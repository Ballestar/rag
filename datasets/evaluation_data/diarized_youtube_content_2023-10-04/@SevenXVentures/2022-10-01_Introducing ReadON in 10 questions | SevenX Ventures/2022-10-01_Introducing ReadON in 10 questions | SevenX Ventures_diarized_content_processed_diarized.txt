00:00:04.490 - 00:00:31.590, Speaker A: Readon is a decentralized content distribution platform that seeks to help users access quality content efficiently and freely and break information silos and explore a real new world. First, Readon will bring a new experience of content consumption. Readon created instant mechanism for users, curators and content creators along with a unique topic bound NFT design.
00:00:31.590 - 00:00:48.310, Speaker A: We believe this design will improve the quality of content that users see. Second, Readon's product format is composable. In the future, Readon will also launch plugins that help creators readily claim their ownership of content produced on Web Two social media platforms like Medium.
00:00:48.310 - 00:01:16.950, Speaker A: These contents can be used by all media D apps and can be used to feed revenue directly into the creator's wallet without the need for creator media connection. Finally, we have a clear understanding of our business model thanks to our team's experience in the past. A successful startup experience from day one, we have been thinking about how to build a new advertising paradigm in Web Three and become the primary source of income for Readon.
00:01:16.950 - 00:01:31.450, Speaker A: So the past six months have been very exciting journey for Readon. We won the award during the Salana Riptide global hackathon in July. We completed the complete 2 million seed rounds led by Seven X.
00:01:31.450 - 00:01:58.046, Speaker A: We released the Read on Socard Mint campaign in August, generating their first Web Three profile SBT for tens of thousands of users and bringing over 30,000 community members to follow us. We will first release a mobile app which is under intense development right now and will soon begin community testing. First of all, we will work with paid content providers on web two like Wall Street Journals, New York Times and Medium.
00:01:58.046 - 00:02:14.966, Speaker A: So NFT owners will enjoy a collection of paid content. Secondly, we aim to be the next big player of online advertising on web Three. Thanks to our reward mechanism, we know whether users have finished some contents and more importantly, it is bounded to a wallet address.
00:02:14.966 - 00:02:26.614, Speaker A: It will be a great idea to AirDrop to these wallets. It's a similar concept with YouTube's True View for videos which shows great success. Also, content is naturally connected to interests.
00:02:26.614 - 00:02:48.958, Speaker A: We could provide Web Three interest targeting which should be a feature that most advertisers would like to have. The core mechanism of Readon is based on the design of topic bond. NFT users will need to own an NFT to start getting rewards and it is the core assets in the token economy to absorb token liquidity.
00:02:48.958 - 00:03:05.170, Speaker A: And every NFT is bonded to a specific topic which gives users the right to govern the corresponding subcommunity and collect incentives from the growth of the community. There are three tiers for the NFT to develop. Each tier will unlock different mechanisms.
00:03:05.170 - 00:03:21.214, Speaker A: The first tier is for basically the enthusiastic readers. They will get more reading rewards if the content they read matches the topic of the NFT. The second tier is designed for community managers who vote and find the best content.
00:03:21.214 - 00:03:32.666, Speaker A: The third tier is designed for community creators. New topics are proposed by these people as a content platform. Growth strategy is always around content.
00:03:32.666 - 00:04:08.140, Speaker A: We will focus NFT owners as shareholders who can collect more rewards through govern to earn so they have the incentive to grow the community. They would invite experienced and famous authors to join the community, create greater content by themselves, or change the ranking or distribution logic. We are also experimenting with important users interests and influences on different topics into Web Three in the form of Soul Bond NFT as a way to provide better recommendations to the users in the future.
00:04:08.140 - 00:04:30.718, Speaker A: In Readon, there are clear governance goals and scenarios. Users with the different tiers of NFTs will be involved in the recommendation process and the generation of new topic communities. First, the Readon has the True Read mechanism, which is used to generate reading tokens through actual reading behavior.
00:04:30.718 - 00:04:47.138, Speaker A: It is used to optimize the quality of the content recommendation network. Secondly, Read On will incentivize curators and bind the revenue of curators'work to the community's success, forming a positive feedback network. Finally, Readon has a clear external value input.
00:04:47.138 - 00:05:16.774, Speaker A: Advertising scenarios and paid content will provide positive revenue stream for the entire economic model. We used to ask ourselves if we were among the best of teams when we're doing the Readon project, and the answer is yes. Our founding team includes engineers and product leaders from Web Two, social giants like TikTok, Pinterest and Chute Hotel, which is the largest Web Two Read to Earn project with about 30 million dau.
00:05:16.774 - 00:05:42.710, Speaker A: The team includes machine learning experts from the Natural Language Processing Lab of Carnegie Mellon University, who are experienced in content understanding and distribution and is also supported by Growth hackers who assisted Step N and Spemit along their journeys. Seven X and US often meet in the common ground about fundamentals and long term topics. It's a really nice experience.
00:05:42.710 - 00:06:00.014, Speaker A: Redon's goal is to participate in the changes that will happen in the blockchain world over the next decade, maybe even two decades, and to bring differentiated value to its users. So we see Seven X holding the same philosophy. They're really helping entrepreneurs accomplishing something different.
00:06:00.014 - 00:06:13.260, Speaker A: In addition to financial support, they're also bringing us a lot of help in financial planning, positioning and token economy design. Choosing Seven X as the lead investor is also choosing a partner who will move forward together on this path with us.
