00:00:16.020 - 00:00:51.790, Speaker A: This is admittedly more people in the room than I thought were going to happen. So I appreciate that in advance. Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, we're just going to keep that sidebar. Okay, so hello everyone, I'm Lawrence, I'm from Index Finance and I will be talking to you today about ways one of the ways that we allow for oh, forgot the mics in my hand. It should be up by my mouth.
00:00:51.790 - 00:01:22.774, Speaker A: One of the ways that we enable portfolios represented by single ERC, 20 tokens that rebalance themselves. So this is just signposting some of the talk in advance. The alternative to reading this is to just watch me give the talk. But here you go, Elisa. You have some stage pointing. So I don't think I really need to talk too much to people that are in the DeFi space about what indices are. In the purely academic sense, they are literally just numbers that track the performance of something going over time, such as weather or what have you.
00:01:22.774 - 00:02:19.710, Speaker A: In the traditional finance sense, we all know what they are, the S P, the Dow Jones, your Nasdaq and so on. Any component that's in an index has a weight and the weights of these things are determined by some fixed strategy. Not necessarily you could have someone just deciding them, but by and large, if it's not some purely quantitative things such as price capitalization or equal weights, you'll have someone that's trying to maximize or minimize for some particular characteristics, such as sharp ratio, crypto, indexes, fundamentally no different. An asset is just a token. And again, the whole point of these things is to diversify. You somewhat minimize your upside, but you also minimize your downside because, well, rising tide lifts all ships, but at the same time you might then be in a position where you can catch one or two that's going up. If something that you invested in tanks, then you're similarly limited exposure.
00:02:19.710 - 00:03:09.150, Speaker A: This is something of a I'm so sorry in advance. It's a bit strange in crypto because we've got all this information in our fingers that you really get to pick one of three parts, right? You either get to say, this is the one that I know deep in my bones, and it's the one that I'm going to mortgage my entire house for, or you can sit there and go, well, someone on Facebook, my uncle told me that dog money's funny. Therefore shiba is where all of my money is going. If you've got a job or a family that you love and time that you want to spend away from your computer, if you're like me, you are going to be sitting there going, well, there's too much choice. I know what the big names are, but I don't perhaps know up and comers. I don't follow all of the tech. I'm going to show some of my kind of TradFi experience and go, it's generally a better idea to be sitting in an index.
00:03:09.150 - 00:03:46.246, Speaker A: So, yeah, liquidity pools as they stand in AMMS are indices. A uniswap liquidity pool is an index of sorts, perhaps not as helpful because of a fixed allocation, but the price that you track of that LP is itself an index of some form. An LP token is a share in that index. It's a claim on the assets within it balancer. Pools are slightly closer to the ideal. You've got their finalized pools where things don't change, but their smart pools. You can adjust those weights as and when, if you desire.
00:03:46.246 - 00:04:06.974, Speaker A: So you can have several assets in a single pool as well. It's not just a 50 50 split. So I'm mentioning here for a reason. These ones uni RV, curve compound and Maker. Because what we've done at Indexed is we've taken balance of small pools and we've forked in. We've made some adjustments to enable assets to be phased in and out more easily. We don't have to rely on external liquidity.
00:04:06.974 - 00:04:48.122, Speaker A: I've just looked straight into the camera, that was a bit weird. Hi, YouTube. Someone's sitting there going, did you feel that? I mentioned these tokens in particular because they are the members of what is currently our largest index by TVL, the D Five Five. Here is a screenshot of its performance. Well, just generally how you would look at it from our website. It's a bit small for those sitting at the back or those that have rubbish eyesight like me, but as you can say so it's uni is sitting there at what is it? Is it 40%? Man, I should have taken a higher resolution image of this. It's 42% uni, 10% Ave no, 18.
00:04:48.122 - 00:05:25.930, Speaker A: My God, I am. So curve, compound, whatever, you can see interactions happening with it as an ERC 20 token, we're tracking the performance for it. You can get it on polygon with Quickswap uniswap, you can view its details on ETH scan, et cetera. I admittedly, and apparently preemptively took a picture of this at 9.2 mil TVL before things started slipping a bit, but I'll take that. So if you're not talking about kind of 50 50 presentations of things like uniswap pools, if you want to have an index that represents some kind of real strategy, you've got two things that you need to decide. You decide what the weights are, that much is obvious.
00:05:25.930 - 00:06:24.234, Speaker A: And then you decide how often you want it to rebalance. So in TradFi things, they do this quarterly or semiannually and you have someone that's pulling the trigger on those things. This is now a personal take of mine and one that I represent within index that having someone or someones make those choices for you isn't ideal. Not all people agree with that, but that's the one that we take also within crypto, given that I've just talked about how people that can all into one particular take and turn your 2030 50 X, I'm a believer that passive management is better than making decisions in the fires of a volatile market. When Warren Buffett finally does ape in, and you do see this on YouTube, hi, please send me money. It's not going to work, is it? But I'm going to try anyway. So, yeah, even if you do have people that are making these decisions for you, and if they're acting with the best will in the world, there's no malicious intent.
00:06:24.234 - 00:07:14.240, Speaker A: They're doing their job. If they have to do something for you, make decisions about quantitative facets. If they have to execute trades for you, you're going to have to pay them because no one works for free. And this is where the management or streaming fee meme comes from, and that eats into your profit, which if you're sitting in crypto, you probably want to minimize. I realize that every single meme template I use here, I misuse, and that is on purpose. So the way that we get around this having to have a human make the decisions is that we defer it to a scoring strategy, which is a smart contract that sits bound to an index pool, which decides asset weights using on chain data. So there is someone that is pressing a button in order to say, actually do the work for us, but they're not deciding the figures themselves.
00:07:14.240 - 00:07:55.306, Speaker A: So all of the stuff that we use at all of the pools that we have at indexed use a square root of market valuations either being fully diluted or circulating market cap, but we use TWAP Oracles for that on Univ Two. Now, we can talk about TWAP stuff being a benefit of accuracy versus security, but it is what it is. As a choice, we take these FTVs that we calculate, we square root them, we sum the total, and then we give weights to assets within the index based on their proportion of that sum total. Now, here's a couple of figures for you. Here's just an example that I took a couple of days ago about the things that are within the D five five index. I just grabbed whatever Coin Gecko was telling me as the numbers. I really wish there was a laser pointer on this.
00:07:55.306 - 00:08:38.230, Speaker A: Is that, holy shit, there apologies. So I just grabbed these prices. These are the max suppliers that are currently sitting on chain, calculate their FTVs, square root them, and then go, okay, well, here's the sum total of them. This is what the proportion is of 34%. Now, this is actually well timed in terms of recent news because Grayscale has recently come out with its DFI fund, right? And crypto Twitter conversations have started saying this is great, but Uni is overvalued at 50%, and a couple of other conversations about why link wasn't included, et cetera. But this is something that we've borne in mind as well. We use square roots of stuff to kind of crush the differences between major outliers in terms of price and everything else.
00:08:38.230 - 00:09:32.780, Speaker A: Similarly, we have an Oracle index. If we just used FTV alone, link would be sitting at something like 80% of it. It's just a choice, too many numbers somewhere else. So the question becomes, if we don't have humans making the decisions about what the weightings need to be, then the question becomes, okay, well, who can trigger a reweighting? Who can actually we do still need to have someone go, okay, this needs to happen now, even if they're not making the decision themselves. So anyone, you or me, typically me lately, can actually update the Twat Oracles for the assets that are within an asset pool. You can also go, okay, now we've updated our Twat Oracles, we can submit a request for the reweighting to happen and that will be accepted if seven days have passed since the last one. So weekly again, there is a gas cost to this, a bit of link, a bit of ETH that's borne by the index team currently.
00:09:32.780 - 00:10:19.866, Speaker A: And yeah, the neat thing is something that we're working on currently is that these aren't restricted to EOAS, so we can have smart contracts do them. We're working on outsourcing this stuff to keepers, be it maybe through Keeper network or something more recent that's coming out like gelato so that we can just ask someone to go. If you do this, we will refund you the gas that you've spent and give you a little bit more as a thank you. So that's an incentivization for people even if they're not necessarily involved in indexed to just do the work for us. Okay, this is now where we get to talk about favorite things. Who has in their portfolio more than ten tokens. Apparently I'm me at my six even beforehand is I have limited imagination, but okay, so that's a fair few of you.
00:10:19.866 - 00:11:25.760, Speaker A: I counted at least eight. Within index pools, we allow for maximum of ten assets that have weights bound to them at any one time. Now this is because these things are AMMS themselves. Each of the pairs can be swapped between, so you've got an end choose two permutation of how many things you can swap between, and if you have too many of those, you introduce il leaks. Now it is the case that no matter what market sector you're trying to track or what thing you're trying to minimize or maximize for performance, there are going to be more options that you can have as choices than are sitting there in your index. Again, I could probably, without a gun to my head, list about 50 things that I'd at least be interested in or could name and talk about a little bit. But I wouldn't necessarily want exposure to all of them because within crypto, at least at its current stage of evolution, with a rising tide raising or sinking all ships, with the exception of news that is unique to these things, five or ten tokens is enough.
00:11:25.760 - 00:12:25.410, Speaker A: But again, there are so many. So the question becomes, well, which ones are the best representatives of that market sector? So he says, turning around for no reason, we do allow pools to have lists of assets that are candidate lists, so they're not in an index at any point, but they're sitting there on the sidelines and they're being monitored. So they're eligible to join the pool of assets, provided that the score given by that automated scoring strategy ranks them as sufficiently high. So every month after every three ways, or not necessarily every month, depending on if people actually do the reways on time, we do a reindex. So that involves querying the TWAP for everything, not just the things that are currently in the index, scoring them and then ranking them. And if there's something that has overperformed relative to something that's in the index, that gets await, what happens to thing that's in the index gets booted out, set to zero. So about two and a half weeks ago, this happened for one of this, just as an example.
00:12:25.410 - 00:12:54.714, Speaker A: So we have an Oracle index that tracks the Oracle market sector, utterly dominated by Link. This is with square roots. So in the middle of last month, it was Link, uma, or I, Chain, Band and deer. And when I did a reindexing at the end of the month, API three had exceeded deer in MCAP, and so got phased in. So you see, that went from being 6.8 to zero. API three phased in from zero to 7.3.
00:12:54.714 - 00:13:50.698, Speaker A: Again, these were weights that were determined by onchain strat. And as of now, and I'll talk about this shortly, this is what the weights were about a week ago. Now, we'll talk about why that's been quite slow, but it is happening. Tellor and Dos down here, they're present as candidate assets, but their scores just have not put them in that top five. So I'm not going to get into any mathsy stuff here, but if you change the weights of an AMM pool immediately and you don't do anything else about them, you change the spot price. So this is a consequence of balance's invariant V, which is the same kind of invariant formula they follow with uniswap's Xyk. If you have claims on the assets in that pool, you are able to add and remove liquidity to the degree of the weights that you're changing, that's fine, you can make those shifts without changing the price.
00:13:50.698 - 00:14:38.918, Speaker A: But as I've just alluded to, because we allow anyone to make those reways, we can't assume that people actually have the claim in the form of the LP tokens for that index to make those removals or additions. So, well, how do we do it then? What we're doing when we do a Reway or a reindex is we go, here's what the target weight should be. Now, how does it actually manifest? So he says, very dramatically. As he does this. So again, these things are AMMS. And so that means swaps happen within them. And so we've got a post swap hook that checks after every swap and goes, okay, if a trade happened in the pool and the weight of a member needs to be increased, it does a very small bump of that weight.
00:14:38.918 - 00:15:11.602, Speaker A: Similarly, the other way around, if something's being swapped out and the weight needs to go the other way, then it drops it by a small it's 1% of whatever its current weight is. And this fires every 30 minutes. It used to be an hour. We've sped it up a little bit recently. But this is so that you can't just constantly bang a pool with small trades and introduce il. And in order to make sure that, again, because these are AMMS, in order for people to actually see them and interact with them, they're in the one inch router, all of the ones that we provide. So even if we all fell down dead, these things would still have volume.
00:15:11.602 - 00:15:45.922, Speaker A: And therefore, if the weights were being adjusted still, then these bumps would happen with the post swap hook. Here's an example. Again, I'm just relying on my D five five here. Not going to get into too much of the detail here, but if I swapped Maker in for uni in the D five five pool and uni's weight needs to go down and Maker's pool needs to weight needs to go up. This loses ten 1% of its current weight goes to 991 two five to one two 6.25. And you'll see that the weight has dropped for uni from 40 to this and everything else has been dragged up. This is just a proportional, a proportional game.
00:15:45.922 - 00:16:36.306, Speaker A: What this does do is it does introduce a small change in the weight. Sorry, in the weight, I'm talking about weights. It introduces a small change in the price of it. The net asset value of these tokens has changed, but it's very, very gradual and that incentivizes arbitrage to even things out against a Dex or anywhere else where it's listed. So it does happen and it's powered by external people sorting that out for us. The question then becomes with all of this stuff that's there, I have mentioned that there are things that people do need to do, at least while we haven't got stuff that's sitting on some kind of automated DevOps for doing rewords and reindexes. How do I see what tokens are in a candidate list? How do I find out what a target weight is for an asset? Where do I go to update an oracle? And on and on and on.
00:16:36.306 - 00:17:09.498, Speaker A: I've missed two of them here. What do I do to trigger a Reway or a reindex? And so we handled that with controller contracts and as soon as I put the word administrator here and sent the slides, I was like, that is a poor choice. Of words. It's not an admin contract, it's just a centralized it's a single point of interaction for which several index pools can be interacted with at the same time. So this is owned by a Dao. We do have an index finance Dao. It's run with the NDX token, and that has the power to add or remove tokens from its pools with.
00:17:09.498 - 00:17:31.140, Speaker A: So NDX is a fork of uni. It uses the Governor Alpha module for dealing with governance. It handles it that way. Anyone an arbitrary account. That's where these controller contracts is, where people can perform updates or rewys or re indexes. They just need to know what that thing is and admittedly know what things to call. But they can do it all from that one place.
00:17:31.140 - 00:18:00.934, Speaker A: The stuff that we use to handle these things administratively, they are upgradable proxy contracts. So again, should the Dow elect to, they can do these things as well. They can vote for these things to be implemented, provided that someone's either done the change and puts it forward for a vote. So that is in the end as it is. I realize I hadn't actually mentioned the site at this point, but it is indexed finance. We do have six pools running at the site right now. Most of these are fairly self explanatory.
00:18:00.934 - 00:18:19.134, Speaker A: D five five, your higher risk, higher reward pool of stuff. Oracles. NFTP, a wider exposure one. And this has got some pegged amount of bitcoin and ETH in it. And then is a fund of funds of D five five, Dgen and CC ten. If you want to follow what we're doing on Twitter. Ndxfi, ndxfi.
00:18:19.134 - 00:18:58.640, Speaker A: There's our medium and there's our subreddit. Thank you very much for your time, everyone. Hit me with the questions, please. Yes, hello, I can hear you from here, but the mic all right, fine. Okay, I have a question. So you talk about indexed as a source of income and passive income mostly, but you know that in DeFi we can do more than holding assets. So is there something extra you want to talk about? Okay, yeah, all right, fine.
00:18:58.640 - 00:19:43.710, Speaker A: When I was preparing these slides, I wasn't sure how much time I was going to have, so I did this Nicky thing of which I learned from my time of academia, which was slam all the stuff I want to talk to in the back if I got a chance at the end. So, thank you, because this is great. I now get to slide this into the question slot. I promise you this wasn't planned. I'm just very grateful for this. So if you know assets that sit within AMM pools are not productive. Now, funny timing this, because Joseph DeLong has literally 30 minutes ago just spoken about upgrades to sushi he became from downstairs.
00:19:43.710 - 00:20:33.646, Speaker A: Nonetheless, if stuff is sitting in a balancer pool, it's just sitting there to be liquidity, right? It's not being used productively. And most of those tokens. For example, the ones in D Five Five are able to be used in lending protocols. So compound or RV or what have you. Now if you were to use those instead, then you get an interest bearing index. I'm going to leave to the side the question about what kind of a centralized exchange would think about if you had a LP of wrapped interest bearing tokens instead. I'm just going to assume that's a non issue, but the way that things currently stand is that these wrapped tokens will sit on a single protocol to be loaned out.
00:20:33.646 - 00:21:34.114, Speaker A: So you've got your Ave wrapped die or your compound interest earning die or what have you, and they can be moved around if you want. You can go, okay, well, I'm going to withdraw from here and deposit here instead. It would be nice though, if that work was not something that we needed to worry about if in an index we said, well, we don't want to go, okay, I'm going to move all of the stuff that's in D Five Five from compound to Aave and then phasing stuff in because that could be a slow process. So it would be nice if you could have one wrapped token. You can say, I'm leading up to something here, one wrapped token that said, okay, here is a representation of a token and then the underlying assets are being loaned across several things at once, compound, Ave, fulcrum, cream, et cetera. We weren't really happy with what existed around there, so we went, fine, we'll do it ourselves. And so, okay, I'm going to set this next slide with bearing in mind that the name has not been finalized yet.
00:21:34.114 - 00:22:36.290, Speaker A: But this is something we've been working on, is Nerne. So it's a permissionless yield aggregator that we have whitelisted protocols, common interface for tokens, and we can segment funds in them across any of those whitelisted protocols at once. So each vault has an array of weightings that you can set to arbitrary ones. So for example, a divalt of 50% compound, 30% RV, 20% cream, any EOA, so not a smart contract, but an EOA can suggest a new weighting, which is then verified on chain using those protocols APY functions and will execute a swap of funds within the vault if you get a higher rate of return. So it's a minimization problem. I'm not going to get into zero one napsack stuff, but actually determining this stuff off chain to propose is fairly simple computationally. And the idea is that once this is out, we were hoping to have it out now for this, and this would be our big reveal, but we're still getting some stuff, right, that we would use this stuff as proxy, tokens, proxy assets.
00:22:36.290 - 00:23:20.500, Speaker A: So the weighting of uni would be represented by N uni indexed uni known is a brilliant and terrible joke of N earn indexed earn nern skyrim simps in this supports six protocols to start with, we launch it on any asset that has at least that supports at least one. So it's 100 volts. It's going to kill us to deploy APIs for things currently range between about 46 to 212 bips. There is a white paper there. It's not out of draft yet, but you can if you choose to. And I do not actually have any bonus slides after this. Thank you.
00:23:22.390 - 00:23:31.874, Speaker B: I have a question. Yeah, I'm over here. How do you make sure that it maintains the peg? Can you redeem the index for the underlying tokens?
00:23:31.922 - 00:24:03.662, Speaker A: Yes, at any time. So because these are LP tokens on our interface, we've got I'm hoping that I can see burn options from here just to illustrate that it is a thing that you can do. Please. Sorry, bear with me. Yes. So we have burn up here. So if you do have those tokens, you can choose to either redeem them for whatever their current weight is and their full amount.
00:24:03.662 - 00:24:49.360, Speaker A: So you go for this. I want all of the if I've got 100 D Five five, I want to get six of the assets out there's, six in here, because one of them is phasing in it's not the D Five six. But yeah, or you could choose to redeem them for one of the assets and that's also fine, provided that you're not trying to swap out one third or more of whatever is in there. And that's just a security thing that we've got in place. But yes. So this is kind of how the index price changes introduced by the post swap hook is able to be arbitraged up or down if a change happens that knocks the NAV out from whatever it is on a deck, you can either mint and sell or buy and burn to bring things down.
00:24:52.130 - 00:24:58.994, Speaker C: What assets will you put in the new oh, God. In the new index. So you said you've got a list of 100. What ones are you going to put.
00:24:59.032 - 00:25:39.150, Speaker A: In the new one? I think to start with, we would just say the contents of the D Five five, we would just replace with the interest bearing equivalent assets. I don't have a good answer for this as to whether it becomes whether we just say if you're holding D Five five, just wait and it will automatically migrate, there's nothing to be done. Or we go and we go, okay, well, we'll launch another one that's an equivalent mirror, but that does split the pot a little bit. It's a good question. One that I don't have a yes or no answer to yet. Oh, thanks. Surprise.
00:25:39.970 - 00:26:00.950, Speaker C: Are you just buying the wrap tokens on uni sushi or are you creating routes and storing them and then going directly to Compan Avi? So, like, for example, some context. If I come with Dai West whatever, do you then go and wrap them for me or do I then come with a wrapped already to deposit into the indexed.
00:26:01.610 - 00:26:21.914, Speaker A: I am not necessarily the one to talk about the implementation of this. I believe that we would have some router logic that would allow you to just deposit the naked asset and it would sort it out for you. But Dylan, who's not here. Hi, Dylan. I know you're watching would be the one to answer about that. Once this stuff is kind know, out of its finally nascent stage.
00:26:22.042 - 00:26:23.102, Speaker C: I've got one more question.
00:26:23.156 - 00:26:23.534, Speaker A: Go on.
00:26:23.572 - 00:26:24.094, Speaker C: If I can.
00:26:24.132 - 00:26:25.630, Speaker A: Fine. They all come in threes.
00:26:26.770 - 00:26:50.150, Speaker C: If you are doing the routine, how are you optimizing for gas? If you're, let's say, coming with ten wealth? Well, actually, let's say 0.1 wet and whatever die, your gas costs might be extremely high for depositing. So how are you optimizing for low amounts of deposits in the native token to then be wrapped into the wrapped.
00:26:50.570 - 00:26:56.358, Speaker A: Not something that I've thought about personally. Okay. It is what it is. Yeah, I don't have an answer for you for that.
00:26:56.444 - 00:26:57.080, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:26:57.610 - 00:27:09.398, Speaker B: I have a question. How does indexed, I guess you the company monetize this or do you guys make it? Do you guys have like a token or something? Governance token.
00:27:09.494 - 00:27:54.460, Speaker A: So there is a governance token for it. It's NDX the way that this is working as it stands is that the protocol generates revenue from burning the tokens, which actually leads in quite nicely to your first question about can you burn? Yes. If you do choose to burn, we take half a percent of that and route it to a treasury for the Dao. And we are currently setting up a process by which people can stake those governance tokens in order for a claim on protocol revenue. So between that and when erstwhilely named Nern is released, performance fees of it's, a small fraction of the yield generated from those vaults will also be routed towards members of the Dow. Cool.
00:27:55.950 - 00:27:57.660, Speaker C: Underlying or is the.
00:28:02.130 - 00:28:23.634, Speaker A: It depends on whether you're doing the fee claim as someone who's just withdrawing or whether it's happening from a protocol burn. It can be one at one or the other, but they're equivalent anyway. I have no idea what time it is because I'm not wearing a watch, so I don't know if I've gone over time.
00:28:23.672 - 00:28:26.120, Speaker D: Do I talk into it? Hi.
00:28:27.290 - 00:28:27.990, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:28.140 - 00:28:29.718, Speaker C: Only one question.
00:28:29.804 - 00:28:34.150, Speaker A: Okay. All right. I thought you had one. I was like, well, that's correct. You're waiting.
00:28:37.210 - 00:28:51.086, Speaker D: I guess you answer my question about the burn fee. It would be around, what, like 0.5%. So I guess that would mean that it would offset some of the margins of Arbitragers. What would happen to the traders if.
00:28:51.108 - 00:29:13.986, Speaker A: You'Re just buying or selling these tokens spot you pay no fees? That was an intentional choice. Quite anti the idea of management or streaming, the idea of having to pay to exit or enter. But because we rely on Arbitras to deal with this, rounding off the edges that are. Introduced by reways. They're arbitraging. We'll take some of a fraction of.
00:29:14.008 - 00:29:17.730, Speaker D: That from it and then the 0.5% goes into the pool.
00:29:17.810 - 00:29:37.190, Speaker A: It goes in well. So there is a swap fee within the pools themselves to minimize il that is given, as is the way of AMM pools, to holders of that token. But when you burn, a portion of that token is just sent to a Dow account, a time locks account, run by Governor Alpha.
00:29:37.270 - 00:29:37.994, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:29:38.112 - 00:29:58.720, Speaker A: No problem. That was the one other question. So thank you very much for your time, everyone that you had nothing, just like I want to bring you. It seemed like it was so.
