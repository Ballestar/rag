00:00:06.730 - 00:00:54.430, Speaker A: Hello everybody, thanks for being here. My name is Vidal. I'm here to share about the experience we gathered developing Verso, that is a non custodial multi chain wallet specialized in EVM blockchains. So I'm working in this space since full time, since 20, 14, 15. So really I enjoy the conference, especially after two years of COVID and I see a lot of new faces, a lot of young people. So we're really glad to be here. So I worked mainly at the beginning in Bitcoin technologies.
00:00:54.430 - 00:01:38.166, Speaker A: Then I saw the birth of Ethereum, the dao. So I experienced all this era and I worked a lot with ICO in Tokens Creations and more recently I'm working with Verso. Verso is a non custodial wallet. So the real value we try to protect is the freedom of users. So really that's the biggest value. We really want to push forward because we believe that the point of crypto is not C DeFi, it's not centralized finance. It's really about protecting the freedom of users.
00:01:38.166 - 00:02:45.774, Speaker A: So we really want to push forward and to improve all topics related to self ownership, self custody, still without compromising with ease of use. Because the goal and our mission is to onboard more users, I will not dare to say next billion of user, but more users to crypto and to its benefits. So if you speak to real people, not conference, but really people outside in the street, that doesn't get the crypto. People try to get into a wallet first. I would just give some examples. For instance, the seed phrase in English. For us it's easy because we all speak at least our language, our mother language, plus English.
00:02:45.774 - 00:03:33.250, Speaker A: But word in English is a nonsense because for a current guy it's not easy to write Latin symbols. So it's a pain point, a lot of other pain points when they try to make a swap up, the approval people don't understand and don't get it what is approved. Okay, thanks. Yeah. Another kind of area of problem is the gas. First, people don't get what is gas. And even if they have a feeling of what may be the gas, they don't know how much gas they need and they don't know what gas to buy and where to get this fuel.
00:03:33.250 - 00:04:03.926, Speaker A: Some other area also of concern is what I would call the spam tokens. Especially for instance like not in Ethereum, because the gas is too high. But in polygon. If you open the polygon wallet, you will be overwhelmed. You will have very often more tokens that you receive that you don't know what is it. I'll give an example. You receive a token called zerogift IO.
00:04:03.926 - 00:05:03.558, Speaker A: So you want to go to zerogift IO, you sign a transaction and then you don't receive the gift that is promised, but somebody's emptying your wallet. So it's another kind of experience that is really bad. So I will not be able to focus on everything, but for this conference I've chosen three topics that we covered. I'll try to explain how we are solving it and to give, because it's a technical audience to give how we implemented the solution. So the first one is about the sit phrase seed phrase. So just a reminder, seed phrase even in ethereum comes from a bitcoin standard that is called the BIP 39. So normally a private key is 128 bits that are randomly generated with a normal full entropy.
00:05:03.558 - 00:06:13.460, Speaker A: And the Bib 39 is just a way to display this 128 bytes in a human readable way. So I assume most of people, even if they don't know the standard they experience what is a twelve word seed? So actually it's eleven words and the last word is for checksum. So what is usually unknown because most of the people don't know is there is a substandard in BIP 39 that is called the localized word list. So here you see in the GitHub of the BIP that we have a dictionary of ten, we have ten dictionary in ten languages. So it's a Korean, Spanish, French, et cetera. So we give the equivalent of each word in other languages. So if we see here on the right of the screen so a dictionary is composed of 2048 words.
00:06:13.460 - 00:08:12.180, Speaker A: Normally the key is divided in eleven bits and those eleven bits are encoded by one of the words to one of the 2048 words. So when you generate this, we take index number five, we simply take so translation of the word because for you to take a newer translation you will lose the entropy and some somebody will okay, so here what I explaining. So if you want to visualize a key so we just translate the word and when you want to import, what we do is simply if someone is importing twelve words in French, we detect that he's using the French dictionary. We find the English equivalent and all the library that you are, you create the private key from the mnemonic so you can do it from the English words. So how does it look like in our wallet here at the left you can see a twelve words. Yes, you can take a photo because it's a private key. So normally there's some money inside this wallet and whoever is fastest will get the money.
00:08:12.180 - 00:09:31.174, Speaker A: So those twelve words in English and you see how people can visualize their twelve words in other languages. So unfortunately this standard is not implemented well. I think that in my knowledge we're the only wallet that implements this substandard. So if you import your words in English, in French for instance, you can only use import it in our wallet, but we offer of course the option to import them in English in case you want to import your seed in under wallet. So that's very interesting and that's very for users issue, but for instance, we have a support email if you are a spanish or a Korean guy. The localized seed phrase is really something that change the experience. Okay, another area I want to discuss because we have an in app swap in our wallet, is the UX for swap.
00:09:31.174 - 00:10:27.094, Speaker A: So I mentioned it already in the introduction. Yeah, people don't really understand what is unlock, what is approved. That's a bad experience for normal people because they are here to swap and they don't know what is to unlock. The other issue is really gas, because they don't understand what is gas. And we solve it because we introduced the sponsoring on the server side and one click approval and swap. So how do we implement it? Here is the documentation, the developer documentation of paraswap, and it gives you all the parameters. When you try to build a transaction of swap and optimizing the routes, there is a standard that maybe not everybody's aware is what we call the permit.
00:10:27.094 - 00:11:26.218, Speaker A: So permit, in most tokens, you have a permit function. So you pre sign an authorization and then it allows you to make the approval without consuming gas. So in our wallet, when you just click on swap and then it does the permit plus the swap transaction, the server side relayer, is for people not having gas. So we realized that a lot of people, when they top up in their wallet, they top up USDC, they top up WBTC, so they don't have gas when it comes to the swap. So what we do, you see on the left, if they submit their transaction, they don't have gas, it will be rejected. So what we are doing is instead of submitting the transaction directly to a node, to a blockchain node, we submit it to our relayer. The relayer checks, makes a lot of checks.
00:11:26.218 - 00:12:04.310, Speaker A: Then number two, he sends gas to the wallet. So he's submitting a transaction, let's say to polygon network. In step three, he checks that the gas has been received and then now he can relay the transaction. Because now that he submits the transaction of the user, that is a swap. Since now that the wallet owns some gas, the transaction will be okay. That's very important. Why we don't use meta transaction, because meta transaction is meant for recent tokens.
00:12:04.310 - 00:12:41.910, Speaker A: Most of the tokens that people are using, like even WBTC USDC contract, they don't implement all the metatransactions feature. Okay, last topic, I know that there are a few minutes left. It's about token management. Another really pain point that user have is that they need to I took screenshot for other popular wallets. You need to activate the token in order to be displayed. If you buy USDC, you need to go to the settings and then activate USDC. Or even if you're a developer on your MetaMask, you have to configure the USDC on polygon.
00:12:41.910 - 00:13:06.042, Speaker A: You have to find the smart contract address and require for the display. That's really a bad experience for people. For the spam tokens here, I took a wallet and I show you. That's funny. You have more tokens, spam tokens than real tokens that the user bouts. So simply what we introduce you see the screenshot of the same wallet. It's cleaned.
00:13:06.042 - 00:13:39.142, Speaker A: What we implemented is the auto discovery. Why most wallets don't auto discovery token. It's because if you check the API of the RPC specifications, it doesn't give you the list of the token of a wallet. So you must know that you can require the balance of a specific token. It will reply or not, but you cannot discover all the tokens. So that's why most of the tokens are deployment it. So there are plenty of solutions.
00:13:39.142 - 00:14:30.438, Speaker A: So I don't have time to detail why this one, but we use Covalent API that offers this option to discover all the tokens of a specific wallet. By the way, it also gives you all the NFT associated to this token. So we implemented using this API, we implemented our own database of spam tokens. So maybe we keep this for the questions. So I'm running out of time. The last words of course is yes, we are working on a lot of problems, I've just chosen some of them. But to open the conversation, there's a lot of problem to be solved around the seed phrase backup around the DeFi balance.
00:14:30.438 - 00:15:03.778, Speaker A: Let's say that if you deposit your USDC in a yield protocol like urine or bifi finance, it's not in your wallet. So your wallet will display zero because it's outside. So we need to work about the DeFi balance. But there's plenty still of lot of challenges to be solved and we are working on it. And final word, I invite you to download Verso. Verso is on App Store and Google Play. So you can just give it a try.
00:15:03.778 - 00:15:40.460, Speaker A: Import your existing wallet and have a new experience of your same wallet because yes, just import an existing wallet so that it's easier. So you can visualize most of new users don't know, but you can have the same wallet in different software. You don't have to create a wallet for each app you install. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you for being here in this hot in this very hot temperature room. And I'm open to any questions.
00:15:41.150 - 00:15:41.900, Speaker B: Thank.
00:15:50.390 - 00:16:59.414, Speaker A: Yeah, I just had a question about the spam filtering. When you filter tokens, how do you sort of decide what's what in terms of spam and who maintains that list? Yeah, okay. Currently it's semi automated. Well, we have a server side database that crawls all the new tokens that are referenced in CoinGecko. In CoinMarketCap, maybe you don't know, but in CoinGecko you have all the smart contract addresses of all the so the first filter is that the smart contract of a token is not either in CoinGecko, either in CoinMarketCap. We have an interface where as an administrator we see the token that we see in the wallet of our users and we can check them and check it manually. And usually when it's not in CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, it's a spam token.
00:16:59.414 - 00:17:25.140, Speaker A: We check also who are the creator address of the token, the date of creation of the token, and usually when it's recent, when it's less than two weeks and it's not in CoinGecko, it's automatically filtered. So we filter this to the user so that they are not bothered with pam tokens. Right. Okay.
00:17:30.990 - 00:17:42.510, Speaker B: Can you quickly explain how the relayer works for the users to relay? I mean, how it's relaying users transaction, which you just showed in the slide?
00:17:43.010 - 00:18:33.306, Speaker A: Yes. The principle is very simple is that we're acting as a proxy node for the blockchain network. We just analyze the transactions because we don't want to sponsor the transaction of everybody. So after some analysis, we just send gas to the wallet and when the gas is received, we just relay this transaction. So instead of the wallet directly submitted to the network, it's our server that submitted to the node after giving the gas and being sure that the gas has arrived, because we optimize the gas. So sometimes it can take five blocks. Well, we don't do it in one block, so we just be shook that the gas is received and then we submit the transaction.
00:18:33.306 - 00:18:50.942, Speaker A: So there's a lot of complexity because we need to compute the gas correctly and to anticipate what is the gas cost in ten to 30 blocks. So there's a lot of complexity, but the principle is simple. We're just giving you gas and it works for all the tokens.
00:18:51.006 - 00:18:58.420, Speaker B: You are deducting that gas from users incoming amount. Something like that, yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
00:18:59.510 - 00:19:04.040, Speaker A: Thank you. There is not more time for questions. Thank you. Thank you.
