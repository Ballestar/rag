00:00:14.330 - 00:00:32.990, Speaker A: Hi everyone. So my name is Shiti, and the title of the presentation is finding utility for NFTs. Who am I? Serve as chief operating officer at FSL, which is find Satoshi Labs.
00:00:32.990 - 00:00:52.678, Speaker A: So there's a lot of finding here. Let's hope I can find some utility in the next 15 minutes. So FSL is the parent product studio, the creators of Step in, but also of our door, which is our Dex of More, which is our NFT launch pad and marketplace.
00:00:52.678 - 00:01:08.080, Speaker A: And we've recently announced a web three social game called gas hero. And more on this and a lot more in the next few minutes. But first, let's begin with where we are in web two.
00:01:08.080 - 00:01:35.298, Speaker A: So there is a famous app infrastructure cycle that Danny and Nick Grossman wrote in their beautiful post in USV about five years ago. They start talking about the fact that there is a beautiful circuitous relationship between app and infrastructure. And every cycle of app inspires the next infrastructure cycle.
00:01:35.298 - 00:01:55.550, Speaker A: It happens across industry. They have mapped very beautifully how it happened in web two. So starting from the messaging and email clients back in 1970s, which then led to ethernet, which then led to email clients, which then led to gmail and so on and so forth, it happened across infrastructure cases as well.
00:01:55.550 - 00:02:32.460, Speaker A: For example, planes are the applications that led to infrastructure of airports. Electric bulb is the application that then led to infrastructure of electric grid. However, with crypto, we are at a point where there are just too many l ones, l two s browser extensions, MultiChain bridges, wallets roll ups, DKE VMs, where are the users? Where are the apps onboarding the users onto web three.
00:02:32.460 - 00:03:17.430, Speaker A: And my punt is on the builders building in this bear who are onboarding users who are building the apps, such as people from FSL shameless plug, but sorry, but not sorry. And this is where NFTs come in the picture because NFTs not only enable building of these apps, but more importantly in adoption of these apps. Justin Kan, who is the founder of Twitcher, once famously said that first time founders are obsessed with product and second time founders are obsessed with distribution.
00:03:17.430 - 00:03:34.758, Speaker A: There's a lot of truth in that. From our experience in building step in to a peak user base of 1 million daily active users. Yes, you heard that right, 1 million daily active users in crypto.
00:03:34.758 - 00:03:55.730, Speaker A: We were breaking salana chain. Sorry, but not sorry. We were flipping ethereum and bitcoin on exchanges, is that there are three things that worked really well for us and we kept repeating that iteratively in the buckets of content, engagement and virality.
00:03:55.730 - 00:04:07.554, Speaker A: So content is broadly at the intersection of education and entertainment, largely led by the horse's mouth. So when I say that, I mean Founders. Weekends, saturdays.
00:04:07.554 - 00:04:12.678, Speaker A: Sundays. Midnight. Our founders were always there answering community questions.
00:04:12.678 - 00:04:33.326, Speaker A: Whether the app was crashing, whether the app was peaking. They were always there to answer users questions. We have probably one of the largest setups of customer care services in Web Three, let alone in Web Two, followed by engagement, which is Twitter Spaces, discord, AMAs, IRL events, basic things, but done right.
00:04:33.326 - 00:04:52.710, Speaker A: At one point we had events going from all parts of the world. So the community on their own accord, getting together and talking about step in onboarding users, people creating the first NFT wallets, people purchasing their first NFTs. And this was happening across La.
00:04:52.710 - 00:05:02.074, Speaker A: Miami, Taipei, Taiwan, Philippines, Japan, melbourne, UK. London, Australia. Everywhere across the world.
00:05:02.074 - 00:05:14.810, Speaker A: And I'm missing cities. And such is the power of engagement, not to mention virality, which includes drops, influencers memes. And this all is made possible by NFTs.
00:05:14.810 - 00:05:28.530, Speaker A: However, you all must have seen the Ananson charts which show NFT sales crashing. And yes, they are. The monthly sales are down badly, 50% on both ETH and Sole chains.
00:05:28.530 - 00:05:46.840, Speaker A: And I think this quarter we are down 35% versus Q One. However, there's one very interesting thing. So while monthly sales volumes are down on the exchanges and chains, the interaction between these wallets and NFDS have actually gone up.
00:05:46.840 - 00:06:08.400, Speaker A: So just possibly, and probably it's not the NFTs that are dead, but speculative trading is. So once again, the focus is on utility versus speculation. So where is this utility? Is it in the room with us right now? Let's see.
00:06:08.400 - 00:06:29.954, Speaker A: Our biggest fund is that gaming will probably be one of the strongest on ramps to Web Three. We've seen what happened with Step in. There are things that worked really well for us in terms of investments, which of course leverages the biggest part of Web Three in terms of strategy, that it's not just gambling and luck.
00:06:29.954 - 00:06:50.330, Speaker A: People actually use their intelligence because gambling just uses luck, whereas Strategizing uses intelligence and keep drawing people in again and again. And the third thing is giving people experience, what people would normally do, which is walk, jog or run in real life. We gave them an excuse to do that on chain and get rewards.
00:06:50.330 - 00:07:10.222, Speaker A: The things that we've learned from Step In is, again, how to improve on this economic cycle, how to improve on asset surplus, and how to create a social game in Web Three. And this is what we're going to do with Gas Hero. You can obviously learn more on the Twitter gas Hero official.
00:07:10.222 - 00:07:32.978, Speaker A: We just concluded a fabulous Twitter spaces, educating about this space and what Web Three social game would look like. And there is a contest that is going which is sharing a prize pool of 2 million GMTs. GMTs are governance token where we are involving users to invite designs for what we call as Gas Hero.
00:07:32.978 - 00:07:57.780, Speaker A: It's set in post apocalyptic world, I shan't say too much about it. And we'll move on to the second biggest use case after gaming in Web Three, and that's undoubtedly art and entertainment. As a startup founder, one of the first questions people often ask is what problems are you solving? And the answer often has to do with either saving people time or saving people money.
00:07:57.780 - 00:08:15.254, Speaker A: But as it turns out, looking at the success of Netflix and TikTok right now, there is much needed space to serve people's lonely lives. And that is what entertainment is about. That is what NFT culture is about.
00:08:15.254 - 00:08:27.674, Speaker A: It's not just and I'm guilty of that, it's not just about composability indivisibility transparency. Those are just technical property of ERC 71 structure. Those are just technical property of what NFDS is about.
00:08:27.674 - 00:08:35.194, Speaker A: And yes, as builders, as devs, we ought to know that. But for retail, it's what NFT culture has come about. Frank does a good job of this.
00:08:35.194 - 00:08:55.330, Speaker A: Nine gag does a good job of this, and therefore NFT culture is entertainment. And that's a killer feature and that is something that we've leveraged well. For our second product, which is more so using AI, we have now launched a tool called GNT on our NFT marketplace and Launchpad.
00:08:55.330 - 00:09:16.826, Speaker A: GNT stands for Generative NFT Tools. In a few months of launch there are close to 900,000 Aigc Aigenerated content, Aigc images already live on our platform. So essentially you can go from an idea to NFT projects in minutes and deploy it on chain using GMZ and Fairmint process on more.
00:09:16.826 - 00:09:33.070, Speaker A: Once again you can learn more on Atmore official on our Twitter. And there is once again a 120K GMC contest going live in relation to how you can create these images. Moving on, there are several emergent use cases.
00:09:33.070 - 00:10:05.286, Speaker A: We've all seen what can happen in music with Rihanna and Doc coachella did Ticketing, artifact did with Virtual Fashion banksy has done amazing things with physical art. American Cancer Society recently did fundraise university of California is issuing degrees and trialing on NFTs in India there are police complaints being launched as NFTs. Yes, there is examples of real estate house ownership being trialed and piloted in some states, protection and enforcements of IP.
00:10:05.286 - 00:10:42.214, Speaker A: And LVMH recently introduced a traceability certificate in NFTs. Admittedly, these are very small use cases right now, very small in numbers, and there's a lot of controversy complaints. But then I don't know if how many of you are young enough to remember this, but when Google acquired YouTube and YouTube was big enough back then, that also was a big controversial decision that would YouTube lead to piracy, would there be video constraints, would there be IP constraints? And we know where YouTube stands today.
00:10:42.214 - 00:11:03.420, Speaker A: So if there are complaints like there are about crypto and NFTs, I think that's a good thing. I think we're doing something right to ruffle feathers in traditional circles. And this leads me to what are conclusively potential four major applications that I believe that NFTs could contribute in.
00:11:03.420 - 00:11:14.378, Speaker A: I broadly classified these into four segments. The first one is the frontier of building a community. I call it prelaunch.
00:11:14.378 - 00:11:39.862, Speaker A: There was a time when AA games would just post banner for giveaways on websites in web two and that is how they started building communities. NFTs are a very good corollary to that on how you can allow community to participate in your product prelaunch. The second one is where founding team has a direct connect with users and community.
00:11:39.862 - 00:12:04.830, Speaker A: It allows them to build platform one on one without spending flashy millions of dollars and celebrity endorsements. And this is what Chris Dixonol often talks about the cold start problem and NFTs really allow you to build community without spending big. The third one is the shift of tokenomics leading to NFT economics.
00:12:04.830 - 00:12:31.298, Speaker A: More and more game designers are realizing that just solely relying on speculative demand and supply, faucets and sinks of token in the game may not be sustainable. What many people don't actually realize is that faucets, sinks, token. All of these concepts have actually come from big traditional web two games.
00:12:31.298 - 00:13:04.238, Speaker A: These are not concepts that web three birthed out of speculation and this is the reason to build sustainability into it. Now there are models that are coming with NFT factories where the Genesis NFTs are given away free and then more and more newer drops happen to the Genesis holders. And there is some thinking going on how many collections are good enough number of collections and I think a figure of five collections over a space of twelve months is the current trend.
00:13:04.238 - 00:13:29.722, Speaker A: But then we are to see and last but not the least, where performance marketing will constantly swerve towards this hybrid model between web two and web three where there will be interoperability between these two games. So often performance marketing is thought to be something like you spend $3 on a user in the hope that they would spend $4 back. Actually it's not.
00:13:29.722 - 00:13:45.760, Speaker A: It's about spending $300 on 1000 users. So then one of them or few of them would actually spend $1,000 on your games. In web two games whales are called as people who spend $1,000 in the whole year.
00:13:45.760 - 00:13:59.654, Speaker A: And then towards the high end, of course you have 10,000, 10,0000, a million. Fortunately, unfortunately in crypto we already have bigger whales. People would easily spend $1,000, which is roughly 0.5
00:13:59.654 - 00:14:22.826, Speaker A: e in a heartbeat. However, to monetize these whales and yet grow the community to a mass adoption needs newer models. And which is why there could potentially exist the confluence of Web Two and web Three, where you monetize these whales using web three tactics and rare NFT drops in web Three.
00:14:22.826 - 00:14:44.930, Speaker A: But also develop a model of users playing your game for good experiences, like in Gas Hero using Power social wealth with simplified games for game experience. And web Two. And last but not the least, I want to stress that I get asked this way too often.
00:14:44.930 - 00:15:02.214, Speaker A: There were two events that I spoke yesterday and again what about Bear Bull cycle? How it's going to happen? And often it just takes one step back to look at where we are. So this is the crypto adoption cycle. There are four big activities that are happening here.
00:15:02.214 - 00:15:22.926, Speaker A: So the market cap of crypto has actually shot up by 75%. The social activity have actually shot up by 63%. The dev activity, which is potentially the strongest indicator here, is 84% up, and the startup activity correspondingly 62% up.
00:15:22.926 - 00:15:40.314, Speaker A: So it's up only. Having said that, we all know that people who can build in a bear market, it's hard to even imagine what they can pull off in a bull market. So obviously NFA gyor.
00:15:40.314 - 00:16:09.150, Speaker A: But this is why I strongly believe in my team, in our team at FSL, who are constantly building production ready products like a game, like an NFT marketplace, like a Dex. In last year alone, we have dished out solid infrastructure and social consumer facing apps like Step In, like More, Door, Gas Hero. So build and build apps which lead to this consumer moment in crypto.
00:16:09.150 - 00:16:22.980, Speaker A: This is a very good spectrum of what in web One. Web Two would be considered in the spectrum of play, as Patron calls it, and what it has evolved to modern times. And we are very close to playing at that level.
00:16:22.980 - 00:16:55.738, Speaker A: And this is why I believe that at FSL we're heading towards in the right direction with Step In, with Door, with More, with Ailed products like FairMind, Smack is our NDG model for Step In, gas Hero is our first Web Three social game and GNT is our AI tool for creating NFTs and images on More. You can learn more about all of these products on Twitter and our Discord. And for any feedback or collaborations, you can hit me up here.
00:16:55.738 - 00:17:09.902, Speaker A: Thank you. Sorry, I didn't leave any space for questions. It's probably only 30 seconds left, so we can take that bump in DMs.
00:17:09.902 - 00:17:10.558, Speaker A: Cheers. Bye.
