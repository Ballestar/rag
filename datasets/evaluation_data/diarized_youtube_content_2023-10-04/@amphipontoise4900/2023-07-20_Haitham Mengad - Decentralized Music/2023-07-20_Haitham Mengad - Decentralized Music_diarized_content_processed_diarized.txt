00:00:12.270 - 00:00:20.340, Speaker A: Hey everybody, thank you for coming to this talk. My name is Hatham. I'm going to be talking about my experience building a music project in Web Three.
00:00:20.340 - 00:00:30.206, Speaker A: I'm the co founder and CEO of Stems. It's basically a music creation and collaboration platform powered by Web Three. My background is in engineering.
00:00:30.206 - 00:00:41.820, Speaker A: I worked in venture capital startups. In 2018, I did some open source code for Cosmos actually. And then I'm pretty passionate about music, so I like to rap and produce and sing for fun.
00:00:41.820 - 00:01:00.542, Speaker A: So as many people here probably already know, the music industry is a little bit flawed. Unfortunately, musicians are not most musicians aren't living off their music. And I think there's three main reasons why the music industry is not efficient.
00:01:00.542 - 00:01:20.290, Speaker A: Basically, it's like poorly designed. The mechanism doesn't reward the creators properly and it doesn't have good discovery mechanisms. The three main factors are so one, most of the music you listen to is back catalog that is owned by three major labels warner, Universal and Sony.
00:01:20.290 - 00:01:31.034, Speaker A: They control 80% of the stuff you listen to on Spotify. And then there's insane competition for musicians. Is anybody here a musician? Nice.
00:01:31.034 - 00:01:38.174, Speaker A: Great. So insane competition. 60,000 tracks a day are uploaded on Spotify and only 0.2%
00:01:38.174 - 00:02:04.630, Speaker A: of people on Spotify make over minimum wage in the US. And then a thing that we don't talk about enough is how the internet kind of somewhat destroyed the music industry in the sense that everything you had to pay for, like you had to get a disc or a cassette or vinyl before and then you could just get it for free via peer to peer. Here you can see the kind of evolution of music with various technologies, music revenue.
00:02:04.630 - 00:02:28.560, Speaker A: So in the period since the early two thousand s and now the US GDP more than doubled, whereas music revenue basically is just about the same. And you can see like after the 70s you have vinyls, then you have the disc in the early two thousand s, the nineteen ninety s and early two thousand s and then you see the effect of the internet completely destroying the music revenue sales. But there is hope.
00:02:28.560 - 00:02:53.074, Speaker A: The ad supported and paid streaming monetization methods are starting to be pretty interesting. Even though Spotify gets a bad rap, it did kind of innovate in the sense that before people used to listen to music and albums, they used to buy vinyl CDs and kind of listen to an album by an artist. Whereas now it's kind of playlist oriented and you can have any song you want instantaneously.
00:02:53.074 - 00:03:21.178, Speaker A: Which is one of the benefits of digital streaming. So what does that all have to do with the web Three? Basically, by putting music like audio files, that's basically what music is, audio files. In NFTs you can have interesting kind of attributes such as transparent, royalty, attribution so you know who owns the NFT, who created it? When there's revenue generated by the NFT, you can attribute it properly, and then you have composability.
00:03:21.178 - 00:03:46.614, Speaker A: So you can basically give the NFT owners, the NFT creators specific perks at a concert or on a different platform. They can use the NFT with another audio file or another video file, and then you can kind of compose into a new NFT. And then the last thing which I think is very cool is as an artist, if you put an NFT out and people buy it, you have the wallet addresses of the people that supported you.
00:03:46.614 - 00:04:06.160, Speaker A: So you have a direct kind of link to these people most of the time. Like, if you post your music on YouTube, Spotify, et cetera, people who comment, you know who they are, but you don't know who kind of listen to your song, you don't know who your top fans on Spotify are. So, yeah, I think this is an interesting thing about NFTs as well.
00:04:06.160 - 00:04:33.950, Speaker A: And so we focus on stems, which are basically individual instrument tracks for the people who aren't musicians in the crowd. Just going to let Stromai show you better. Can it be louder? Okay, I have another had something else planned.
00:04:33.950 - 00:04:53.154, Speaker A: So this is a stem player. Have you guys ever seen this? Anybody? This is something Kanye West came up with, and it kind of shows what stems are. So each of these little bars here is one of the instrument tracks, like drums, bass, vocals, and melody.
00:04:53.154 - 00:05:08.586, Speaker A: So if I play here, I can kind of turn off a part of it. You hear like different parts of the kind of the song coming together. So that's kind of what a stem is.
00:05:08.586 - 00:05:15.882, Speaker A: It's each different individual stem track. Okay. All right.
00:05:15.882 - 00:05:39.442, Speaker A: And so the reason we decided to make stem NFTs instead of strong NFTs is because I personally believe that for music to go to, for kind of a consumer product to grow in the blockchain with music, you need the music to be there already. I don't think people are going to listen to music that is on Spotify. They can get for $10 a month on other platforms because they're supporting the artist.
00:05:39.442 - 00:05:48.642, Speaker A: Unfortunately, that's not how human nature works. So by focusing on stem NFTs, we have the building blocks for music. And the music is being created on chain.
00:05:48.642 - 00:05:58.342, Speaker A: So you have to go on chain to listen to it. And then you can do stem level rights attribution. And the original artist has kind of control over whatever is made with the stem.
00:05:58.342 - 00:06:17.694, Speaker A: So imagine a 40 year old bass line is used again, like 40 years later, you can reward the people that bought it, that created it, et cetera. So we made this protocol, basically, that consists of dropping a song into the different pieces of it. It stems as NFTs.
00:06:17.694 - 00:06:36.594, Speaker A: And then we like the Stems labs, the company, incentivizes people to make music with these stem NFTs. And then the resulting music is basically a combination of stems from the drop and then new stems that the remixers make. And then the original artist can actually approve the remixes they like on chain.
00:06:36.594 - 00:06:47.210, Speaker A: So it's kind of like a featuring mechanism on chain. Let's say there's 50 remixes. The original person can pick which one they like, and that's kind of public and transparent.
00:06:47.210 - 00:07:15.554, Speaker A: So up until now, this presentation, we'd been doing that with this presentation for a few months, and that's like the kind of the theory of the protocol is very interesting, et cetera, but in practice, we've been building for about a year now and talking with a lot of artists. The reality of it is, like, the protocols and the things underneath are all interesting, and when they grow, they make a lot of sense. But initially you need people, you need artists to use them.
00:07:15.554 - 00:07:48.826, Speaker A: So we've been focusing on a platform that wraps around this protocol called Stems Art. Kind of the same way uniswap Labs released a mobile app, for instance, to wrap the Uniswap protocol. Yeah, I think that's the most interesting kind of topic nowadays, as the person before me was talking about how do you make user friendly things, like, beyond Web Three? How do you kind of hide all the protocol stuff and make it very simple? So there are two ways that you can grow the network of a protocol, in my opinion.
00:07:48.826 - 00:07:58.900, Speaker A: One is strong incentives. So basically, like proof of work for Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was like people were using Bitcoin Ethereum because there was a financial reward for it.
00:07:58.900 - 00:08:21.558, Speaker A: In the case of these projects, like, you have Audius and a bunch of other projects that did Airdrops, which is an interesting mechanism that can use that. Another way to make your kind of base of users grow is just good UIUX, like Openc. They first built a nice product that was very simple to use, brought like tens of millions of people into Web Three, and then they built the protocol.
00:08:21.558 - 00:08:29.926, Speaker A: So that's kind of the approach we have. And you can see how early we are. Like, there's 200 million Ethereum addresses and then 600 million music streaming users.
00:08:29.926 - 00:08:37.760, Speaker A: There's 2.3 billion people on Instagram every month. So we're still very early and we need to focus on this kind of user adoption stuff.
00:08:37.760 - 00:08:50.290, Speaker A: Unfortunately, there's some challenges. I don't know what's going on this slide. Anyway, so there's obviously UIUX hurdles around wallet signatures and transactions.
00:08:50.290 - 00:09:08.770, Speaker A: Who logged in using a wallet here? Who ever used a wallet here? Who never had a problem connecting with a wallet? Nobody. So basically, I use wallets every day. I have multiple wallets.
00:09:08.770 - 00:09:23.310, Speaker A: It's a terrible UX. It needs to be attracted away to not use users, lose users. The other thing you're not seeing in this slide is basically Music NFTs went into kind of a bubble a year ago, and then Music NFT sales plummeted.
00:09:23.310 - 00:09:55.478, Speaker A: Basically, there was no real use case for Music NFTs. My opinion is there was a lot of venture capital, there was an eco chamber that pushed the sales up, but there wasn't really an explanation beyond just supporting the artist, which is cool, but it's not really a consumer product use case, I would say. And then the other part of this slide that you're not seeing is we're pitching to regular artists, like people that have an audience that go on tours, that have millions of streamers and when we come in and tell them crypto or NFT, they get scared away right away.
00:09:55.478 - 00:10:04.374, Speaker A: So we actually try to keep it very subtle. We'll use words like decentralized, digital, native, et cetera. And you can see this is across the industry.
00:10:04.374 - 00:10:24.180, Speaker A: Like Coinbase changed their logo, they removed Coin from Coinbase, which is pretty huge, the biggest company in the space. So some solutions that we've thought about basically the philosophy is to think of blockchain. It's like your database technology.
00:10:24.180 - 00:10:40.818, Speaker A: So when you're building a startup, you're not going to tell the users, I'm building it with SQL and you're asking them for their SSH into SQL or whatever. You're focusing on the product. There's some value to using blockchain for the user.
00:10:40.818 - 00:10:58.650, Speaker A: They need to know that it's transparent, they can use tools to see the stuff that is happening to their money. So yes, that should be surfaced, but beyond that I think it should be kind of toned down. So a couple very cool kind of guiding principles is to remove the initial friction.
00:10:58.650 - 00:11:21.326, Speaker A: So there's plenty of tools out there that allow users to sign up and log in using regular providers like Google, Apple, Instagram, and then there's various models to generate wallet addresses for them. So they don't even need to worry about wallets, they can just log in with Google. These tools use different mechanisms.
00:11:21.326 - 00:11:35.686, Speaker A: Like MPC is a mechanism that allows you to generate a wallet for somebody, but you don't own the private key. The private key is basically spread, nobody owns it. So that's been huge, a lot of products using that, it's been very big for us.
00:11:35.686 - 00:11:45.014, Speaker A: And then the other thing is simplifying transactions. So there's many ways to do this. Lens protocol that we're building on has a dispatcher mechanism.
00:11:45.014 - 00:12:15.000, Speaker A: So basically you activate this thing and then you're basically telling them anything that I post is validated, is signed, I don't need to sign every time until you deactivate it. So there's a little security risk, but I think most users won't really care about that. There's also account abstraction, it's very new, allows people to kind of interact with portions of their wallet via smart contract without directly kind of having to log in or anything.
00:12:15.000 - 00:12:36.058, Speaker A: There's also topping up the user account with fiat currency. So there's tools like Onramper, Cross, Mint, et cetera that allow you to let users pay for NFTs with dollars with their credit card, which make the whole thing very simple. And I'll leave some time for questions so I'm going to stop here.
00:12:36.058 - 00:12:43.440, Speaker A: This my info. Yes, go ahead.
00:12:47.810 - 00:12:57.714, Speaker B: This might come as a little bit of a curveball, but I don't know if you were in the previous talk, but I assume a lot of the music you're talking about is like recorded stuff, right?
00:12:57.832 - 00:12:59.442, Speaker A: Recording recorded stuff.
00:12:59.496 - 00:13:02.354, Speaker B: Like MP3, s waves? Like recorded content?
00:13:02.472 - 00:13:07.590, Speaker A: Well, yeah, most content is now in the form, like when you listen to on Spotify, et cetera.
00:13:08.010 - 00:13:12.200, Speaker B: This I understand. My question for you is, what about Live?
00:13:12.970 - 00:13:24.454, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that's a whole different what about Live with just regular Web two, right. Never really made the I mean, there's Ticket Master. I think there's stuff with tickets.
00:13:24.454 - 00:13:30.060, Speaker A: That's what I'd say. We're not really doing that, but with tickets, this is probably some interesting stuff. I'd say.
00:13:35.650 - 00:14:11.482, Speaker C: I wanted to ask, what is Stem's meeting point with the user? Like, are you about creating a streaming app for the stems produced composite of Stem NFTs? Or is it more like an online editor where me as a musician no, even just as a synchron, like a marketer. I need original music, and I can choose different stems from different creators, create my pay, and that gets divided. So what is the final product that maybe you're aiming to if you want to disclose, of course.
00:14:11.536 - 00:14:22.830, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. I think it's kind of like a chicken and egg thing where you need musicians to get users. You need users for musicians to care about posting.
00:14:22.830 - 00:14:35.122, Speaker A: So we're focusing on producers and just building up producer. It's a producer centric product and platform. We're on Discord also, if you guys want to join the Discord and see how it works.
00:14:35.122 - 00:14:50.794, Speaker A: Basically, we're learning from the community of producers to build a product that creates more music and then brings on more users, basically. Great. That's it for me.
00:14:50.794 - 00:14:51.560, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you.
