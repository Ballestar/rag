00:00:57.490 - 00:01:00.694, Speaker A: Everyone. Thank you for joining. My name is O.
00:01:00.694 - 00:01:16.240, Speaker A: I'm the co founder and CEO of Firearm Blocks. I led a smart to a team in Bancor about five years ago. And in 2018 yeah, sure.
00:01:16.240 - 00:01:27.534, Speaker A: In 2018 was 06:00 A.m., I got a phone call. It was summer for my team, my team in Bancor.
00:01:27.534 - 00:01:42.150, Speaker A: And he said that there is person over the support group on Telegram and is trying to convert some tokens. And he got an error message over the web app. The error message said 99% of slippage.
00:01:42.150 - 00:01:51.100, Speaker A: I took my laptop and I start digging in. I made some phone calls to my team members. No one knew what's going on.
00:01:51.100 - 00:02:03.680, Speaker A: And then I start looking after the recent transaction, the recent activity. After a while, I start calculating. And I found out that $20 million were liquidated out of the app.
00:02:03.680 - 00:02:15.134, Speaker A: And then for 72 hours, three days, and three nights, there were no trades over the app. No one could use it. No one could trade.
00:02:15.134 - 00:02:21.670, Speaker A: No one could withdraw their funds. I didn't eat, I didn't sleep. Three days and three nights.
00:02:21.670 - 00:02:46.090, Speaker A: And the team, the community, no one knew what's going on. And the only thing that we actually know back then is the fact that the ecosystem is not ready to scale and it's not ready to mass adoption with this kind of security measure. And finally, we succeed to return about $10 million out of the stolen amount was like an Israeli military operation.
00:02:46.090 - 00:03:10.690, Speaker A: And we also understood that something is missing, that this is not the way to protect on Web Three. We also understood that Benco was lucky. Benco was lucky because the fact that my partner SAF and I, we succeed to save more than $300 million that could be stolen out of the pools.
00:03:10.690 - 00:03:27.958, Speaker A: And the only reason that we succeed to do that is the fact that we responded immediately. And this is why we built Ironblocks. Ironblocks provides real time detection and responding.
00:03:27.958 - 00:03:48.954, Speaker A: It's a full security suite, and it allows the protocols to reduce the chance of being hacked. It means that it allows them to respond on time response within milliseconds. And more than that, we understood back then that if it happened to us, it can happen to anyone.
00:03:48.954 - 00:04:02.920, Speaker A: It can happen to anyone. Because security today and also back then centers around code. If we're talking about bug bounties or audit or formal verification, which are super important, but this is code.
00:04:02.920 - 00:04:32.910, Speaker A: What about compromised private keys, for example, or authors or market assumptions? This is not code. And until last year, until 2022, no one really did or provide real time security system for Web Three. And even if some project want to have some monitoring, they had to create that by themselves from scratch.
00:04:32.910 - 00:04:43.954, Speaker A: It was highly complicated. There were no tools back then during 2022. And the maintenance was it cost a lot during the last year.
00:04:43.954 - 00:05:01.720, Speaker A: We can see that there are a lot of detection companies, a lot of monitoring services and some are more precise. It brought a lot of confidence that was missing into this ecosystem. However, to prevent an attack, a good detection system must come together with a good prevention system.
00:05:01.720 - 00:05:18.694, Speaker A: And today, the most common way to prevent an attack, the most common prevention solution is posing. Posing mechanism. It means that posing it's posed the whole protocol.
00:05:18.694 - 00:05:39.342, Speaker A: Basically, it's common in most of the project and it has several doorbecks. The first orbit is about the time that it takes to activate it. Usually it's baked by multisig and those signers based in different locations around the world, usually in different time zones, and can take hours until it's getting activated.
00:05:39.342 - 00:05:56.570, Speaker A: We can see the recent hacks that happened in the last few months, how much time it took to activate this mechanism. More than that, the usability of the protocol even legit users. They can't use the app or withdraw the funds during the time that the protocol is posed.
00:05:56.570 - 00:06:27.324, Speaker A: And if you think about your bank, I don't think that it makes sense, or you will think that it makes sense that you wouldn't be able to withdraw your funds. If the bank think that there is another client that made a suspicious or malicious action and then the bank block all the other clients of withdrawing their funds, we can improve that. Even today we can improve that with circuit breakers.
00:06:27.324 - 00:06:59.912, Speaker A: For example, circuit breakers in the traditional world works in a way that there are some indexes that for example, the SP 500, if it drops by 7% or more, there is an automated circuit breaker that gets inactivated and pose the all trades. No one can use the trades and actually to protect on the global economy in web three, we can apply a very similar technique. We can apply a technique that allow to pose a specific liquidity pool or specific vault.
00:06:59.912 - 00:07:26.944, Speaker A: We can apply that to reduce the withdrawal limit. For example, we can also pose the protocol for a very certain amount of time. It actually allow us to balance between risk management on the one end and on the other end we can balance between risk management and the usability of the protocol.
00:07:26.944 - 00:07:41.850, Speaker A: And if we think about that, there are several projects that already apply this system. For example, Ave over there, it's possible to pose a specific pool instead of posing the old protocol. And we can improve that even more.
00:07:41.850 - 00:08:04.400, Speaker A: For example, two weeks ago, one of our employees, she went to see her family in Colorado. She went from Tel Aviv to Colorado to see her family and she booked some hotel, she booked some flights to this conference for us over here. And I got about 15 text message from Mastercard to verify my identity.
00:08:04.400 - 00:08:29.848, Speaker A: What happened over there is that Mastercard, they saw that there is unusual activity, for example, unusual location, unusual amount within those transactions and they actually sent me a verification code each time to make sure that I'm the actual person who commit those transactions. With this understanding. In Ironblocks, we apply a very similar technique to protect on transactions in Web Three.
00:08:29.848 - 00:09:04.004, Speaker A: It means that we are capable to verify transactions before they are getting executed within the base layer. If we are talking about the building blocks of this entire ecosystem, centralization privacy, transparency, it's our job to make sure that we kept on those building blocks on behalf of the users into the new era. In Ironblocks, we build the most exciting solution in Web Three security today.
00:09:04.004 - 00:09:29.710, Speaker A: It's a full security network and it allow us to verify the transaction before they are getting executed within the base layer. It means that we actually remove surgically specific transactions and move them into a different security funnel. And the other users of the protocol, the legit ones, can continue to use the protocol in the same time.
00:09:29.710 - 00:09:55.260, Speaker A: It's completely decentralized, it's private and it's transparent. It's the most precise solution today with the best user experience out of all the existing solutions. And if we are talking about decentralization, and if you ask yourself why swans, by the way, so swans, usually they fly in groups.
00:09:55.260 - 00:10:10.036, Speaker A: And as we say that if there is a new Swan or a new member that want to join the group, they need to approve them. And if one of them drop off, they continue moving. As we say, that the decision.
00:10:10.036 - 00:10:45.216, Speaker A: Whether a transaction is legit or not, it should be taken by different detection providers, not single one, to make sure that we keep on decentralization. And if we are talking about privacy, we believe that there shouldn't be any third person that can understand or can take any advantage over the person who committed transaction. And more than that, we believe that the transaction data and the user data must remain private.
00:10:45.216 - 00:11:19.892, Speaker A: And if we are talking about transparency protocols, users and their communities should be able to understand what the processes that their transaction are going to go through and be able to choose whether they are okay with that or not. So if you build a detection system, we want to work with you, we want to collaborate with you to make this ecosystem much more safer for everyone. If you have a project in Web Three up and running, think about prevention, think about detection or monitoring.
00:11:19.892 - 00:11:28.960, Speaker A: This is highly important. And if you build a project right now, think about embedded security. Read about that.
00:11:28.960 - 00:11:35.070, Speaker A: It's super interesting within your smart context, by the way, I hope that you enjoyed and thank you.
