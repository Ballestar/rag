00:00:13.290 - 00:01:00.670, Speaker A: Hello everyone, thanks for being here today. For the first time at the SEC, we have organized like a complete legal track to address the main legal challenge and legal issues that the project are in. So we will be together all this morning until 12:30, until the lunch and we will have the pleasure to welcome a lot of legal experts from all around the world. And also each time we will have also a project like builder who come from the project. The idea is really to share and to share the view and to share the feeling about regulation.
00:01:04.450 - 00:01:05.200, Speaker B: Actually.
00:01:06.930 - 00:01:09.838, Speaker A: About the legal track because what's the legal challenge.
00:01:09.934 - 00:01:14.482, Speaker B: The crypto will face in 2020.
00:01:14.536 - 00:02:24.118, Speaker A: Of course, you'll have the answer during all this morning during roundtable so I hope that night was not so not so wild. So thank you to be here. First thing, the first we see a rise about regulation on crypto in things that's actually quite crypto industry. And this regulation, it is very interesting. It's all the regulation waves come during actually the beer market and the crypto winter. And what we should stress out is that the crypto winter or the beer market actually fuel the regulatory activity. We saw quite recently the last maybe one or two years, we saw the rise of a global stable coin which raised actually very strong and very interesting political and legal challenge, especially if you try to do not have the view of the people here who are I think really like crypto and tech savvy.
00:02:24.134 - 00:02:27.974, Speaker B: But if you stand the fee regulator.
00:02:28.022 - 00:03:10.870, Speaker A: And actually the rest of the world on stablecoin so it's something we will address today. The other very strong phenomena that fuel the regulation we see like an unbelievable massification of the crypto and the crypto has arrived in the retail market. I will just give you one figure about only the French market, but we have the same figure for all the European market and probably everywhere in the world. There is a recent study from KPMG in France who showed that 7% of the French citizens of French Euros have crypto. It's absolutely massive.
00:03:10.950 - 00:03:13.130, Speaker C: It's something like comparable to the people.
00:03:13.200 - 00:04:19.920, Speaker A: Who have stocks directly and it's not through retirement plan and so on. So the consequences of this is that crypto and DeFi, it's not a niche, something like something secret around a bunch of gig. It's becoming something at the level of the regulation, at the level of the states. So that's why the regulation is coming so quickly. And the last very strong, very strong things we have witnessed, like quite we have witnessed that unfortunately or fortunately, it was very pervasible actually the industry is not able to regulate itself. We saw that of course DeFi and CFI are not in the same bag. But anyway, in the eyes of the regulator and in the eyes of all the other people who are not in this building today, like the crypto industry have made people lost some money and that's the only thing the regulators is able to look at this point.
00:04:19.920 - 00:05:21.042, Speaker A: We talk about this in detail during the next 3 hours but these three phenomena has to be keep in mind regarding the legal track, it's a very simple India. Last year there is a very brilliant legal talk. We were disseminated in all the track around the people. Some of the people from last year will be there today of course. So the idea is just to gather these people so to have something like more maybe true with all the legal challenge that can be addressed and also of course to share the view. So that's why we have organized a succession of panel to allow sharing between.
00:05:21.096 - 00:05:22.962, Speaker C: Project and legal experts and between different.
00:05:23.016 - 00:06:40.910, Speaker A: Legal experts from different place of the world. All the speakers today are very knowledgeable about tech, they are very knowledgeable about law and they are king like daily basis with builders. So of course I would like to thank them for the participation and we are very glad to have them today and I continue to ask you everything you need to know about the regulation because we will try of course to accept as many as questions as possible from the room. I want to end this presentation with a positive note. Regulation is a very anxious topic on the crypto industry for most of the people I've seen the crypto industry and especially on DeFi because it's a little bit less regulated that's for instance the exchange or the CFI players. So this legal track we want to give you a very distressing message. We will try to be positive because two things first of all, you will see that there is a lot of people like Isolin and Robert Francis that are just here, that are very brave and they are working to industry late innovation and regulation so you are not alone.
00:06:40.910 - 00:07:11.414, Speaker A: And the other thing is it's not like the end of something, it's maybe the end of, I don't know, the first era of the crypto like the so called jungle. Now the rule of the game are just changing and our goal with this legal track is to answer your question about these new game rules and give you maybe some advice to play with the new rules that arrive and that will be in place in the next.
00:07:11.452 - 00:07:13.880, Speaker C: Maybe twelve to 24 months.
00:07:14.330 - 00:07:20.454, Speaker A: So we'll try today to push forward this area and I will finish by saying thank you for being here and.
00:07:20.492 - 00:07:21.990, Speaker C: Thank you to all the speaker.
00:07:29.890 - 00:07:30.640, Speaker B: It.
00:07:37.170 - 00:07:47.100, Speaker A: Maybe if some of you have some question at this stage or if you don't any question? No.
