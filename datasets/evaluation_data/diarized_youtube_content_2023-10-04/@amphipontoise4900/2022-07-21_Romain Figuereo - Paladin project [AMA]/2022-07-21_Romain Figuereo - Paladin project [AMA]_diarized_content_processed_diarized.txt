00:00:22.520 - 00:00:54.884, Speaker A: Thank you everyone for being here for the second panel of the for the second step of the ETCC legal track, it will be about a project, Paladin. I will give the floor to Roma that will explain us who he is and what is Padon. My name is William Rourke and I'm a partner at Awwell and I will ask some questions to Roman during this Ask me anything and of course we will be glad to take your question during the ask me anything.
00:00:54.884 - 00:00:58.810, Speaker A: Roma, I'll let you introduce yourself and introduce your project.
00:00:59.180 - 00:01:05.476, Speaker B: Thank you for the invitation, William. So I'm Romas. Some might know me as Fig on the social networks.
00:01:05.476 - 00:01:26.176, Speaker B: I'm one of the co founders of Pardon, which is governance, Lending and Management Protocol. I'm going to try to be as candid and interesting as possible on the legal questions of things, so hopefully I don't get canceled or taken away by regulators by the end of the talk. So yeah, do you want to start right away? Do you want me to describe a.
00:01:26.198 - 00:01:35.188, Speaker A: Bit more what we yeah, maybe explain us what is exactly a governance lending protocol? Maybe some people, especially on the stream, are not very savvy about these kind of things.
00:01:35.274 - 00:01:47.208, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. So what we have built is what we call influence market. It's a way for people who don't use their voting power to basically deposit them into the vaults that we have created and other people can basically borrow them.
00:01:47.208 - 00:02:05.884, Speaker B: It can become much more complex than that, depending on the protocols. So the decentralized organization we're actually building on top of. But the main idea is that there's a big participation problem today and we're basically trying to enable more people to access the voting power by reducing the friction of access.
00:02:05.884 - 00:02:08.748, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the very basis of it.
00:02:08.914 - 00:02:23.890, Speaker A: Okay, so to summarize, I can ask your protocol, like Paladin to borrow or to lend some governance right. Attached to a token if I want, for instance, to participate into the governance. So to participate in a decentralized project.
00:02:24.260 - 00:02:37.928, Speaker B: Yep, that's exactly it. The idea is that, for example, you have a lending protocol and you could say, but what's the difference? A traditional lending protocol enables you to lend out the asset. Right? And the difference is that with Paladin, you're just lending out the voting power.
00:02:37.928 - 00:02:51.052, Speaker B: So it can become very interesting because most of the regulation today, essentially the banking regulation, is around financial assets. Right. The thing is that is voting power, financial assets today, that's not the case.
00:02:51.052 - 00:02:57.740, Speaker B: So we can enter in a very complex and interesting discussion because what we're actually doing in a sense is not really finance.
00:02:58.320 - 00:03:19.652, Speaker A: Okay, great. And I precise that you have a legal background, so it will be interesting. This is just for the record, and I also understand that Paladin, so you are a protocol that is offering a kind of services into the Dao ecosystem, but at the same time you are yourself a do, right? Or you are becoming a Dao, if I understand.
00:03:19.652 - 00:03:19.924, Speaker A: Well.
00:03:19.962 - 00:03:34.712, Speaker B: So paladin is a dao. I think the problem with saying we are a Dao. Is that you're saying that you have passed a point of decentralization where you're basically fully decentralized, and the truth is that there is no such a thing.
00:03:34.712 - 00:03:41.096, Speaker B: It's a constant point you're trying to get to. It's just a limit. You're not trying to be decentralized.
00:03:41.096 - 00:03:53.616, Speaker B: You're trying to be as decentralized as possible. So paladin is a dao. We're trying to put more and more measures to make it more decentralized, but we have tried to be as decentralized as possible from the get go.
00:03:53.616 - 00:04:06.192, Speaker B: So, for example, the core team Hawaii, had their tokens allocated by the actual Dao. We did not have any allocation at the beginning, in a sense, and that's very specific to Paladin. I think we really need to be a Dao.
00:04:06.192 - 00:04:16.730, Speaker B: Simply because what we're building cannot work in the traditional sense, like for a traditional company, because you cannot ask people to give you too much power and not think you're going to abuse it at some point.
00:04:17.180 - 00:04:44.800, Speaker A: Okay, I would like to ask you some question about more globally the Dao. Because your project is in the middle of this ecosystem. Could you explain what is a dao? What is a decentralized autonomous organization? And maybe give us some insight about if there is any difference with a company or a form of normal company? Corporate?
00:04:45.300 - 00:04:51.124, Speaker B: Yes. So I actually think no one agrees on what the Dow is, so we're probably not going to agree.
00:04:51.162 - 00:04:54.070, Speaker A: That's why I'm asking you this question.
00:04:55.160 - 00:05:07.716, Speaker B: So it means a decentralized autonomous organization. Autonomous does not mean automatic. It means that it doesn't need any above or side regulation or laws to basically function.
00:05:07.716 - 00:05:31.404, Speaker B: It basically has the governing body and the rules that allow it to be self sufficient and autonomous and then decentralized. It just means that basically there is no centralized power and it's easy for people to basically move the center of power from one place to another and that there needs to be an absolute consensus for things to move forward. So when we say, what's the difference with a company? I would actually say a company could be a Dow.
00:05:31.404 - 00:05:46.076, Speaker B: Honestly, for me, a Dow is not a type of legal entity or a type of entity. It's like an operating system for entities. So you can have a company that's a Dow.
00:05:46.076 - 00:05:51.140, Speaker B: You can have an association that's a Dow. You could even have a state that's a Dao. But that's in theory.
00:05:51.640 - 00:06:04.504, Speaker A: Okay, so if it's an operating system, is it possible to be a do without having a legal entity? I mean, if you want to hire contractors, if you want to have a relationship with the other project or other.
00:06:04.542 - 00:06:09.150, Speaker B: People, okay, so let's be very careful on this. Yes, you can. I'm not saying it's a good idea.
00:06:10.560 - 00:06:20.140, Speaker A: Okay, very interesting. Maybe about the risk. When we're talking about regulation, we're talking about trying to mitigate the risk.
00:06:20.140 - 00:06:43.044, Speaker A: And we talked about it in the previous panel. It could be in a wrong way or in a bad way. If you are taking the innovators and the builder point of view, what is the main risk you see with Dao? I know it's a very broad question because there is a lot of kind of Dao, but maybe on the governance, is there is a governance attack or governance sales that can happen.
00:06:43.044 - 00:06:45.930, Speaker A: Is it something the Dao project are working on?
00:06:47.900 - 00:07:12.556, Speaker B: So as you say, there's a lot of risk. We can talk about the ethical risk, the success risk, in a sense, is this the type of organization that can actually function? And then you have the legal risks, the legal risk, in a sense, you have, you could say, as we mentioned, banking regulation risk. You're going to have fiscal risk, which are probably the most obvious ones and the ones who are going to have the most problems the fastest.
00:07:12.556 - 00:07:29.316, Speaker B: And then you have the civil responsibility risks in case there's a problem, who is responsible? And that's the problem. If you share the power and there is no central authority, central sense of responsibility, is everyone responsible? Is no one responsible? That's a really great challenge today.
00:07:29.498 - 00:07:35.376, Speaker A: Okay, so the risk is that today could be classified or qualified as a de facto company, for instance.
00:07:35.488 - 00:07:39.608, Speaker B: Yeah, it could. It's not even de facto company. So in France, in the US.
00:07:39.608 - 00:07:55.230, Speaker B: We have different types of companies, right? Means that the jury who's going to basically indict you, they're going to be the ones who choose what type of company you are. So you basically lose the freedom and the flexibility that you could have by creating the legal wrapper yourself.
00:07:56.080 - 00:08:11.856, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. And maybe a last question about the risk, about the governance token itself. Do you see some risk to this governance to be classified as something regulate? I'm talking about virtual asset on one side, security token on the other side.
00:08:11.856 - 00:08:15.984, Speaker A: And could you explain us a little bit? What is this risk and what is this kind of token?
00:08:16.112 - 00:08:31.492, Speaker B: Oh yeah, it could happen for sure. So the problem that we have today is the speed at which the regulator goes is inversely proportional to the speed at which crypto goes. So for example, we're now starting to talk about DFI regulation.
00:08:31.492 - 00:08:38.872, Speaker B: We're in 2022. We've been doing DFI for what, four years? So each time they regulated ICOs three or four years after the ICOs. Right.
00:08:38.872 - 00:08:52.000, Speaker B: So the problem we have is they're telling us this is bad. Once everyone has basically delved their toes into it. I do think we're going to find a legal qualification for crypto assets, especially governance tokens.
00:08:52.000 - 00:09:28.484, Speaker B: Is it going to be an old category that we revamp or do we have to reinvent something, as you mentioned, with virtual assets? Honestly, I don't really know what's the I think it's also going to depend on the type of assets because, for example, you have governance token that yield, that bear yield, they have dividends, like for example, CRB token that gives you different types of yield but at the same time it's not transferable. So it does not have the same characteristic as a traditional asset. The idea is that you could say governance tokens and that's controversial look like stocks, but they're like some kind of programmable stock.
00:09:28.484 - 00:09:40.904, Speaker B: But some of them are worse than stocks, some of them are better. So in a sense, it's not just one qualification. That when it's like a whole table with different characteristics and then we have to add them, but at the same time some other people are going to invent new characteristics.
00:09:40.904 - 00:09:43.120, Speaker B: We have to make the table bigger constantly.
00:09:43.540 - 00:10:16.696, Speaker A: I will be a little bit provocative but if I understand the meaning of a discussion creating a dio can draw some risk like to be classified at a company in one form or another that draw risk on the taxation, risk on liability, governance token draw also some risk. So what is the purpose? Is it a good idea to create a do and how to create a Dao without trying to mitigate this risk or at least to know them?
00:10:16.878 - 00:10:51.492, Speaker B: So something that's important is that crypto started a lot with a lot of very young folks, a lot of people who did not have, and I am part of them by the way, who did not have entrepreneurship experience. So yes, when you build a company you have legal risk yes, when you have entrepreneurial risk, you have financial risk and this is exactly the same when you build a Dow. What's interesting about a Dow is that you have much more opportunity you could have in your traditional company because you're building something that's more resistant to social consensus, to power concentration and much more flexible in term of the programmability of all of it.
00:10:51.492 - 00:11:01.450, Speaker B: So in a sense you're taking more risk because you're potentially creeping more reward but you have a canvas of exploration in term of the projects you can build that's much bigger today.
00:11:02.460 - 00:11:26.060, Speaker A: Okay, very interesting. Do you see forthcoming regulation in the EU or in the US or in the UK that can have an impact on Dow or not especially. We are talking about when we are talking about just for the public, when we are talking about civil liability or de facto companies, we are talking about like maybe 200 years old regulation.
00:11:26.060 - 00:11:32.476, Speaker A: So I'm talking about maybe Mika or in the US. You see some interesting regulation that arrive.
00:11:32.588 - 00:11:53.176, Speaker B: So I know a lot of founders don't actually agree with me on that, but regulation should come. It's still going to take some time. They say Micah needs two more years, right? But if we don't have regulation we're basically subject to interpretation which is even worse because it means that we don't know where we're going, if we get sued, if we have a lawsuit, we don't know where this can end up.
00:11:53.176 - 00:12:06.156, Speaker B: And uncertainty is much more dangerous than certainty, because you can prepare against certainty, you can't against uncertainty. So in a sense, I want us to get regulated, but it has to be in the same logic. That what we have built.
00:12:06.156 - 00:12:22.770, Speaker B: I've been very adamant on saying that the problem with banking regulation is that what they're asking from banks, they can't ask the same from crypto. Not because we can't give it to them. We can actually give most of the questions they want to because the blockchain is so smart, but because they're asking the wrong question.
00:12:22.770 - 00:12:29.316, Speaker B: They want to know the identity of someone. They don't actually need to. What they need to is look at the transaction history from someone.
00:12:29.316 - 00:12:40.584, Speaker B: And then if they want to ask the identity, they ask for on and off front actors, centralized exchanges, who basically do this liaison. And in the DeFi sandbox, no one cares what you're doing. In a sense.
00:12:40.584 - 00:12:49.900, Speaker B: You can't, for example, launder money this way. And that's the problem. The problem is that because we're asking the wrong question, we're fighting against the wrong principles and the wrong problems.
00:12:49.900 - 00:13:02.464, Speaker B: We need this because then we end up with a luna crash, then we end up with Wonderland, where we realize that they're potentially washing money away, et cetera. It's a big problem. We need to have higher standards and we need to know where we're going.
00:13:02.464 - 00:13:10.050, Speaker B: And when you have an 18 years old kid who creates a lending protocol, he has no idea of all the complexities of the credit system. Right?
00:13:12.180 - 00:13:29.800, Speaker A: Before accepting maybe some question from the public, what will be your main advice to someone? Want to create Dell? I mean, most of the projects in DeFi are linked on one way or another to Dell. What will be your main topic? To create Dell with a legal standpoint, of course.
00:13:29.950 - 00:13:36.170, Speaker B: Oh yeah, for sure. I was going to say go to law school, but.
00:13:37.900 - 00:13:39.396, Speaker A: That'S a very hard advice.
00:13:39.508 - 00:13:54.416, Speaker B: That's a very bad advice. So the idea is either find a good lawyer, but of course you need money to do so, you have to be successful, or to raise funds at some point, just read the articles, speak with other people who brought out. There are best practices that are being made.
00:13:54.416 - 00:14:04.496, Speaker B: Some people are writing articles about it. It's very easy, don't do stupid things. If something is deemed stupid in a company, it's probably going to be deemed stupid in a dow.
00:14:04.608 - 00:14:23.144, Speaker A: It's really a grandma advice don't do stupid. Now, maybe something we can add is that just try to cool down for five minutes and understand what exactly your people are buying, your governance token, what they will be able to mean it's. I understand your advice like this.
00:14:23.144 - 00:14:35.150, Speaker A: Usually if there is, I don't know, a financial risk or governance risk. You can assess it quite just. Of course, you just need to step down a little and to try to have some insight on it.
00:14:35.150 - 00:14:43.004, Speaker A: Okay? So, Romans, thank you very much for this. Ask me anything. Maybe some of you have some question, because actually it's ask me anything for you.
00:14:43.004 - 00:14:48.130, Speaker A: You are supposed to ask something if any one of you want to have a question.
00:14:53.970 - 00:15:18.360, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe just some thoughts from Roma on very specific stuff, like, for example, legal rappers. It's a very common topic for DAOs now, but in your opinion, is there right now any decent strategy for legal rappers, or is there no strategy? And just like, opinions the way.
00:15:20.810 - 00:15:39.994, Speaker B: I think the biggest problem is that today most of the legal rapper comments we find, at least on the Internet, at least I am not. So it means that I am not subject to the same kind of regulation, to the same kind of regulating philosophy than they are. So we can actually be held liable by the SEC, but we also are much more likely to be held liable by the European or the French regulator.
00:15:39.994 - 00:16:06.450, Speaker B: So in France, for example, if you create an entity in the BVI or something, you're going to have really complex problems with the fiscal system in France because most of the transactions who come from the BVI are them as fiscal evasions or something like that. So it's not the most obvious system for us in France to actually follow the legal wrappers that are advised in the US. Again, it's like you can look at a lot of different structures.
00:16:06.450 - 00:16:29.470, Speaker B: I don't think there's the right answer. The whole point and the whole beauty of law is that usually there is not one answer. There's a lot of different constructions you can have, and it's more about finding the right fit for you and usually building it yourself with your consultants, if you have them, with your lawyers to basically find what's the ideal setup for your specific project and your specific company.
00:16:29.470 - 00:16:31.680, Speaker B: It's always the same, right? You have to tailor it.
00:16:34.370 - 00:16:54.996, Speaker A: Any further questions? Any more question? If you have any question to Roma, maybe you will be free after the talk to answer. Okay. Thank you very much for being here.
00:16:54.996 - 00:16:57.620, Speaker A: And thank you, Roma, for your participation.
00:17:32.710 - 00:19:02.810, Speaker B: You want yeah, people which.
