00:00:20.120 - 00:00:33.144, Speaker A: Hello. Hello everyone. Welcome. I think we got the hottest room in the whole conference today. So thanks for being here. My name is fonting Liu. I'm a staff engineer at Coinbase.
00:00:33.144 - 00:01:18.138, Speaker A: Before I joined Coinbase, I was anonymous founder in DeFi for a few years. So I'm very excited to be here to talk about DeFi with you guys. Our chat is going to be a little bit different. So I want to zoom out of the DeFi and crypto world and explore the gap between DeFi and the real world a little. So when we look at DeFi, all the activities, or most of the activities in DeFi right now are really just within the crypto world. You trade cryptocurrency with cryptocurrency, you borrow cryptocurrency against your cryptocurrency collaterals, et cetera. So we don't have many connections to the real world meaningfully just yet.
00:01:18.138 - 00:02:01.450, Speaker A: So what do I mean by that? Let's look at a few examples. When your friends want to buy a house, they don't come to DeFi for a mortgage. When a business wants to hedge their, let's say, foreign currency exposure, they don't come to DeFi right now. But DeFi has so much to offer to the real world. So today I want to talk about how we can as builders, users, investors, to help DeFi, to prepare DeFi, to be ready for the future needs in the real life. Because right now we're actually at the first real winter of DeFi since it took off. So we're very early.
00:02:01.450 - 00:03:01.950, Speaker A: And I can't wait to see DeFi to actually provide use cases for the real world in a meaningful way. So today's agenda, we're going to talk about DeFi, just a brief introduction of DeFi, what is it and its characteristics and where we are today. And then we will go into the gaps between DeFi and the real world and what we can do to improve the ecosystem, bridge those gaps. So this is from Investopedia and essentially decentralized. Finance is a financial technology based on distributed ledgers, aka blockchains. The system removes control banks and financial institutions have over money, financial products and financial services. So as the name says, it's decentralized and it's financial, so it provides financial products for the users.
00:03:01.950 - 00:03:42.974, Speaker A: So what's so special about DeFi? I want to talk about five main characteristics of DeFi. First, decentralized. It runs on thousands and more than thousands of nodes, on Ethereum, for example, and other blockchains as well. And on DeFi, a bank would never block your transactions. It's open, everyone can access it. I know right now some of the applications are sort of doing geo censoring in the UI, but you can always interact with the smart contracts and no one's going to stop you. That as long as you have internet, it's non custodial.
00:03:42.974 - 00:04:24.040, Speaker A: So all the users own their own assets. And you can trade it whenever you like, wherever you like, without using a bank or any intermediary. Like financial institutions. It's transparent all the code, the smart contract, the core services of the DApps. Decentralized applications are live in the blockchain and you can go inspect, look at the code whenever you want. However, though this characteristic comes with side effects. There are plenty of talks today about security.
00:04:24.040 - 00:05:12.950, Speaker A: It provides transparency on one hand, but it does attract hackers, especially exploits. But we've heard about horrible stories in the past few years, how many billions of dollars lost in DeFi. But I think the advantages are outweigh the disadvantages and we'll talk about a little bit about that later. The last characteristic of DeFi is it's composable. When you think about traditional finance, you use some sort of service. Mostly the service is actually within one provider and if you need to communicate between different providers, it takes days or if not longer. Now in DeFi you can use different DApps together within seconds.
00:05:12.950 - 00:06:26.010, Speaker A: So I want to talk a little bit about the history of DFI and I want to start from the very beginning when bitcoin was invented in 2009 and then 2015 Ethereum Mainline launched. However, not until 2017 December, when make a Dow launched its first stablecoin Dai, which provided the first building block for DFI that DFI starts taking off after. So even at the time, in the end of 2017 DFI, this term was not even invented in 2008. Months later in 2018 August, a few entrepreneurs had a telegram chat and decided to came up with DFI and then people started using it and then not long later Uniswap launched and curve launch and the rest is history. So where is DeFi right now? So this is a ecosystem app from Missouri from earlier this year. I think it still captures the DeFi landscape pretty well. And they divided DeFi into four layers.
00:06:26.010 - 00:06:50.850, Speaker A: We're going to start from the bottom right to the top left. The first layer is the chain layer. The chain layer is the foundation for DeFi. It is the D of DeFi decentralized piece of the DeFi. It consists of most of blockchains, well, all the blockchains and some tooling. Sitting on top of that is the DeFi primitive layer. This is the bread and butter of DeFi.
00:06:50.850 - 00:07:46.390, Speaker A: They are the actual financial services and products that made up the phi of DeFi. Above that is the aggregation layer. They just pretty much make the primitive easier to use. For example, paraswap may make it easier for you to find the best price among different exchanges. And then on the left is the user and frontend layer and that is more of a bridge helping users to interact with blockchains and also give user a better visual representation of their positions, et cetera. Now I wanted to zoom in on the DeFi primitive layer a little bit because that is what made DeFi really a financial system. There are four main categories in the primitive layer.
00:07:46.390 - 00:08:53.642, Speaker A: I want you to help to be with me to do some imaginations DEXes today DEXes are very easy to understand. You trade cryptocurrency with other cryptocurrencies. Now what if someday imagine you could buy tokenized physical art or tokenized commercial real estate to diversify your investment. So next one is lending. Right now you lend cryptocurrency and borrow cryptocurrency. What if in the future you can open a USDC credit line with Avi against your stock portfolio or your real estate and actually in 2021 make a dow has already closed a few loans against real world assets. But again, those are very not streamlined processes and not available to most of their investors and users.
00:08:53.642 - 00:09:51.386, Speaker A: Derivatives easy. You can hedge against risks or speculate, whatever you want, but all on cryptocurrencies mostly. What if someday DeFi derivatives are a default option for businesses to come to hedge against their real world risks. Stablecoins gives people an option to hold packed assets in digital forms. So what are the gaps between the DeFi and the real world? The first one I want to talk about is the conversion between real world value and crypto value. When you think about it, to bring DeFi to the real world, we'd have to be able to use it in the real world. So we have to make DeFi being able to provide services for real world assets.
00:09:51.386 - 00:10:28.326, Speaker A: How can we do that? Well, if we can convert real world value assets and crypto value exchange easily, then we can bring DeFi to the real world. Second, we are still missing certain critical financial products and tools. And I'll go a little bit deeper on that later. The third is security and trust. Well, that one is easy. We've lost billions of dollars in DeFi since its inception. And for a normal user, I'm not talking about us as tech savvy and understand blockchain and DeFi.
00:10:28.326 - 00:11:10.006, Speaker A: I'm talking about our parents, our grandparents. How would they feel if they lost their tokenized house and exploited just like that? So I'm going to go deep into that area as well and see what we can do to help there. So first one conversion between real world value and the crypto value. So what do I mean when I say real world value, real value and crypto value? I want to give a few examples. The first is USD. We've been doing so well on this one. We have over $120,000,000,000 in USDC and USDT alone.
00:11:10.006 - 00:12:12.774, Speaker A: And it's so easy nowadays to convert between USD and USDC or USDT and same goes for many other currencies based. But when we think about it, we sort of never progressed after this. So what about real estate? What about loans? Package the loans and tokenize those loans? Well there are many companies are working on those problems, but none of them are mature enough or provided a complete solution to the problems. So I want to go through a few problems in the existing solutions. One is incomplete or simply lagging. I don't think there is any company, maybe I'm wrong, that is working on digitalizing packaged car loans, for example, or mortgage loans. And there are some solutions that achieved partial success for real estate, but it's not complete when you think about it.
00:12:12.774 - 00:13:00.534, Speaker A: You tokenize your real estate. What's next? Can you trade them? What if they are cash flow positive commercial real estate? Are there security? Is SEC going to do something? So a second problem is the onboarding process is still complicated. It's not streamlined or automated in any way and each case is very unique. However, when you think about tokenizing any assets, you can see there are custom pieces, for example your specific house where it's jurisdiction. But there are common pieces too. So we need to streamline those common pieces, automate them and then minimize the manual work that necessary and decrease user friction as much as possible. The third problem they have is for existing solutions.
00:13:00.534 - 00:13:51.100, Speaker A: They're extremely expensive or some of them some of them charges up to 10% of your asset value. Imagine you have a house worth, let's see, $500,000 and 10% of that $50,000 is just going to the agency to convert it into digital tokens. So that's insane. So what can we do for builders? I want to encourage you guys to work in the problem space and find cheap ways to convert real value to crypto value. However, make sure still be compliant with the laws. Second, all builders should work with legal partners to build complete products. As a builder myself, I'm guilty of this.
00:13:51.100 - 00:14:27.586, Speaker A: We always shy away from complicated legal problems. We try to stop there. Either stop there and getting scared and et cetera. But I think those are hard problems and problems that we have to fix. So I encourage everyone to work with the legal partners to really think about what's a complete product for whatever product you're building. The third is work with policymakers to create innovative crypto solutions. We don't have to replicate Trifi because of the DeFi and the decentralization of all the blockchains.
00:14:27.586 - 00:15:37.694, Speaker A: We can find innovative solutions ourselves. Next, what can investors do? Easy double down investments on startups that are focusing on this problem space to be able to expand DeFi into the real world. Sooner or later we are going to face the problem of converting real value and crypto value. It seems like a hard problem and people want to shy away from but we have to solve it eventually to be able to make DeFi really for the world, not just for the crypto world. Lawyers. Lawyers are always very needed in crypto space, especially in a conversion of real value and crypto value because this is a place that touches a lot of legal policies and regulatory policies we have to accept ownership of property or ownership of assets is one of the most critical rights to build a developed society. So we need lawyers to build startups, provide services for other startups to use.
00:15:37.694 - 00:16:19.260, Speaker A: One thing you could do if we have any lawyer here, you can start accepting equity as payments. I know it's risky, but it's for the greater good. The second thing lawyers can do is which a lot of companies are doing. For example, Coinbase has a dedicated policy team in legal and I'm sure a lot of other centralized companies. Ave has a team as well, working with policymakers to create policies that actually make sense for DeFi. So now let's go to the second gap missing certain critical products and tools. Well, there are many tools I'm missing, but the following two stands out.
00:16:19.260 - 00:16:56.230, Speaker A: First is press discovery and capital efficiency. A widely used order book can improve price discovery and liquidity in many ways, especially to facilitate options and derivatives trading. I know AMMS are easy and very familiar by a lot of people. But they're not for all trading. For assets like ethereum bitcoin, they have a lot of liquidity. People trade them a lot. But for a lot of other products they maybe only have a month's life.
00:16:56.230 - 00:17:47.942, Speaker A: They only last for a month. And using the AMM in this case doesn't make any sense. So I encourage all the founders, the builders, if you're building a protocol, if it has a trading feature, I know it's easy to fall back to AMMS because how easy it is to use and how familiar it is everyone is with it. But I encourage you to think about it. What is the right tool for your product? What would make more sense for your users to find the right price for whatever trading assets that you are doing? And it's a lot more capital efficient. Another product I want to stand out is insurance. This is not only for DeFi protocol insurance, and we will touch a little bit on that later, but this is also for real world insurance, like life insurance, car insurance, crop insurance.
00:17:47.942 - 00:18:42.354, Speaker A: This is a very complicated problem and the insurance word is so inefficient and has been a pain point, at least in the states for years and years. But when we think about this problem space, we need to think about it's easy because in DeFi or in crypto, code governs a lot of things, right? But code doesn't govern non binary. How can we handle non binary event? What's the claiming process like? So there are a lot of problems to think about and we definitely need to more builders into this space. So it's very easy to solve this problem. We just need to build and support protocols that are building products and tools that are missing. Now let's go to the third one security and Trust. Those are some horrifying numbers.
00:18:42.354 - 00:19:06.100, Speaker A: In 2020, more than $150,000,000 were lost. In DFI. 2021, more than $2.2 billion are lost in DFI. In 2022, only the first half of the year, we've lost $1.6 billion already. We have to do something for mainstream users to be comfortable to using DFI in their daily lives.
00:19:06.100 - 00:19:41.690, Speaker A: So what can we do. I wanted to tackle this part into two different sort of areas. One is we have to solve the root cause, make DeFi more secure. Because if DeFi is secure, we don't have all those problems anymore. And on the other part, we need to start building user trust between DeFi and the mainstream users so that they're comfortable when DeFi is ready, they're comfortable to use DeFi products. Now go to the first one. Make DeFi more secure first.
00:19:41.690 - 00:20:07.590, Speaker A: Builders are their critical component here. To make your protocol to be secure for people to use. One is first, follow standards and use battle tested composable code. Well, as programmers, we are not new to copying code. Stack overflow is our best friend. So it's the same for smart contracts. Use standardized smart contract that's out there.
00:20:07.590 - 00:20:46.530, Speaker A: And a caveat, don't try to modify if it's not absolutely necessary. We've heard so many exploits happened because someone modified something they don't understand. And then a lot of user funds are lost. Second, we need more open source projects. Open Zeppelin has been doing so good for the public and we need more open source projects. We need to build a rich database of composable code to minimize risks. When you think about it, for all the smart contracts, all the core protocols are building, there are a lot of overlaps.
00:20:46.530 - 00:21:32.314, Speaker A: If we can use the battle tested code who lasted for three years, two years, which is long in DeFi, then it would solve a lot of problems. The third is we need extensive monitoring. Not only we need to monitor our services as builders, we have to monitor our smart contracts every interaction. Who is interacting with your smart contract? You don't need to know their identity, but you need to know what the transactions are trying to do. And to caught those threads early on. For auditors, we need more product level auditing. Right now we have a lot of auditors are super busy.
00:21:32.314 - 00:22:03.702, Speaker A: We know they booked six months ahead. But not only we need code auditing to make sure the code is safe. We need people who understand the product. We need auditors, have security engineer and product managers maybe together, work together to understand the protocol first and then understand if there are any protocol level threats. The second part is build a user trust, building products. First is building products insurances. That meaningfully.
00:22:03.702 - 00:22:34.850, Speaker A: Ensure smart contract DeFi protocols. And the second one is we need big companies like Coinbase, which is already doing to present DeFi services to their users. So they're acting like a bridge between DeFi and the user for the time being. To build the trust for the users at the same time take some risks for their users. The goal for us is to bring DeFi to the whole world and everyone take a part in that. I think that's all. Thank you everyone.
00:22:34.850 - 00:22:36.740, Speaker A: We have a few minutes for Q and.
00:22:48.350 - 00:23:16.340, Speaker B: It, as far as I understand today. It's not so much the problem of the technology, but one of the issue is the recognition and enforceability in the real world of such transactions. So let's say a Token has a house and sell it. So how can the buyer then get it recognized in the real world and enforce this contract? Do you have good examples for that? Where it is working, where it's not working, what has to be done?
00:23:17.030 - 00:23:42.982, Speaker A: Yes. So that's a great question. And that's actually one of the things that I've thought about a lot, is that when you come with real estate, what we need to build is not just code. We need to build all pieces for the whole process. First we need to legalize the ownership representation of the house on the blockchain. Right. The government and the local government have to recognize the ownership.
00:23:42.982 - 00:24:24.598, Speaker A: You own the Token means you own the house. And then we need to have secure ways for users to hold those tokens. Sometimes self custody is not the best solution. Maybe an MPC wallet is more suitable. And then we need to have enforcement on the trade among those tokens enforcing that ownership is actually transferred. It's the same as a renter who refuses to leave the property. You have to have evictions, you have to have legal process in place to guarantee when the new owner who owns the property property can actually access the property the way they want.
00:24:24.598 - 00:24:38.060, Speaker A: So, yes, there are a lot of different sort of domains involved, a lot of them related to legal and to real estate expertise. But Coda is not the only piece here.
00:24:40.270 - 00:24:41.820, Speaker B: Is there another question?
00:24:47.370 - 00:25:15.614, Speaker C: Hi, felling. Thank you so much for your presentation. There is something you mentioned that we don't need to replicate ratfly but I wanted to ask you what are the things that the Web Two world has been doing that we could take some inspiration and build something not even like build from scratch, but build something on top of it to make it better in the blockchain world? Because I assume that not everything that has been done so far, it's crap, right?
00:25:15.652 - 00:25:17.600, Speaker A: So what are the things that we.
00:25:18.370 - 00:25:22.862, Speaker C: From the traditional world that we've been in, we can replicate in the blockchain?
00:25:23.006 - 00:25:58.074, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. So the service core services, I'm not talking about how they're providing the service, but the actual services themselves are the products that we're trying to build. In the DeFi ecosystem, you have banking, you have loans, those kind of things. But we don't have to build the same way they built. I mean, banking sucks. Look at Uniswap founder Hayden, his Chase Bank being closed just like out of no reason. So in DeFi, that would never happen.
00:25:58.074 - 00:26:18.260, Speaker A: Your bank would never closed. Even if the UI is shut down, you can still interact with the smart contracts. And so I think one is we need to understand what's working in DeFi. What are the services helping everyone one's day life. And then how can we create better services in DeFi for that?
00:26:19.670 - 00:26:22.100, Speaker B: Thank you. We are running out of time.
00:26:22.790 - 00:26:24.320, Speaker A: Thanks everyone. Have fun.
