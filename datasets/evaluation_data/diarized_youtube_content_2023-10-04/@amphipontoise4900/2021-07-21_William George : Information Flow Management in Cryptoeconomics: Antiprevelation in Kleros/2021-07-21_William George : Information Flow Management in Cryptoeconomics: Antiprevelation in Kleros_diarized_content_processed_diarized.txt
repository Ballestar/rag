00:00:26.570 - 00:00:34.010, Speaker A: Okay, so thanks for covering everyone. So my name is William George. I'm a mathematician, and I do research for Claros.
00:00:34.010 - 00:01:07.434, Speaker A: So Claros, if you're not familiar, is a blockchain based dispute resolution platform and today I'm going to be talking about information and the flow of information in crypto economic design and particularly motivated from our research at Claros, although I hope to hit on some more general themes. So first sort of point I want to make is that information is like fundamental in mechanism design, in the structure of trading a game. So as a way to illustrate this, there are variants of chess where you don't see the pieces of your opponent, maybe you see them if you can attack them or something.
00:01:07.434 - 00:01:27.454, Speaker A: There are a couple of different variants like this and on some level this is the same game as normal chess. You can make all the same moves, maybe you have like an arbiter that prevents you from making an illegal move. The set of all games is exactly the same, but the fact that you can't see the information is different fundamentally changes the game.
00:01:27.454 - 00:01:41.640, Speaker A: All the strategies are different, what is good play is totally different. And moreover, what you do impacts the flow of information in the game. Like you take a piece and you've revealed something about your position, like the opponent has learned something.
00:01:41.640 - 00:02:11.200, Speaker A: So as mechanism designers you want to keep in mind when you're trying to create an incentive structure to create equilibrium that are good, you obviously want to keep this in mind. And game theorists of course have studied information, perfect information games, imperfect information games, common knowledge. But for us as sort of crypto economic mechanism designers, an important lesson is how hard this is to control in a decentralized system.
00:02:11.200 - 00:02:32.520, Speaker A: In a classical world, you could have some omniscient third party that you trust have all the information and then people sit in front of their computer and they see different versions of the website from the trusted third party that give them the information they need. And it varies one person to another and the third party can sort of control what information people see. In blockchain world, not so much.
00:02:32.520 - 00:02:58.640, Speaker A: So famously in public blockchains it is quite difficult to hide transaction histories. In the biggest public blockchain the transaction network is sort of public by default and people can do transaction analysis to anonymize people. So information is sort of leaking information that maybe the mechanism diner wouldn't have wanted to be available is flowing around.
00:02:58.640 - 00:03:26.390, Speaker A: And sort of a flip side of this is like yeah, maybe you have more information than you want floating around, but you also can't count on the information to be there. So there's the data availability problem, which is a fundamental problem in crypto economic mechanism design as well, where sometimes this data can go missing. So famously a good example of this is if you're like a light client that's verifying the consensus protocol for Ethereum.
00:03:26.390 - 00:03:35.126, Speaker A: And you're going along and you're just checking block headers. And then at some point, you want to check the contents of a block and you can't find the block. And it might be because the miner never published the contents of that block.
00:03:35.126 - 00:03:45.980, Speaker A: And because you were only a light client, you just notice. Or it might just be because it just went missing. You can both have information that's too available and not available enough.
00:03:45.980 - 00:04:08.994, Speaker A: So I'm going to sort of talk about things we've thought about in terms of Claros research we've done on Claros that will hopefully have touch on some general themes. So if you're not familiar, Claros is, as I said, a dispute resolution platform. So classically, what does this look like? Well, imagine Alice is a small business owner, and she's hired Bob as a freelancer to build her website.
00:04:08.994 - 00:04:17.030, Speaker A: And she's unhappy with well, she puts the payment for Bob into an escrow. And if she's happy with Bob's work, she gets the website. She's like, this is great.
00:04:17.030 - 00:04:35.846, Speaker A: She clicks a button, and that releases money from the escrow, and it comes to Bob. If she's unhappy with Bob's work, then she clicks some other button that says, Raise a dispute. And some randomly selected pool of Claro's jurors will judge this dispute, and they'll look at the website, look at the contract between Alice and Bob, and they'll come to some kind of decision.
00:04:35.846 - 00:05:04.006, Speaker A: They'll vote, and the contract will execute and either give the money back to Alice or to Bob accordingly. And this works on a system like a principle called a shelling point. This is an idea created by Thomas Schelling, a Nobel Prize winning economist, that in the absence of communication the absence of communication, people tend to drift towards sort of focal points or ideas that seem natural, common or special or relevant to them.
00:05:04.006 - 00:05:18.438, Speaker A: So the classic example of this maybe adapted to Paris is that if you wanted to meet somebody tomorrow, you don't know when, you don't know where. You just know it's in Paris. What would you do? Well, maybe you'd go stand under the Eiffel Tower at noon.
00:05:18.438 - 00:05:29.774, Speaker A: Why the Eiffel Tower? Well, it's kind of a distinguished place. People just kind of gravitate towards that as, like, a place to know it stands out. Why noon? Well, it's a distinguished time.
00:05:29.774 - 00:05:48.398, Speaker A: And then the idea in Claros is that if you look at the case and you make your judgment about who's right and you're not communicating with the other jurors, and you think, okay, I think Alice is right in this dispute. And I think because I think Alice is right, the other jurors are more likely to think Alice is right than not. So I imagine the other jurors will probably vote for Alice.
00:05:48.398 - 00:06:02.118, Speaker A: So I'll vote for Alice, too, because I'm incentivized to try to be coherent with sort of the broad population of jurors. And you all vote for Alice and Alice wins. So this is live.
00:06:02.118 - 00:06:19.530, Speaker A: We've had hundreds of disputes on a wide variety of cases, and an important I don't want to delve too deeply into the details of Claros, but an important aspect of this for the purposes of this talk is we have an appeal mechanism. So people can appeal in some circumstances. They can say, I'm happy with this ruling.
00:06:19.530 - 00:06:40.762, Speaker A: And then you go to a bigger pool of jurors and you're incentivized to be coherent, to sort of largely agree with what the last appeal around says. So not your own round, but the people in the future in an ultimate appeal round. Okay, so I made the point that this shelling principle assumes an absence of communication.
00:06:40.762 - 00:07:06.634, Speaker A: So what happens if somebody just sort of shouts out, I'm voting for Bob, and they publish their vote and they tell everybody they're voting for Bob in advance? Even the Bob isn't the right answer, isn't the honest decision. What you want to avoid, what you wanted to design the system to be resistant to, is for the other jurors to look at that and be like, well, I think Alice is the right choice, but he's voting for Bob. That's one more vote for Bob.
00:07:06.634 - 00:07:24.706, Speaker A: And maybe that sort of moves the shelling point where maybe now Bob is a distinguished choice because nobody's shouted out that he's voting for him, and then herd behavior happens and everybody votes for Bob. This is what you want to avoid. We want to structure the flow of information.
00:07:24.706 - 00:07:47.766, Speaker A: And a common solution to problems like this in blockchain mechanism design is what's called commit and reveal, where instead of publishing your vote, you say, okay, I'm going to take a random value and I take my vote. I'm going to hash them together, and I publish that hash on the blockchain. And then later, when it comes time to a later period, like a reveal period, everybody's committed.
00:07:47.766 - 00:08:00.938, Speaker A: I will release my random value, release my vote. The smart contract can check that they hash the same thing and my votes are counted. So this way nobody sees the votes until everybody's sort of committed to their vote.
00:08:00.938 - 00:08:14.914, Speaker A: So there are a couple of problems with this, both technical and sort of cryptographic and also game theoretic that I'll hit on. And so the first one is this, like, practical. This is kind of like a mild problem, but still on like a user interface, user experience problem.
00:08:14.914 - 00:08:24.034, Speaker A: It's something to keep in mind that with commit reveal, you have this two step process. You have to commit and you also have to reveal. So you've committed to your vote.
00:08:24.034 - 00:08:40.630, Speaker A: And maybe when the reveal period comes, you're like computers off, you're on an airplane, whatever, and it comes down to reveal and you're just not there. And you get slashed because you didn't review your vote, because nobody could ever figure out what your vote was. You just committed to this hash value and only you know your vote.
00:08:40.630 - 00:08:50.030, Speaker A: In a centralized system, some omniscient party could just keep all the votes and then reveal them at the appropriate time. But that's not possible in a decentralized system. So that's unfortunate for these people.
00:08:50.030 - 00:09:10.100, Speaker A: It's not the end of the world because people are responsible for revealing the vote, but it's not great. So one way to allev user experience on this kind of thing is to have your device store your vote and then reveal it automatically at some future time so nobody knows your vote for you. But my phone is an extension of myself.
00:09:10.100 - 00:09:25.974, Speaker A: As long as my phone is on, maybe it will review my vote for me if it's still not ideal because your phone can be off, whatever. So that's like a practical problem, something to keep in mind. One way potentially to deal with this practical problem is to use something called threshold encryption.
00:09:25.974 - 00:09:53.250, Speaker A: So here the idea is that when I make my vote and I take my random value, I will encrypt them under an encryption key, a public encryption key which corresponds to a private key, which is sort of like broken into pieces using a secret sharing scheme. And then maybe the other jurors, maybe some third parties, have pieces of the key and no one can see all assemble the whole key unless they have some kind of threshold. And of M, two out of three signatures or whatever, two out of three key pieces.
00:09:53.250 - 00:10:11.830, Speaker A: But once the reveal period comes, everybody publishes the key pieces as well as their pieces of the vote, potentially. And then the key can be assembled and you can find out how everybody voted. So this is based on a paper of Peterson in the early 90s who shows how to set up a system like this without a trusted third party.
00:10:11.830 - 00:10:46.174, Speaker A: And conveniently, this is something that's being developed by another blockchain project called the Shutter Network, where they mostly view this as like a way to deal with front running and mev issues. If you're in a DeFi platform and I have a transaction I want to make and somebody front runs me instead, maybe I'll commit to my transaction, I'll commit to my place in an order book or whatever, and then later I will reveal it's the same problem, but basically in DeFi. But by having a sort of a system like this, they have some decentralized network of keykeepers.
00:10:46.174 - 00:11:00.200, Speaker A: My reveal traction can reveal itself so that no one can front run me because they haven't committed in time. So that's one way to handle this sort of problem of votes automatically revealing. But this isn't enough.
00:11:00.200 - 00:11:23.520, Speaker A: Just because you have a commit and reveal system that's easy to use, you haven't totally solved the poll problem because people also have to be incentivized to not reveal their vote. So beyond, even if you commit and reveal, the dude can still shout out that he's voting for Bob, he can still tell everybody what his vote is going to be. And if there's not a penalty for that, arguably he's incentivized to do it because people might be influenced to vote like him.
00:11:23.520 - 00:11:45.442, Speaker A: So how do you like you have this sort of two dimensional set of issues that you want to deal with, to have a good commit and reveal, to have commit and reveal that works well. You both want to have technical and cryptographic solutions to make it easy to use and viable to keep the vote secret. Similarly for TX analysis, you can have your ZK proofs and your ring signatures and your mixtures.
00:11:45.442 - 00:11:56.822, Speaker A: Here we have our commit reveal as well as our threshold encryption or whatever. But you also want to incentivize people to actually use these things. For TX analysis, if your transactions are like non private by default, that's like bad game theory.
00:11:56.822 - 00:12:15.998, Speaker A: And here, if you don't have a good solution for prerequisite attacks, people might still be incentivized to publish events. So the main defensiveness in Claros is something we call the lone voice of Reason Jackpot. So the incentive structure of Kleros is structured again so that you're incentivized to carry it with the ultimate appeal around.
00:12:15.998 - 00:12:28.834, Speaker A: And so these are jurors that might be selected in the future. You don't even know who they are yet, so on some level you can't communicate with them. The shelling point idea you can't trying to communicate with the other jurors, these people, nobody knows them.
00:12:28.834 - 00:12:54.582, Speaker A: So you're trying to be coherent with some people in the future and you think you see the dude in the middle votes for Bob is like well I think the appeal is going to vote for Alice and you vote for Alice. And if the appeal does vote for Alice, you're rewarded. And in fact you'rewarded more based on how the payouts work, the fact that that dude in the middle voted for Bob means that you get part of his lost deposit for having voted incorrectly.
00:12:54.582 - 00:13:12.222, Speaker A: So you're that much more incentivized to double down on the right answer and we can do some statistical tests. So first of all, in Kleros, because of these issues around pre revelation, we've implemented this so that commitment reveal is implemented in the contract. But it is like a parameter by court.
00:13:12.222 - 00:13:28.466, Speaker A: So caleros cases are divided into courts. In some courts this is turned on, in most it's not because we rely on this loan. Voice of Reason Jackbot so in many cases, in most cases you can see the votes coming in on Block Explorers like Claros Board which was a community created Block Explorer.
00:13:28.466 - 00:14:07.982, Speaker A: Ultimately this would have all been available on Etherscan anyway. So shout out to Koki who developed this community Block Explorer which makes equal access to these votes that someone could have gotten from Etherscan, but also gives lots of great statistics, which I will use here as I sort of analyze how people are behaving and people are responding to these incentives. So you can imagine that if people just voted in a random order, they don't look at the votes at all and they just vote in a random order, what happens? So if you have like a two to one case where there are two votes for AA and one vote for B, you can have AAB, Aba, Baa, and if the votes are really independent of what's already visible on Claro's Board, these should be equally likely.
00:14:07.982 - 00:14:31.320, Speaker A: Which means there's a one in three chance that there'll be one vote for B even after there's a majority of votes for A and you can look over all cases. In some appeal cases where there are more votes, you have more complicated combinatorial argument and we're like, okay, I have six votes, two of them are for B, one person never voted. And then I can figure out the probability that the votes were in a random order.
00:14:31.320 - 00:14:57.586, Speaker A: Everything's into people are voting independently, whatever that. What is the probability there'd be two votes for B after the majority for A, one vote for B after the majority for A, or zero votes for B after the majority of A? I can get a probability distribution per case and I can put that all together and I can get a probability distribution for the number of sort of late incoherent votes, at least incoherent with respect to a given appeal round over all cases. And we've done this and for cases 300 to the present.
00:14:57.586 - 00:15:08.390, Speaker A: So 300 was rough about a year ago and it's when Claros board was published. There were block explorers before already that used for Claros cases. But I feel this is like a good representation of sort of modern juror behavior.
00:15:08.390 - 00:15:34.426, Speaker A: And you can see that the number of expected late and coherent votes like this is a little larger than the number of actual votes, but it's not a huge difference. So we can't quite statistically, even significantly, even say based on this test that people are even looking at the votes, although they probably are, at least to some degree. It's like a Bayesian prior, there's probably some degree of looking at the votes.
00:15:34.426 - 00:15:59.730, Speaker A: But this lone voice of reason at least seems to be largely incentivizing people to not overly heard. And we can break this down into sort of sub cases where you're like, okay, people are incentivized to think about what the appeal is going to do if they expect there to be an appeal. Maybe there's like an edge case where they don't expect people to bother to appeal.
00:15:59.730 - 00:16:20.190, Speaker A: And then you can sort of break this down like how do people behave when there we don't know when they expect an appeal, but we know when there actually is an appeal which should be correlated. So we can break this down based on when there's a future appeal, when there isn't, and indeed when there's a future appeal. People as a sort of percentage have more of these late incoherent votes than when there isn't.
00:16:20.190 - 00:16:50.898, Speaker A: Although neither of these has super statistically significant results. But already this sort of information, it gives a sense that this lone voice of reason is a good but imperfect defense against pre revelation attacks. So what could you do additionally to prevent disincentivize people from pre revealing? Well, one idea is based on a blog posted by Vitalik several years ago, even pre Claros on what he called anti prerevelation games.
00:16:50.898 - 00:17:18.990, Speaker A: So here the idea is that you can bet on what other people are going to vote in a shelling game based system. And the way it's rigged, if you think that 80% of people are going to vote for Alice and you think this other person is going to vote for Bob with 90% of the time you have like an edge over the generic voting for Alice. So you gain a small amount and if you like, you know, like, you gain and your expected value is how likely someone is to do something compared to the average.
00:17:18.990 - 00:17:42.962, Speaker A: So if you just bet on people randomly, everything averages out to zero. Although you can still sort of grieve people by betting on them, by creating like variants on any given case they might win or lose, but it should average out in the long run. A similar idea that we're probably going to implement in the next version of the Claros court is like an anti prerevelation court.
00:17:42.962 - 00:18:14.910, Speaker A: So this maybe improves a bit these variants by griefing people and voting, betting on people randomly. It's also more native in Clara because we already have a court rather than having to design this extra layer game like in Vitalik system where if somebody pre reveals you can sue them and you can be like this. Person pre revealed and part of their deposit will be subject to being slashed and given to you if some Claros court rules that they misbehaved in particular by pre revealing.
00:18:14.910 - 00:18:32.034, Speaker A: And why do we need such a complicated system to determine why if people pre reveal? Well, people can pre reveal in a lot of different ways. You can imagine like a simple system where if just like people's salt is published, then you slash them. But I don't have to publish my salt, my random value in order to pre reveal.
00:18:32.034 - 00:18:42.698, Speaker A: Maybe I have a ZK proof that says I own a salt that says I vote a certain way. Or maybe I have some elaborate smart contract that says, okay, if I don't vote for Alice, I'm going to slash myself. Or maybe I can do both.
00:18:42.698 - 00:19:00.430, Speaker A: Or maybe I have something even weirder. And ultimately, it's hard for a smart contract to look at this diversity of attacks and slash people appropriately. What you need is subjective human being judgment to be able to look at that and be like okay, you came up with an elaborate attack but ultimately you're pre revealing.
00:19:00.430 - 00:19:24.170, Speaker A: And this kind of subjective judgment is exactly what Claros is capable of doing. So that gives sort of a sense of how we view this problem, what we're going to do in the future. So just to summarize, information is fundamental, the mechanism designed, and it's particularly challenging in crypto economics because we don't have trusted third parties to just manage information flow.
00:19:24.170 - 00:19:52.240, Speaker A: And then for Claro specifically, you want to avoid hard behavior, you want to have disincentivized pre revelation and incentivize keeping votes hidden. And this involves like a sort of mix of practical cryptographic and game theoretic issues that require as diversified a response. Willing to open up the floor to questions if we have time.
00:20:09.850 - 00:20:14.730, Speaker B: Well, congratulations for the talk, William. And when can we see some of this implemented into the close protocol?
00:20:15.310 - 00:20:31.760, Speaker A: Soon. So we've finished the sort of like research for the next version of the crowds court, the version two of the court, and we're writing the specs now and coding should begin imminently, so hopefully in months later this year.
00:20:33.090 - 00:21:04.738, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm actually the one usually giving the microphone. I was just curious, just in the same way that Paris makes it really good to meet at the Eiffel Tower, this does sort of have an effect on precedent because there's not a reveal, but nonetheless, people would have a sense of what the precedent is. I just was curious on your thoughts will have the effect of maintaining and actually accelerating that precedent, but is not really effective at changing precedent and moving in a different direction if that's a more justice oriented outcome.
00:21:04.738 - 00:21:10.282, Speaker C: So just curious on your thought and how you might use these models to sort of overcome that justice issue.
00:21:10.416 - 00:21:47.830, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's another element of the information that's flowing around if there's precedent from previous rulings. So a priori unless you have some fairly complicated system where rulings stay hidden, which even that's hard to enforce because parties can always just reveal them, that is also information that's flowing around. So people sometimes ask us, in fact, there was a question in a talk earlier today, is Claros it's a justice protocol? How do you feel about common law versus civil law? What is the role of precedent in your system? And my view is that precedent has sort of an inevitable role in the shelling game system, that people will look at the previous cases and they're trying to be coherent with how the current jurors are going to decide.
00:21:47.830 - 00:22:06.438, Speaker A: So ultimately they're going to gain insights from previous cases and they're going to be influenced by those. And if you feel the previous cases are just like in a common law system and if you feel that the previous cases are doing poorly, the jurors are given sets of policies to read. Depends on the arbitrable app that's asking for the ruling.
00:22:06.438 - 00:22:20.030, Speaker A: Alice and Bob's freelancer dispute. Alice and Bob had a contract that the jurors see and consider when they're making their ruling. Other applications we have curated lists that are plugged into Claros, have some kind of policy for what things should be on the list.
00:22:20.030 - 00:22:36.120, Speaker A: And if the presidents are producing bad rulings, then the sort of natural thing to do is similar to what you do in Commonwealth legal systems when the judges are creating bad president based rulings is you legislate, you amend the policy, and you change sort of what jurors are supposed to think about.
00:22:36.570 - 00:22:37.320, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:22:41.130 - 00:22:51.290, Speaker D: Will there be a special pool, I mean, a special court for the people who are saying, this guy has revealed some stuff?
00:22:51.440 - 00:23:16.506, Speaker A: Yeah. So we anticipate having a special court for sort of general juror misbehavior, which includes being able, like, cases where people are accused of prerevealing, where they'll be judged for having violated their policy on not prerevealing their vote when they commit and reveal their vote. This could also potentially be used for other like, to slash them for other sort of juror misbehavior when they violate sort of the policies of what it means to be a juror.
00:23:16.506 - 00:23:23.720, Speaker A: There's evidence that they clued it. That could also be in the policies. But, yeah, there'll be a new court for this.
00:23:26.730 - 00:23:39.020, Speaker D: How will you avoid a majority of bad people being pulled off this court and saying, no, my friend didn't preview this information?
00:23:39.390 - 00:23:48.346, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, the cases are always appealable. You can appeal more to larger and larger pools of jurors. Eventually you appeal out of that court, to the general court.
00:23:48.346 - 00:24:03.780, Speaker A: And that kind of attack would only really be successful if it was able to command, like, a 51% attack system, a majority of the system that was willing to make this sort of incorrect ruling. Because it's like any other 51% of that kind of chorus question. Maybe.
00:24:07.590 - 00:24:20.358, Speaker B: Just a comment, if you want. In my country, if you say for who you vote, that's a crime. I don't know if in other places, but that's just a comment, I guess, for a reason similar to this, right?
00:24:20.444 - 00:24:53.790, Speaker A: Yeah. And here, once you have the sort of anti prevalence court, it's a crime in the sense that you can be slashed limited to the fact that your vote has to stay hidden during the commit period because jurors are given incentives, like rewarded, penalized based on how they vote. Ultimately, after the case, if you see the flow of money going to people based on their rewards, then you can't keep it hidden indefinitely, but you can at least keep it hidden as long as you need to to prevent influencing other people's votes.
