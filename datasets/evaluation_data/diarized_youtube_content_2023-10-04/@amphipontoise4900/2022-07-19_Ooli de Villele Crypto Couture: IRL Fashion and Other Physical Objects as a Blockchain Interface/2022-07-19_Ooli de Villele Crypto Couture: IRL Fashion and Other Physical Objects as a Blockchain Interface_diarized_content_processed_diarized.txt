00:00:00.730 - 00:00:12.990, Speaker A: Thanks for coming. I'm Uli Shannon de Ville, and I'm a Web three fashion designer. I don't make clothes for the Metaverse, but I make garments with a sewing machine that I then put on chain.
00:00:12.990 - 00:00:32.434, Speaker A: That's just my side hustle. My day job is actually building a technology that puts all kinds of physical goods on chain. But today we're going to talk about fashion because I believe that it's a really powerful communications interface that can help all of our products become adopted.
00:00:32.434 - 00:00:49.750, Speaker A: And so I'm going to try to tell this in a three part story titled fashioning the Revolution with Crypto Couture for Collective Action. It's a lot of words. So part one before we start, I think we first need to acknowledge that Web Three blockchain struggles with adoption.
00:00:49.750 - 00:01:14.386, Speaker A: I think if we left this building and went outside and asked just any random person on the street, they would be challenged to actually define what a blockchain is. I think NFTs are still confusing to people, let alone the value of them. And even worse, I think that there's still a lot of distrust and fear in the technology and I think that this is because the media is controlling the narrative right now.
00:01:14.386 - 00:01:36.602, Speaker A: And I think that we need to take back the narrative by maybe not talking about what our products do, but instead talking about why we're building them. I think it's a better way to connect with others who don't understand the technology right now. So I'm going to connect these dots by taking us on a tour right now.
00:01:36.602 - 00:02:00.178, Speaker A: It's 1964 and we're in Washington DC, the capital of America, of the United States, and we're waiting with 250,000 other people for Martin Luther King Jr. To give what would become his famous I Have a Dream speech. I want us just to look at this photo and notice two things.
00:02:00.178 - 00:02:15.702, Speaker A: Just how many people are there? How did they all arrive at this time on this date? Nobody sent out invitations. This was before Twitter, this was before Telegram. So how did everyone know to show up? That's question number one.
00:02:15.702 - 00:02:45.230, Speaker A: Question number two is why did people show up? Many of the people in this photo, they took a bus in very hot weather, much like we have today, UNAIR conditioned bus, uncomfortable, and rode this bus for miles and miles across kilometers, kilometers across large American states. And some of the people in this photo even hitchhiked, risking their safety. So why did they do that? Well, we might think it's because they went to see Dr.
00:02:45.230 - 00:03:10.166, Speaker A: King speak, but no one knew that this was going to become his famous I Have a Dream speech and they also could have listened to it on the radio. So the reason why I think they showed up and this was really the brilliance of Dr. King, it's because he knew that to sell his product, which his product was actually the Civil Rights reform, civil Rights Act.
00:03:10.166 - 00:03:26.234, Speaker A: To sell, that he didn't need to talk about what it would do for people. He needed to talk about why it mattered to him. And by talking about why it mattered to him, then others could connect with that why, and they could realize that that's their dreams, that they shared those dreams.
00:03:26.234 - 00:03:28.474, Speaker A: He said, I believe. I believe. I dream.
00:03:28.474 - 00:03:33.374, Speaker A: I have a dream. He didn't say, I have a plan or I have a roadmap. That's how politicians talk.
00:03:33.374 - 00:04:00.050, Speaker A: He said, I have a dream. And so I think that this is important for us, because right now, in the space that we're all in, the reason why we're all here, I would say that we're probably all the innovators here building this space, the early majority, late majority, that represents the mainstream, where we see mainstream adoption. And at the end, the laggards are the people who will only adopt a new technology if the old one is discontinued.
00:04:00.050 - 00:04:14.074, Speaker A: So you notice there's a break. This is a very famous graph by Everett Rogers, but that graph is sometimes referred to as the chasm. And the question is, how does that chasm get crossed? And I believe it's, of course, the early adopters.
00:04:14.074 - 00:04:35.122, Speaker A: The early adopters are all of your users who will put up with downtime, who will put up with your kind of janky featureless app in the early days. And the reason they do that is because they care about why you make it. They care about the vision and the future that you're building.
00:04:35.122 - 00:04:47.400, Speaker A: It's the mainstream that actually cares about what you're making. But really, the early adopters to cross the chasm, they care about why you make it. And so communicating the why to them is really important.
00:04:47.400 - 00:05:06.826, Speaker A: So, in summary, to increase adoption, we need to talk about the why we're building, not what we're building. Part two of our story. So if we agree that there's an adoption problem and we agree that talking about why can help solve it, then there's a question of how do we communicate the why? And of course we can use Twitter.
00:05:06.826 - 00:05:14.510, Speaker A: Of course we can make videos. Of course we can use the about page on our websites. But I want to propose something maybe a little bit different.
00:05:14.510 - 00:05:19.118, Speaker A: And this is where the fashion comes in. So to do that, I'm going to take us back to Dr. King.
00:05:19.118 - 00:05:30.182, Speaker A: And this time in the photo, notice what everyone is wearing. It's a hot summer day in August, and they're wearing suits, tailored suits. In America, we call it Sunday's best.
00:05:30.182 - 00:05:37.186, Speaker A: Their church clothes. Why are they wearing these? You might think because people are making speeches. We need to look formal.
00:05:37.186 - 00:05:52.102, Speaker A: But in fact, in every rally, every protest, tailored suits were worn every day. This is Rosa Parks on a bus wearing a tailored jacket. And the message that this delivered was, I deserve dignity.
00:05:52.102 - 00:06:03.770, Speaker A: I deserve respect. And true, Rosa Parks could have put this on a sign and held it up at a protest. But maybe just by wearing the clothes she was wearing, that demanded dignity and respect.
00:06:03.770 - 00:06:20.790, Speaker A: It's more subtle, but maybe it's more of a powerful way to communicate. And it's not just tailored suits, but denim was also a big part of the civil rights reform. Denim was to say, Remember plantations? This is what we wore as slaves in plantations.
00:06:20.790 - 00:06:34.182, Speaker A: And of course, the Black Panthers leather jackets. Berets the message here was, we're ready to fight. And when you walk into a room and you see someone else wearing a leather jacket and a beret, you know that you're part of the same tribe.
00:06:34.182 - 00:06:41.470, Speaker A: You know that you're both ready to fight. And this isn't just civil rights in America. This is the Zapatistas from Mexico.
00:06:41.470 - 00:06:56.450, Speaker A: Indigenous clothing with balaclavas. Balaclavas, because the leader, Marco, believed anyone could be the leader, so everyone would wear a balaclava and everyone could be the voice of this movement. It was about shared values.
00:06:56.450 - 00:07:12.070, Speaker A: And, of course, Pussy Riot. Very influenced by the Zapatistas. This is a riot or sorry, a march in Chile about for sexual assault, safety for women, of course, anonymous.
00:07:12.070 - 00:07:20.914, Speaker A: And the vagina hats from the women's March in the US. And this isn't a new phenomenon. It's not recent.
00:07:20.914 - 00:07:31.274, Speaker A: This is from the 18 hundreds. Leisancroyales this is a French movement wearing the most outrageous outfits. They openly rebelled against the social norms and rules established by the French Republic.
00:07:31.274 - 00:07:39.854, Speaker A: So this has been going on for a long time. Fashion has been used to express values, to express the why. Of course.
00:07:39.854 - 00:07:43.962, Speaker A: Black Lives Matter. Trayvon Martin. And here back to France.
00:07:43.962 - 00:07:56.434, Speaker A: De Gin and I live in France. I live about 2 hours from here. And I bought a car last year, and when I opened up the trunk and I found my yellow vest, I actually understood what this movement meant without being a part of it.
00:07:56.434 - 00:08:07.754, Speaker A: It's like, oh, I have access to a yellow vest. This, what they're fighting for, could affect me and I can be a part of it. So I believe that to increase adoption, we need to meet people where they're at.
00:08:07.754 - 00:08:26.830, Speaker A: We need to find familiar things, everyday things, because wallets exchanges are not familiar. Self sovereignty, these concepts, transparency, they're not familiar. So to help others connect to these concepts, we need to talk about them and why we care about them and then connect it to something that's recognizable.
00:08:26.830 - 00:08:39.454, Speaker A: So this is some of my own work as a fashion designer. This is a collection called for the Daughters of the Witches. You didn't burn the video won't play, but basically it's a garment.
00:08:39.454 - 00:09:00.518, Speaker A: When you scan the tag, it plays a really cute AR video and then it validates the authenticity with an NFT. This is another example. And what I was interested in was, what does it look like if we're not using everyday clothes, but if we intentionally design clothes for these movements to express our values.
00:09:00.518 - 00:09:21.040, Speaker A: So when the US Space Force launched this uniform, I made this counteruniform to represent space peace. Maybe I can play these videos, actually. So here's the garment and then here's the sorry, the AR.
00:09:21.040 - 00:09:35.780, Speaker A: So they just have a little piece of delight on them. So I like to call this is what I call fashioning the Revolution. I think that fashion is a really subtle yet powerful tool to express why we're doing things.
00:09:35.780 - 00:09:50.390, Speaker A: So, part three. Now that we've talked about the why, let's talk about the what. What are you building? How do you talk about what you're building? And how do you decide what to build? So we'll return one last time to Dr.
00:09:50.390 - 00:10:07.614, Speaker A: King, and this time, talk about his speech. So we know it as the I Have a Dream speech, but in fact, it used to be called its first title was Normalcy Never Again. And it's because his speech writers thought that I Have a Dream was too trite, it was too obvious.
00:10:07.614 - 00:10:27.880, Speaker A: And the whole first half of the speech, if you read it, it uses these terms like promissory note, bad check, insufficient funds, banks. And this is because the Civil Rights Act was very much about equal opportunity employment and you need a job. So the first half of the speech was about communicating needs.
00:10:27.880 - 00:10:34.322, Speaker A: But there was a moment where Dr. King went rogue. He put down a speech.
00:10:34.322 - 00:10:47.430, Speaker A: There was a gospel singer who said, tell us your dream. And I'm imagining this. I like to think that the night before this is true statement, actually, the night before, he met with this gentleman.
00:10:47.430 - 00:10:58.190, Speaker A: He's a 15 year old kid, Robert Avery, who was brutally beaten by the police with a cattle prod in Alabama. And he hitchhiked to get to the Dr. King rally.
00:10:58.190 - 00:11:21.990, Speaker A: And Dr. King sat down with him and talked to him for 20 minutes. And he didn't ask him, what do you need? He asked him, what are your dreams? What do you dream of? And so that's when he put down his prescripted speech and made what became his very famous I have a Dream speech, and I use that as an example to talk about when we design products.
00:11:21.990 - 00:11:53.474, Speaker A: I think the world of product design kind of started with designing for the needs of technology, but then user centered design taught us, no, we should actually be designing for the needs of users, not the technology. But what I want to challenge here is that user centered design assumes that users are rational and users tell you what they actually need. When I think in reality, we should be asking, what do you want? Not what do you need? What do you want? What do you desire? And that's what Dr.
00:11:53.474 - 00:12:01.762, Speaker A: King did with his speech. You need a paycheck, but you want equality. You want these other more conceptual things.
00:12:01.762 - 00:12:26.102, Speaker A: So maybe you need a wallet, but you need a wallet, but maybe you actually want and desire and care about self sovereign identity and owning your own data and concepts like this. And just to give a couple more examples so maybe we need to vote on proposals quickly in our Dow. But what I want is maybe to grow my social influence in the Dow.
00:12:26.102 - 00:12:52.670, Speaker A: So then maybe that helps us reprioritize the features that we build, from easy voting to social tokens for rewarding, for participation. Or if you ask a user, maybe these kind of old school car companies, if they ask users, what do you need in a car? They might say, I need a more fuel efficient engine. But if you ask them what they want, they might say, I want to look like a boss when I arrive places.
00:12:52.670 - 00:13:08.354, Speaker A: And Uber was created, you arrive in a black car. And so I think using I want has the power to reprioritize features, but also potentially even create new industries. And here's just a couple of examples.
00:13:08.354 - 00:13:18.794, Speaker A: So I know a man, he's 60 years old. He doesn't know anything about NFTs or blockchain, but he knows a lot about wine. And so I made this little thing up for him.
00:13:18.794 - 00:13:28.270, Speaker A: When he corks the wine, he gets to see this little animation and it mints an NFT. And now fast forward, he has a wallet. His friends have wallets.
00:13:28.270 - 00:13:53.858, Speaker A: They all want corks with little characters on them. And so I think it's a really interesting way of meeting him where he's at to help him sign up for a wallet and begin his journey in this space. And then just another example, teenage girl, for her birthday, I bought her a compact, a makeup compact, and made this animation.
00:13:53.858 - 00:14:03.562, Speaker A: And same thing, when you open it and scan it, it mints the NFT. And suddenly she's flexing. In high school, she's like the most popular kid in her school.
00:14:03.562 - 00:14:19.514, Speaker A: And they all want NFTs, and they've signed up for wallets and they're researching. And she went on YouTube and learned how to do this by herself, how to set up a wallet. So I think just inspiring users by meeting them where they're at is a way that we can increase adoption.
00:14:19.514 - 00:14:32.354, Speaker A: So design around desires, not needs. And just in summary, remembering the way Dr. King conducted and delivered his speech, number one, we should communicate the why.
00:14:32.354 - 00:14:46.726, Speaker A: Two, we should meet users where they're at. And I believe that building on ramps to all of our products using IRL physical things is a way to do that and design around desires. And thank you.
00:14:46.726 - 00:14:51.260, Speaker A: That's the end. I would just say make fashion, make the physical a part of your tech stack. Thank you.
00:14:51.260 - 00:15:06.142, Speaker A: Someone has a question. I have one. Thank you.
00:15:06.142 - 00:15:31.142, Speaker A: So in web three, what do you propose or what you believe in? Well, I think it's a really powerful technology. I mean, Blockchain, NFTs, I think they're really powerful and they represent a lot of the values that I care about things like decentralization and self sovereign identities and transparency. I believe in these things.
00:15:31.142 - 00:16:03.580, Speaker A: So I think for me, as a fashion designer, it's my way to contribute to this world. And I think anyone who is building a product just imagine kind of what could be the very front end of that stack and can it be just the everyday objects that we have in our world? Could that be like the very first touch point of your product? Thank you. Thank you very much.
