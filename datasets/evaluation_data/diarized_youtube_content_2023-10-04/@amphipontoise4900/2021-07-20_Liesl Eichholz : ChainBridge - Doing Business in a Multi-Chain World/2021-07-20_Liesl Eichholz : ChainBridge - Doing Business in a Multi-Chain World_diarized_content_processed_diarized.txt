00:00:38.484 - 00:00:47.750, Speaker A: Cheers, everyone, for coming along. I know there's only a few of us, so we can make this a little bit more of a conversation. Feel free to jump in with any questions or anything that you have along the way.
00:00:47.750 - 00:01:04.170, Speaker A: My name is Liesel Let. You go back and I'm going to tell you a little bit about chainbridge and what we're doing with this as a product and what it means to be doing business in a multi chain world and what it's going to do for the ecosystem. So.
