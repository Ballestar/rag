00:00:18.020 - 00:00:25.160, Speaker A: All right, let's go. So thank you everyone for coming. So my name is Guillaume and I'm with Reflexor Labs.
00:00:25.160 - 00:00:54.636, Speaker A: And today I'm going to speak about what happens when Console theory meets crypto economics. At Reflex Lab, we are building a new kind of stable coins that involve console theory. So control theory is a widely known engineering field where it's about algorithmic control of dynamic systems and pretty much basically like the science of stability.
00:00:54.636 - 00:01:06.664, Speaker A: So it's pretty good thing when you want to build a stable coin. So console theory is everywhere. It's in probably all over this room.
00:01:06.664 - 00:01:29.116, Speaker A: There are plenty of control theory systems from heating systems or like power supplies. And you have those controllers everywhere, also in industrial system and so on and so on. And the one typical example you have is when you are in your shower and you want a certain temperature in your shower.
00:01:29.116 - 00:01:46.692, Speaker A: So you turn the knob back and forth until you reach the desired temperature. So the most elementary building blocks in Console theory are PID controllers. If you studied engineering, you probably heard a lot about them.
00:01:46.692 - 00:02:12.400, Speaker A: And a PID controller takes an input and outputs a control variable to control your system. So it works by having three constants set, three terms, proportional, integral and derivative. Proportional just a constant that multiply the input and gets the output integral accumulate the error over time.
00:02:12.400 - 00:02:25.568, Speaker A: So like if you are off your target for a longer period of time, it will accumulate and output a stronger signal. And last is the derivative. It's based on the rate of change of the error.
00:02:25.568 - 00:02:49.788, Speaker A: And this allows you to address things like to anticipate the state of your system and to address overshooting and things like that. This is a very simple example of what a PID controller does. This is just a stick that mounts it on a motor that tries to point to 45 degrees always.
00:02:49.788 - 00:03:11.680, Speaker A: And you have a PID controller that control this motor to get back to 45 degrees. And then someone comes with stick and perturbate the things. And after sometimes it gets back to its targeted state and it converges fast to it.
00:03:11.680 - 00:03:53.280, Speaker A: And the key to tune the pad controller is setting the three variables that I've talked to you in the previous slides. Okay? So before we move on to crypto stuff, I wanted to point out this academic paper shows that central bank policy actually could be implemented or are paid control. And for example, policies with the Taylor rule, which express the Fed funding rates regarding to the GDP growth, I think, and the rate of inflation.
00:03:53.280 - 00:04:10.740, Speaker A: And this can be expressed as PID control. And the same goes on for many of the most well known and used in practice policy rules used by central bankers. So at Reflexolab, we are building rye.
00:04:10.740 - 00:04:29.630, Speaker A: Rye started out as a fork of MakerDAO's MCD, which is dai that probably most of you know. And there is one very key important difference is that it has no fixed peg to $1. So it's free floating and the peg is moving around.
00:04:29.630 - 00:04:52.560, Speaker A: And the key to that is an algorithmic interest rate set by a PID controller and the last important thing to note is that it's ether only collateral. So how that works, I want to define three things first, so the redemption price, the redemption rate and the redemption rate feedback mechanism. So the redemption rate is the moving peg.
00:04:52.560 - 00:05:22.332, Speaker A: Instead, like makers are always $1, we have something that moves around and it's supposed to be the price at which rye trades on the market but it's also the price at which you will mint rye. So there is also CDPs or Vault or we call them safe. And the redemption price is the price at which you mint rye and it started as an arbitrary value.
00:05:22.332 - 00:05:33.810, Speaker A: So when we launched it, we chose Pi. So 314, 16 something and the next term I want to define is the redemption rate. So the redemption rate is the rate of change of the redemption price.
00:05:33.810 - 00:05:53.844, Speaker A: It can be seen as an interest rate for example if the redemption rate is -10% that means that the redemption price will go down 10% over a year. And last is the redemption rate feedback mechanism. It's this system with the PID controller that set the redemption rate.
00:05:53.844 - 00:06:10.216, Speaker A: So like the PID controller sets the redemption rate which change the redemption price. So how does that work? Quickly. So, on the top left we have the market price in green and the redemption price in blue.
00:06:10.216 - 00:06:42.932, Speaker A: So the PID controller sees the market, so the market is an AMM on uniswap and it sees the error. So for example the Red Arrow, the current rye price is above the redemption price and the PhD controller does his math and sets the redemption rate. And for example here the redemption rate will be -11% that means that the peg will go down 11% over a year and then that way the redemption price goes down.
00:06:42.932 - 00:07:09.528, Speaker A: And ideally it is expected that this change in Peg will affect the market which will drive down the price of rye. So, what are the effects of a moving Peg or changing this redemption price? From the perspective of rye holder, it's pretty obvious. Like if the redemption price the peg goes down, you are entitled to sell or you would like to sell because you're losing money.
00:07:09.528 - 00:07:29.110, Speaker A: And if the peg goes up, you can buy and take advantage of this thing and make money. Like from the safe owner perspective, it's a bit more complicated. Like when the redemption price goes down, that means that their C ratio, their collateralization ratio is going up.
00:07:29.110 - 00:07:49.488, Speaker A: So they can mint more rye without taking more risk of getting liquidated, and therefore they can mint some more rye. And this will likely put some pressure, price pressure and drive the price of rye down. And the opposite.
00:07:49.488 - 00:08:11.330, Speaker A: Now when the redemption price goes up, it's bad for Safe Holder, kind of because their C ratio goes down and they are at a greater risk of getting liquidated. So they need to buy rye from the market and to repay a part of their debt to avoid liquidation. So, since they are buying from the market, this will likely push the price up.
00:08:11.330 - 00:08:40.250, Speaker A: So there are, of course, other mechanism that regulate the price of rye. One is just arbitrage people buying low, selling high, which is the main driver of the price on a daily basis. And the redemption rate mechanism that we just discussed is more on long term thing so people can take advantage of the redemption price either.
00:08:40.250 - 00:09:00.450, Speaker A: When it's positive, you just all dry and you can earn the interest rate. And when it's negative, you can just open it safe and your debt will melt according to the redemption rate. So we launched Rye in February 2021.
00:09:00.450 - 00:09:33.356, Speaker A: At its peak we saw 369,000,000 in value lock so Ether locked into the system and more than 2000 users positions like those CDPs and currently like what we're seeing is that the price of rye Fluctuates around 2% Of The Redemption Price. And now it has settled down. The redemption rate is below 10% annual, and so far we've seen about 10 million.
00:09:33.356 - 00:09:45.004, Speaker A: 11 Million. Now I believe in liquidated collateral. This Is The price chart of it since it started.
00:09:45.004 - 00:10:04.290, Speaker A: We can see that at the beginning it was pretty volatile, and we also fine tuned the controller since then. But the price was a lot above the redemption price, which is in. Red the redemption price in red, and it drove the redemption price down.
00:10:04.290 - 00:10:37.710, Speaker A: And nowadays, we are more stable. And if we zoom in so this is the last two months, we can see that currently the redemption price is the market price sorry, in purple, is a bit below the redemption price, and that's why we see a slight uptrend in the red curve. So, yeah, the redemption price move fairly slowly and predictably, and the price volatility so far is good.
00:10:37.710 - 00:11:52.580, Speaker A: This is the redemption rate since the beginning we've seen so, like, as I mentioned before, the market is a bit below, so the rate is positive, as we can see on the right side. And at the beginning we had a lot of volatility and very high rates, but nowadays it's like maybe two 3% in a redemption rate. So a question I get a lot is like, what's the long term outlook of the redemption price? Right? Like where will it be in one year, five years, 100 years? Because that's something I care about if I want to store value in rye, right? And the very key factor to that is basically if there are any large and sustained imbalances between supply and demand for rye and the thing to keep in mind is that it's going to move slowly, right? First it's bounded so the redemption price, the peg is not going to be super volatile, it's going to be something in the lines that we just saw in the previous charts.
00:11:52.580 - 00:12:41.620, Speaker A: So why are we doing all this and what's the point? And it's nice but why? So the things to understand is that with this kind of synthetic derivative asset like rye or Dai, you want to match supply and demand and what are those? Supply is basically the right minters. So people looking in ether to draw some ride debt and the demand which are basically the rye holders, like how much people are willing to hold rye or how much utility there is for rye so that people buy it. So what drive the supply? The supply pretty much depends on the appetite for leverage in the market.
00:12:41.620 - 00:13:01.244, Speaker A: So there are other reasons to mint rye but this is the main one. People that mint rye are pretty much long ETH and they take a loan against this ether to do something else with it. Questions? Sure.
00:13:01.244 - 00:13:02.780, Speaker A: Yeah. I can repeat.
00:13:07.360 - 00:13:08.824, Speaker B: The rye withdrawals.
00:13:08.952 - 00:13:09.484, Speaker A: Sure.
00:13:09.602 - 00:13:21.724, Speaker B: I was just curious on the demand, why it's listed as the holders, why is it not the converse like rye withdrawers? Because in the supply it's people who are coming into the system. Normally the demand is a complete opposite of supply.
00:13:21.772 - 00:13:46.170, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, yeah, good point. I mean it could be flipped but yeah, from the perspective of the rise supply, I don't know, there is demand but yeah, you're saying that there could be like demand for leverage and I don't know, I guess it's just a naming thing like sorry, it's unconventional. Yeah.
00:13:46.170 - 00:14:02.652, Speaker A: And the demands for rye just depends upon the utility of stablecoins. And what we observe is that these two things are unfortunately fairly independent or if not inversely correlated. Right.
00:14:02.652 - 00:14:20.948, Speaker A: Because of the nature of the crypto market, when you have a lot of leverage into the system and people want to go long ETH, they don't want to hold onto stablecoins. And when you have the beer market, people want to hold onto stablecoin, they don't want to leverage. So it's not exactly true.
00:14:20.948 - 00:14:51.452, Speaker A: In practice we see that they are fairly independent mechanism that depends on different things but this give a rough idea and the key is that they are independent. So what's the solution? The solution is to balance market forces and that's exactly what the redemption rate is trying to do. One note, if you're a trader you certainly know that longs pay shorts or short pays longs with those derivatives and this is exactly what the redemption rate is doing.
00:14:51.452 - 00:15:28.756, Speaker A: So when the redemption rate is positive, CDP holders pay rye holders and when the rate is negative, like rye holders effectively pay CDP owners. So I want to talk about maker a little bit. So this chart, you've probably seen it elsewhere, is like the share of Dai that are backed by different collateral type and the big one here is USDC, which right now sits at about 60% of the die in circulation.
00:15:28.756 - 00:15:51.692, Speaker A: And it used to not always be the case. So this chart is like what's the share of USDC that backs die? And right now we are sitting at 60%. It all started with black Thursday in March 2020 when we had this big market crash.
00:15:51.692 - 00:16:24.188, Speaker A: And to solve some issue regarding to the peg like maker introduced, the first USDC collateral took off for the first time. More recently, like in May this year, the USDC backing die went all the way from 25% to 60% in a very short period of time. And this is due to the huge market crash we've seen in May when ether went from.
00:16:24.188 - 00:16:52.512, Speaker A: What is important to see here to understand here is that this shows what I was pointing out before, that when the leverage into the system into the market goes away and that there is not enough people to go leverage long ETH then there is not enough dye into circulation. So this has to be replaced by something else. And in the case of maker, what is replacing that is USDC.
00:16:52.512 - 00:17:16.236, Speaker A: It's more USDC collateral into the system. The last thing that we could wonder is what is this huge spike in around October 2020? So at the time make your problem with the peg. Dai was consistently trading above the peg and to fix that they introduced, I mean they lowered the culturalization ratio for USDC vaults from under 20% to 101%.
00:17:16.236 - 00:17:56.552, Speaker A: And that worked, that brought back the price of die to one. But it had the consequence of driving a lot big influx of USDC into the system. So last, why would I want to hold a coin that is supposed to be stable but not to $1 when what I want is one dollars? Yeah, it's maybe true, but I think it's pretty much impossible to do without introducing custodial risk into the system.
00:17:56.552 - 00:18:30.230, Speaker A: And that's like the trade off that maker made a very hard peg over introducing custodian collateral. So like flexible pegs allows you to effectively balance market forces and to have synthetic ass ri that is effectively only backed by east and still managed to stabilize itself. Yeah, so it's question microphone coming.
00:18:32.920 - 00:18:36.228, Speaker C: Could you elaborate on the custodial risk that Dai has?
00:18:36.394 - 00:19:04.712, Speaker A: Yeah, USDC is a centralized stablecoin run by one single company and this exposes maker to a third party risk, which is this bank account that is holding the coin. And this ultimately rely at the end of the day that on whether circle will always be willing to die not USDC.
00:19:04.776 - 00:19:07.772, Speaker C: Sorry, I mean die not USDC because there's no bank account with die.
00:19:07.836 - 00:19:20.544, Speaker A: Yeah, but what that means is that if your one die is backed by 60% of USDC sorry. Yes. Is that if USDC turns out to be worth zero, your die is turned out to be worth much less.
00:19:20.582 - 00:19:22.912, Speaker C: What about single collateral die when it was just backed by ETH.
00:19:22.976 - 00:19:42.316, Speaker A: So single collateral die was just backed by ETH. And in fact, what we're trying to do is much closer to what was PSI single collateral. Yeah, but the thing that we see it worked at the time for sometimes pretty well.
00:19:42.316 - 00:19:57.310, Speaker A: It was more volatile, but it was also more early. But yeah. How would that work at scale if it would have all the peg for so long and across all the market cycle? I'm not so sure.
00:19:59.520 - 00:20:06.332, Speaker C: Just the custodial risk you referred to is things like USDC backing Dai exactly. Doesn't apply if it's just single collateral backed by ETH.
00:20:06.396 - 00:20:14.500, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. So that's the trade off you make that they made it's like they introduce collateral that is subject to counterparty risk.
00:20:14.500 - 00:20:26.680, Speaker A: All right, so that's it for my talk. And yeah, if you have questions, feel free to check out our discord documentation.
00:20:39.520 - 00:20:52.720, Speaker D: Do you have an idea where demand for which people are currently holding Rye? Because if you're getting like 2% interest essentially on it, that's not a lot for stablecoins. So which entities are holding this?
00:20:52.870 - 00:21:08.980, Speaker A: I mean, obviously Rye is new and it's fair to where is the demand coming from for this thing? Right. It's all network effect. Right now there is a liquidity mining program and people are mostly farming.
00:21:08.980 - 00:21:11.928, Speaker A: That's where it comes from. Mostly for now.
00:21:12.014 - 00:21:12.696, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:12.878 - 00:21:25.976, Speaker A: But yeah, the idea is to transition to some more organic usage over time. So yeah, like Rye is on a bunch of lending platforms and it's being integrated here and there and yeah, slowly.
00:21:26.008 - 00:21:31.196, Speaker D: Growing, I guess for most, like stable coins that are new, it's the same.
00:21:31.218 - 00:21:32.428, Speaker A: Problem for every new.
00:21:32.514 - 00:21:34.812, Speaker D: They all have just demand because they have yield farms currently.
00:21:34.946 - 00:21:35.630, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:21:36.820 - 00:21:46.668, Speaker D: And I guess it's also like the biggest advantage of maker is that Dai is just integrated and actually used. But obviously you need something like this to get to a stage where it's used.
00:21:46.774 - 00:22:07.530, Speaker A: So what's interesting about Dai is that it's the most commonly asset used in DeFi very often, like when it comes to all this DeFi protocol, they choose Dai first. So there is a lot of demand for Dai coming from there and that's what is causing issue to maker to all the peg. Like all this craze in DeFi summer and so on.
00:22:07.530 - 00:22:12.280, Speaker A: And that's why they double down on USDC as collateral.
00:22:13.100 - 00:22:16.604, Speaker D: I guess the only thing they could really do, I think, unless they would just lose pack.
00:22:16.802 - 00:22:24.720, Speaker A: Yeah, otherwise you need a way to get some more dye into circulation. Otherwise you can't handle growth.
00:22:28.500 - 00:22:40.368, Speaker D: I think it's pronounced Faye or something like the stablecoin. That one is like $1 fixed, but I think it has a different mechanism to ensure it doesn't go over peg.
00:22:40.464 - 00:23:22.400, Speaker A: Fay, it's kind of like a bank or, I don't know, hedge fund if you want. So that has Easter collateral that back Faye and they committed to you can always redeem your faith or one dollars worth at collateral and we will always be doing that. But yeah, it's a very different model because they own all I mean the Dow or I don't know exactly what the stricter is there has all of the collateral and yeah, it's to be seen over time if they will be able to maintain to have as much collateral as there is fake into circulation.
00:23:22.400 - 00:23:36.576, Speaker A: Because since people can always redeem it, it can be that people just redeem at the bottom of its price always and that treasury goes down. But yeah, it's also an interesting experiment.
00:23:36.688 - 00:23:47.720, Speaker D: But then if demand for phase very high actually goes over packed do they then just mint pay and just use it to buy eat collateralize?
00:23:48.380 - 00:23:50.216, Speaker A: That's what they should do.
00:23:50.318 - 00:23:58.764, Speaker D: The same as Ride would do it in ride it's like other users will do this opening a CPD and the protocol does it themselves.
00:23:58.962 - 00:23:59.710, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:01.760 - 00:24:02.750, Speaker D: Oh sorry.
00:24:04.320 - 00:24:23.284, Speaker A: You're saying when the price of Faye goes above the Faye protocol is selling out Faye for ETH and there is more ETH into the system. But same what if people are minting a lot of Faye at the market top and then market goes down and people redeem it can lose money.
00:24:23.322 - 00:24:30.280, Speaker D: No, for sure. I'm not saying that it's better. I just like wondering if this is how it works where as you said, they do it themselves.
00:24:30.280 - 00:24:32.840, Speaker D: Essentially they'll try to maintain a peg themselves.
00:24:32.990 - 00:24:33.690, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:34.060 - 00:24:35.016, Speaker D: Okay cool.
00:24:35.118 - 00:24:47.772, Speaker A: So they are the ultimate guarantee or they guarantee the peg. Yeah, however they do it to smart contract or governance proposal or whatever. Yeah.
00:24:47.826 - 00:24:49.630, Speaker D: Okay. Interesting. Thank you.
00:24:50.160 - 00:24:50.910, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:24:55.440 - 00:25:07.808, Speaker E: Yeah. Okay, this is a really dumb question because I'm not really into stablecoins but I keep seeing on Twitter people are part of Homies the 3.3. They're also a stable coin.
00:25:07.808 - 00:25:08.290, Speaker E: Right. Do you mind?
