00:00:15.770 - 00:00:28.614, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for joining me today, this afternoon. Okay, so I just want to show our hands who is here is in charge of their teams or projects, finances, operations lead.
00:00:28.614 - 00:00:32.726, Speaker A: That's why you're here today. So I just have a rightful idea of my audience. Okay.
00:00:32.726 - 00:00:45.734, Speaker A: Or sometimes maybe you're the project lead, I think. Okay, so my name is sharon, and I mean, I kind of kept it simple by just saying FinOps financial ops. And I'm from a company I started, one called headquarters shorthq XYZ.
00:00:45.734 - 00:01:01.440, Speaker A: We basically specialize in, I would say bookkeeping and reconciliation because finance back office, we all know there's just so many things to do right there's payroll and et cetera. So for us, actually, I want to talk a lot more about the reporting and accounting space that is for today. Okay.
00:01:01.440 - 00:01:20.610, Speaker A: So, yeah, the usual legal disclaimer, definitely engage your own tax advisor for your own projects. We all know that crypto is entering a new trying to be funny by a new level of financial accountability given what has happened last year. Infamous headlines.
00:01:20.610 - 00:01:56.682, Speaker A: We all know, and unfortunately, I think good and bad, but I think for all of us remaining and building in a scene this year, regulatory scrutiny or maybe for some of you, your private investors have perhaps asked you some questions related to more financial reporting. So the reason why I started headquarters is because back in singapore, singapore is definitely the hub for asia's crypto scene. I've been in that scene for a couple of years now and was right smack at the center of leading a fiat on off ramp network as well as a stablecoin in singapore currency in pretty much the peak of all the regulatory scrutiny as well.
00:01:56.682 - 00:02:24.438, Speaker A: So that's where I realized that a lot of the smaller teams or middle sized teams are struggling. Definitely the expectations now that we have. Okay, so I think for those that raised your hands every day, your daily job is perhaps tasks related to hey, at any point in time, do you have accurate oversight around your team's treasury? Is it convenient enough, though, because no one has time, so much time, at least at the start to really go down to the details.
00:02:24.438 - 00:02:45.770, Speaker A: But yet, you know, you have to. And the last tree is really given the market climate these days, all of us are having really big spotlights on us on all fronts, whether it's secure do you have best practices around your controls as well as compliance? So this is a snapshot of a recent article that a 16 z just did. It's not unique to crypto.
00:02:45.770 - 00:02:58.438, Speaker A: It's really just as a finance stack, what is it that many finance managers have to care? So I thought we kind of have a very great summary. So I kind of snapshot it and put it here. So we just go from the bottom to up.
00:02:58.438 - 00:03:20.970, Speaker A: We all know that crypto is great for transactions there's software or block explorers like Etherscan that really helps, you know whether something is settled. But here's the but right, this just knowing whether the transaction has settled, it doesn't really give you any context in the business ledger sense. So that's where I know the job of anyone here who's in a finance role, you always have to translate that into actual context.
00:03:20.970 - 00:03:42.610, Speaker A: Another thing is especially for more of you if now, given what's happening, not everyone even in crypto has their treasury in pure digital assets. I think fiat is definitely making a strong comeback. So there is also, unfortunately now no longer one dashboard for Fiat as well because I think a lot of portfolio trackers out there for crypto is largely around just pure digital assets.
00:03:42.610 - 00:04:17.486, Speaker A: Okay, so again, rising of many, many different wallets that have arise from your EOAS all the way to different Mltsing and one custodial. So depending on your nature as much, sometimes we like to own our own keys for legal reasons, perhaps on the jurisdictions you are at, we are sometimes kind of soft, forced to go down the track of custodians as well. So how are you going to reconcile that when it's not all completely on chain? Yes, and increasingly later I will give you a little bit of snapshot what's happening around the world.
00:04:17.486 - 00:04:48.200, Speaker A: The reason why we have many wallets is because we are really now being forced to segregate our user funds and our funds so that the infamous commingling doesn't really happen. Okay, so this is a quick snapshot for anyone who is really day in Dell for a special number of years, who is responsible for accounting crypto. This might be just a bit of a basic primer guide for you, but for those who are new to this, feel free to hit me up after this because these are some best basic things that you should be aware of.
00:04:48.200 - 00:05:04.860, Speaker A: One thing I've noticed about a lot of our users as well, they tend to only think about all this at least a year after they have gone live. But then it's kind of I won't say it's too late, but just that you'll be drowning in a mountain of transactions. So it's one of those the earlier that you start, the better.
00:05:04.860 - 00:05:20.158, Speaker A: We all know, for example, I'll just pick one of them. The challenges that we have primarily is that everyone knows that crypto is still evolving. Different DeFi concepts are happening, different types of NFT models are happening, or the obligations under NFT is also changing.
00:05:20.158 - 00:05:45.542, Speaker A: So what that means is that the business activity is definitely never the same. So that makes it very hard actually, even for yourself, or if you even engage an external bookkeeper, it's pretty challenging on them as okay, so I'll just give a little bit of example. So I think for most, if there's anyone here that has their project registered in the States, you're probably susceptible to the gap standards or otherwise.
00:05:45.542 - 00:06:06.994, Speaker A: For most of us outside of the states, I think it's IFRS whether you're in Europe or even Asia where I'm from, we kind of fall under debt standards. So this is definitely not exhaustive, but just a very quick guide. End of the day business is know run a project even in let's say you're in the process of going down a dow track no matter what.
00:06:06.994 - 00:06:46.286, Speaker A: I think a lot of us, we are running somewhat of a business, so we do have to recognize what's the context of the transaction, right? And for that, the recognition or in accounting speak, accounting treatment most of the time is still treated as intangible assets, some say even stable coins depending on your jurisdiction. They will also treat it as that rather than cash as well. Okay, so this is really going down to the details related to the accounting itself, right? So end of day, like what I said, always go down to what exactly the transaction is for.
00:06:46.286 - 00:07:04.210, Speaker A: So this is a bit of just a snapshot of our platform just to gather all of us as well. So you can see that, for example, a transfer, that's on chain, right? At the last point when you go to Ether scan, it's one transaction hash. But definitely when you look into it, there's always bundled transactions that you need to account for.
00:07:04.210 - 00:07:17.110, Speaker A: So that's the challenges. Even though everything is on chain and transparent for you. Have you done things manually? Your accountant or bookkeeper will probably need to break it up manually, right? So they have to file two journal entries basically.
00:07:17.110 - 00:07:27.222, Speaker A: So the gas fees is one and the actual transaction as well. Okay. The next one is actually once you actually identify the context.
00:07:27.222 - 00:07:49.518, Speaker A: So this is just a very quick feel free to take a photo if you want, but these are just very common crypto transactions on the left. How do you really categorize it? So this is a very basic way of categorizing it, but this is highly encouraged. Usually if you're using an everyday accounting software like QuickBooks Online Xero, there's this thing called Chart of accounts.
00:07:49.518 - 00:08:02.802, Speaker A: So treat that as a source of truth. Honestly, from a data system perspective, no point having two standards if you're already using that. Just use that standards and bring it in, right? And it's just about mapping it conveniently.
00:08:02.802 - 00:08:17.542, Speaker A: So maybe for some reason platform fee, just tag it automatically to the chart of account of Expense, for example. Okay, the next one, cost basis. So it's quite infamous.
00:08:17.542 - 00:08:31.678, Speaker A: Again, if done manually, it's very tedious. So it also depends on the jurisdictions and what you decide to pick. For example, you'll notice that the last two, last in, first out, highest in, first out.
00:08:31.678 - 00:09:04.442, Speaker A: This tool depends on jurisdiction for most places, for example, is not encouraged, right? But whereas first in, first out and weighted average tends to be the norm that I've noticed in the industry. So all these slides are actually public, so feel free to take a snapshot and stuff. Lastly, I think when it comes to price data, it's always if one day, should you be audited or maybe at bare minimum, your own internal team wants to really know, hey, where do you get this market price from? Exactly? What is it? Right, it's very simple.
00:09:04.442 - 00:09:23.866, Speaker A: Just make sure that you do keep track where all your prices are from. Even, for example, if you use Etherscan or like Block Explorer, just dig around, right? Just try to find out how exactly do they have that price. Because years later, should your project succeed, someone might come knocking on your door and it's just good to have those information on hand immediately.
00:09:23.866 - 00:09:31.998, Speaker A: Right? So that's one. So data source. Second one is maybe for example, you always trade a token at a specific trading venue.
00:09:31.998 - 00:09:50.482, Speaker A: Should you really take the market rate or should you just rely on that trading venue where you always tend to take the prices from? I think that the latter is obvious one. So just be very mindful about exactly which price are transacting it and reflect it as such. Okay, so this is just me being a little bit cheeky.
00:09:50.482 - 00:10:01.002, Speaker A: So end of day, we all know that everything when it comes to on chain transactions are on chain. It's transparent. Whether it's for payments, whether it's for loans, whether it's for other products as well.
00:10:01.002 - 00:10:15.054, Speaker A: That's the beauty, right? The transaction happens openly for everyone to see. But unfortunately, end of the day, whatever we end up having to report isn't just something that's on chain. If the team is all native in crypto, that's great.
00:10:15.054 - 00:10:24.770, Speaker A: But sometimes the world hasn't caught up yet. So we have to translate to something that they can actually prove that we're responsible as well. So the three financial statements essentially.
00:10:24.770 - 00:10:43.174, Speaker A: Okay, so I'll just share a little bit of snapshot while I know coming to before this week, what's happening in the whole world, right? So fastb. They have been having a very long report that they kind of published back in March. So this is definitely just the title headline.
00:10:43.174 - 00:10:49.286, Speaker A: Go back. If you're on a role that really needs to know this, you should read it. It is important, especially at the gap.
00:10:49.286 - 00:11:03.618, Speaker A: And yeah, I think the big change that we have kind of noticed is that previously crypto is treated as an indefinite leave intangible asset. Now there's a bit more refinement around that. I was saying it hasn't changed drastically, but it's a bit more refined now.
00:11:03.618 - 00:11:14.290, Speaker A: So, for example, it's about asking you to measure it at fair value, which is a bit subjective sometimes. So you have to also back it up. Okay.
00:11:14.290 - 00:11:19.058, Speaker A: Over Asia, things got exciting. We just googled. Japan.
00:11:19.058 - 00:11:21.110, Speaker A: Hong Kong. Korea. Singapore.
00:11:21.110 - 00:11:35.494, Speaker A: It's very interesting. But just in the month of May and June, a lot of regulatory details came up. Call for proposals from the industry or proposed regulations from the government itself has really all been released.
00:11:35.494 - 00:11:51.738, Speaker A: Very funnily, or coincidentally I would say, in the past two months. So Asia, I think, definitely has a race amongst the regulations of how can we give clear regulations so that cities can start attracting, I think, crypto projects in. So that's kind of the trend that's happening in Asia.
00:11:51.738 - 00:12:00.286, Speaker A: If anyone is know again, just feel free to grab me later and talk. So, high level Japan. Japan interestingly.
00:12:00.286 - 00:12:25.590, Speaker A: At least anecdotally what I've personally noticed is that the NFT market has still been quite rampant there, even largely not just the small creators, but even the large enterprise like Sega and stuff. So I think the government has been quite proactive to at least give clarity to everyone in this segment. You can see that they have kind of tried a balance of being kind of not too stringent, but yet being responsible.
00:12:25.590 - 00:12:46.366, Speaker A: Right? So the not too stringent part, for example, is if a token is not yet realized. So if there's some sort of unrealized gains at a point of financial year, you won't have capital tax yet. Second one, however, if you're an NFT creator and you have sold NFT now, they definitely have classified it to be clearer that you have to charge consumption tax.
00:12:46.366 - 00:12:58.806, Speaker A: So these are very clear things for the industry, I would say big and small, to grow. Next for South Korea. South Korea, unfortunately, we all know, has been quite hit quite badly last year with all the shenanigans in the DeFi market.
00:12:58.806 - 00:13:10.022, Speaker A: So the government has definitely hit hard. Coming next year, they are going to come out with a new User Protection act that hasn't really quite been announced for the past few years. Okay.
00:13:10.022 - 00:13:33.390, Speaker A: And there's a lot of when it comes to centralized exchanges, very firm ask of segregation of customer funds and operational funds. You actually see that similarity back in Singapore, my hometown, where we have a couple of centralized exchanges registered in Singapore as well. So again, the ask is to have customer assets separated from operating funds.
00:13:33.390 - 00:13:47.430, Speaker A: Sounds obvious, but at least now it's on paper for everyone to really follow explicitly. Okay? So, yeah, all this has been published online. These are really just basic points of what's happening back home in Asia.
00:13:47.430 - 00:14:15.610, Speaker A: Okay, so to just give you an overview, definitely I'm not alone. Whatever I'm showing right now is a new age of tools to kind of just service this industry as we go through this kind of stringent time where we have really been scrutinized quite strongly. So it's quite crazy for someone who's building a DeFi project here, a protocol to also care about this in the back office, in everything manually is too much, I would say, for a team to handle.
00:14:15.610 - 00:14:39.782, Speaker A: So definitely the generations of tools like me have emerged where the goal is typically to have one dashboard bring in all your wallets centralize or not, working towards even fiat to bring that in as well so they can help. You have just one place to know your transactions, but in a bookkeeping fashion, not just a blockchain ledger fashion. Okay, so just the wallets are here, very similar to portfolio trackers, I would say.
00:14:39.782 - 00:14:51.830, Speaker A: But I think the main thing that differentiates us is the next step. It's how do we automate all your realized gains and loss based on the parameters that you give us. Of course, a tool is not an accountant.
00:14:51.830 - 00:15:05.614, Speaker A: It's for you to set your parameters, your standards and then we just run through it, right? Yeah, so that's what we do. Okay, that's about it. Just feel free to scan if you actually need any help on that back office front.
00:15:05.614 - 00:15:15.220, Speaker A: Otherwise I think we have some time. So maybe you can just take a couple of questions. Okay, yeah, okay.
00:15:17.110 - 00:15:26.466, Speaker B: Just curious, the logical buyer of this is a corporation or could it also be a Dow?
00:15:26.578 - 00:15:42.234, Speaker A: Good question. My observation is that corporations, let's say you're a normal consumer brand, that sometimes you might have a bit of digital assets. Chances are their transactions are not as high, so they probably would still get by with a manual system.
00:15:42.234 - 00:15:48.406, Speaker A: So it's actually more the latter. When someone is a native crypto project, we have seen higher demands. Interestingly.
00:15:48.406 - 00:16:00.350, Speaker A: I think those that haven't chosen to not go down that whole public token sale, they actually do have a lot of private investors. So the ask for management reporting has kind of emerged behind the scenes. So it's definitely more crypto native projects.
00:16:00.350 - 00:16:02.302, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, what's your question?
00:16:02.356 - 00:16:10.898, Speaker B: Yeah, so yeah, obviously this is going to be for crypto native projects, but within this crypto native projects, there are companies.
00:16:11.064 - 00:16:11.826, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:12.008 - 00:16:27.074, Speaker B: And corporations and then there are Dows, Convex, there are maker. Those are not companies, those are projects.
00:16:27.122 - 00:16:36.394, Speaker A: Got it. Definitely stronger demand on the first one. Yeah, so those that have definitely onshore, we have NFT creators actually they are created onshore, unlike the DeFi community.
00:16:36.394 - 00:16:49.070, Speaker A: So that's a very clear segment under the DAOs. Interestingly. Actually it's a mixed bag, but I'll say majority there's a minor sum of them that they do have corporate entities to run the whole Dao foundation system.
00:16:49.070 - 00:16:54.020, Speaker A: Those yes as well. Yeah, even though they are marketed as Dows. Yeah.
00:16:54.020 - 00:16:56.580, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:59.190 - 00:17:15.314, Speaker C: Thank you for your presentation. So I have a question about the market data that you mentioned. So there is the part where you want to recognize the taxes and transactions, but there's also the part where you want to calculate the net asset values on your balance sheet.
00:17:15.314 - 00:17:29.766, Speaker C: So two questions there. One, what time of the day do you calculate those prices? And second, what price sources have you seen to be recognized as serious by authorities to do those calculations?
00:17:29.878 - 00:17:35.870, Speaker A: Okay, good question. The first one the norm that I've seen. So as a system we actually do allow teams to set it.
00:17:35.870 - 00:17:41.950, Speaker A: But I think the common setting that we have seen it's day and closing. Yeah. So that's what we have seen.
00:17:41.950 - 00:17:56.462, Speaker A: So let me just go back to that. Yeah, so that's what we have seen in terms of credible data sources for price feed. Actually, they're hearing I know it's generic for me to say this, but it really depends on the client.
00:17:56.462 - 00:18:15.002, Speaker A: So if it's very clear that the client has been trading on a primary trading venue, they will ask for proof. Actually, it gets down to the details. If it comes from an actual auditor, they will track all the transactions on that trading venue and the transacted price.
00:18:15.002 - 00:18:25.258, Speaker A: Yeah. So, thankfully, I think whether it's Texas, whether it's Dexas, they all have a trading price, executed price. So usually those that get audited tend to go down to that granularity.
00:18:25.258 - 00:18:41.650, Speaker A: Otherwise, usually for management reporting the common data aggregators like CoinGecko coinmarketcat, that tends to be sufficient with end of day closing to be the most common one. But to go down all the way to the auditing stage, usually that's a bit more detailed.
00:18:44.720 - 00:18:53.276, Speaker D: Hi Malisha. Here from Streamflow. We help teams with payroll, actually real time payroll and talk investing.
00:18:53.276 - 00:19:03.328, Speaker D: And I'm curious, do you have some sort of integration or this is like full blown product or you also offer some APIs that we can integrate?
00:19:03.424 - 00:19:13.704, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. APIs is something upon request because we always realize that we are still at a stage of not creating every endpoint yet. So yeah, but definitely that's fine.
00:19:13.704 - 00:19:30.996, Speaker A: To kind of pose your question back, payments is something that we have realized captures the context of the transaction. Whether there's an invoice or, like you say, token vesting, there's a context and that's needed for bookkeeping. So for us, the stand just be cheeky.
00:19:30.996 - 00:19:41.250, Speaker A: There's a reason why our company is called headquarters, because actually we believe in working with other payment providers, basically like Streamflow to bring you guys in. Yeah. Or vice versa is fine.
00:19:41.250 - 00:19:51.610, Speaker A: Okay, there's no further questions. That is it. And thanks, everyone for hearing, listening to me.
