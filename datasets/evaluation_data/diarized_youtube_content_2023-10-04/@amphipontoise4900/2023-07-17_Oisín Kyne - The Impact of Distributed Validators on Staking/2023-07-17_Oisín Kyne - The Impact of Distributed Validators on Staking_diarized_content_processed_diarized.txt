00:00:16.410 - 00:00:23.642, Speaker A: Salute. Salute moi. Jamapel oshin parlay the validator.
00:00:23.642 - 00:00:30.758, Speaker A: The subway. After six years of learning French, I felt obliged to at least say hello in French. Nice to meet you all.
00:00:30.758 - 00:00:40.090, Speaker A: My name is Ushin. I'm CTO and co founder at Oball Labs. And today we're going to be talking about the impacts of Distributed Validators on staking.
00:00:40.090 - 00:00:58.430, Speaker A: But before I get into Distributed Validators, I wanted to ask a few questions about solo staking. Hands up who thinks solo staking is easy today? No hands at all? Hands up who thinks it should be easy in future. Nice.
00:00:58.430 - 00:01:08.690, Speaker A: Sweet. So yeah, that's where I'm going to start and talk about some of the reasons that solo staking is not currently easy. There's quite a number of them.
00:01:08.690 - 00:01:32.886, Speaker A: One of the main ones is it's prohibitive on a cost perspective unless you're into ethereum for a long time, or getting involved in a liquid staking pool. There's other things, like being on call 24 7365 is a massive drag on solo stakers, more or less without fail, every time I leave the country, my node will die. And even just trying to wake up in the middle of the night and stuff, or being a one man band.
00:01:32.886 - 00:01:43.422, Speaker A: Keeping a solo stake online is not fun. There are other complexities, like having internet bandwidth. Not everyone has unlimited data.
00:01:43.422 - 00:02:03.042, Speaker A: I have burned through all of my fair use bandwidth in the internet and gotten throttled before hardware regularly dies. Most solo stakers don't keep a full, ready to go second machine, and the meme I have here caught me this week. My Nethermind fully filled up my disk and I was like, cool, I can prune it.
00:02:03.042 - 00:02:13.270, Speaker A: And then it was like, no, you need 200 gigs of free disk to prune. So I was kind of completely screwed and just had to kill the machine and was offline for 2020. 4 hours till I resync a node.
00:02:13.270 - 00:02:32.070, Speaker A: Keeping up versions, that's also important, but even just generally, it's quite technical to get a node set up, and even more technical to kind of keep it high uptime, auto restart, self healing. Particularly people sometimes try and run keys in two places and get slashed. Please don't do that.
00:02:32.070 - 00:02:55.490, Speaker A: But generally, solo staking right now isn't as easy as it could be and I'm hoping that Distributed Validators will change that. However, before I talk a bit about Distributed Validators, I wanted to briefly kind of tell you a bit about how I kind of got here. I joined Consensus in 2018, and around DevCon Four, I had kind of started to appreciate how much energy was being used by proof of work.
00:02:55.490 - 00:03:14.282, Speaker A: And I was like, oh, what are we going to do about it? And the Serenity design came out, which was the original ETH proof of stake design. And that had a 1500 ether minimum and slashing, it wasn't clear, but it was pretty obvious you could lose all of that if you got slashed. Or it was still being worked out.
00:03:14.282 - 00:03:30.494, Speaker A: And at the time, 1500 ETH was like half a million dollars. And with the risk of losing it all, I wrote this article saying, I don't know about you guys, but most rational people will outsource this. If it's like a half million dollar risk that it's not your core business, you're not going to do it.
00:03:30.494 - 00:03:43.822, Speaker A: And my big fear was that sooner or later there would be 90% of stake running on a small handful of providers. That was kind of my fear up until about a year later. At DevCon.
00:03:43.822 - 00:03:55.670, Speaker A: Five. These two gentlemen, doncrad and Carl from the Ethereum Foundation. Over that year, Ethereum decided to move to the BLS signature scheme for ETH Two.
00:03:55.670 - 00:04:15.630, Speaker A: And what that allowed is mainly it allowed the stake to come down to 32 Ether. But what the EF researchers were also aware of is you could do signature addition or signature aggregation with BLS, which was not something you could do with the previous elliptic curve. And this allowed them to give this talk on what they call trustless validation.
00:04:15.630 - 00:04:32.130, Speaker A: I have moved away from calling it trustless validation because there's still plenty of trust involved in staking of all types, and now we call it distributed Validators. But this idea kind of gave me a bit of hope that this might make a bit of sense. So fast forward to kind of today.
00:04:32.130 - 00:04:58.298, Speaker A: Where are we at now? So I've been worrying about proof of stake since 2018, and trust with Validators as a community was established after DevCon Five. And Oval is a project, we've been on the go since early 2021. We did our first testnet in early 2022 around DevConnect, and we've been running on main net with one Validator since the end of 2022.
00:04:58.298 - 00:05:12.318, Speaker A: Recently this year, we ran our second public testnet for BIA. I think some of you that took part are in the crowd, and we've recently announced our alpha mainnet phase. So capped at one Validator risk it if you have the means.
00:05:12.318 - 00:05:21.250, Speaker A: And we're now kind of looking at like beta, where we kind of take off that one Validator cap and we say, okay, this is getting a bit more stable. Let's give it a try. Let's kind of take the numbers up a bit.
00:05:21.250 - 00:05:41.020, Speaker A: And you might recognize Vitalik's roadmap slides. Vitalik has had distributed Validators on them since day one, and he now has them close to being fully ready to go, which is quite cool to hear. And yeah, one of my questions now know, did my fears of centralization come true? Oh, okay.
00:05:41.020 - 00:05:58.618, Speaker A: On Google Slides, I skipped some of these, but alas, so, so far it's not at the point where all nodes are. It's not at the point where we have three nodes running it. This is what we currently look at of breakdown by market share, we have 54% across five entities.
00:05:58.618 - 00:06:20.834, Speaker A: I think this is if you count Lido as its own one and then even in the staking types we have LSPs make up a very large amount. Solo stakers according to rated is around six and a half percent, which we're hoping we can kind of do better about. So yeah, apologies, I'm going to skip a couple of these slides that I had on to be disappeared.
00:06:20.834 - 00:06:44.982, Speaker A: But how do we improve staking like solo staking and its decentralization? For me, we're starting to use the word squad staking a lot. Bankless and David Hoffman came up with a good meme and we're trying to kind of spread it more widely and get more people running in squads as opposed to solo staking on their own. So what are DVS and how do they make solo staking more accessible? A distributed validator.
00:06:44.982 - 00:06:54.318, Speaker A: The easiest way to think of it is like a multisig. Most people in this room I assume, know what a multisig is. Particularly it's usually one with more than two thirds need to sign something.
00:06:54.318 - 00:07:18.418, Speaker A: And what's novel here is you do not need all of the nodes online all at once. This is something that will allow people to run at home with fault tolerance, have machines die, but still have hopefully three nines of uptime. What sort of thing advantages does this present? This allows people to have high uptime and high effectiveness regularly.
00:07:18.418 - 00:07:47.354, Speaker A: Solo stakers don't have super good effectiveness because they keep their peers kind of small and that can impact their inclusion distance and sometimes raise the chance of missing attestations and even worse missing proposals when you have multiple nodes that all broadcasted at the same time. So far the data is showing us that the inclusion distance regularly works out very favorably and that you have a better chance of actually getting included when you're running in a DV than running on your own. It also massively reduces the maintenance pain.
00:07:47.354 - 00:07:54.018, Speaker A: I kind of gave you my example of my node dying. I was running a solo validator on that. It was off for 24 hours.
00:07:54.018 - 00:08:12.442, Speaker A: The DV was not. It just stayed online and then coming on to the kind of the liquid staking protocol side of things. Liquid staking protocols would really love to have lots of solo stakers and to have like a really diversified operator set.
00:08:12.442 - 00:08:43.442, Speaker A: But so far you have to give your entire stake to one operator and they can kind of go offline, they can kind of withhold, there's quite a lot of risk and trust. So a lot of the liquid staking protocols either stay with curated operators and only pick people with kind of cash flow name recognition, are likely to be around for a long time or they have very high collateral requirements and that's their kind of other workaround. However, with distributed validators and you not being like a total person running the validator, you're just like one piece.
00:08:43.442 - 00:09:18.618, Speaker A: You can then instead have a lower risk of taking in like a solo stake or to take people into running a cluster and you can also split the collateral requirements or even just kind of reduce them more generally because any one machine going offline shouldn't be too fatal. So is this all theory yet, or where are we at in terms of seeing this being adopted and seeing the impact of Distributed Validators on the stake? The first one I want to talk about is Operation Solostaker. So Operation Solo Staker is an initiative by Etherfi, Dapnode, AVADO and Obal.
00:09:18.618 - 00:09:33.202, Speaker A: And the idea is to get more solo stakers taking part in LSPs. So, so far I think we've shipped about twelve machines to people and there's about 100 more on the way if you have interest. I think they are open up sign ups again.
00:09:33.202 - 00:09:54.170, Speaker A: There's an event on on Wednesday to go chat about it. But the idea being that Solo stakers are going to run Distributed Validators in groups and Etherfi will use them as their node operators. And the goal is to kind of push the limits of decentralization and have a much more diversified operator set than some of the existing LSPs.
00:09:54.170 - 00:10:15.390, Speaker A: In a similar manner, Lido have also been working on bringing solar stakers into their operator set. They've recently upgraded to version two, which introduces the idea of modules. And these modules intend to have kind of different purposes and pretty high up the list is having a Distributed Validator module that brings in Solo Stakers.
00:10:15.390 - 00:10:45.130, Speaker A: Over the long run, the goal is to have permissionless bonded access to the Lido operator pool. But before then, what I alluded to about mixing professionals and amateurs in a Distributed Validator is kind of what they're looking at first and recently we finished the second testnet with them in this regard. We had 41 home stakers or Solo stakers or like new Entrants, which is more than 100% of the existing Lido operator set.
00:10:45.130 - 00:11:01.374, Speaker A: They were partnered up with twelve of the professionals to run ten clusters, I believe, and they ran for about 60 days. And the performance was NetNet indistinguishable from kind of some of the best operators on Gurley. And yeah, so far so good.
00:11:01.374 - 00:11:27.350, Speaker A: We're now kind of in talks about planning how we put this on main net and how we kind of start to actually bring solo stakers into Lido. And then another example we had recently of Distributed Validators keeping things online in about a month or two ago now there was Ethereum loss finality. There was an issue with kind of really old messages screwing up with some of the clients that kind of caused them to lag horribly and miss their slots.
00:11:27.350 - 00:11:38.458, Speaker A: At the time we had a small number of Mainnet Validators on and none of them missed their attestations. Granted we had a bit of kind of an overrepresentation of lighthouse. If lighthouse had an issue, it probably wouldn't have been as well.
00:11:38.458 - 00:11:51.630, Speaker A: But the idea of being able to hedge your client risk in a DV was at least somewhat shown. There and I'm hoping that we'll get more of these data points the more there are kind of bumps along the road. Hopefully no bump too serious.
00:11:51.630 - 00:12:12.146, Speaker A: So one of the other things I wanted to talk about is what are we doing to harden DVS? Get them all ready. I mentioned that we're in Alpha, so what's the kind of like the security of this? Like I'm happy to announce that we've recently finished our first audit with Sigma Prime of the Karon code base. It'll be published recently.
00:12:12.146 - 00:12:19.590, Speaker A: I think there's a QR code there for you guys if you want to investigate it early. It'll be going out in the blogs fairly soon. Very happy with how that went.
00:12:19.590 - 00:12:27.062, Speaker A: It, I think, uncovered two critical five highs or three highs. It's the five highs. And yeah, that's all been merged.
00:12:27.062 - 00:12:36.480, Speaker A: All of the changes are out in our current V 16 release. We just haven't published it yet. And as well as that, we also have quite a number of other security related initiatives going on.
00:12:36.480 - 00:12:54.302, Speaker A: One of the things we've done is a review of our software development lifecycle with the Ethereal Ventures team. The software development lifecycle and also the employee OpSec is ones that I spend quite a lot of time on. A lot of people kind of really focus on finding bugs in clients.
00:12:54.302 - 00:13:15.706, Speaker A: But the vast majority of the hacks these days are compromising some DevOps who has access to keys or getting into the supply chain that way. So we do a lot of time bolting things down, making sure that there's not a lot of harm that can come to it. There's an interesting blog on our side around our architecture where Karon does not actually have access to the private keys once you're up and running.
00:13:15.706 - 00:13:27.594, Speaker A: So even worst case scenario, our software is entirely compromised. You should end up with a liveness risk, not a safety risk, because we shouldn't have access to the private keys. The other things we're doing are solidity.
00:13:27.594 - 00:13:38.578, Speaker A: Audits should be announced shortly. If there are any auditors in the room that want to come chase me, please do. And we're also pen testing our launchpad, which some of you may be familiar with.
00:13:38.578 - 00:13:54.450, Speaker A: This is the UI where people kind of create their distributed validators. So this is how we're hardening them. And the other thing I want to talk a little bit about is how do they change the economics of staking? So title of this talk is the Impact of DVS on Staking.
00:13:54.450 - 00:14:09.222, Speaker A: And this is in the Blockchain economics track. And one of the things that we spent a lot of time on and before I would have started Obel, I would have worked for Block Demon building their E Two stack. So I'm kind of very conscious of the cost of running staking.
00:14:09.222 - 00:14:26.190, Speaker A: It's not as cheap as you might think, especially for the solo stakers. And if you're not at kind of huge scales so what we've done recently is we worked with the Meaga Labs team. We went out onto the internet and bought a load of the cheapest bare metal servers money can rent.
00:14:26.190 - 00:14:40.470, Speaker A: And we, I think, put 21 of them around the world in ten or so locations. And we ran three clusters on them, a four node cluster, a seven node cluster and a ten node cluster. And the goal was to see could we get them up to 1000 keys.
00:14:40.470 - 00:14:58.198, Speaker A: I had intended for it to break somewhere along the way and not make it all the way to 1000, but all three clusters went just fine. And the headline conclusion of the report is none of them were more than 1% off of their reference nodes. So they all performed nigh on identically to a solo node.
00:14:58.198 - 00:15:19.090, Speaker A: And then after the testing completed, we wanted to push it to breaking and we put all of the 3000 keys on one set of four nodes and it was still fine and stayed online, still looked good. In fact, the performance went up slightly. So from an economic perspective, we are able to run an astronomical amount of Validators on four bare metal servers.
00:15:19.090 - 00:15:45.690, Speaker A: Whether we want an astronomical amount of Validators to be run by a small group of people, not so much. I would much rather this be kind of run by solo stakers and we kind of further subdivide it. But it is something that's super interesting, particularly for the node operators in the room that have high cloud costs and are trying to figure out how they kind of adjust now that prices have come down, apr has come down, competition has gone up, there's quite a lot of node operators that are like, feeling the pinch.
00:15:45.690 - 00:16:07.906, Speaker A: And yeah, this is one example of our performance. I won't dwell on it too long because it's on the testnet and yeah, I'm going to skip both of them because we'll show you more data coming out soon. I don't want to undermine some of our cool reports that are coming out, but I will say the intention is to make Staking, particularly with DV, sound easy.
00:16:07.906 - 00:16:16.370, Speaker A: But I would say that it's not as easy as it could be. Yet there's still some caveats. You still have to run a Validator, keep it online, learn how to manage it.
00:16:16.370 - 00:16:27.666, Speaker A: But what I would say there's a little bit of communication and coordination overhead with your team. But the real benefit is having a team to run a Validator. There's a lot of people that would be scared to run a Validator solo.
00:16:27.666 - 00:16:44.266, Speaker A: They'd be not so sure if they have the technical chops for it, not so sure they'd be able to fix it if it goes down, particularly when your Validator does go offline, it's quite a frustrating time to try and get it back online. But when you're in a group in a DV, you have allies with you that are quite happy to work with you. They'll let you know it's down.
00:16:44.266 - 00:17:07.170, Speaker A: They'll figure out how to get you back online. If you need to kind of connect to their beacon node for a while, you can kind of leverage them and in general the hope is that your squad will have your back. But the real question I want to kind of leave this with is where will Staking and Solo Staking more particularly be next year? That is the kind of phase of this that I'm really hoping will kind of take off.
00:17:07.170 - 00:17:42.942, Speaker A: Some of the last two years have been heavy in the R and D, getting to alpha and stuff and at this point we're now kind of really expanding it and trying to make it super accessible for people. We're doing a lot of work with all of the launchers, so the kind of DAP nodes of Addos, steriums, all of these type of UIs to make things easy and we're generally hoping to get more solar stakers involved and to lower the barrier of entry to Staking. If you guys would like to kind of help us with this, particularly over the coming year, there's a number of ways you can get involved depending on kind of what you like to do at the top end.
00:17:42.942 - 00:17:58.478, Speaker A: If you have the means to run a main net validator and you would like to take partner alpha, I would encourage you to do so. Come ask me questions if you would like and beyond, then you can join our discord. This is kind of where we keep most of our communication and we have people going, taking part and getting involved.
00:17:58.478 - 00:18:13.318, Speaker A: You can find people to run DVS with there if you don't know a group yourself. We have recently launched a community forum which is where we're starting to do some of our more advanced research on a distributed validator protocol. A distributed validator protocol.
00:18:13.318 - 00:18:40.450, Speaker A: What that is, is the idea of being able to provide succinct proofs of who is online and offline in a distributed validator with the intention of eventually being able to kind of reward and punish people individually within a distributed validator rather than collectively. Right now it's just a team game. You keep the validator on, you can split them equally, but there isn't quite a way to kind of prove to a smart contract, hey, I was online, but they weren't, so I should get the rewards they shouldn't.
00:18:40.450 - 00:19:04.714, Speaker A: We're doing a lot of good work with Nethermind on this. Nethermind are also working with Lido on kind of permissionless validation. So if the kind of more researchy end, ZKS, VDF, Byzantine consensus, all this kind of stuff interests you, I would recommend you to take a look at it and then more generally, what I alluded to about the education side is something that we're really trying to make a push for at the moment.
00:19:04.714 - 00:19:25.598, Speaker A: There's quite a lot of kind of communities involved in Staking and Ethereum more generally regularly. There's the ETH staker community ethladam Kipu nodes Shifi there's groups all over the place that are trying to kind of promote Ethereum for their community or their special interest. We would love to work with you guys to make DVS accessible for your kind of group.
00:19:25.598 - 00:19:47.746, Speaker A: The goal is to kind of train you to train others. And the hope is that we make running distributed Validators less scary for people and that we have kind of groups that are all involved, all keeping validators online with one another. And lastly, for the kind of developers in the audience, we have recently soft launched an SDK for making it easy to create DVS programmatically.
00:19:47.746 - 00:19:59.962, Speaker A: It's in the advanced section of our docs if you want to go find it. It's still a bit ugly and rough around the edges, so I'm not shitting it too hard just yet. But if you are eager to give something like that a try, I would encourage it.
00:19:59.962 - 00:20:05.760, Speaker A: And other than that, mercy. Thank you very much. And I would like to see if you guys have any questions for me.
00:20:05.760 - 00:20:30.060, Speaker A: Go on. Someone throw up a hand there. Take the solo staker program.
00:20:30.060 - 00:20:39.550, Speaker A: Good question. I think one of the organizers might be around. We have a picnic.
00:20:39.550 - 00:20:52.840, Speaker A: Well, we have a talk Wednesday evening at the solostaker event. But if you search Etherfi operations solo staker, you should be able to find a sign up form there. I don't think we have anything on the oval side right now, but yeah.
00:20:53.930 - 00:21:07.594, Speaker B: I don't think that works. Oh, it does work. Now do you foresee any issues if say, 100% of solo stakers are running on oval software? Is that an issue? Do you have like a spec that others can run?
00:21:07.712 - 00:21:20.126, Speaker A: Yeah, you hit the nail on the head there with the spec. So that's what the effort with Nethermind is to make a distributed validator protocol spec. Well, if it was only solo stakers solo stakers are a small percentage right now.
00:21:20.126 - 00:21:31.566, Speaker A: I don't think it would be too big a deal. But yeah, generally if 100% of all stakers ran with only one client, I've talked about how Caron is the name of our software client. It doesn't have access to private keys.
00:21:31.566 - 00:21:43.042, Speaker A: So even worst case scenario like software is totally compromised. Caron shows slashable messages to the validator that's connected to it. The validator shouldn't sign anything slashable, but you will end up offline.
00:21:43.042 - 00:22:02.474, Speaker A: So to reduce the liveness risk that's still there, we are working with making a spec and the intention is to have ideally four interoperable clients over the long run. And that way if there's a zero day or a massive failure in any single one of them, literally nothing should go offline. But I would also say that Karon is independently versioned.
00:22:02.474 - 00:22:17.374, Speaker A: Each cluster is isolated from one another, so you don't have to upgrade versions at the simultaneously and you don't quite have to kind of all or nothing it. So if there ever was a Dodgy version. You could roll it back, you can upgrade some of them slowly.
00:22:17.374 - 00:22:44.042, Speaker A: So yeah, there can invariably be liveness risks but we are working on having multiple implementations to kind of get ahead of that as well. It any last questions, speak now or find me after all it okay, I think. Oh no.
00:22:44.042 - 00:23:06.254, Speaker A: Last minute I have loud voice. Thanks. Can you tell more about this box? Yeah, I hope some of them will make themselves known afterwards and give us a bit of info about what has been running.
00:23:06.254 - 00:23:28.146, Speaker A: So the idea, my understanding is that ether fi are the ones that are swallowing the cost of sending out these machines and that you would gradually earn your way out of that by they keep the rewards. And that's kind of how you kind of get in and you start earning your keep. And yeah, that's effectively the means of etherfire.
00:23:28.146 - 00:23:43.498, Speaker A: Like they have the ETH, they're looking for node operators, they want solo stakers. So they will send you a box if you kind of prove you are a solo staker and that you're credible. As for actually what it's been like, I think Iridian might be around somewhere but he's been working with the teams, getting them set up.
00:23:43.498 - 00:23:54.730, Speaker A: They have AVADO and Dapnode packages and I think they're at least running on Gurley. I saw one proposed a block recently so that's a good sign. And I think the hope is to start spinning them up on Mainnet fairly shortly.
00:23:54.730 - 00:24:04.674, Speaker A: I don't know if that's another hand or if that's just a wave. No, probably not. Anyone else last questions? Okay, won't give you as much time this time.
00:24:04.674 - 00:24:06.350, Speaker A: Thank you very much all you can come find me afterwards.
