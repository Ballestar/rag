00:00:11.850 - 00:00:47.740, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Thanks for being here for the last panel. Of the legal track, it may be the most interesting one if you are if you are a dign or a crypto fan, we will talk about the anonymous project. What is an anonymous project? What is a legal challenge to run or to launch an anonymous project and all the things relating to it, to talk about it. We have three very different and interesting people. I will let you introduce yourself, maybe Simon, if you can say a word about you.
00:00:48.350 - 00:01:14.530, Speaker B: Yes. Hello everyone. Simon Paul, I'm maybe the more regulatory guy of the panel. I'm a lawyer, I've been working with Adan, the French Crypto Assets Association, and also the European Crypto Initiative, which is basically crypto lobby at the EU level. And very interesting things to say about ENN projects.
00:01:16.470 - 00:02:00.850, Speaker C: Yeah, my name is sorry for the voice, got a strong voice from La de Jen. It's a long week, it's just the beginning. Yeah. So my name is Julian, Butulu I've been involved in the space for quite some time. I'm involved in Curve, the auto market, making stablecoin our crypto assets. Blackpool, the quant for the NFT market, where we invest in the NFT market and we run Esport vertical to create yield on those assets. Veg News, the underlying dark side investigative firm where we analyze the market, we study the acts and different things and we also throw some amazing parties.
00:02:00.850 - 00:02:10.758, Speaker C: Enscape Capital, which is the it's a found family office plus a quant. So we build different DeFi tools in.
00:02:10.764 - 00:03:04.390, Speaker D: The space and hello everyone, thank you for inviting me to this risk key panel. There's part of the Ave legal team in the room, so I'm a bit sweaty right now, but that's going to be a great experience, I'm sure. So my name is Mark Zeeler, I'm the head of Developer relations at the Ave Company. The Ave Company is a webtree studio contributing open source software to decentralized protocol. One of them is the Ave protocol. So basically what we do is that the most recent example is that we as the Ave Company, developed the software of the Go stablecoin and we presented that to the Ave governance with the Go proposal. And then the decentralized protocol shall decide if they accept or not to onboard this piece of software.
00:03:04.810 - 00:03:37.060, Speaker A: Thank you for this introduction. So I'm William O'Rourke, I'm working at Orwell and I will try to moderate this panel if it's possible. You can sit if you want in front, if you don't want to stay on the back of the room. Okay, so maybe let's start with a philosophical question. Why being anonymous as an individual and as a project can be understand as the epitome of the crypto? I mean, why there is so much anonymous anonymity in crypto and why it's so well seen in crypto industry? Maybe Mark, you want to answer this question?
00:03:37.670 - 00:04:13.100, Speaker D: The first thing I want to say is that we value privacy. Like privacy is a right and if you use the internet, anyone in this room for less than ten buck can probably buy your personal data on the darknet, that's a fact. If you want to protect your user, don't collect their data that's the best and most efficient way to protect your user is to limit the data collection. Privacy is a right, privacy should be valued and crypto and the ethos of decentralization is very compatible with the add on culture and we think it's a good thing.
00:04:14.110 - 00:04:15.900, Speaker A: Jujan you want to add something?
00:04:16.430 - 00:05:09.166, Speaker C: I don't see the devil advocate. I have to choose between the legal and this side. Normally I'm this side so I will try to do a balance the discussion. I don't truly believe that users are becoming anon because of privacy. I think most of the people that are anon is because of they want to build a project and regulatory system is not necessarily built in their favor. So they choose the anon aspect and the DeFi space is easy to build any project from any place in the world and you don't need to ask requests or ask permissions. So being add on has nothing to do with privacy for me it's more like people can build a project, make money without necessarily answer regulatory questions if there is a shit show happenings like for example being listed on vector news.
00:05:09.166 - 00:05:12.960, Speaker C: So I think that's the main aspect of being anonymous in the space.
00:05:14.710 - 00:05:55.200, Speaker B: Yeah, I would concur with this analysis. It's more that because of crypto can because crypto is the only space where you basically allow to create a project from the beginning through the end whilst remaining anonymous. It's the only place, the only space when you actually can do that and create really meaningful financial products that really have a big impact. So that's basically a way to build without bothering yourself with all the legalties but at some point we'll go through that later. Is it really viable in the long term? That's an open question.
00:05:56.210 - 00:06:33.260, Speaker A: Very interesting. Before continuing, maybe let the door open and if you want to move on the front of the room to sit here on the side because I see a lot of people on the back. Yeah, I think we have gained the right to be on main stage next year thanks to you. Okay, so we understand two things. First, anonymous anonymity and privacy is very valuable on crypto industry, especially on the DeFi. Secondly, crypto have lowered the mean it's technically possible to work and pay someone without knowing his identity. So it's very interesting.
00:06:33.260 - 00:06:50.158, Speaker A: We are in a legal track so there have to be some pain. So I'm turned to Simo. Is it possible legally to do something anonymous or being anonymous means you will be always outside of the legal system.
00:06:50.244 - 00:07:34.158, Speaker B: Or the so there's no law that says that you cannot do a project with remaining anonymous. But there's so many issues with doing that that it's practically well, it's not impossible. Of course people are doing this, but it creates a lot of friction and a lot of legal friction. The most simple one being you are collecting money from people not identified. You're not identified, you're not supposed to do that. And when you are paying people, it creates issue. When you are creating IP or something that you want to protect, it's creating issues.
00:07:34.158 - 00:08:06.600, Speaker B: So, of course, crypto has a lot of things that goes around that, and you can still build something. But creating a non project and remaining completely anon throughout all the functions of your project and being 100% legal, it's probably not possible even today when regulation is not finalized, and will probably not be possible at all in the future. But that's something we'll go to later. I don't know if someone wants to react to that.
00:08:08.330 - 00:09:26.594, Speaker C: Coming back to the first part of the discussion, I think there's an interesting statistics that we can run. But on wrecked news, I think in the space, there's not a single project that has been running by Anand that hasn't been wrecked. So the point that I'm trying to say is there's a correlation between yourself putting the reputations of what you're working on and the anonymity of what you're trying to be in the sense that if you want to be anon. The only project that I think hasn't been wrecked as Anon is bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto but then the entire ecosystem of DeFi projects, all those Anon projects got wrecked. Because at some point, since it's easy to build projects without necessarily asking or being accountable for people getting wrecked or for shit show going on in projects, then it's pretty big issue. So for me, I'm always suspicious and scared of using an anon project because why don't you put your reputation at stake in a space where we're using smart contracts? And it's always a red flag for me. Obviously, we shouldn't put everyone in the same box, but in this space, reputation is big.
00:09:26.594 - 00:09:46.680, Speaker C: And if you're building a DeFi project and want to be anon, it should be like a really clear reason for that. For example, building a protocol that you don't want this protocol to be stopped, but be the foundation of other projects. But as a project, it's kind of complicated for me, the reasoning of being Hannah, at least as a lead of the project.
00:09:47.770 - 00:10:17.646, Speaker A: Okay, it's very interesting. So, two things. First of all, just to explain you, of course, how to structure legally on a non project. It's a fake question, because the idea is not to structure it at all if you do not structure it at all, if you want to remain anonymous, we will give you and Julian, just thought about it. We will give you the main risk. We have seen the risk, of course, of rack, pool, scam, or wrecked. I mean, in every way I mean, it could be contractors to project project to users between users.
00:10:17.646 - 00:10:37.990, Speaker A: Also there is also a risk. Simon, you start to talk about it, maybe you can give us more insight. If you are earning cryptocurrency as a developer, for instance, as anonymous developer, it will becoming increasingly difficult to cash out because maybe the banking system will ask you where this money come from and there is a risk of laundering.
00:10:39.370 - 00:11:20.630, Speaker B: Yeah, well, if you are structuring your project as an anon project, you will have to be grassroots crypto and you don't have to think about cashing out because it probably won't be possible. You will lack all the necessary justification and all the necessary identification that are part of the financial system today. So basically creating an unan project is pushing you out of any chance of being regulated or being even interconnected with the regulated system. And that's something you have to have in mind when you create an anon project. That would be my two sentence.
00:11:21.450 - 00:11:24.166, Speaker A: It's a choice. Mark, you want to add something maybe?
00:11:24.348 - 00:11:47.870, Speaker D: Yeah, so that's the risky part, I guess. So I want to start by saying that I spent some time in law school, but I'm not a lawyer, so nothing I'm saying from now on is like legal advice or whatever. Because I do spend some time in law school, but I decide to do something more productive with my life at some point. So I'm a dropout.
00:11:48.930 - 00:11:59.314, Speaker A: Thanks Mark. It's very nice. I think we will leave now.
00:11:59.352 - 00:12:57.014, Speaker D: I guess the elephant in the room is that some people in the ecosystem, not all of them on top of valuing privacy, are choosing to be anon because they are choosing to deploy products that are regulated or sometimes illegal. And they think, and I think that's not the best strategy because a decentralized ledger that by nature will store all transaction forever is the worst technology ever to do these kind of things. But whatever. I think the main issue is that if you want to limit legal risk, be as decentralized as possible. You cannot have the cake and eat it too. If you want to create products that are truly decentralized, be truly decentralized and you will limit your risk. That doesn't mean that the risk will disappear completely.
00:12:57.014 - 00:13:29.950, Speaker D: That doesn't mean that it's a free card. I'm completely decentralized, so nothing can happen to me. I don't need to be Nanan. But you cannot have both. You cannot pretend to be decentralized, propose services and take directly as a human being fee from a protocol or directly propose services that you have direct control over it. And I think that's the main point is that do you need to be anon if you are truly decentralized?
00:13:30.770 - 00:13:47.890, Speaker A: Interesting. Maybe one short question, very basic. Do you know could you give us the name of one good anon project? You said that a lot of them have been wrecked but maybe one of them, as an example for people who want to stay or to become anon?
00:13:48.570 - 00:14:49.020, Speaker C: Well, I mean, the biggest anon project is bitcoin obviously DeFi. It's difficult to gouge Anon project because some people I know them myself the Anonymity has got some limits. And if you want to do some deals and at some point those projects that either become successful, those people, they also have these paradox of being anonymous but also want to tell the world that they have behind those projects. So at the end they're not anon to everyone who's anon in a room. No. Yeah, so you got a few different projects, but none of those projects, I don't know the people name, so it's difficult on my side, but maybe you know some project.
00:14:49.630 - 00:15:01.038, Speaker D: Yeah. So there's several good examples in the ecosystem. Most of the yearn team, for example, is anonymous yearn, is that's going back to my point?
00:15:01.124 - 00:15:03.470, Speaker C: Well, they all got wrecked, those projects.
00:15:03.970 - 00:15:17.700, Speaker D: Well, there's some passive whatever. For example, Chidao is mostly island, not wrecked so far.
00:15:21.990 - 00:15:23.166, Speaker C: We know, the Shidao.
00:15:23.198 - 00:15:31.590, Speaker D: Guys know this is recorded and we value privacy. So this is the end of this part of the conversation.
00:15:33.850 - 00:16:49.022, Speaker B: Well, maybe just to add very quickly, what we see is that mostly we talk about anon projects, but there are some part of reputation attached also to pseudonyms. And this reputation is notably built in the fact that some people know them. So this is a blurry state, right? Some people are anon for a time and then they become well known in the community and then they reveal themselves sometimes because they feel like it's a step in the right direction at some point, or maybe they are doxed and they have to. So it's a very blurry term, anon. And nobody is really anon because you cannot trust a project if there's no at least a synonym that has some form of track record or something, or you end up correct in the end. And just to get back to very quickly on the risk, because you said how to reduce the risk if you are doing an anon project, I feel like the most important thing to not have any risk is just to not wreck your user. Because as you said, everything is published on the blockchain and most likely than not, people will find you if you do something mean.
00:16:49.156 - 00:17:48.290, Speaker C: Going back to the point of mark, it's a good point that if your project is fully decentralized, then there's no really point for being anon inside the project. You can be anon. I'm talking about the core team of the project that is leading the project, the vision, but then people outside working on GitHub and as being anon to participate or provide value to the protocol, then it's fine. But as a project and running the project from the entire point of being anonym, then usually in the system we say don't trust verify. But the problem in projects that are built on top of smart contract. The aspect of trust is very important because you will always value the reputation of someone that is building a project way higher than the project mission. Because you understand that this person doesn't want his reputation is way higher than whatever he's trying to do in the market.
00:17:48.290 - 00:18:04.120, Speaker C: So you will always put faith in the person who's building the project. And for me that's the most important aspect of the anonymity in this space. Being anonymous is fine, but being anony and running a project as a complete anonymity aspect, then it's always a red flag for me.
00:18:05.370 - 00:18:25.600, Speaker A: Very interesting just to bounce back on what you just said about the people who are known and who can becoming synodonymous and reveal themselves. I mean, the beauty with anonymity is you can be a lawyer during the day and a famous anonymous contributor to tell us something. I will reveal myself today.
00:18:28.930 - 00:18:34.770, Speaker C: He said the name Saifu is a good anon, not wrecked.
00:18:35.750 - 00:18:49.880, Speaker A: Perfect. Let's maybe move to more concrete how to work with someone anonymous. For instance, how do you hire someone anonymous? You have to check on its credential only on in GitHub. I mean, it's a basic question.
00:18:51.610 - 00:19:46.674, Speaker C: Yeah, in state capital, running all those different project, 90 people, employees, we tried three times hiring anon people that are non and working with us and we got wrecked three times. So statistically speaking, it's difficult. One we end up, and this is also a story that might end up in rec, but it's very famous in the Indian industries. Like you have firms that are using the fragility of young kids and developers and they lock them in the room. And then their goal is to farm projects in the early days of the project, is to make friends with the project and get access to GitHub. Get access to this. This is pretty big in have because it's proven.
00:19:46.674 - 00:20:38.210, Speaker C: We also have police reports and all this stuff in Canada. So we got involved and then those persons they got access to and be placed in the multisig and also get access to some equity of the project and then they start damping the project and they start basically attacking the project. And we've seen this in multiple SushiSwap, one of the anon guy that worked for SushiSwap then racked the website. I think this is broad and we need to openly speak about this. My experience in the group hiring anon people, it's been painful, not just economic damages, but also inside the team. And yeah, it's pretty difficult. I think the only way it's not hiring Hanon, it's just people participating in code on GitHub and get to grant.
00:20:38.210 - 00:20:51.850, Speaker C: Yeah, but always double check and verify, always the maximum security on the code that has been passed by someone that you don't know because the reputation normally should be the one that is making an extra layer of verifications.
00:20:54.110 - 00:21:29.260, Speaker D: I completely agree with what has been saying I will just cover the boring part. I think if you have a legal entity, it's going to be hard to have a fully fledged employee that is fully Alan, for obvious reason. That being said, usually what happened is that you have service provider agreement. So there's a lot of different jurisdictions that will allow to pay in Stablecoin. That doesn't mean I can't love that, but I think Simon is a bit more technical on this than me.
00:21:31.230 - 00:22:31.194, Speaker B: Well, there's no issue in using Stablecoins for payment. It's not banned. And in the EU, as long as Mika is not in place, you can do pretty much everything you want with Stablecoins, although you need to find an accountant that would accept that. But yeah, supposedly you cannot walk as a company with someone that you have not identified. So that's the main blocker. I mean, that's the reason why I said you have to be dejan to hire Anans and the amount of risks that this implies makes it very unwalkable in practice. So usually I would not recommend walking with Anon people, except if this anonymity is just a pseudonym of a very well known person and that this person agrees to reveal to you, because that's the most important thing.
00:22:31.194 - 00:22:54.340, Speaker B: It can remain unknown for the rest of the people, but you need to have something at least to identify that. It's always very simple things, because if it's purely an unperson, you're not even sure that it's only one person. You're not even sure that the person does not sell his account to someone else. You don't know anything. So it's really easy to screw you.
00:22:55.770 - 00:23:26.142, Speaker A: It's perfect because it was my last question before, of course, accepting some question from you, from all of you. What will be your advice to someone? Either you want to create an anonymous project or someone who want to stay anon and working with a project. So Julian, you already told us that it's complicated to apply to your company and remain anonymous. But I don't know what could be your advice if you want to share with us.
00:23:26.196 - 00:23:31.040, Speaker C: Well, I think the first question is what do you define anonymous project?
00:23:33.090 - 00:23:41.090, Speaker A: If you don't know, let's say something which is not incorporated and you don't know the main executive, if I may say.
00:23:41.160 - 00:24:46.674, Speaker C: But then if you start from there, you have a thousand of projects being deployed every single day because it's a smart contract. By definition, if the source of the token that were founded to this wallet and create the smart contract, then it's kind of an anon project by definition. I think the Anon project is a project that is trying to have a huge impact on the ecosystem without taking the regulatory risk. So this kind of project, I will consider them as anon. But the person that deploying smart contract and small impact project, those guys, I think is because they don't want to necessarily build a legal entity and then go through the path of paying expensive lawyers. It's May Day, but on my side we don't hire anon. And as Mark mentioned, it's because of legal reasons.
00:24:46.674 - 00:26:03.406, Speaker C: And now when you have a broad scope and the ecosystem is very risky, this is not something that we want to take. And for anyone that wants to be anonymous, in the sense of being able to deploy smart contract without asking questions, to answering questions to people, as in everyone is doing this on a daily basis, deploying an NFT contract and this is being anonymous if you don't say that you're behind the project. So there's two stage of anon like those guys doing this and I really like what you said. All the anon people in the space, if project are working with them, you can be 100% sure that they know each other, like personally, they talk on the phone, they met before. I don't know a single project in the space where we don't know the founders or the people that are being dis. And it's strong, that's why and then if Avi is working with one project that is anon or I'm working with project design on, you can consider that we did due diligence ourselves, we did the double checking and add this kind of extra layer of security on top. It's not saying that if the project will not get wrecked okay, don't ape.
00:26:03.406 - 00:26:04.020, Speaker C: Okay?
00:26:04.790 - 00:26:57.518, Speaker D: That's a very important point, is that we value privacy. I think in this ecosystem, that doesn't mean anonymity is a spectrum, that doesn't mean you cannot give some information to a selected few people that you want to have synergy with. Obviously you take a risk when you do that because when you give your identity or any kind of information to a selected party, you take the risk that that selected party will leak that information and make it public. And that's a huge risk for your privacy. So that's something that need to be carefully considerate. That's why most unknown in the industry are known to a selected few member of the ecosystem. But I think we value the privacy enough to make sure that publicly those people have their privacy protected.
00:26:57.518 - 00:27:25.226, Speaker D: So that's an important point. It's a spectrum. And if you want to take the anon route, I will say again, you cannot have the cake and eat it too. Build something that is truly decentralized, that will limit your risk. Because if you think being anon is a magic shield that will protect you from any risk, I think that's stupid. Like literally. Because time is not on your side.
00:27:25.408 - 00:28:21.020, Speaker B: Yeah. And just to react very quickly on that and maybe to projecting in the future, we could really imagine ourselves, like the crypto community, developing tools that would help actually being anonymous for some people, but providing proofs to other people without revealing too much that you have actually, I don't know, worked on a project or that you have been vouched by someone. I mean, with ZK proofs and these kind of things. There's a lot of projects that are already thinking about decentralized identity and we could very well have these kind of identities that are pseudonymous and that have a very strong role in the future of the ecosystem because they are built with a lot of authentication, a lot of proofs that you have actually done something and that you are a reputable person. But I'm not sure that we are at this stage today.
00:28:21.790 - 00:29:05.750, Speaker C: If I can add something that is an example as my personal experience well, for example, I think if you're playing with people money, it's difficult to bring the anonymity aspect because the trust is here. You don't want to get wrecked. But for example, Rec News. I found Rec News. I ran Recnews as the person behind the co founded and financially on Rec News. But then the rest of the content and entire website and people are involved it's amazing team it's a kickass team but entire team is anon in the sense that the reason for that we're not playing with people money but we provide a content that can be for some person be taking as a personal attacks. So in this sense that we need to protect ourselves.
00:29:05.750 - 00:29:52.194, Speaker C: We need to protect the people that are writing those those piece of contents, because then we don't want them to be attacked. And we want the content that we deploy, the content that we ship to the industry for serving the people that are in this industry to be fully this content, to be fully agnostic, to be not associated with anyone. So that's why we can provide the best service to the users, to you guys and trying to understand what's happening in the space. And if we ship a video that attacks some behaviors on the ecosystem, you can guarantee that we serve you guys. And that's important in this project is because it's not dealing with people money. It's trying to build and understand what's happening in the space. The reason of being hand on.
00:29:52.194 - 00:30:18.420, Speaker C: It makes sense. You don't want to get lawsuit for stuff that you write because people think this is either defamatory or like stuff like that but also reg, never attack anyone. We try to understand and we make people make their own conclusions but we try to provide facts from the blockchain, what we see on blockchains. That's the reason why we can be anon because the information that we provide is information that we read from the on chain data.
00:30:19.030 - 00:30:43.094, Speaker A: Thank you very much Mark Julian and simu for all this information. I think we understand much more like what Anonymity means in the crypto industry. So you can upload them if you want. I think next year I think I will do a track only on Anonymity.
00:30:43.142 - 00:30:47.610, Speaker C: Because we have menstaged nicely. I got confirmation.
00:30:48.110 - 00:30:53.040, Speaker A: If some of you have some question we can try to take maybe one.
00:30:54.450 - 00:30:58.160, Speaker C: The question was who's anon? You said Rebecca, you raise your hand.
00:31:01.090 - 00:31:25.830, Speaker E: So I'm interested in it's a two part question. So one which is from a legal perspective, we think about what it means to be truly decentralized all the time. But from a community perspective, what's really important for you when you're looking at true decentralization then the other part of it, which Simon mentioned was we should build tools that help people be anonymous, but why wouldn't we build tools that will help people understand how to decentralize properly?
00:31:26.890 - 00:32:20.098, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I only got the first part of your question, so I will answer this one. I think coming back to this point, I think everyone should be anonym in a sense, not 100% anonymity as a person, but part of the activity that you do on a daily basis. You have a certain spectrum of that activity that should be anonym to the rest of the world. If you're buying something to the shop, then this information should only be your property. In a sense that we're coming back to the privacy, we're coming back to all those different systems like the Gafa and all those even guys that are stealing private information from people. So I think the anonymity has a different level. And as a human, as someone part of the society, we all need to have this part of anonymity part of us.
00:32:20.098 - 00:33:26.830, Speaker C: And that's the reason we have zero knowledge proof transactions. And legally I think this is causing a lot of issues. But if we in Europe GDPR stopping from people stealing our information, if the governments and regulatory entities are built to serve people on the ground, this is like there's no way that we can go to a system that is not providing zero knowledge proof transaction. This is a fact. We have to go there. And then this is the job of regulatory, of regulators to make sure that those people that are doing those transaction, you will have 5% or 1% of those people that are doing bad things. But it's the job of the regulatory entities to cash them and those kind of things, how you can track those things like Nansen, all those different tools, dune analytics, chain analysis, all those different tools can provide to the government's system that we can track people that are using the system in a bad way.
00:33:26.830 - 00:33:31.680, Speaker C: But then the rest of us, we should have this kind of anonymity attached to us.
00:33:33.730 - 00:33:59.940, Speaker A: I'm sorry, we are running out of time. And I was thinking for the technical team that have to lunch as any one of us, thank you very much for this panel.
