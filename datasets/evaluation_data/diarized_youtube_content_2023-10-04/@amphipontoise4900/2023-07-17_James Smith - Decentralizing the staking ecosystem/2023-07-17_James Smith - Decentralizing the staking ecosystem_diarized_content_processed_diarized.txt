00:00:30.370 - 00:00:34.642, Speaker A: Hi everybody. Thanks for your patience. I'm James, I'm from the Ethereum Foundation.
00:00:34.642 - 00:00:48.038, Speaker A: It's good to be here. I'm going to talk to you today about system and a few key points that I'd like to bring up. I saw Ocean's Talk about an hour ago, so I made some rapid changes.
00:00:48.038 - 00:01:11.780, Speaker A: So bear with me because I wanted to make it a little bit different to some of the parts he brought up as well. And then I want to talk to you about DVT and how that can change some of the design choices in the staking ecosystem. So if I give you a first and I also made this because DVT is quite dry, so that's why there's lots of colors going on.
00:01:11.780 - 00:01:30.626, Speaker A: A DVT 101, if you don't know, is one validator running on many machines and it reduces a lot of single points of failure. This distributes the power of responsibility from the large players. And at the moment, lots of node operators have a won't be evil attitude rather than a can't be evil.
00:01:30.626 - 00:01:51.294, Speaker A: DBT helps change this as well. But taking it back a slight step, we can see if you're building a staking startup, and this might be a slightly controversial view, there's not much money in staking operations. So if you're the largest staking pool, you're making around 18 20 million.
00:01:51.294 - 00:02:11.410, Speaker A: How much money do you have to put in to compete with that staking pool to get that market share? And that's why we're not seeing a lot of big entrance into the market and a lot of people wanting to compete as well. You've got user access, liquidity and first mover advantage. One of the big things, a great example is Coinbase.
00:02:11.410 - 00:02:26.780, Speaker A: They started about six to nine months later than other staking pools and they offered no LST and they charged double the fee as other people. And they grew to be one of the biggest staking pool providers out there. How do they do that? User access.
00:02:26.780 - 00:02:46.046, Speaker A: And what we're not seeing is uniswap ave other big players offering staking services because they have users there as well. A lot of the staking pools I speak to have thought really highly about the different features and processes they can actually have. They're not thinking about their go to market strategy.
00:02:46.046 - 00:03:08.120, Speaker A: They're not thinking, oh, I need to do some partnerships with wallets, with likes of exchanges and Uniswap for instance, as well. And that's really where a lot of the growth is very prohibitive. Then you had withdrawals and there was a big the great reshuffle was what people were calling it and it turns out nothing happened.
00:03:08.120 - 00:03:18.166, Speaker A: One of the actual key points here is it reminds me of bank accounts. How many times do you move bank accounts in a lifetime? You don't. Staking is also very sticky.
00:03:18.166 - 00:03:34.530, Speaker A: So if you're a staking pool that's new, you have to find new people with new ETH because they're not moving it. I speak to some exchanges and they tell me the average user holds around $600 of staked ETH. That is not worth the gas fee to move, it is not even worth the 4% to move.
00:03:34.530 - 00:04:00.666, Speaker A: So there is a lot of apathy there to move your stake to ETH unless there's a better offer. So how does DVT level the playing field? Well, I think node operators have to run expensive, cloud validators, or lots of serious hardware with rigid requirements. Other staking pools have a bonded system which prohibits growth quite a lot.
00:04:00.666 - 00:04:29.026, Speaker A: And the key considerations for any staking for is reputational, risk and performance as well. So how does DBT level the playing field? It may not help professional node operators that much, but if you're a solo operator and you join with six friends or six strangers on the web, your performance and uptime can really increase and you can start competing with node operators. You can then start offering a better charging cost to these providers as well.
00:04:29.026 - 00:05:03.674, Speaker A: You can start joining forces and offering staking pools as a DBT solution, which is more resilient and robust on cheaper machines, which I think is really exciting because we've seen with withdrawals and staking startups, you can't change the way that the current makeup of five entities controlling over 50% of the staked ETH. But if you can change the underlying infrastructure, the way that it's built, I think that's the most interesting thing that DBT really offers. The fault tolerance is really good on DBT, you're running multiple different clients.
00:05:03.674 - 00:05:26.500, Speaker A: We've seen that with an incident last month and also that you've got different geographical areas. A major exchange had to stop staking operations in California for instance, and that could have had a really bad effect if there was a large node operator or staking provider based there. With DBT, you escape a lot of these issues as well.
00:05:26.500 - 00:05:43.862, Speaker A: In a nutshell, I wrote some things that maybe if you're not aware, you don't have to share your keys. So it really turns you from a I can't be evil, I won't be evil, to a can't be evil. And lots of node operators also, I should say, don't want that label as well.
00:05:43.862 - 00:06:07.558, Speaker A: They don't want to be evil, but it's better if they can't be. This is DBT's journey ahead and the way I hope it plays out. So you also get a reduction in bond because you start building trust systems and you'll start seeing with other new staking pools coming out, that the number of ETH you need is getting lower and lower.
00:06:07.558 - 00:06:51.966, Speaker A: But I also think you'll get to a point where there's zero collateral needed as well, and then really far in the future is one stock signatures, which is probably a good decade away from being built out. And lastly, I want to say that DBT is a really exciting thing coming through, but there's not enough node operators, there's not enough solo operators or mini node operators actually learning and participating in this as well. So myself and Iridian, who's loosely part of ETH staker and also has written a lot of documentation for Obel and SSV, is actually we decided to fly to Kenya as a proof of concept.
00:06:51.966 - 00:07:13.946, Speaker A: So we set up an ethereum node there and apart from the cleaner trying to swipe our setup twice, we managed to get it working and it performs extremely well and it's participating. And we did it to build some awareness around DBT that it could be a really good proof of concept. And we're looking to give those two nodes away at EF Safari in September for someone to manage those as well.
00:07:13.946 - 00:07:25.438, Speaker A: So a big shout out to Dapnode and Home Node for providing those as well. But we're now running a DBT cluster across Australia, Germany, the UK and Kenya as well. And the United States.
00:07:25.438 - 00:07:52.854, Speaker A: So it really is a proof of concept and encourage you to go to DB Stakers to learn and start participating more about it, because I think it's the start of where you as a node operator, a solo operator, can really start earning rewards without putting up so much collateral as well. And I think that's most exciting thing is that we can spread that revenue around as well. That's a short take and a few, hopefully, discussion points for you as well.
00:07:52.854 - 00:07:54.440, Speaker A: Does anybody have any questions?
00:08:09.060 - 00:08:25.910, Speaker B: Yeah, repeat. So you're saying that DVT is basically several nodes which are implementing the same validator, and you say it cannot be bad, but if you're the entity that spins all those nodes, like why, if you are bad, can all the nodes you are spinning also be bad?
00:08:27.800 - 00:08:59.650, Speaker A: Well, say you've got your seven or eight nodes, you actually have a split key generator, so a hacker or somebody malicious would need access to each every single machine to be able to be malicious, so no one person controls the key, so you can't take advantage of that as well. Exactly, yeah. And hopefully there'll be blind DBT, so you don't know who you're partnered with, so there can be no collusion in the back end as well.
00:09:05.310 - 00:09:18.570, Speaker C: So how do you eventually get to just the signature level requirement where you don't even stake ETH? You don't stake zero ease, you just have signatures. Like, tell us about Beta endgame.
00:09:18.650 - 00:09:20.218, Speaker A: Oh, the one shot signature?
00:09:20.314 - 00:09:20.766, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:20.868 - 00:09:54.170, Speaker A: That's actually a quantum cryptographic theory, I should say, at the moment, where it's still in very much the research phase, but it will lead to trustless staking pools and trustless staking where you won't actually need a lot of pools to do anything as well. The same thing for actually the best place to go is the reddit Ask Me Anything and Justin Drake wrote a whole paragraph on this recently, so that's the best place to check it out. But it's about a decade away, so it's still very much in theory stage.
00:09:54.170 - 00:10:02.574, Speaker A: So at the moment, DBT is one of the best solutions. And I also don't think it's over. I think there's room for more DBT solutions to be built.
00:10:02.574 - 00:10:14.580, Speaker A: I only see a handful of middleware operations coming out, and a lot of people think that the build is over, but it's really not. So if there's any builders, I encourage you. I think there's still space.
00:10:20.910 - 00:10:36.110, Speaker D: What do you expect? The ratio between the stakes is and the revenue for the stakers. If they need to stake less ETH, so would the revenue decrease appropriately or should stay the same and just earn more per ETH?
00:10:37.570 - 00:10:57.880, Speaker A: I don't understand your question. You mean with people that are running nodes or with their own ETH or with other well, personally, in my opinion, I think that staked ETH will go will tap out around 30%, 25, 30%. It may go a little bit high if Eigen layer starts adding a percentage on top of this as well.
00:10:57.880 - 00:11:08.314, Speaker A: But I would assume that with a lot more players coming into it, your revenue will go down, and then a lot of people are staying with it based on what the token price might do.
00:11:08.432 - 00:11:09.660, Speaker C: Okay, thank you.
00:11:13.850 - 00:11:15.174, Speaker A: One last question.
00:11:15.372 - 00:11:28.140, Speaker E: The DVT landscape is super narrow right now. With the number of protocols that we have. How do you see that playing out? Do you see more DVT solutions coming online or them all adhering to one spec?
00:11:28.830 - 00:11:44.218, Speaker A: I'd love to see more DBT solutions coming online, especially clients. So it's maybe a non governed DBT solution where a cluster could form together, organize themselves, and almost offer a node operation through that as well. So that would be ideal.
00:11:44.218 - 00:12:00.340, Speaker A: And then I think that DBT gives lots more design choices in the Staking space than the current situation, because you have to build in a certain way, and DBT opens up the opportunities. So I hope we start seeing some different specs coming through. Thanks.
