00:00:00.650 - 00:00:24.458, Speaker A: Welcome to Uncommon Core, where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. This show is hosted by Su Zu, the CEO and chief investment officer of 3 Hours Capital, and Me Hasu, a crypto researcher and writer. Today, sue and I are sitting down with Matti and Fiscantes of Z Prime Capital.
00:00:24.458 - 00:01:01.440, Speaker A: The two have consistently been among my favorite people to follow on crypto Twitter, so I'm very glad that they agreed to have this conversation with us. In fact, we ended up talking for so long that we have to release the episode in two parts. In this first half, we covered the value of crypto Twitter in finding and spreading ideas, z Prime's unique investment thesis, and how it is to be an outsider in the VC space, how memetics and Reflexivity shape the crypto markets, and whether this current crypto cycle will be the last.
00:01:01.440 - 00:01:17.186, Speaker A: I hope you enjoyed this conversation. I know I did. I came across you guys because of your Twitter account.
00:01:17.186 - 00:01:39.670, Speaker A: You both sort of became some of my favorite people on Twitter in 2020 and I had no idea that you work for a VC or that you even work at the same firm. Right, because you didn't even have that in your bio. And just from reading your Twitter, it would never have occurred to me that you work for a VC because you don't take yourself too seriously.
00:01:39.670 - 00:02:01.330, Speaker A: You post a ton of memes, but also great analysis. It seems like you're not really concerned with leaking your thesis that you have for different projects and also criticize stuff about others. So I respect that a lot, especially you really understand how ideas spread in markets and on social media and we'll get into that later.
00:02:01.330 - 00:02:06.226, Speaker A: So would you mind giving us a quick intro of yourself and Zprime?
00:02:06.338 - 00:02:24.860, Speaker B: Thanks, Hasu. It was a very nice intro from you. So yeah, I'm Matti, I've co founded Zprime and I'm also helping to build Hydra DX and I'm also engaged in other kind of site projects that we run within.
00:02:24.860 - 00:02:31.534, Speaker B: I guess that's the short story about.
00:02:31.572 - 00:03:01.750, Speaker C: Me Fiscante is here. I used to play poker professionally for a couple of years, same as you, Hasu, so I don't even think of myself as VC. I'm much closer to this DeFi crypto degen culture because poker was a bit similar and I grew up there with all the poker players doing crazy bets on a lot of stuff and it kind of went naturally in crypto for me to kind of build this, let's say, persona.
00:03:01.750 - 00:03:39.954, Speaker C: So I have this conflicting kind of personality where one part of me is AVC, I want to be deep down in projects, kind of help the team. But the other part of me is also about running a portfolio of liquid bets kind of degoning into farms and doing all this fun and crazy stuff that DeFi allows now even like some short term things like playing some algo stablecoins even though I don't really think that many of them are not here to stay. But I still play them because it's fun and it's a game.
00:03:39.954 - 00:04:03.974, Speaker C: It has some rules and you can figure out how the game works and how to exploit it. So this is what I do and this is where I draw joy from. But at the end of the day, the space is growing quite fast and you can meet a lot of crazy and smart people who are building the future of finance or future of France.
00:04:03.974 - 00:04:26.126, Speaker C: How the meme goes. So, yeah, I love both aspects of the space, and that's why I joined Zprime, because they allow me to kind of go deeper into projects and understand the tech and the founders, the teams behind the projects a bit. More not just ape into their farms and just play with their so I.
00:04:26.148 - 00:04:46.598, Speaker A: Want to go back to your Twitter account briefly because, like, so still so amazed by I mean, usually people use their Twitter if they're also big investors, they use their Twitter to generate deal flow and leads for their fund. But you guys don't even mention the fund in your so what do you use Twitter for? Like, why do you use it? What do you try to get out of it?
00:04:46.684 - 00:05:22.946, Speaker C: So, from my mean, I don't mention it now, I had it there briefly. I kind of start to see value in having a pseudonymous account or close to anon despite I'm not really anon people if really want to, people can really dig down and just find my real name and stuff, so I'm not really too focused on that. But I find value and freedom in having this kind of no strings attached account that can speak freely and doesn't post as some representative of some other entity or something like that.
00:05:22.946 - 00:05:40.838, Speaker C: So that's why I decided to experiment with this. I mean, I may even put it back later that I'm part of Zprime, but everyone who follows me already kind of knows that or they know that I invest. And actually, despite me not having it in my bo, I retweet stuff from Zprime.
00:05:40.838 - 00:06:10.690, Speaker C: I act sometimes I kind of act as VC as well on Twitter. So we actually get a fair amount of deal flow via this way. I myself had a couple of early founders getting in touch with me because of something I wrote about Stablecoins or about synthetics, and we made a couple of very interesting and successful investments based on my activity, despite me not really posing as a VC.
00:06:10.690 - 00:06:39.322, Speaker C: And also right now there is this meme which I think is misguided, but there is this meme of like, VC Bet, right? My persona is more close to standard DeFi crypto user and that's why maybe some people find it more likable than some big name ivory tower we see who pretends he's on top of everything all the time.
00:06:39.456 - 00:06:46.510, Speaker B: For myself. My Twitter account. It wasn't very followed until very recently.
00:06:46.510 - 00:07:07.510, Speaker B: I think it was the first kind of writings that I published. I think it was my rebuttal to Berniske's essay that he wrote, and I think it was sue who retweeted it or something like that. And then it started for me, as in getting the following on Twitter.
00:07:07.510 - 00:07:31.950, Speaker B: I wasn't really productive on Twitter before that, and I still am not tweeting as much as Fiske does. And then it was the kind of my essays helped me to build this following and obviously reflexivity kicked in. I became more productive.
00:07:31.950 - 00:07:52.802, Speaker B: But I still don't feel like tweeting too often. I feel like you have to kind of earn that sort of balance it with work that you do outside of Twitter. So I still feel like I have to kind of I don't want to feel entitled or anything like that.
00:07:52.802 - 00:08:22.722, Speaker B: So I think it's a great tool. And Twitter itself is I think it's replacing these hubs, like geographic hubs in a way. So I think 2017, I mean, there was crypto Twitter in 2016 and even before that, right? But I think it's becoming sort of more dominant and it's dominating now over physical locations.
00:08:22.722 - 00:08:29.070, Speaker B: So you don't have to be in San Francisco anymore. You don't have to be in New York. You can be anywhere.
00:08:29.070 - 00:08:32.320, Speaker B: We are sort of a proof of that.
00:08:33.570 - 00:08:48.760, Speaker A: Sue, how do you feel about your use of Twitter? I don't think we have ever talked about this on air, but for the longest time, you had no Twitter account, right? Only in 2018, like mid 2018 or something. And very late you made yours. So then kind of skyrocketed from there, right?
00:08:49.210 - 00:08:49.718, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:49.804 - 00:09:19.918, Speaker D: I think previously I would talk more on Discord or on Telegram groups, but kind of just saw all the stuff people saying on Twitter and just felt like it's a good way to meet people and it's like a good way to just get your message out there, whatever it is. And I think too, that I had always been more provocative in Telegram groups. And then I realized it's more fun to provoke a large amount of people than a smaller amount of people.
00:09:19.918 - 00:09:29.374, Speaker D: So that kind of fed my ego a little bit. I think Kyle then saw me tweet, and then when he saw me get to 20,000 followers, he's like, all right, I'm missing out. I got to get in on those actions.
00:09:29.374 - 00:09:39.790, Speaker D: So he got into the mix there as well. But I've met the best contacts in crypto from Twitter. Like Arthur Zero X.
00:09:39.790 - 00:09:51.740, Speaker D: When I had 1000 followers, he had followed me and he DM'd me. At that time, my DMs were open and he DM'd me and said, let's just get coffee sometime. I'm writing research in an incubator right now.
00:09:51.740 - 00:09:58.426, Speaker D: I've got this 30 page report on a project called SNX. It's two cent. I think it can go to $2.
00:09:58.426 - 00:10:06.762, Speaker D: And I obviously brushed him off whatever. It's like this young kid, whatever. But we did have coffee and then a few months later I'm like, wow, you're actually smart.
00:10:06.762 - 00:10:40.954, Speaker D: So I think Twitter is one of the best ways to meet people because it's just like people can find you, you can find them, and the ideas are all out there. But I do agree with Fiscontes too in the sense that it's difficult at some point to separate the persona from the beliefs from the need to project a persona and to be a sometimes like I feel like I'm just playing a character at this point as opposed to being able to say the things that I might want to say in a certain situation. So I think it's always tough to balance that.
00:10:40.954 - 00:10:45.354, Speaker D: So I might make an alt one day, but we'll see.
00:10:45.552 - 00:11:01.018, Speaker A: Yeah, that might be one of the problems. Right? It's really fun to provoke and build a character that has these cartoonish elements, especially when it comes to bullish posting and so on. But then it can become like a trap.
00:11:01.018 - 00:11:02.698, Speaker A: It's very hard to get out of that.
00:11:02.804 - 00:11:25.618, Speaker B: Yeah, you get forced into a persona then, because you get rewards, right, in terms of in form of likes, retweets and et cetera. And it kind of rewards this particular behavior of yours and then you feel like you need to kind of replicate it and get more likes. It can be a trap.
00:11:25.618 - 00:11:37.020, Speaker B: And for some people it is a trap. I think that people have they even do these breaks from Twitter like that they have to take a break because they're not handling it well. Probably.
00:11:38.350 - 00:11:50.026, Speaker A: Yeah, it's exactly what you said, right? You self select for the people who wanted to hear your previous content. Right. If you got to 20K with posting bullish memes, then you have a lot of followers who want to hear bullish memes.
00:11:50.026 - 00:11:53.726, Speaker A: And if you then post something else, then can get very difficult. Right.
00:11:53.828 - 00:12:30.266, Speaker C: It's also about consistency, right? If you are consistently bullish about ethereum, then it's very hard to kind of break out of that loop and be bearish or criticize it because a lot of your followers will not take it lightly. Right. So this is actually something that I'm often like, I try to exercise that I try to provide even opinions that I may not necessarily fully agree with, but I just put it out there just to kind of see what the response is, how the market and the community feels about stuff.
00:12:30.266 - 00:12:44.462, Speaker C: And yeah, I even have a disclaimer that not everything that I write about, I mean, really seriously. And I try to have fun. Maybe that's one of the reasons I don't still have 20K followers, because I'm often so inconsistent.
00:12:44.462 - 00:12:49.490, Speaker C: I would say I try to have fun more than follow an agenda.
00:12:51.270 - 00:13:15.206, Speaker B: I think with this it's similar to becoming a particular asset maximalist. So you fall into this hole that keeps on giving. So I think that many bitcoiners, why they don't look beyond, is because they stumble upon bitcoin and it has rewarded them with so much sort of cash and wealth that it's a very comfy hole.
00:13:15.206 - 00:13:39.810, Speaker B: And you don't want to get out of it because you feel like you're cheating on it or something like that, and you just keep on being stuck, and it's a very comfy hole. And the same goes for Ethereum and the same goes for your sort of identity that is being rewarded online or on Twitter. So it's a very similar mechanism for me.
00:13:39.880 - 00:14:15.298, Speaker C: The one example I can provide was I mean, I was super bullish on Synthetics early on. Despite it has many design flaws, I still saw that there is much more potential and the team is like in a beast mode, building fast and growing and the community was great. But my most popular article was actually criticism on Synthetics and how it is getting wrecked by various design exploits such as Oracle Front running and at that time I was actually one of the SNX partners.
00:14:15.298 - 00:14:33.886, Speaker C: I would say I got a lot of followers who were fans of Synthetics but it worked out well. Everyone was taking it very seriously that this is actually happening. There was no backlash from the community that I dare to FUD their backs.
00:14:33.886 - 00:14:37.220, Speaker C: So this was pleasant surprise for me at least.
00:14:37.830 - 00:14:52.694, Speaker A: We already got like a glimpse at your investment style and how you think about different projects. So listener can really get an idea of what kind of ZPC does as a firm. So how would you describe your investment style and what are some of your proudest bets?
00:14:52.822 - 00:15:00.490, Speaker B: So I think that maybe I could sort of tell you the story of Z Prime or maybe how it kind of evolved.
00:15:00.850 - 00:15:01.838, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely.
00:15:01.924 - 00:15:34.322, Speaker B: That's the best way to get an idea. So we don't really have like a fancy thesis but we do have fancy memes though, I think. So I left the previous crypto fund because that was the end of 2018 and I thought that the industry is changing and it requires this kind of like new type of mindset and that is one that is not so much based on the process, but on something that I would call substance.
00:15:34.322 - 00:16:04.960, Speaker B: And it was sort of convenient to believe that, of course, because I have an unconventional background for an investor, like in terms of nationality, location, et cetera. So when I say substance, I mean like this one off thing. So the process is based on pattern recognition, but substance is this abstract, spur of the moment thing, something that people say computers cannot do.
00:16:04.960 - 00:16:36.954, Speaker B: So I think that investor process in crypto or VC is you need to be in San Francisco, New York, you have to speak a certain way, you have to wear a patagonia vest or like perhaps this is a caricature, but you get the gist, it works right? So you're copying these surface attributes and I think that substance cannot be imitated. So I felt like I want to do things differently. I know it's a cliche thing to say, but this is how it was.
00:16:36.954 - 00:16:57.610, Speaker B: And I was lucky that a friend of mine, Michael, approached me. So we were buddies from the university days and we started investing together. And later on Jacob joined and know, this is how Zprime sort of came to, you know, the very brand, the website, et cetera.
00:16:57.610 - 00:17:09.800, Speaker B: It had this non serious look. I really felt like I don't want to take myself too seriously, but doesn't mean that we don't take our work seriously. And I was very happy with that.
00:17:09.800 - 00:17:19.878, Speaker B: We did not define the investment thesis. We didn't write a long paper or anything like that. We just said like crypto and crypto related.
00:17:19.878 - 00:17:31.946, Speaker B: So that was kind of the beginning. And one of our first investments was Hive One. So I was friend with Machek, the founder of Hive One.
00:17:31.946 - 00:17:52.734, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys know Hive, but probably hashing that you know it. Yeah, I use it a and for a long time, believe it or not, no one wanted to invest in Hive because it has a rather complicated vision. And we joined the founder on his US roadshow when he was meeting with investors.
00:17:52.734 - 00:18:08.970, Speaker B: And we were present at the meetings in New York and San Francisco. And there I really felt like a total outsider. So one would think that VCs, especially crypto VCs, would be very open and inclusive.
00:18:08.970 - 00:18:23.466, Speaker B: But I could tell that we did not fit this pattern for those guys. And they looked at us with a suspicion and there's an actually funny story. So we had an event in San Francisco.
00:18:23.466 - 00:18:43.074, Speaker B: It was like a panel discussion. And after the event I talked to a founder and I don't remember what his project was, but he was starting a company and we had a good chat and he asked me if I would be interested to invest because he knew that I was investing. And I said that sure, I want to hear more.
00:18:43.074 - 00:19:08.060, Speaker B: And he asked where our office was in San Francisco so that he could come pitch. And when he learned that we're not local, he was, you know, I'm looking for someone local to yeah, for me it was astonishing. So anyhow, we learned a lesson there and I realized that this process based circle jerk cannot be something that will change the world.
00:19:08.060 - 00:19:31.922, Speaker B: So I do not believe that the next big thing will have a private seat round with those regular names in it. So I think that would be too mean. You know, most big name VCs missed out on ethereum but aped into ethereum killers, right? So I wanted to be as far from those type of investors as I could.
00:19:31.922 - 00:19:43.746, Speaker B: So again, it's convenient because Z Prime was an outsider, so it's easy to sort of bet on being an outsider. We were not let in. So I'm not saying that these guys are not smart.
00:19:43.746 - 00:19:54.950, Speaker B: They're probably, in some instances, much smarter than I am. But this is sort of the memetic aspect of Z Prime of the diagram.
00:19:55.110 - 00:20:15.202, Speaker A: Maybe we should actually talk about the diagram, just describe it to the people. Because a while ago, Afisky posted something on Twitter that may have been a meme, but it stuck with me nonetheless. And it shows a Ven diagram with three sets and a Z Prime in the middle.
00:20:15.256 - 00:20:15.426, Speaker B: Right?
00:20:15.448 - 00:20:26.642, Speaker A: And one Ven diagram is reflexivity and it says Mimetics and markets as mirrors. And it has George, soros I think it's Peter Thiel and Rene Giraffe.
00:20:26.706 - 00:20:27.030, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:27.100 - 00:20:38.738, Speaker A: And the second set is optionality with an Asim Talab. And it says risk asymmetry anti fragility and uncertainty. And then the third set is free markets.
00:20:38.738 - 00:20:46.614, Speaker A: The Art of the Dao and Creative Destruction. And it says on the outside, Austrian Economics. And it's, I think, mises Hayek and Milton Friedman.
00:20:46.614 - 00:20:50.122, Speaker A: So what do you mean by know?
00:20:50.176 - 00:21:01.066, Speaker B: Just let me briefly say that yesterday I got an email from a funder fund, crypto funder, fund. And he asked me, like, send some docs on C Prime. I sent the tweetstorm.
00:21:01.066 - 00:21:13.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I sent the tweetstorm. This meme, I don't even remember when I actually did this. But yeah.
00:21:13.714 - 00:21:46.720, Speaker B: So I think that it's more a meme than something that is really fundamental, but it's kind of a good mix about things that we often discuss and we might believe in. So, as I mentioned before, there's this Mimetic aspect. So we want to be aware of Mimetism and always try to assess the reflexivity potential and try to understand the markets, even when we live in a sort of distorted world, one could say.
00:21:46.720 - 00:22:11.880, Speaker B: And then the Talib side is definitely more conventional. Be aware that you're always operating under uncertainty, make bets that are asymmetric to the upside, but that's generally sort of VC portfolio building. But this meme represents this kind of resentment of process, I'd say.
00:22:11.880 - 00:23:01.160, Speaker B: So the fact that I put it in a meme and not written about it, I think it's kind of more defining. And then there's a part, I think it might be in full by Randomness by Nasim Telab, where he wrote that he took a lesson from soros that every time he was starting meeting with investors in his shop, he was making sure the first thing that he made sure is that letting them know that they're a bunch of idiots that don't know anything and they're mistaken prone, but they're sort of endowed with this rare privilege of actually knowing that they don't know anything. So that's kind of the message I'd say behind this, if it makes sense.
00:23:01.770 - 00:23:28.590, Speaker C: But it's also something that kind of reflects on the practice of how Zprime invests. For example, I am more in the camp of being a DeFi farmer, and I always argue with Matty that we should farm more that we have a lot of BTC, a lot of capital that just sits idly. And I'm like we should just put it into yield farms and just earn additional income on it.
00:23:28.590 - 00:23:50.360, Speaker C: And he always argues that it's actually concave strategy, that you either win, I don't know, 1020 30, 40% a year, or you ape into something really crazy, but then the risk is higher. Or you can lose it all. If the smart contract is buggy, or if there is some exploit or if something happens on the layer that secures it.
00:23:50.360 - 00:24:12.394, Speaker C: Zprime is not like we are not farming, we are providing liquidity, we are running nodes and stuff like that. But we definitely keep in mind that we don't want to get into game of picking up pennies before the steamroller. So we try to aim for bets that have much more upside than they have downside.
00:24:12.394 - 00:24:30.420, Speaker C: And a lot of DeFi is not like this, even though it seems like it's like endless money rain but the music may stop someday on some big protocols or DeFi platforms and we don't want to get caught naked when the tide is off.
00:24:31.270 - 00:24:45.910, Speaker B: Yeah, so that sums it up. We generally have a very sort of ad hoc mode of operation. Our thesis is flexible and I would say that each one of us has like a different thesis and even those keep evolving.
00:24:45.910 - 00:24:54.774, Speaker B: So we don't agree on many things, but we're able to remain mostly respectful in these disagreements.
00:24:54.902 - 00:24:57.180, Speaker C: We argue like crazy sometimes though.
00:24:57.870 - 00:25:18.722, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think that this is what helps us. And to be honest, I was plenty wrong since the beginning. Before we had this synthetics moment, we were pretty, I don't want to say bearish, but we were unsure about tokens, right? And we didn't see a sustainable model.
00:25:18.722 - 00:25:31.000, Speaker B: So I call it like for myself, the synthetics moment. It's a credit to the team. I actually realized, okay, we can build these tokenized networks that make sense.
00:25:32.010 - 00:26:00.974, Speaker A: Maybe let's zoom into one of the sets, the reflexivity. Because that's how I found you the first time and it was your article that kind of sue made the connection, right, between you and Derrivit insights and then you sent in your article on reflexivity and imitation and then I read it and thought it was an amazing article. I still think it's definitely in my top three articles that we published on derivative insights in the last year.
00:26:00.974 - 00:26:06.754, Speaker A: It was so good. Everyone should read it, for sure. I would love to talk about that article a little bit.
00:26:06.754 - 00:26:15.970, Speaker A: So what are memes or memetic imitation and how does it affect reflexivity?
00:26:16.550 - 00:26:36.700, Speaker B: Memes, you can look at it from as the meme on the internet, the funny pictures and then there are memes as in the unit of imitation. These are like cultural units of imitation. I would define them, probably.
00:26:36.700 - 00:27:28.330, Speaker B: And reflexivity is kind of do we have to define reflexivity? I think people understand the flywheel. In order to get a flywheel going, you have to put something on the flywheel in a way, right? And memes be they funny pictures which are sort of related to the dockinsian memes. They are the things that can sort of start this because they reduce nuance and they enable us to kind of rally and in a way they might be creating a shelling point but they are the basic units that allow us to kind of communicate without really communicating.
00:27:29.890 - 00:27:55.746, Speaker C: For me, I kind of partially disagree that memes always reduce nuance. When you create a meme, you usually go to a meme template, right? And the meme template itself, it provides some meta position or meta information on what kind of emotion or information you want to convey, but then you treat it as a canvas. You have this template that gives it some structure, but then you can put anything on it.
00:27:55.746 - 00:28:22.378, Speaker C: So it can go from simple jokes that go viral because it's just simply funny, to very deep insights into some sort of a subconscious of the Internet or some particular community. It gives you a sidegeist sometimes. And in crypto, naturally, when markets are going down, you see a lot of memes with pink vojacks bleeding from their eyes.
00:28:22.378 - 00:28:36.500, Speaker C: When markets are going up, you see all these happy green pepper frogs and it's really simple. Then you know that people are happy that number up and people are sad when number down. But then beneath that sometimes you see some more nuanced information.
00:28:36.500 - 00:28:57.302, Speaker C: You see how people think about various stuff and you don't need to read long articles, you don't need to kind of go deep to understand it. You just see a couple of memes and you know, okay, so this is how the current tide turned today. It's not always the case.
00:28:57.302 - 00:29:27.010, Speaker C: Sometimes it's just random jokes, but sometimes you really can have a glimpse into the subconscious. And crypto community is still pretty small and pretty unified in a lot of ways. So you can see it flowing with the memes, which I'm not sure if it can provide you with some actionable insights like I should invest in this or that, but it definitely helps to understand the space and how it is going and what are its values and the philosophy.
00:29:28.390 - 00:29:57.270, Speaker B: It always captures an emotion, right? An emotion is a powerful thing and then your sort of primitive brain takes over. But it's funny because I was creating this design brief for a designer, for HydraDX actually to create some kind of design things for us. And this is a guy that is totally outside of crypto.
00:29:57.270 - 00:30:31.350, Speaker B: And I was like trying to explain DeFi and as I was explaining it and putting different memes in, I realized how weird it must be for someone who's not from the group and that he's just looking at it right now. And I'm describing this anon person who is like a thought leader within or whatever you want to call it. And I realized that you almost create a unique language that if you're an outsider, you cannot really comprehend.
00:30:31.350 - 00:30:53.786, Speaker B: First, they're two different things, like memes as pictures and meme as the unit of imitation. But I think they're becoming very powerful these days. And this is how reflexivity is kind of connected.
00:30:53.786 - 00:31:19.494, Speaker B: Because with this, I know that Fisky disagrees with the nuance production, but I think that it's connected to something going viral. I think I saw a video, it was bezos discussing it, right, that if you want something to go viral, you need to reduce the nuance and add emotion. And this is exactly what these memes are there.
00:31:19.494 - 00:31:21.560, Speaker B: And they will become more powerful, I think.
00:31:22.090 - 00:31:37.146, Speaker C: Well, I'm not saying I disagree completely, but partially there is this YouTube channel, it's pretty small. It's called meme analysis. And this guy analyzes various memes and he probably has some psychology degree or something like that.
00:31:37.146 - 00:32:03.806, Speaker C: So he goes very deep and it's kind of interesting. There is this one meme called are you winning, sun? With the diet coming into the room and the sun is playing on computer or something. And he goes really deep into explaining how the meme can turn from a simple joke which makes fun of this generational gap into complete the collective sadness of present kids who are stuck behind their computers.
00:32:03.806 - 00:32:09.794, Speaker C: And the only way they can communicate is via computer. And it goes even deeper. It was almost depressive.
00:32:09.794 - 00:32:19.340, Speaker C: So I'm just saying that sometimes the emotion you can convey is actually pretty nuanced and it goes much deeper than just happy or sad or funny or whatever.
00:32:20.110 - 00:32:46.674, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree with that as well. And I'm actually convinced that the way we analyze 15th century paintings, right, there are people who do that today. I think in another 500 years, we will analyze people will analyze the memes of the 21st century in order to understand the zeitgeist in a way that you cannot understand any different way.
00:32:46.674 - 00:32:55.960, Speaker A: Because these memes convey such fine information and mood swings, I think that you just don't pick up anywhere else.
00:32:56.730 - 00:33:18.362, Speaker B: Yeah, when you think about it, they protect the secret of the tribe. Because, again, if you do not understand the language of the tribe, these are totally meaningless to you. I just created a meme a couple of minutes ago, before this, just as a responsive thing.
00:33:18.362 - 00:33:29.150, Speaker B: And if I show it to someone, even if I show it to my girlfriend, you wouldn't understand at all. So it's definitely an interesting thing. Interesting phenomena.
00:33:30.210 - 00:33:39.250, Speaker A: So you have created some of the most memorable memes. I mean, how are you so good at this? Like the reasonably sized house and preferring wealth?
00:33:41.670 - 00:33:42.594, Speaker C: How do you do it?
00:33:42.632 - 00:33:46.630, Speaker A: Right? How do you make such viral memes?
00:33:47.210 - 00:34:00.214, Speaker D: Well, first of all, thank you, I appreciate that. But I do agree with you that I think memes, in the old days when you. Read an English literature from the 19th century.
00:34:00.214 - 00:34:37.080, Speaker D: They have tons of these Greek and Latin illusions and they have these biblical illusions, right? Like everything has all these and it's sort of a way to tie information from the past, present, future and it's also a way to communicate that there's some assumed body of knowledge, right? And it can be as deep as you want it to be or as shallows as you want it to be. Like when Dante wrote the like the genius of it too was that it was both commentary on contemporary florentine politics as well as a commentary on so many other things at the same time. And so I see memes that are similar to this where it's like.
00:34:39.930 - 00:34:40.246, Speaker C: When.
00:34:40.268 - 00:34:47.926, Speaker D: I meme about the bottom being in and think things like that. I also think people understand when I have my over the top prefer wealth. Memes too.
00:34:47.926 - 00:35:28.322, Speaker D: I think people understand that it's both a caricature of this, but it's also real, right? It's also like the fact that this is how you get a group of people to really believe in what they're doing and what they're holding, right? Because if you don't, then when you're up ten x, when you're up 50 x 100 x you're just going to press the sell button and then buy a house, right? That's all you're going to do. But if you understand that your house needs to be sized proportionally, then you have to think about it a bit more. So I think for me it's just like I want my followers to do well and to kind of embody the and to kind of get how they should be thinking about crypto.
00:35:28.322 - 00:35:44.460, Speaker D: I'm firm believer that this is the last cycle that you're not going to be able to cutely, just buy an 85% down and then do another cycle all over again. And I think a lot of people don't realize this still. They think like oh yeah, we're just going to go into some backwardation, buy some bitcoin at maybe fifteen k and then do it all over again.
00:35:44.460 - 00:35:57.360, Speaker D: If the things we do matter in crypto, then this is the time that they matter. So I just think that's kind of my general message and I kind of try to convey it as simply as possible, I guess.
00:35:58.610 - 00:36:08.174, Speaker A: I love that commentary. I think it conveys a level of urgency that many people in the space don't have, that they should have. I also agree that this is like the last cycle.
00:36:08.174 - 00:36:33.660, Speaker A: I mean we talked about this in private that if Bitcoin goes to 150K or something, then half of the world's billionaires are going to be from crypto and it's just such an insane statistic to wrap your head around. I mean, that alone shows that there couldn't possibly be another cycle after that, right? Unless we get into the territory of actual wealth creation instead of wealth redistribution, as I would argue, we are in right now.
00:36:35.470 - 00:36:42.506, Speaker C: Maybe. The thing is that we still measure wealth in dollars. We can have multiple bubbles.
00:36:42.506 - 00:37:12.920, Speaker C: Let's say if Fiat will be getting less and less valuable, then if we measure everything in it, then the bubbles are infinite, right? There is nothing stopping it from going higher just because the base is smaller, the base unit is getting less and less valuable. Nobody wants to hold Fiat but everybody wants to measure their wealth in Fiat because that makes them feel like they are more wealthy and the wealth is being created and accumulated by them.
00:37:13.850 - 00:37:29.580, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like a global leaderboard, right? I mean there might be another global leaderboard where people can compare themselves with others in the future, but right now it's the only leaderboard we have and these leaderboards have like insane network effect. It's very hard to move to something else.
00:37:30.590 - 00:38:17.194, Speaker B: And funny that as sue was discussing this perma bubble or the ultimate bull run, I haven't stumbled upon anyone that would actually be able to argue that I was surprised. Mean, we also kind of chatted about it just briefly, but I think that a lot of crypto, OGS, whatever you want to call them, they have this BTSD from all the years that they're calling the top. This is going to be again one of those moments and I understand that, but there are alternative scenarios to that one as well.
00:38:17.194 - 00:38:51.414, Speaker B: And I think that it's interesting to entertain this kind of perma bubble idea. Or maybe it's not bubble because I think that sometimes collective hallucinations can be more powerful than reality and I think that we've seen it outside of crypto markets and this is not anything new and we should definitely talk about it more. And I don't see many people actually being able to even think about it.
00:38:51.414 - 00:39:03.034, Speaker B: And that makes me so kind of interested in a very idea because I don't want to say it's contrarian, it's not really contrarian, it's pretty independent I think, and it's pretty risque as well.
00:39:03.072 - 00:39:38.200, Speaker C: Right, well, I created this GIF which shows all the bitcoin bubbles if you want to call them and it's like what? Six of them already? And each one was like order of magnitude bigger than the last one. So after like five or six times people kind of learned this pattern and they expect it to occur again. So when sue says that now the pattern will be broken, it's actually pretty bold claim and people are getting ready for another bear market for another -80% because they already seen it in the past couple of times.
00:39:38.200 - 00:40:18.674, Speaker C: When you are betting against that, you are betting not just against it objectively happening, but against the narrative as well. Because when people expect it to happen, it can become a soul fulfilling prophecy, which if enough people await for it to happen, then when bitcoin will grow high enough, some people may just make it happen by having itchy trigger finger and just sell their load. So it's actually very hard to bet against this narrative, not the objective reality that makes sense that crypto is here to stay and to change the world in a meaningful way.
00:40:18.674 - 00:40:27.330, Speaker C: But the narrative is still very strong among many, even big bag holders that may turn the tide just by selling.
00:40:27.490 - 00:40:33.110, Speaker B: Yeah, you're betting against a very powerful ironic meme of this time is different, right? Yes.
00:40:33.180 - 00:40:52.042, Speaker A: Right. That actually brings us back to the kind of narrative investing and reflexivity, right? Just because people believe something will happen that can make it happen. And that's one thing that I actually took away from your article as well, and that I also strongly believe in the bubble theory of money, right.
00:40:52.042 - 00:41:20.310, Speaker A: Bitcoin is or like money is the bubble that never pops, right? It keeps growing as a bubble and then when it's large enough, then it doesn't need to pop because it has become useful, right, because it actually is liquid and is a network of people to transact. Right. So what do you think we can learn from this analysis of memes and reflexivity and narrative about investing in the crypto markets?
00:41:22.810 - 00:41:39.750, Speaker C: As I said before, it's very hard to take any actionable advice just seeing a meme and then investing in something. What I would say we can learn is that reality is largely negotiable. And let's say there are like two types of fundamentals.
00:41:39.750 - 00:42:12.694, Speaker C: One are these hard fundamentals that people learn at school, like how to value a company, how to do accounting and how to then invest based on that. And then there is other type of which I also believe it's fundamental, but it's much less a science and much more an art. The fundamental perception of reality by crowds and by communities now even amplified by social media.
00:42:12.694 - 00:42:49.620, Speaker C: The best example, which I believe we all agree on, is Elon Musk, who became richest man on the earth. Not by having the most successful car company, because it's not they are not producing nearly enough cars to be the biggest one, but by selling the narrative, combined narrative of this new type of car that is much better, and also connecting it to his other dream, which is Colonizing Mars. And people are just jumping on that narrative bandwagon more than they are jumping on the future cash flows of Tesla, the company.
00:42:49.620 - 00:43:27.194, Speaker C: So this is the best example of all the financial analysts I know. Even my good friends from traditional finance who are investing in stock markets for a long know they were shorting Tesla or they were at least skeptically bashing it, saying know, I don't want to short it, but I don't think it's sustainable or anything. But if you invest according to hard fundamentals, only according to DCF and value investing principles, you probably won't lose too much money, but you also will miss the biggest opportunities you can find during any timeline.
00:43:27.194 - 00:44:13.706, Speaker C: Not only this timeline, but I believe any timeline had some hidden opportunities that were so outside of the box of traditional fundamental thinking that they were unreachable to most of the educated crowd. And that's why Pepe de Frogs and NEETs became link Marines and made it, because they understood that it's not about the token being value accretive, it's about the narrative. And this is something that I don't want people to just abandon the hard fundamentals and just disregard stuff that maybe matters in an economic sense, but just don't take it for granted that this is the way to think about the world, because it clearly isn't.
00:44:13.706 - 00:44:18.014, Speaker C: And we have many examples of it not being the best way to think.
00:44:18.052 - 00:44:54.074, Speaker B: About the world because you asked about what we can take from it and what we can learn from it. What's the lesson? I think that we should look at value investing Warren Buffett as a meme as well, and then try to look at new memes that will help to redefine the fundamentals because I think the fundamentals can be defined only exposed in a paradigm shift or whatever you want to call it. So I think that's the lesson and the best stories in history are those that are being told all over again.
00:44:54.074 - 00:44:55.958, Speaker B: Right? So that is also a lesson.
00:44:56.134 - 00:45:28.050, Speaker D: That's such a good way to put it, I think, where there's definitely this school of thought which thinks that value investors are the rational ones and then anything that is not value is therefore a bubble. It's going to pop or it's going to and if you just think about it, this is nothing new, right? I mean, when Apple was going to make the like, there had been smartphones for years in Japan, there had been all this stuff before. They just sold the vision, they had the community, they had the memes.
00:45:28.050 - 00:45:47.980, Speaker D: Right? And memes are fundamentals. I think in a sense there's no distinction, right, where you think about a different world, where Palm Pilots had a much better community, had a much better meme, they were just designed in a different way. We'd be all using Palm right now, probably.
00:45:47.980 - 00:46:13.902, Speaker D: These are all things that I think you can't separate out. And that's why I think especially for value investors, when they come into crypto, they expect a lot of things to look the same as they do when they go and buy a cash on cash business. And what they don't recognize is that the Internet is a new medium, right? And you should look at what would look like fundamentals on this new medium.
00:46:13.902 - 00:46:18.598, Speaker D: What would that be? Right, so I think that's kind of what you're getting at as well.
00:46:18.764 - 00:46:36.262, Speaker A: I feel like we discussed a lot of takeaways, actually for investors in the crypto space, like way more than you predicted right in the beginning. I fully agree. I was on board with this before, that crypto is actually all about the narrative.
00:46:36.262 - 00:47:12.022, Speaker A: I mean, crypto is like bootstrapping a new money and bootstrapping new networks is a form of coordination game and the memes are a coordination mechanism and the fundamentals like the tech is also a coordination mechanism in a sense. So if the tech doesn't work, then the memes, they sort of take a hit, right? And kind of the coordination takes the hit because it can't really play out. And that's why often I feel like you see projects do better before they actually release anything tangible that people can actually try.
00:47:12.022 - 00:47:40.830, Speaker A: Because at that point, like before that point where they actually release their product, then the optionality in the minds of investors is still so big that they can project anything. Like any meme can project it on a project that doesn't exist yet. But when the project actually exists and has to meet their expectations of investors in the real world then kind of the meme can often die and then kind of the whole narrative and equilibrium will reset.
00:47:40.830 - 00:48:12.060, Speaker A: Before the show started, we talked about how is it possible that something like Cardano or Iota, how is it possible that they are still in the top 20? These projects are so shit to put it frank, they have nothing going for them but they have the community, they have the memes and they have not ever had to face a reality check in the real world, right? They don't have a product. But I think this offers like one explanation for why they can stick around simply because they never had to fulfill the investors expectations yet.
00:48:12.590 - 00:49:06.362, Speaker C: This is something I wrote a while ago on Twitter as well, that when the project is in pre launch stage, the optionality is endless, it is shapeless, it can become basically anything it wants and investors are kind of pricing it in in a way that they are betting on it being a new internet or whatever. Once the project becomes tangible, once it starts doing anything outside, once it starts getting real traction, which you can measure, which you can evaluate, you can have hard metrics on stuff like fees and unique addresses, then the optionality slowly disappears and the reality kicks in. But for these projects that never get to that point of actually being used in real world like Iota, this never happens.
00:49:06.362 - 00:49:29.490, Speaker C: So the story can go on without reality checks. I agree that as long as they don't start doing anything real, they can really go ahead with the narrative. And with every bull market it kind of resurrects because there are new people coming in and they are enamorated by the narrative the project tells.
00:49:30.070 - 00:49:47.010, Speaker A: Yeah, the investors buy the narrative. They don't buy something that they actually intend to use or that even someone else intends to use and that's why it works. That actually brings us to another article that you wrote, Matti, which is kind of the scapegoat mechanism.
00:49:47.010 - 00:50:25.862, Speaker A: So Giraff argued that whenever there's conflict between different people or groups of people then you need a way to diffuse that. And one way to diffuse it is kind of they find a common scapegoat and then they sacrifice the scapegoat and then the friction is resolved. And you linked that to crypto, which I thought was amazing, and applied it to the DeFi bubble, quote, unquote, right, that we can't even remember anymore because the DeFi bear market didn't last for very long.
00:50:25.862 - 00:50:33.880, Speaker A: So you argued that kind of WiFi and Andre Cronier was sacrificed by the community so that DFI could live.
00:50:34.810 - 00:51:08.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that I felt that I actually wrote, like, the very first draft of this sometime in 2018, when I saw so much hate towards ethereum and vitalik during the dump. And I was like, this is the scapegoat for this cycle. It was so transparent, and yet there's a unique kind of property of even bitcoin, like being resurrected in a different narrative.
00:51:08.770 - 00:51:27.922, Speaker B: So with bitcoin, it's always something else it still works for. And ethereum the same thing. So I think it kind of works in crypto, too, but probably it's sort of accelerating, so the cycles may be even shorter.
00:51:27.922 - 00:51:37.098, Speaker B: We might not even notice that there was a cycle and there will be like a constant stream of scapegoats that get resurrected into something else. Possibly, yeah.
00:51:37.184 - 00:51:51.438, Speaker A: That's why I wanted to actually bring up the article, because since we talked about narratives and how narratives are fundamentals, I think it's important to understand what happens when one narrative dies. How can it actually be replaced by another? What is the mechanism there?
00:51:51.604 - 00:52:21.034, Speaker B: I think one problematic narrative that I see all throughout since bitcoin, it's the sort of narrative of equality. And I'm afraid that that's a very kind of red herring narrative. Like, we think that it's going to solve world's equality, inequality problems, and I truly think that this is wrong.
00:52:21.034 - 00:52:40.590, Speaker B: It would be nice if it was like that, but crypto is like, internet is a leverage, but crypto is even more powerful leverage. And I don't think this solves the problem of the little people, or whatever you want to call it. Crypto will not help to solve inequality.
00:52:40.590 - 00:52:58.360, Speaker B: It will create generational wealth for people with particular skills. But I don't think this will change. I mean, there's this saying that I always keep repeating, the more things change, the more they remain the same.
00:52:58.360 - 00:53:21.658, Speaker B: And this is the kind of the meta narrative, not only within crypto, but since the French Revolution, probably before that right. That keeps on playing again, again, and we always fail to kind of reach it. I think that this is very sort of potentially destructive narrative.
00:53:21.658 - 00:53:40.500, Speaker B: If that plays out wrong, the conflict and the violence cannot be sustained to markets and can be sort of spread outside of market. And this is always bad when the sort of thematic conflict sort of escapes the market.
00:53:40.950 - 00:53:55.160, Speaker C: By the way, Matty actually predicted what happened with Jarn and Andre. He started to write the article even before it really happened. He's just reluctant to publish a lot of his writings up front.
00:53:55.160 - 00:54:18.922, Speaker C: But yeah, I have to give him a lot of credit for this particular idea that materialized pretty quickly. On the other hand, I'm a bit more optimistic in this. Crypto is not like a solution to all problems, but as in history, there is a conflict and then there is resolution of that conflict.
00:54:18.922 - 00:54:32.658, Speaker C: But we are getting better over time in many areas. It's not like we are stuck in any particular era of conflict. We are creating new conflict while resolving the old ones.
00:54:32.658 - 00:54:49.994, Speaker C: We are getting better at coordination, even stuff like startups. The old internet was dominated by a couple of big startups funded from Silicon Valley and only these people got asymmetrically rich. Right now.
00:54:49.994 - 00:55:35.718, Speaker C: I'm not saying everyone will be equal or equally rich, but it levels the playing field on how can we get there, how can we make it like startup founders today? If they are doing some DFI project with early liquidity, they can cash out partially much sooner than in eight years in IPO. And other people can join them openly and freely from all over the world to kind of start building that project with them and get piece of the pie much earlier than they would if they were waiting for Facebook IPO to invest in. Or they can join the project or the company on GitHub or in Discord without really applying for a job.
00:55:35.718 - 00:56:13.442, Speaker C: So this coordination, I would say that will make some things better the same way internet made media, let's say better by allowing people to be YouTubers instead of having to go to TV to kind of broadcast their message. So I'd say this will help a lot in some areas, especially in finance and in startup world. At the same time, I definitely agree that we won't see any utopia communism or anything like it that would create paradise on earth with everyone being equal or anything like it.
00:56:13.576 - 00:56:36.060, Speaker B: Sure. But I think that it's overselling this idea of inequality solving inequality that can create this potential sort of straw mans that sort of haters could pick up on. I've seen a couple of journalists mentioning like bitcoin genie coefficient and stuff like that.
00:56:36.060 - 00:57:34.590, Speaker B: I just think that after a decade we're going to end up with extremely wealthy people, crypto people that might be very near the top of the very richest of the world and nothing of the inequality problem solving thing doesn't materialize, then that might be serious backlash. I actually thought that this radical market movements that will be picked up by sort of the smarter of the New York Times journalists and all this kind of left wing people in the US. But it didn't because the web free narrative, it's pretty powerful because it fits their anti Google, anti fang propaganda.
00:57:34.590 - 00:57:50.882, Speaker B: But I haven't seen it kind of being picked up by those guys. But I saw that this is a cool thing for them to actually it's smarter than just being what they are right now. Yeah.
00:57:50.882 - 00:58:01.954, Speaker B: So I just think that this is a potential very powerful narrative that, if not fulfilled, can create a strong backlash.
00:58:02.082 - 00:58:22.490, Speaker A: I think this topic is super interesting, just like hearing what you guys think, how the world is going to look in 20 years if kind of the last crypto cycle actually plays out. And I also see two big conflicts there. I think I agree definitely with you, Matty, that crypto will be massively worth centralizing.
00:58:22.490 - 00:58:46.038, Speaker A: I think whoever says something different, I think I strongly disagree with that. Crypto is itself like a large network, right? It expands the internet over even a wider range of people and geographies, and makes it possible to conduct commerce from everywhere in the world without using your identity. It's like massively leveling the playing field.
00:58:46.038 - 00:59:04.700, Speaker A: But by doing that, it expands the network. And networks offer like extreme leverage. One person can reach a billion other people, right? And hence many markets will be winner take all and sort of the best product can win the whole market, right, or the best coupled products.
00:59:04.700 - 00:59:23.620, Speaker A: So on the one hand, you have this wave centralization where you have a new class of super elites from these original crypto natives. But at the same time, I feel like we have people that don't really reflect about the need for government in this world. And that's what I would like to talk with you about.
00:59:23.990 - 00:59:41.762, Speaker B: I have a sort of shorter answer to that. So when we kind of bridge it to what we were just talking about. So I think that potentially, I don't know if it's correct, but equality of opportunity creates more inequality of outcome.
00:59:41.762 - 01:00:14.298, Speaker B: Possibly people do not talk about it a lot, but possibly this could be how this plays out. And then obviously, with the increased ability to become free, only certain individuals can become free. So then, on the other hand, you will have to have this compensating role of government or welfare state or UBI or whatever you want to call it, that will kind of act as a balancing force to that.
01:00:14.298 - 01:00:37.000, Speaker B: So on one hand, you create this radical freedom tools, whatever you want to call them, and on the other hand, you need something that will compensate for it. Right? And with COVID I actually tweeted about it, I think that this really strengthens the welfare state. Yeah.
01:00:37.000 - 01:01:07.426, Speaker B: And I'm sort of afraid, because I see it in my home country, that this is kind of a window of opportunity for certain political ideologies. I don't want to say I'm scared, but I'm definitely concerned. And I don't know which is worse because I believe that there's a sort of health crisis out there.
01:01:07.426 - 01:01:26.360, Speaker B: Right? But I don't know if the health crisis is worse or the potential crisis of epistemics or whatever you want to call it. Is worse, so I don't know which one is worse, but definitely it's a problem.
01:01:28.270 - 01:01:43.686, Speaker C: It's a hard topic, and I don't feel like I can add too much. Just crypto for me is, like, ability to choose. Not even, like, ability to choose to hold bitcoin instead of fiat, but also ability to fork.
01:01:43.686 - 01:02:00.834, Speaker C: If I don't like something, I still can fork. And I know it's hard, and it's hard to fork something with network effects and start anew. But if there is a system that provides this ability to kind of leave and to have multiple options, it's always more healthy than if you are stuck in one system.
01:02:00.834 - 01:02:23.834, Speaker C: So hopefully, I hope this will be the case. I'm not sure crypto will keep offering this ability to choose within itself as well as outside of itself. How this translates to physical world, where you still can have borders and armies, I'm not sure, but I would say it helps a lot.
01:02:23.952 - 01:02:34.106, Speaker B: Yeah, I would be actually interested to hear from sue, because he lives in singapore, right. If I'm not mistaken. And it's a unique sort of government.
01:02:34.106 - 01:02:40.526, Speaker B: Right. So what do you think about is the role of government there is pretty kind of unique, I would say. Right.
01:02:40.526 - 01:02:47.600, Speaker B: And it's always talked about. I mean, it's a city state, so it probably has different sort of inherent guess.
01:02:48.050 - 01:03:17.994, Speaker D: I think singapore kind of shows maybe a way forward for a lot of broad types of governance, where, because it's so small, they can really set policies that are a bit heterodox or a bit kind of not. They don't have to have a huge debate about it for several years. They can just weigh it and then do this kind of pragmatism, decide what is correct.
01:03:17.994 - 01:03:30.014, Speaker D: Like, when crypto first came around, singapore actually had a lot of exchanges. And then after silk road, the government decided, for whatever reason, this is just not something we want. So they kicked them all out.
01:03:30.014 - 01:03:44.498, Speaker D: They lost all their banking. Itbit moved to new york, coin moved to Japan, a few others had to go overseas. And then in the past few months and really the past year and a half, they thought, wow, all these billionaires are getting into it.
01:03:44.498 - 01:03:52.520, Speaker D: Tech guys are in it. This is great now. So a lot of the cryptogees have moved to singapore in the past year.
01:03:52.520 - 01:04:20.362, Speaker D: They've really supported crypto now. So I think singapore kind of shows an interesting thing where it's like the government is very much just trying to be where it is, be where the whole market is going. I think, for me, crypto is the most Sci-Fi part of what's happening in the world right now, and you generally want to be where the most Sci-Fi stuff is, because that's most likely what's going to grow the fastest.
01:04:20.362 - 01:04:42.790, Speaker D: And so I think singapore has always been kind of on that forefront and seen it as sort know, we don't stand around it and say, this is good or bad, we just say if this is going to happen, then we want to be a part of it. So I kind of see government as being very accommodative to crypto up to a point at least the smaller governments. You kind of see that in Estonia or some of these smaller countries like Malta as well, to some extent.
01:04:42.790 - 01:04:55.722, Speaker D: But I do agree with you. I think that it's going to be a big reckoning down the line as you get this extreme inequality from this. And I think also that one of the things that kind of scares me about the US.
01:04:55.722 - 01:05:17.518, Speaker D: Is that I think they're definitely headed toward a more European system of sort of asset taxes where the richest people in the US. Haven't been paying tax for many years now, right? Like Trump, he's a billionaire, hasn't paid tax in at least 15 years that we know of, so possibly more even before that. And a lot of these big tech companies haven't paid taxes since IPO.
01:05:17.518 - 01:05:50.482, Speaker D: So I think you might see a short term phase where probably not in the next few years, but maybe in the next 2030 years, you may see a move toward European socialism if you have democratic socialists take power. And it'll be really fascinating to see how crypto deals with that narrative because there are some elements of it that those type of folks actually really like about crypto. And then on the other hand, there's some that they're going to have problems with or they're going to try to influence the governance of these crypto networks with their own kind of normative views.
01:05:50.482 - 01:06:38.074, Speaker D: So I think on netlike, the government reaction to crypto, I think in the medium term, will be very dovish, because they see it as accommodative, they see it as sci-fi, they see it as something that give it a chance, see what happens, and then maybe after it happens, there's a further reckoning again. And they say, was this what we actually wanted to happen or not? And then if it was, and these people do rise up to the values and make society better in the way that societies that are democratically elected, they would think that this is actually better, what we've done here, this is not worse. So I think if crypto does fulfill that kind of economic freedom mandate and it does make people's lives better and easier on Net, then I don't think people have that much to worry about.
01:06:38.074 - 01:06:52.510, Speaker D: I mean, in every kind of epoch you've had wealth inequality from early adopters from this kind of thing. I don't think that's anything new to crypto. And I do think there will be a lot of selling on the way up from OGS, so I don't think they'll actually be as rich as people think.
01:06:52.510 - 01:07:01.890, Speaker D: Just thinking back to OGS that I knew in 2013, yeah, some of them are rich, but a lot of them are actually a lot poorer. Than you would think. So I kind of see the same thing going to happen this time.
01:07:01.890 - 01:07:24.954, Speaker D: I mean, I remember talking about ethereum with some folks, like when it was at $100, and people saying, yeah, it's going to go to 10,000 immediately, tons of those people sold at $500, tons of them sold at $1,000. So I think the whole inequality thing, it's like these gartner hype cycles. A lot of guys sell at their first five X, their first ten X, and so there's no difference, and it keeps distributing out.
01:07:24.954 - 01:07:37.310, Speaker D: So that would be kind of the dovish case for crypto inequality, where it's not going to be as bad as people think. It's going to get distributed just from price going up, from people being log wealth. If I can use that meme.
01:07:39.970 - 01:07:40.286, Speaker C: In.
01:07:40.308 - 01:07:47.086, Speaker A: That sense, maybe it's extremely good that it's such a strong meme that there will always be another bear market, because if there wasn't, like, people didn't believe.
01:07:47.108 - 01:07:48.126, Speaker D: In that, that's how we trap there.
01:07:48.148 - 01:07:48.750, Speaker A: Would be no reason.
01:07:48.820 - 01:07:51.360, Speaker D: That's how we get their coins, that's how we get.
01:07:54.610 - 01:07:55.360, Speaker C: You.
01:07:58.650 - 01:08:14.290, Speaker A: All right, guys, hope you enjoyed the first half of our conversation with Matti and Fiscantis of Z Prime. Please come back next week where we talk about polka dot, different layer, two solutions, and the role of ethereum and bitcoin in a world of increasing blockchain interoperability.
