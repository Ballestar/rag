00:00:00.410 - 00:00:43.994, Speaker A: Hey, welcome back to Uncommon Core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. Today I'm sitting down with Suzu, my friend and co host, and Josh of Orthogonal Trading. Josh is one of the most experienced options traders in crypto and we had a very interesting and wide ranging conversation. Topics we touched on today include how how options work, differences between options and futures, different strategies for using them in crypto, as well as what Josh thinks about options trading platforms in DeFi. Please enjoy. So.
00:00:44.032 - 00:00:44.282, Speaker B: Hey.
00:00:44.336 - 00:00:51.290, Speaker A: Welcome, Josh. Why don't you introduce yourself real quick and what you guys do over at Orthogonal?
00:00:51.650 - 00:01:18.274, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. It's very exciting to be on this podcast. I listen to it religiously when it comes out. So we are Digital Asset focused hedge fund. We run three main buckets of risk, I guess you would say. We do a lot in options making and taking that we predominantly take. We do some market neutral arbitrage stuff in both CFI and DeFi.
00:01:18.274 - 00:01:47.406, Speaker B: So that could be anything from farming to purpose physical ARBs or other types of ARBs. And then we do some systematic trend following stuff as well. So that's kind of gray black box over a few different time horizons focused mainly on BTC and ETH, but we'll do some other assets if they're moving a lot. We kind of allocate our risk between those three buckets depending on the opportunity set at the time.
00:01:47.588 - 00:01:52.910, Speaker A: So I take it you have a background in traditional finance before coming into crypto?
00:01:53.890 - 00:02:35.598, Speaker B: Yes, my background before Crypto was I was a macro portfolio manager at an internal hedge fund down here in Australia at the bank I was working at. So that was kind of like your classic macro prop desk where you came in at the beginning of the year and had some limits and some stop losses and went for it. I did that for several years. That desk was kind of being wound down and so then I went into crypto. I joined a firm, Digital Asset Capital Management, working with a guy named Richard Galvin as their head of trading. So I had a great time there for a couple of years. Yeah, we did a bunch of stuff.
00:02:35.764 - 00:02:37.966, Speaker A: I think we are both huge fans of Richard, right?
00:02:38.068 - 00:02:39.550, Speaker C: Yeah. Love, Richard.
00:02:39.890 - 00:02:42.342, Speaker A: We should definitely have him on sometime.
00:02:42.506 - 00:03:31.280, Speaker B: Yeah. I introduced Richard to Carl and sue if my memory is correct. Yeah, a long time at Dacam for two years and then at the beginning of this year I left there and to set up my own firm with a few partners. So my partners from traditional markets as well from predominantly vol backgrounds. One from Morgan Stanley Trading FX options one a senior guy who was at a lot of different shops but he was at firms such as BlueCrest as a senior PM. There we've got another guy who is a Dev who came from some of the large Japanese banks. So now we're four strong and chugging away.
00:03:32.930 - 00:03:34.820, Speaker A: I love your accent, by the way.
00:03:35.350 - 00:03:36.194, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:03:36.312 - 00:03:38.610, Speaker A: I don't know too many people from Australia.
00:03:40.070 - 00:03:44.046, Speaker B: I don't know if my accent is a lot Australian or a little Australian.
00:03:44.238 - 00:04:00.326, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not sure. It's very easy to listen to, for sure. How is the crypto scene actually in Australia? So you guys manage your own balance sheet but also have some outside capital, right? So did you raise from Australia how's the scene over?
00:04:00.428 - 00:04:25.710, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So we run our own balance sheet. We do some slightly different stuff with our own balance sheet to what we do in the fund. We do, like, for example, we'll test strategies out, like systematic strategies and stuff with our own money before putting external people's money into them, just to make sure they're all working properly. We do a bit of VC stuff as well, where it suits strategically in terms of our fundraising.
00:04:25.710 - 00:05:15.758, Speaker B: It's not much from Australia, actually predominantly from Asia, but more the kind of classic Hong Kong, Singapore, China, and we have some funds from Europe and the America as mean. Yeah, the Australian crypto scene, I would say it's pretty good. I mean, obviously, Melbourne is a huge hub for DeFi. And there's some stuff, I guess, happening in Sydney. We have Akuna who are, if not the biggest, certainly one of the biggest options market makers in crypto. They have a Sydney office. So there's some option stuff, at the very least, happening in options.
00:05:15.924 - 00:06:12.340, Speaker A: Good change of topics. So that's actually the main reason I wanted to have you on, because you're one of the biggest options traders in crypto, mainly on the taker side, and I think you're very good at making things sound understandable and simple. So I really admire that. Love following you on Twitter, for sure. We've done an episode on sort of a 101 on perpetual swaps a couple of months ago, actually, I interviewed sue and that was our most popular episode back then. So since then, a lot of people have requested that we do something on options as well, sort of give people a basic intro. So can you describe in your own words what an option is and how it works?
00:06:13.030 - 00:07:17.714, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Now, I'll probably do a terrible job of keeping things simple, but the classic definition would be that it's a derivative that gives you the right, but not the obligation to transact at a certain price at a certain time in the future. So if you buy a call and let's say it expires in a week's time and the strike is $20,000 per one BTC, then you have the right, but not the obligation to buy the amount of face worth of BTC that you bought in that option. So if the option was for ten BTC, and the spot market ends at 21,000 after a week, you can buy ten BTC at 20,000, and you'll make your profit of $1,000 times by ten. And likewise, if you're the seller, then you sell the option. So if they want to exercise, you have to. And you got the opposite position in practice, there's no like, oh, I'm not going to exercise.
00:07:17.714 - 00:07:21.510, Speaker B: If you're in the money, you get exercised, and if you're not in the money, you don't.
00:07:21.670 - 00:07:35.710, Speaker A: But theoretically, very basic question. So when I buy a call option and it expires in the money, how does the settlement work compared to a futures contract?
00:07:36.770 - 00:08:34.478, Speaker B: Well, different platforms in different markets will settle you in different fashions. Like, some will cash settle you, some will physically settle you for an exchange on derribit. How the settlement process works is like half an hour before expiry, you have your delta from the options, and it will then tell you what your delta of your derivative account will be after expiry. So if you're delta hedging your book, ie. You're keeping your directional exposure to a minimum, you will use that period to adjust via perps or OTC or futures or whatever your position such that it's flat at the end of that period. If you just outright have the option, then basically at the end of the period at settlement time, all your exposure goes away and you get your BTC or ETH payout in your account. So it effectively cash settles in.
00:08:34.644 - 00:08:47.480, Speaker A: Okay, so if I buy the option to buy like a BTC at ends at 21K, then actually need to buy a bitcoin, right?
00:08:48.170 - 00:08:54.280, Speaker B: No, you don't have to just get that PNL in your account, basically.
00:08:55.210 - 00:09:20.234, Speaker A: Okay, so going back to your original explanation, so I picked up three key terms, I guess that maybe our listeners should understand. The first being kind of the strike price, right. The second, the expiry date. The strike price is basically where you can buy or sell the asset.
00:09:20.362 - 00:09:32.500, Speaker B: Yeah, correct. And sometimes you'll see people refer to the strike price as k. So like on Twitter or wherever, the strike price equals K. Okay.
00:09:33.110 - 00:09:37.970, Speaker A: And then the expiry date is just the date when the option expires, right?
00:09:38.120 - 00:09:38.890, Speaker B: Yep.
00:09:39.070 - 00:09:43.142, Speaker A: And the third being kind of the premium, what you paid.
00:09:43.276 - 00:10:08.750, Speaker B: Yeah, premium is the cost of the option. If you buy ten of an option and the option costs a dollar, then your premium will be $10 spent. Effectively, if you buy a call and it's limited loss, you'll long it, then that that $10 premium is your max loss for that position. Assuming no delta hedging.
00:10:10.290 - 00:10:28.390, Speaker A: So I would assume that our listeners, all of them, are familiar with kind of how futures work because we've done a very intensive episode on that. So how would you describe kind of the differences between the two types of derivative?
00:10:30.410 - 00:11:08.370, Speaker B: I think one way you could describe them, assuming that we're just talking about kind of longing options and not shorting options, is and if you don't use a stop loss on your futures position, then your futures position is obviously unlimited loss and you can end up getting liquidated or whatever. If you're in an option, assuming you don't use the entire account balance on that option, your max loss will only be the money you put down. So that's one aspect I think that's pretty different, is that you have a limited loss versus an unlimited loss.
00:11:08.790 - 00:11:13.394, Speaker A: And by unlimited in the context of crypto, we always mean busting your account, right?
00:11:13.432 - 00:11:26.550, Speaker B: Yeah. Zero, negative 100%. What's another difference? Let me think of sue. Do you reckon you get more leverage on like a highly levered perp or on a call? Probably on a call. Right?
00:11:26.700 - 00:11:38.140, Speaker C: I think a call also, I think the biggest value of a call over a perp is really that your stop loss is defined better right. So that you kind of don't get wicked out.
00:11:38.750 - 00:11:41.020, Speaker B: Yeah. You can set and forget it almost.
00:11:42.350 - 00:11:46.400, Speaker C: So I think that's probably the biggest difference.
00:11:47.570 - 00:12:43.210, Speaker B: Another difference between I think a future or a perp and an option could be if you buy a perp, a market goes up, you make money. If you buy, say, an option that is $1,000 out of the money and the price goes up by $600, that option will decay to zero and you're still out of the money expiry and you'll suffer your total loss of the premium. So while the options have a limited loss on an expiry, you obviously make money during the option as it rallies. But in an expiry sense, you don't have that guarantee that you will make money if the market rallies, because the market has to rally through your strike and through your strike by enough technically to cover any of your costs as well. They're probably the two main differences.
00:12:43.370 - 00:13:20.906, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like especially for someone who doesn't have kind of an automatic trading setup and is kind of hooked directly into the Exchange API and can basically has a manual kind of stop loss system. I think that it's a very valuable feature of options, basically, that it's kind of set and forget. Because I've tried to use stop loss in futures both on BitMax and FTX, it never really works the way you yeah, yeah.
00:13:21.008 - 00:13:29.840, Speaker B: Well, the wicks in crypto are real even without mex being so dominant, they're still pretty serious when they want to be.
00:13:30.290 - 00:13:50.802, Speaker A: Yeah, not just the wicks for sure, but also when the market actually gets to the price where you set your stop loss, you're basically never getting filled there because on the way there, there might also be liquidations queued up, so you're not first in the queue basically to execute.
00:13:50.946 - 00:14:37.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree with that. I mean, obviously if you want to short options, that's a different ballgame with very different risks. But if we're talking long options, then you get plenty of leverage, especially if you buy what you would call like a wingy option, which is an option with a low delta or a low probability of going in the money. You can buy a lot of those types of options for a small amount of cost, only lose what you put in. But yeah, there's no guarantee that at expiry time you are right. But I guess in a sense that means you've just got a long time before you have to worry about effective stop triggering.
00:14:38.970 - 00:15:07.502, Speaker A: Yeah. So you touched on long options and kind of the short side being the way more risky one. That's something that took me a moment to wrap my head around. Right, because if you're used to futures, then kind of the opposite, the counterparty of every long is kind of a short. Right. If you have a long view on the market, then you just long the future. If you have a negative view on the market, then you can short the future.
00:15:07.502 - 00:15:20.850, Speaker A: Right. Whereas in options you can buy a call or you can sell a put. Right, and those have very different risk profiles.
00:15:21.190 - 00:15:48.794, Speaker B: Yeah. They may give you a similar delta exposure so your effective spot position, but they'll give you different. The other Greeks they give you will be very different in a first order sense. So if you long the call, you have your long delta and you have some long gamma and you pay theta and your long get into what those.
00:15:48.832 - 00:15:50.218, Speaker A: Mean a little bit later on.
00:15:50.304 - 00:16:01.520, Speaker B: Yeah. And if you sell the put, you still have the long delta but everything else is the opposite basically. So the scenarios you want that make you money are pretty different.
00:16:02.370 - 00:16:14.034, Speaker A: Yeah. Every time you sell something, whether it's a put or a call, then your loss is unlimited. And every time you buy something, then your loss is limited to the premium you paid, right?
00:16:14.152 - 00:16:16.200, Speaker B: Correct. Yeah.
00:16:17.850 - 00:17:13.318, Speaker C: I think an interesting philosophical way that I've had options explained to me in the past that I think might be useful for beginners is that when you're buying options, you're long volatility and when you're short options, you're short volatility. So when you buy options, you're hoping that the market will move more than other people expect it to move. Right. So when you buy that call, you're betting that the price of that call, the price is not reflecting as much upside volatility as you expect. So in other words, you choose the option to express that view because you think that that gives you the most upside. And same with the put. You buy the put when you think that the market is not pricing it as much downside volatility as you.
00:17:13.318 - 00:17:48.690, Speaker C: It's really, it's really about your own view on volatility and whether or not you think the market is overpricing it or underpricing it. And that kind of gets to what Josh just mentioned now about Greeks, right, where he talked about theta, gamma and vega. These are all just different ways that you can quantify your exposure to volatility. So think framing it that way where you're either long ball or short vol. I think it's a good place to start to understand what kind of risks you're taking on when you do a strategy.
00:17:49.270 - 00:18:52.562, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. You could add as well that in options there are a lot of different ways to trade options. You can just buy a single option and just say you buy a call. Just worry about did I buy a call that I think is reasonably priced and do I make money on it? Or you could be much more complicated and analyze a bunch of kind of options, specific metrics to see if that was a good outright way to trade a delta view. Or if you don't want to trade options for delta as a convex way to get a good payoff for, say, a long option position, then you might run a relative value book where all you care about is the Vols. Sometimes you don't even care if it's a call or a put, you just care about what that vol is on the curve or the surface. And you have multiple long and short options at any one time across every risk bucket.
00:18:52.562 - 00:19:03.898, Speaker B: So you can make it simple and you can make it complex. And I think it depends on what you want to get out of it, really, and what your expertise and experience is.
00:19:04.064 - 00:20:30.360, Speaker A: Sue, you mentioned that philosophically, one way to think about options trading is kind of betting on volatility, right, relative to kind of what the market expects. And the first time we talked about options ever on this podcast was in the context of uniswap appealing. Right? So when people put two assets into a pool, they're kind of rebalanced by the market. And in terms of exposure, it is like selling volatility, right? So they give up kind of the extreme top side and the extreme downside and yeah, kind of the volatility is kind of compressed. So you suggested that one way to hedge that exposure, which is we also call it impermanent loss, typically would be to buy volatility, actually. Right, using combination of two options. So I want to get into some of these things people use options for in crypto, maybe going through the different stuff, both very simple, like one directional stuff and the more kind of complex combinations of products that people might be interested in.
00:20:30.810 - 00:21:50.510, Speaker B: I mean, I think you can probably separate them into hedging and speculating to start with. So speculating is kind of just buying or selling an option based on whatever your prevailing view is. And then hedging might be like the AMM example where your negative gamma from being an LP on the AMM. So you say buy some strangles or straddles and you try to structure it in a fashion whereby your negative gamma is mitigated but you still net earn some sort of money from fees or yield being given to you in the form of a token or whatever. Gamma being the rate of change of your notional position for a move in spot. So if you have X amount of gamma and spot goes from one to two, your position won't be the same, it'll be a function of the gamma position. I don't know if I explained that very well, but what kind of options.
00:21:50.580 - 00:21:54.370, Speaker A: Are in a strangle?
00:21:55.030 - 00:22:37.550, Speaker B: So strangle is just a long a strangle and a straddle are kind of the same thing in terms of what options they are. So a straddle is two options. A put in a call of the same strike and a strangle is put in a call that are different strikes. So if you're trading, say, in the macro world and you just want to buy like a grunty vol position, you might go in and say, hey, I want to DNS thanks. What's your vault? And that stands for delta neutral straddle. So you basically buy like the at the money put and the at the money call. You have no delta exposure, you just have like a large vol exposure.
00:22:37.550 - 00:23:45.410, Speaker B: If you think that the value in options is more on the out of the money stuff than the at the money stuff, then you might buy a strangle, in which case that's still delta neutral. If the delta is on, the strike is the same, obviously, but then you might buy the 25 delta put and the 25 delta call. So they give you kind of the same risks in the sense that you're long bowl and you pay a premium to own those options. But the second level would be that you have different risks in a local or local sense, or if the market moves a lot. So you'd buy the strangle. If you thought the market was going to move a lot and the out of the Monies were very cheap, but if you just thought the market was going to kind of move locally but the Vol was cheap or you thought the smile was fair I e the value of the out of the monies compared to the out of the monies then you might go the straddle.
00:23:47.030 - 00:23:56.930, Speaker A: So, yeah, you separated them into speculation and hedging and I guess most speculators would take play only the long side of options, right, to kind of call buying.
00:23:57.010 - 00:24:27.300, Speaker B: I think you see a lot I actually think you see a lot of speculating in options selling for yield. I think that's one thing that's changed in the market. I think like maybe 2019, 2018 even, you saw a lot of the speculating was just people punting long options. And now I think there's been a bit of a shift where people are quite keen to earn some yield, so they'll come in and sell them or sell them in some sort of product. I think that's changed a bit.
00:24:27.830 - 00:24:31.890, Speaker A: I actually had them down here as the third category, yield enhancing.
00:24:32.230 - 00:24:33.954, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, that would be.
00:24:34.072 - 00:24:40.790, Speaker C: That is speculation, but just in a nicer word when it's you're totally right.
00:24:40.940 - 00:25:29.400, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. There are lots of good examples, I guess hedging in macro world in terms of using hedging options for hedging in crypto. Yeah. Miners is the classic one where they buy puts. They either buy puts or they sell the risk reversal, which is buying puts and selling calls. So that's the classic minor hedge. Another one might be like a fund or an investor that's long biased or long only and wants some downside protection, so is happy to buy some puts and if the market tanks and so be it, you've protected yourself, and if you lose the premium, you're fine because you want the market to rally anyway.
00:25:31.050 - 00:26:39.690, Speaker C: I think another form of Hedging that people don't think about as much but kind of like bullish hedging, if you'll allow me that meme is when people think their fund is going to get more subscriptions or a lot of money is going to come into their fund to buy BDC. Then they may buy a call spread or buy calls to hedge that inflow because they'll say, I want to try to lock in a good price for those people if the money is already confirmed, but just the fiat hasn't hit yet. So I think you also see call buying in that context, and that's actually quite common in equity markets, right, where people will buy calls to hedge their expected inflow the next month, things like that. So hedging can also be like hedging fiat into BDC. Like, let's say you're a trading firm and you expect to make X amount of BDC next month on a trade. You may want to hedge and just lock it in, but you may not have the capital yet to go long spot and you don't want to get liquidated on long perps. Then you may buy calls instead because you know, you can fully fund that in a day once you get the cash from your proceeds, for instance.
00:26:40.510 - 00:27:39.840, Speaker B: I think you could even extend that too. This is going to maybe sound really silly, but like hedging your longs with calls, whereby let's say you're bullish and you've got a large pert position, but you're also terrified that the market's going to have some sort of nasty pullback. You can take some of that premium or some of that profits and put it in a call instead. So unless you're not going to be buying a call that is the same delta or notional position as your spot position is. So you're reducing your directional risk, you're lowering your PNL vol by putting it into that call. So in a sense that I would say is really a hedge I e. Definitely it's not necessarily profit maximizing, but it's vol lessening like PNL vol.
00:27:40.370 - 00:28:36.194, Speaker C: You're basically creating a synthetic put for yourself, right. What you want is you want to be able to protect the price that you can get out of your deltas at by changing it into a call. So I think that's also, I guess, another interesting example tying into yield farming is back in July August when WiFi had come out, and there's a lot of good farms, stablecoin farms with curve and compound and so on. I think a lot of BTC denominated players that we speak with as well as ourselves, it was interesting to think, like, you can sell your BDC to USD Farm with it at 100% APY on huge size. And also then buy calls. And the calls get you your BDC exposure back. And the yield from your yield farm kind of pays for that call.
00:28:36.194 - 00:28:40.526, Speaker C: Theta, this may be too much alpha.
00:28:40.558 - 00:28:43.780, Speaker B: Leak, but I think yeah, we did that as well.
00:28:44.470 - 00:28:47.638, Speaker C: These farms are mostly dead now, so I feel okay talking about it.
00:28:47.644 - 00:28:48.918, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's fine.
00:28:49.084 - 00:29:03.340, Speaker C: But yeah, I think thinking back to that's, one of the most obvious trades and it's a hedge where you basically have no downside because even if Bitcoin goes to one K, you don't care actually, you probably make money.
00:29:04.030 - 00:29:36.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in that scenario, well, certainly if you're liquidating your farms into Fiat and BTC gets smoked and you're farming like a stable, then that's a great outcome because you'll lose a bit on your calls, that's fine, whatever. But you will be able to buy a lot of BTC back cheaper with the Fiat you've accumulated, right? And I mean, if the market does tank, you don't even necessarily if you're like a sophisticated trader, you don't even necessarily need to sit on that core delta, right. You can just go and hedge it and try and get the deltas back lower.
00:29:36.232 - 00:29:36.900, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:29:37.430 - 00:29:40.850, Speaker B: Yeah, we did that as well. I think that was kind of no brainer.
00:29:41.670 - 00:30:10.622, Speaker A: We touched on oil selling and that there are a lot of products now where people are kind of exposed to that. So I think Binance has a pretty popular one. I'm not sure if they call it like dual savings account or something. And then Matrix Port, I think, also has a product in that direction where you deposit BTC right. And then they sell calls on that BTC. So what do you think about that kind of product?
00:30:10.676 - 00:31:30.014, Speaker B: In mean, I think that selling calls is great until it's not and then it's really not at all very good. Think of it like, I guess probably depends a bit if you're covered and what strikes you're selling and what premium you want. So, for example, if you're selling calls in a market that's grinding higher and there's no real prospect of any explosive up move in the short term, that's one thing. If you're selling calls with BTC at could be at 22 in three minutes, that's a whole different ballgame. And I think also think of it like, if you want to earn x yield, say you're long xBTC and you want to earn y yield, you can sell a higher delta call, a call that's closer to the strike in an amount that might notional match your you know, you have the BTC, and you'll be okay. You just cut off the upside, which everyone is kind of here for, but that's fine. But if you then go, oh, you know what, I don't actually want to be selling my BTC at that level, but I still want to get that premium, then you end up selling a further out of the money call, but you have to sell it in much more size to get the same premium.
00:31:30.014 - 00:32:13.478, Speaker B: So you can be in this situation then, where you're not actually fully covered anymore. And I've heard of some firms that have done this, then you actually just outright short calls because you're long 100 BTC, but you short 200 calls. And then you have at that point, like a super wingy position with a lot of vola vol and other kind of more complicated Greeks on it. So I think the covered call is always going to be around, and I can understand why. I think there's times and places for it and depends a bit. If the volleys up there are 200, then sell all the covered calls you want because it's super worth it. If the Vols are like 30, then I don't think it's a very good idea.
00:32:13.644 - 00:32:36.480, Speaker C: I think also covered call just as an idea, it's very similar to being a Uniswap or Sushi swap LP. It's not good or bad on its own because it's also about what you would have done instead anyway, right. Like, if you would have worked to sell wall on coinbase at 21K, then you might as well sell a 21K call right.
00:32:38.290 - 00:32:40.080, Speaker B: If I get there, yeah.
00:32:40.530 - 00:32:47.138, Speaker C: Because you would have put the offer there anyway. So this is strictly better than putting the offer there somewhat. It's still not quite I was going.
00:32:47.144 - 00:32:57.160, Speaker A: To ask you about that because you tweeted something very interesting the other day where you said there's options. I can't remember the strike price, actually, but.
00:32:59.290 - 00:33:00.934, Speaker C: Seventy two k. Seventy two k.
00:33:00.972 - 00:33:14.534, Speaker A: Seventy two k, yeah. You said if you plan on I mean, a lot of people have this kind of like plan that they stick to, where if there's a big run up in BTC, they sell some BTC at different prices.
00:33:14.582 - 00:33:14.746, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:14.768 - 00:33:38.546, Speaker A: And they force themselves to stick to that. And you said if you are going to sell it near seventy two k anyway, then why not sell these calls, right? Is that strictly better than not doing it? If you have a plan where you definitely want to sell there, or am I missing something?
00:33:38.648 - 00:34:35.262, Speaker C: The main difference is that if the price gaps through your limit price, what you would have done selling the call is better strictly because you're getting the time value of that option that's being paid to you by the call buyer. Right. You're getting money every day that. The price doesn't get there by expiry. And so if you already have those BTC and you would have sold there anyway, then you're adding on that premium value to your net worth. So that's free money in the sense that you would have sold there anyway. The obvious question will be like, why are you the type of person who sells at some price anyways? Why are you that type of person? Right, but that's getting into risk aversion and that's getting into lots of other kind of very tricky concepts.
00:34:35.406 - 00:34:45.240, Speaker B: Yeah. Your decision should be a function of the context at the time, not because you decided when you were lying in bed three years ago that that was the price you wanted to sell at.
00:34:45.930 - 00:34:51.000, Speaker A: Well, I mean, empirically people who right.
00:34:51.390 - 00:34:53.450, Speaker B: Assuming you make good decisions, I guess.
00:34:53.600 - 00:35:19.326, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's why the efficient markets people, they kind of fundamentally don't really get market sometimes. Right. Because the average Joe, he does not wake up and think about what is optimal. He just tries to live his life a little bit better than the day before. Right. So in that context, selling a call on BDC he already owns may be a great strategy, because if it doesn't get there, maybe he uses that premium to buy more BDC and then he sells more calls each time.
00:35:19.326 - 00:35:47.526, Speaker C: And if it gets 72K, he's not fussed about it because maybe he has some cold storage as well and he's okay letting these BD go to some fund that bought these calls from him. Right. So it's all about risk aversion. It's all about what is the purpose of wealth to you. Right. Options kind of crystallizes that nicely because I do think the log wealth, linear wealth talks. It really comes into play with these wings on BDC calls.
00:35:47.526 - 00:36:04.820, Speaker C: It's like, does anyone need more money when BDC is at 72K? Some people don't need more money, they have enough. So selling a 72K call makes sense for them because they don't need more money after 72K. They can buy their reasonably sized house and they can move on.
00:36:05.430 - 00:37:17.394, Speaker B: Yeah, because then you have the participants who are I'm not quite sure what the perfect way to phrase it is, but they're like pure EV maximizing. So whatever their wealth is at 72, BTC is irrelevant to them. What's relevant is, have I made maximum returns on whatever's happened in the last X time period up till now? All right. Now and as a slightly separate thing on those wingy options, there's been some pretty large flows going through over the last month in some of the 32 to we'll trade a lot of those wingy options both top side. And downside, but with no real view on the spot. If Spot is going to be in the money on that option at that specific time. Because those wingy options give you a lot of grunt in certain events.
00:37:17.394 - 00:37:33.360, Speaker B: So there's some quite nice kind of strategies that carry fairly well, that have a lot of oomph behind them that you can kind of get into by dilling in those wingy options because they're so convex to be long.
00:37:34.930 - 00:38:14.458, Speaker A: Josh, you said something earlier that really fascinated me, and I want to kind of move into that direction. So there are people who trade only spot or futures or options, so they trade always the same exact product. Right. But then another way to look at trading, and I'm sure this is how you actually look at it and longer term investing is that you should first think about kind of the exact kind of financial exposure that you want based on kind of your general beliefs about the market. And then you create a mix of products to create that bet in a sort of capital efficient way, right? Yeah, in general.
00:38:14.624 - 00:39:23.198, Speaker B: So, I mean, if you put that into options, terms of like, I want to be long, and I think the market's going up over the course of the next month, there are a bunch of different ways, not infinite, but there's a lot of ways you could express that view, depending on how many options you want to trade, et cetera. So, I mean, you could say, I'm going to be long, a bunch of spot, and I'm going to buy a put, and that put is a hedge and it protects me and I can be long the spot and not have to worry about taking profit or not having to worry about getting wicked out. Like, I've got protection for a month or whatever. So that's like a pretty simple way. Then you have the, oh, I'm going to buy a call and I'm just going to spend the premium on my call, and if it pays out, then that's great. I guess I could give a bit more context of the actual specifics of the options. So if you're like a professional, you might do that put because you think the Vols on the downside are really cheap and the Vols on the top side are quite expensive, but you want to be long and you're kind of bearish vol.
00:39:23.198 - 00:39:47.560, Speaker B: Like you think we're just going to grind higher. You think this skill is expensive, so maybe you just want to be like, short some puts and you think vol is high, so you want to be short some puts, and maybe you want to be long spot and structure it such that you can deal with whatever happens on the downside. Right. It's not like you're going to sit on it or the calls. You might think, oh, Vols are generally cheap. These calls pay out pretty well. I don't want to get wicked out of my spot position.
00:39:47.560 - 00:41:10.562, Speaker B: The calls are cheap relative to the puts, and the Vols are fairly priced, okay, I'll buy some calls and I'll sit on them. Or then you might say, okay, well, I don't want to be short and naked option to the downside, because I might not want to run the spot position all the time, and I don't want unlimited losses, et cetera, but I don't want to spend all the premium to buy a call. And I think Vols are fair to maybe mildly expensive, but they're like broadly whatever, and the difference between calls and puts, maybe calls are a bit expensive, but it's not crazy. So I'll do a call spread and I'll buy like a ten k call and sell a 15K call and just sit on it and see what happens. Or you could then say, oh, you know what I actually think because that will give you basically a long delta exposure where you pay less decay, but you have a limited upside and limited loss because you sell the call. Right? So the asymmetry of that is a lot of that asymmetry is determined by what is that vol that you're selling that call at, at least relative to the vol you're buying the call at. But then you might say, well, actually, I think Vols are expensive here, and I think the SKU is too well, crypto flip it around.
00:41:10.562 - 00:41:45.150, Speaker B: So I think the SKU is too cheap, ie. Calls are too expensive, especially the wingier calls. So maybe I want to actually be long spot. Well, I want to be long delta rather, but I want to be short vol. So to be short vol, well, I have to buy a ten k call, and I have to sell 215k calls. So I now technically have unlimited loss to the upside. But the break even on that trade is obviously going to be very good because by the time you get to your short strike, you've already made $5,000 per lot.
00:41:45.150 - 00:42:33.582, Speaker B: So your break even is well above that strike. And you can do those ratios, they call them in any ratio. Or you could say, well, I think that skew is really in crypto would be expensive. I think puts are way too expensive relative to calls, and I think I'm very bullish and the market is just not going lower and I just want leverage to be long. So you might do a risk reversal. You might sell a put and buy a call and just leave it so there you've got the same delta view, but every trade has different to very different Greeks on it. And, I mean, you can get more complicated than that.
00:42:33.582 - 00:42:45.220, Speaker B: And if you're trading your book in a fashion that is even like remotely delta neutral, then to get something optimal becomes more complicated again.
00:42:46.390 - 00:42:56.438, Speaker C: What do you think about the way you roll over, actually? How do you handle the quarterly and the monthly expiries in terms of your thinking of it?
00:42:56.604 - 00:43:49.638, Speaker B: It's kind of painful, especially when you get like, outrageous deltas at expiry. Well, two things we do, one thing we do is as we kind of come into the expiry, where we can we try to hedge our options with options. So we'll try to kind of sell some options or buy some options back, such that at Expiry our life will be easier as long as it doesn't give away too much money. So we do a bit of that to help us, I think from a trading standpoint, otherwise you just kind of grit your teeth and do the best you can. From a micro market standpoint, I think it has an impact. I think even sometimes the weeklies have an impact, to be honest. Obviously, if there's a huge amount of Oi or a huge amount of strikes, that makes a difference.
00:43:49.638 - 00:44:45.640, Speaker B: But I'm not convinced that you even need necessarily to have a huge amount of total Oi. I think if you've got kind of the right players with the right strikes in the right size, even if the total Oi is not that big, they can still have quite a large impact on the Spot market, right? You might just have a random Friday where a Delta neutral guy has got, I don't know, like 3000 X of a strike that's in the money and he hasn't to Delta hedge it and nothing's happening and there's not like this huge expiries, but one dude has a massive ticket to do so. I think it's a bit random. I think it's hard to create a strategy that's like high alpha around it, aside from sometimes it'll matter and sometimes it won't, and just kind of assume that it has some impact that's hard to benchmark. That's probably not very useful though. What do you think?
00:44:46.010 - 00:45:23.940, Speaker C: Yeah, it's tricky for us. We generally use options for hedging as well as for speculation when we think it's good value. So it's definitely painful to manage the expiries because because we'll usually just buy Spot. If we need to replicate in the TWAP window to get the Deltas back rolling, we try to match off with the flow that got us in the position in the first place. So I feel like doing it then is the ideal time, right, when you get the big self load coming back in.
00:45:24.470 - 00:46:23.890, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. I guess if both people decide they want to fix it up, then that works. We have had instances because we run multiple different books, right? So we run what do we have now? Maybe like seven derivative books for various reasons, and we replicate positions across denominations, obviously, but you get differences and we have kind of two Volstrats that we run, so sometimes they'll have different risk. So there are times where one book might have like 200 BTC to sell and the other book might have 100 BTC to buy. So in those instances we can just match each other off. But if that's not the case, then you just kind of got to chip it in, right? It can be a bit of a pain though. Like if you got a large Delta well, if you've got a large changing your delta over expiry, right? And you want to keep that delta.
00:46:23.890 - 00:47:17.878, Speaker B: I mean, you can end up say it's like you're long if the market's getting belted over, that like half an hour, 45 minutes window, and you're having to run like 30% to 50% longer than you would like for expiry purposes, it can be a real pain. Honestly, I think the most crazy thing in the market these days is what I alluded to on that call, which is like every Friday after expiry, or even slightly before Vols just get destroyed. It's pretty common for front end to be down like ten to 20 volts between 05:00 Friday night and like 10:00 a.m. Saturday morning, right. They just come in and murder. Yeah, they come in and they just basically destroy it. So there's stuff like that where it's kind of like sometimes I just sit there shaking my head, just being like, what are you doing? But they just don't want any decay.
00:47:17.878 - 00:47:19.340, Speaker B: Over the weekend, I think.
00:47:21.230 - 00:47:56.674, Speaker A: We touched on a lot of different of the so called Greeks, and I do want to get into kind of the basics of how to price options and what actually are those Greeks and what they mean in podcast format. This can't really replace people sitting down and actually reading through a proper explainer and maybe playing around with it. But in your own words, how would you explain how to price an option, what those different factors are?
00:47:56.792 - 00:48:53.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you're trying to price an option, all you're trying to do is figure out is the value of this option. Fair or not? If it's not fair, is it too cheap or is it too expensive? And you can take two approaches to that. You can take the market maker approach, or you can take the kind of, I should call it the relative value approach, market maker approach, or you can take the kind of directional, pure buy side approach. So I mean, in crypto lab, most people use a standard kind of black shoals pricer, which has a few assumptions. I won't go into too much detail, but you can Google it on Wikipedia. It's like a fairly standard in traditional markets, I'd say. There's more complex models being used now, like FX practitioners often use like well, mainly Stochastic volatility models are used, but there's a few different models.
00:48:53.670 - 00:49:56.422, Speaker B: But for crypto purposes, most people use black shoal. Still. In one sense, if you're a price taker, you almost don't need to price the option per se because it's pretty simple. Like you think you can make that if option costs X, you think you can get far enough in the money that you're like X plus something, then you should buy it, right? You don't really care if it's worth 70 vols or 72 vols because you think it's going to go ten X. So you're vol insensitive to some extent. And there is that thing that if you want to trade an option and the market makers are showing you X and Y is their bid offer on their two way price, you pretty much have a choice where it's like, well, I can trade it or not trade it. So it's like maybe am I slightly overpaying for an option? Maybe, but do I think I still have an edge in it? Yes.
00:49:56.422 - 00:51:03.514, Speaker B: Okay, well, I'll just trade it. That's the like, it is what it is what it is. If that's what the market price is, do I think it's expensive or cheap by some small amount, then so be it, right? I've done like a fair chunk of that where it's like, well, yeah, this option is probably like two Vols expensive, but I'm going to hold it. And maybe it's just a punt in my PA, for example. Well, maybe it's slightly expensive, but I think it's going to go from six K to don't really care if you want to trade the Vols properly. So, for example, what a market maker will do, like a market maker will have their models that will be spitting out what they think the fair Vols are and then they will have basically it spits out what they call like a theo, which is a theoretical vault, which is what their vault is basically. And then they will put their bid offer around their theoretical vol such that they have an amount of vol edge, ie.
00:51:03.514 - 00:52:29.130, Speaker B: Spread that they're happy with. And then they will just auto quote that all day because according to the prices that they use, every time someone crosses that spread, they're paying too much or too little. And when you have they'll have a book of pick x summer number of strikes, 100 strikes across like ten tenors and it all kind of they netted out and that's how they make their spread. So that's the kind of classic market maker or you have the relative value firm where they'll look at all the Vols as well, like a market maker. But they may not necessarily have a theoretical vault for every single strike on every cereal because that's just overkill, right? Instead, they might have a firm like us, for example, might have a bunch of analytics and we might have our own kind of discretionary views on smiles and SKUs and flies and curves and baseballs and all kinds of stuff. And so we'll run our analytics or whatever and it might say, okay, well this part of this SKU curve is cheap or this part of the smile is expensive or whatever. And we'll have our views of, well, I think the curve is too flat, I think the curve is too steep.
00:52:29.130 - 00:54:00.810, Speaker B: And once we kind of get to our, I guess, bit more kind of quantitatively driven but more holistic view on where the value is, then we'll dive in in more depth to that specific part of the market. So then we'll go and we'll have a look at all the specific options. Which one's going to decay the best, which one's the cheapest? If X happens, which one will give you the most convexity, what's the best thing to sell against that or buy against it? So instead of trying to model a theoretical value and build a two way price on every option, we'll basically come to a view of what we want our books to look like, what is the view? And then we'll just deep dive into those specific options and we'll have more of a general view on the other options, right? So that's the kind of the third way to do it. And within that, there are a bunch of different vault trading techniques you can use depending on how you want to trade it. And there's a few heteristics, I guess, that I find helpful about. If you want to be long convexity, think of it's probably a small athlete, but I think it's okay. But you want to buy options that when you want to sell them will be hard to buy.
00:54:00.810 - 00:54:28.020, Speaker B: So everyone else wants to buy them, and you want to sell options that when you want to buy them back will be easy to buy and everyone will want to sell them. So if you have that in the back of your head, if you're trading like a kind of book with multiple options and legs in it, then you tend to end up in a scenario where if this shit hits the fan, you've generally done okay.
00:54:30.310 - 00:55:18.798, Speaker C: It's a very good answer. I think it's very illuminating. If you think about also a lot of participants, they get overwhelmed by options markets because they think it's all about the model. They think it's all about you need to have the most cutting edge model. You need to have the biggest eggheads in your firm, right? And actually, for practitioners, they realize that for a small subset of participants, what they are trying to do is classical market making. They're trying to match off the most expensive, the richest part of the curve with the cheapest part of the curve to put on those positions such that their Greeks are manageable, their risks are managed, and then they're capturing the difference between what people are willing to pay for the most expensive stuff versus the cheapest. But then outside of those players, there's a whole wide spectrum of discretionary players.
00:55:18.798 - 00:56:08.020, Speaker C: And it really does make it very important to have a view as well on how the markets will evolve. Like Josh said, what kind of options will be very hard to buy if the market moves this way, what options will be very hard to be very easy to sell, and these kind of things. So I think if you look at in the traditional markets, right, there is a lot of trades where the balls become irrelevant. If you have true alpha asymmetric alpha on the delta, right, like, let's say dollar CNH calls, when the price is near seven and you're PBOC, and you know you can defend seven, then the vault is irrelevant. The vault is irrelevant. Even two vault is too high. Similarly, like Euro Swiss puts before the Swiss National Bank, right, you can pay any vol you want.
00:56:08.020 - 00:56:55.138, Speaker C: There's even philosophical debates about, can you actually price a model using a vault model, or is it all mental, right? So once you realize that, then you realize the model is irrelevant. If you're a true big player in the market, or you're a big speculator in the market, and you feel that bitcoin is an exponential koshi process, then all calls are mispriced, right? Because at any point, bitcoin can go up 100 x or 50 x or ten x within the course of a few days. So from that point of view, putting a model on it, you may say that any call spread, you want to buy the wing, because your mental model is different from an options practitioner's model. Right?
00:56:55.304 - 00:57:55.166, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, you could have an example of that. An example of something now might be, okay, I can sell 21, 22, 23K calls at somewhere between, say, 65 and 80 volts, and I can earn that premium. That's cool. But what happens to Vols if BTC goes to 21K? Even accounting for what you would call the roll or slide, like on the Smile, which would be as your option, delta changes, your vaults will change. But even accounting for those factors, which we don't have to go into, I'm pretty confident that if BTC went from 19.4 or wherever it is now, and at the end of this podcast it was at 22K, those Vols would be you'd be lucky.
00:57:55.166 - 00:58:58.694, Speaker B: No? Well, for a start, you wouldn't be able to buy any, but if you were managed to buy some, you're probably paying well in excess of 90 volts. So that's a vault that looks obviously, people are happy to sell it. They're happy to sell it now because we haven't gone above twenty k and whatever. But that's not necessarily I would say that's a very bad bold, to be sure, because the scenario where the market goes higher, you're probably in a disgusting position, and in the market, the scenario where the market goes lower, it's probably going to be relatively sharp sell off. So initially volz may even be supported on that. And certainly if you're running a delta hedge book, that roll down on the Vols will hurt you because your 30 delta option will roll to a ten delta option, and the vol you have on that option, even accounting for lower Vega, will go from 60 to 80. So I think that's not a very good vault to sell.
00:58:58.694 - 00:59:11.180, Speaker B: For example. Those types of options seem like obvious buys, really, irrespective of what your actual spot view is. But I mean, I personally think the base vows are generally on the low side here anyway.
00:59:12.690 - 00:59:29.010, Speaker A: So something maybe that what's interesting to me is kind of what your original answer didn't say. Are we kind of interested in do you think it's not necessary to understand what the different Greeks are and how they work in order to be an options taker?
00:59:29.590 - 01:00:17.330, Speaker B: No, I think if you just care about if you just want to punt a spot view via an option, then as long as you can compute what your payout is and what your loss is, you can be profitable. There are definitely crypto traders in the market who are not professional volt traders, but very good delta traders and they make a lot of money trading options. But I mean, I would say most of them know all the basic Greeks, but their money isn't necessarily coming from Greek analysis. It's coming because they've found some cheap or asymmetrically payoff profile options that support a generally correct spot view. So I mean, you can definitely do that.
01:00:17.400 - 01:00:44.650, Speaker C: That's definitely true. That's definitely true. And actually I would even go further than that. And I would say a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing because I was speaking to Light about this the other day. But when he started to realize that he's paying these vault spreads, whatever he got really into trying to get the best price possible and trying to buy in the mid of vault. But by definition you can't do that anyway. You have to just ask all the market makers and then buy the best offer.
01:00:44.650 - 01:01:09.266, Speaker C: Right. Because as a taker, that's priced in. And part of that priced in is that makers will know sometimes you're sharp and the market will go in your direction. Right. He said because of that he ended up missing out on half his size right before the big C pump in 2019, where it went from like seven K 7.2 to eleven K in 24 hours. Right.
01:01:09.266 - 01:01:25.746, Speaker C: So it's stuff like that where how much Greeks do you really need to know to trade options? I honestly don't think it's very much at all. I think knowing too much and then thinking about it all the time actually will make you a lot worse because you won't.
01:01:25.778 - 01:01:28.118, Speaker B: Yeah, there's some leveling, there's a lot.
01:01:28.124 - 01:02:34.638, Speaker C: Of leveling where you want to get the absolute best possible fill at the best possible times. You want to start being a market maker yourself, but you start to lose the whole point of trading an option in the first place as a speculator, which is that you're exploiting the curve because you think about buying stocks. Right? I try to give this analogy. When you buy stocks, you're also not analyzing every single exchange, making sure you get the absolute best TCA, making sure you get the absolute best possible price because the size of your gain, if you're right, is so much bigger than any optimization you can do on the microstructure that it doesn't matter as much. Right. And I think the same applies in options as well where you think about the put sellers that have come into the market and if they have hundreds of millions of fiat, behind any put that they can sell is free money because they'll buy the spot themselves, right? Like saylor if he knows he's going to buy half a billion of spot and he can sell a one week put, that to him is actually free money. Free money.
01:02:34.638 - 01:02:55.618, Speaker C: And imagine him thinking about volatility, right? It would be mentally ill for him to think that way because of the flows in crypto. There are a lot of these times where people do have this kind of value. A lot of times when the SKU moves a certain way or the curve moves a certain way, it's like is it value or is it a trap? These kind of things are always in the mind.
01:02:55.784 - 01:04:01.850, Speaker B: It's often sticky, like it's persistent when it moves, even if it looks wrong, there's generally not for no reason. And in a macro world, there's so many smart people with lots of money sitting around like trying to ARB out every little thing that if you see something that's a bit wrong, you can put it on, it's pretty much done, you can take it off the next day. Crypto, you might have to sit on some sort of RV position for months as it all goes through the market. And that is just both painful and not a very good use of your VAR. I think the other point you made about a little bit of knowledge can be dangerous thing is a super important point actually, because in a sense you start trading options, you learn some stuff about options. You become at the point where you start to trade the volves or whatever. But it's pretty unlikely that anyone self taught and just a lot of people, generally speaking, are going to have an edge in that relative value, kind of highly technical, vol playing field.
01:04:01.850 - 01:05:49.740, Speaker B: Unless they have the experience of learning from someone who's done it or having done it in a professional environment, your edge is just very unlikely to be large in that sense. I think the key is really just to say, well a what type of options trading strategy do I want to employ? And B is it realistic that I can employ this strategy and have some positive EV? So if you're kind of an average or normal trader, the answer to that question is likely going to be, okay, well, the strategy that I have the most EV in that I can employ without making gratuitous errors by accident or, like, leveling myself or doing something where I think I know what I'm doing, but I make a mistake. That strategy is likely going to be some sort of directional options trading strategy where you buy calls, you buy puts, you buy put spreads, you buy call spreads, you buy straddles, you buy strangles or. You sell them and you just look at the payoffs, you look at maybe realized versus implied vol and just like a chart of vol and does it look low, does it look high? Kind of thing. And then see where realized is and you look at the difference between the Vols and the call and the puts to see which is more expensive and just take those pieces of information, basically, and try and put on a trade that has some positive returns to it. Right. And trying to go in and think about, well, the smile and the smile and the curve and what's going to happen to the curve if this vol moves here and what's this van going to do, and what about my volley vol and all this kind of other stuff.
01:05:49.740 - 01:06:02.990, Speaker B: The Greek that represents my skew, what delta do I need to run to hedge that skew out, you're just going to end up in a disaster. My personal opinion.
01:06:03.330 - 01:06:05.540, Speaker A: Okay, so I have one final question.
01:06:05.990 - 01:06:07.906, Speaker B: That was a bit of a rant, sorry.
01:06:08.088 - 01:06:25.430, Speaker A: No, it's very interesting. I have one final question, which is we all love DeFi, right? Decentralized finance on ethereum, and there are a couple decentralized options protocols now Hedgek Open, I don't know if there are any more.
01:06:25.500 - 01:06:52.238, Speaker B: Actually, I think there are a couple being I've heard of one that's being built, but there's two that I know of that are kind of currently in development. Siren? Well, yeah, there's siren, there's another one. Pod. Pods Finance is another one and then there's a couple more, but I don't think I should say what they are yet. But there are a few out there. Definitely Hedge and Open are the dominant ones. Yeah, for sure.
01:06:52.324 - 01:07:04.802, Speaker A: So what are the trade offs between decentralized options platform and the current you can't even say market leader. Right. Derby Bit owns like over 90.
01:07:04.856 - 01:08:12.810, Speaker B: Yeah, it is the market, although I see is kind of growing. I mean, I think one of the major, and I'm a big fan of Derby, one of the major advantages that Derbybit have over everyone Bit, CFI or DFI is portfolio margining. It's very hard to trade options in a professional capacity without portfolio margining, even if you want to do basically it means that you don't have to put up the entirety of the sold option. So when you buy a call, you put up the entire premium. If you sell it, you get like a margin credit because you're not outright short a call in a call spread. Like your short call is matched off with your long call, basically just means you get more. And basically the portfolio margin at its core allows you to sell options with good collateral usage, basically, so you don't have to put the full notional down for every option you sell.
01:08:12.810 - 01:08:24.138, Speaker B: So without that, it's very inefficient to run any sort of portfolio that has any short options in it, basically, and I don't think anyone else is doing PM. So that's a huge advantage for them.
01:08:24.224 - 01:08:43.620, Speaker C: I think it's not really easy to do in DeFi too, unless you can know where you're going to source your liquidation from because the only way you let someone sell a call, let's say for more BTC than they put up is if you know how to liquidate them when BTC goes to the moon. Right. Because they won't have the money to pay out. So they need to stop their position.
01:08:44.550 - 01:08:48.002, Speaker B: That that will have unlimited loss, right? By definition.
01:08:48.146 - 01:09:22.122, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And it can go unlimited overnight. Right. So as we've seen plenty of times. So I think that that is a struggle. That was our thesis when we invested in derribit too, which is that clearing is a network effect in options where the more people come to derribit and trade on portfolio margin, the more people want to as well, because that's the best, most capital efficient way for you to express your options views. And so I think DeFi is going to have a lot of problems with that unless they can also source, let's say, the perpetual swap.
01:09:22.122 - 01:10:44.010, Speaker C: You kind of need a perpetual swap market primitive yeah. To be able to hedge off that option because otherwise, anything else you can come up with would just be mentally, it would make no sense because you have to liquidate an actual option, and then you need to have someone sitting around to have capital ready to trade that it's strictly worse than everything in CFI by a lot if you do that. I think Hedgek is interesting and we do participate in Hedge in the sense that you put up capital and then you are saying whoever comes, they'll buy options from me and I'm selling in this indiscriminate way. But I think the nice thing about that is you get kind of like a synthetics kind of a mentality too, where people then come and then they feel a need to trade on it without necessarily checking the best price. So they're not that price sensitive. They just like the idea of using Hedgek while also being a part of it, while also staking in it. You kind of get this kind of not very price sensitive action and not very capital sensitive action, which I think is very good for Hedgek and for any product which manages to achieve.
01:10:46.350 - 01:10:51.178, Speaker A: Mean some people do value. I mean, Derek now has KYC, I.
01:10:51.184 - 01:10:53.206, Speaker C: Think starting exactly January.
01:10:53.318 - 01:10:55.610, Speaker A: So that's maybe the big advantage.
01:10:55.690 - 01:11:12.466, Speaker B: Yeah. The other thing I think to us his point was when it comes time to liquidate that person on that short option, if it's like an extreme circumstance, I mean, even on Derby, when the stuff really gets wild yeah, even on.
01:11:12.488 - 01:11:13.486, Speaker C: Derby it gets nuts.
01:11:13.518 - 01:11:46.126, Speaker B: You can't trade right. There's either like nothing on the screen or the volumes are too small. It's not that it's unusable, it's definitely the wrong word. But if the market is just gapped 20%. No one's going to stick a two way on the screen of like 500 BTC. And what if you've got like 1000 BTC notional call that you've just getting liquidated on, right? There's no vol hedge in that scenario. They just have to hedge basically the gamma and it is what it is.
01:11:46.126 - 01:11:59.682, Speaker B: So yeah, I think you're right that and I hadn't thought about this until right now, but I think you're right, that a big thing for the DFI options protocols will be having liquid pert markets alongside them.
01:11:59.816 - 01:12:57.058, Speaker C: Yeah, like in early 2018, I remember discussing bitcoin options with Cumberland and a couple of other firms and they were adamant that you would never see a liquid bitcoin options market because bitcoin itself would be so volatile that it would be impossible to hedge the gap moves. And so thinking like where it's come now? It's already quite impressive that you even have options in know, and I think a large part of that has been due to the portfolio margining people, more and more participants coming and then trusting it and then CME coming out and less capital sensitive people coming in and also selling calls is kind of close. And if you think about in March, April 2019, I think on the bitcoin move from 3.8 to 5.5 and then seven K on that Snap move, I think more than half the market makers got wiped on that move or something like that. I can't remember the exact numbers.
01:12:57.144 - 01:12:59.026, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember it was pretty mental.
01:12:59.138 - 01:13:08.534, Speaker C: Because they had calendar spreads on, they had diagonals, they had a lot of ratios that all the assumptions are wrong because the price just doubles, right?
01:13:08.652 - 01:13:09.320, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:13:10.110 - 01:13:36.718, Speaker C: And so when I think about DeFi options being able to handle massive amounts of liquidations, I think perps DeFi needs to handle perps very well. First, the only reason why Derek was able to do options in a huge way was because perps were already very liquid by that point. I think that kind of has to come first for you to get the proper scale that you need for options in DeFi.
01:13:36.894 - 01:14:11.050, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes time. I do think over time that DeFi options will grow and I am bullish that as an asset. I'm bullish both CFI and DeFi options. I think they cater for different players and there's room for kind of both. So it's certainly not like yeah, I'm not bearish on it or anything like that. I think there's like short term challenges that everyone would acknowledge around liquidity and all of that kind of stuff, but they're not insurmountable by any stretch of the imagination.
01:14:11.970 - 01:14:30.610, Speaker A: So would you say the two watershed moments for DeFi or options in DeFi would be a liquid perps or very liquid perp market in DeFi and doesn't have to be the same protocol. Right. They can hook into each other way better than the centralized exchanges can. And second, serving portfolio margin.
01:14:31.750 - 01:15:35.590, Speaker B: Yes, they would definitely be the two things for me. And I think those things obviously you need liquidity, right? But it's a circular thing where to get liquidity, you need to have these other things and to have the other things, you already want to have liquidity because they're hard or whatever to implement, but eventually that gets cracked. I mean, CFI also has there are new exchanges like Bit and et cetera coming up in CFI, so there's like competition, which is always a good thing, and you have those firms that are trying to help the ecosystem as well in CFI, right? Like for block trading, you have paradigm which is doing well for bilateral stuff, x margins, working on it. So there are still kind of unsolved issues in the CFI options as well. But people are hammering away at that stuff. And DeFi options have only been around for what, a couple of months? Like a few months max. It's very early to expect it to be solved.
01:15:35.590 - 01:16:10.980, Speaker B: Right now, I think is not realistic. But yeah, we've traded it on Open, we've done a little bit on Hedge as well. Most of our volumes are on the CFI exchanges for the reasons that we've kind of discussed, like efficient use of capital, liquidity, the style of trading that we do, et cetera, et cetera. But the DeFi stuff is certainly something that we're interested in, know, helping to grow the options pie both DeFi and DeFi for everyone.
01:16:13.270 - 01:16:23.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a great way to end this. Thank you so much for your time, both for you, Josh and sue. Josh, do you want to say where people can find you?
01:16:23.930 - 01:16:54.910, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. You can get us on our Twitter account at orthotrading O-R-T-H-O-T-R-A-D-I-N-G. We have a website as well, but probably the most active, which is just that is orthogonal trading is our website. But yeah, probably Twitter is where we're most active, most active on in the general sense. And people who know me can find know wandering around the crypto scenes.
01:16:56.210 - 01:17:01.230, Speaker A: Yeah, it was an illuminating conversation for me. Learned a lot. Thank you.
01:17:01.380 - 01:17:02.958, Speaker B: Thanks guys, appreciate it.
01:17:03.044 - 01:17:03.980, Speaker C: No, thanks for being on.
