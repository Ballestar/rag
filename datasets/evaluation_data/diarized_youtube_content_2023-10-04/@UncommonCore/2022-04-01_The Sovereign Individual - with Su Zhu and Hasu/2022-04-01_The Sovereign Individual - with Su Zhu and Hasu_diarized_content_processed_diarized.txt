00:00:03.370 - 00:00:20.110, Speaker A: Welcome to Uncommon Core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. This show is hosted by Su Zu, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Three Arrows Capital. And Me Hasu, the crypto researcher and writer.
00:00:20.110 - 00:00:24.110, Speaker A: Hey, sue. It's so good to see you again.
00:00:24.180 - 00:00:24.950, Speaker B: Yeah, you too.
00:00:25.060 - 00:00:33.874, Speaker A: I checked our anchor and it's crazy, it's been December that we last recorded an episode. I think it was the Eve versus layer one. Right? That one was memorable.
00:00:34.002 - 00:00:39.590, Speaker B: I think we did another one which was like market in general. Right. And we talked about markets.
00:00:40.570 - 00:00:47.098, Speaker A: Maybe that was right about the same time. Right? Yeah. We've always been wanting to do one on macro as well.
00:00:47.098 - 00:00:49.082, Speaker A: That's right. Yeah. That one didn't happen.
00:00:49.082 - 00:00:52.910, Speaker A: Maybe it will happen still in the next few months. I think that would be really interesting.
00:00:53.060 - 00:00:53.614, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:53.732 - 00:01:01.690, Speaker A: Not just on the podcast. We haven't really talked for some time. What's new in your life? What has happened since December?
00:01:01.850 - 00:01:20.258, Speaker B: I think same old. For us, crypto has just been really interesting because you've seen a lot of different things start to happen. I think we're kind of out of the speculative wave of crypto and we're now really going to kind of what I said is the sharpest or the steepest part of the S curve.
00:01:20.258 - 00:01:30.934, Speaker B: So we're seeing a lot of nations start to form their policies and see people use it in larger scale and yeah, it's a very fascinating time that we live in now. Yeah.
00:01:30.972 - 00:01:36.282, Speaker A: Hasn't there been a request for a discussion or a proposal even for a CBDC in the US.
00:01:36.416 - 00:01:45.294, Speaker B: Yes, that's right. And I think every nation is really scrambling to figure out what they think about crypto. If they want to do their own CBDC, if they want to have travel rules or not.
00:01:45.294 - 00:01:50.346, Speaker B: How do they tax it, how do they do regulation, the whole gamut.
00:01:50.538 - 00:01:56.678, Speaker A: I saw that the other day. You played a match against one of the Botest sisters, right? Was it for derribit?
00:01:56.714 - 00:02:08.462, Speaker B: I think, yeah, that was a derebit sponsorship. It was a lot of fun. I mean, I do think there are a lot of overlaps between skilled games, online games and crypto in general.
00:02:08.462 - 00:02:21.786, Speaker B: And a lot of the top trading firms used to recruit top chess players, top poker players. It's just cool to kind of go at it from the other side. Me being a chess amateur and then she being a professional and just talk about things.
00:02:21.786 - 00:02:40.206, Speaker B: Obviously she's also really interested in crypto from a holding perspective. And so yeah, it was a great discussion and we also touched on where we saw similarities and kind of where we both saw value in crypto as an idea, as an ecosystem, as a group of people.
00:02:40.308 - 00:02:49.618, Speaker A: Did you play Andrea or Alexandra? Okay. And how did it go? I think she's like a fabit. Higher than you ranked, right?
00:02:49.704 - 00:03:02.278, Speaker B: Yeah, she's ranked much higher. So she went easy on Me and that was nice because we could talk through the moves and she gave me some advice as well and yeah, it was a pretty friendly game. I hope people learn something from it.
00:03:02.278 - 00:03:04.966, Speaker B: I definitely learn a lot just playing her in general.
00:03:05.068 - 00:03:17.814, Speaker A: I don't know much about chess, but so if you rank 1600, right, and she's 2200, then can you win ever? Or is it basically are you completely drawing that unlike something like poker?
00:03:17.942 - 00:03:31.438, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not quite like poker because in poker, on any given hand, the likelihood of winning, even as the amateur is quite high, just because it's so much. That depends on what the cards are. Whereas in chess there's no luck element in that sense.
00:03:31.438 - 00:03:56.322, Speaker B: I mean, there's still luck at high levels in the sense of just like mindfulness and how people are thinking at that time, but at our levels, yeah, what people do is they'll prepare strange openings to surprise each other. If it's a fast game, then they can try to do unsound moves that still require the other side to know the precise response. Those are called gambits or kind of sharp openings.
00:03:56.322 - 00:04:18.666, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's interesting because the Internet has made it quite a different game than over the board, because you have all these really fast games now that people actually Alexandra was mentioning, too. But there's a whole generation, actually, that has only grew up playing fast games. And so they've never actually sat on a table and played a long game of chess before, just because maybe they don't even own a chessboard.
00:04:18.666 - 00:04:20.814, Speaker B: For instance, if they're in a certain country.
00:04:20.932 - 00:04:26.842, Speaker A: By fast game, do you mean that the thinking time is very low or is it the playing style that's faster?
00:04:26.906 - 00:04:30.706, Speaker B: Yeah. So if the thinking time is sufficiently low, then the strategies just become very different. Right.
00:04:30.706 - 00:04:42.694, Speaker B: Like you want to sometimes get your opponent low on time or you sometimes want to do different types of things that you wouldn't do. A classical game would be like hours and hours over a board. Right.
00:04:42.694 - 00:04:49.046, Speaker B: So you have to do very good moves on every move because you're not going to get away with any tricks. Whereas same is not true in a fast game.
00:04:49.148 - 00:04:56.698, Speaker A: If you had to play her not in a show match but in a life or death game, what would be your approach to the game?
00:04:56.864 - 00:05:04.942, Speaker B: I mean, I would get crushed. There's actually no chance. If it was life or death and her life was on the line, there's actually 0% chance, I think.
00:05:05.076 - 00:05:11.582, Speaker A: Okay, and if you had a month for preparation and she had to do it immediately, would that be different?
00:05:11.716 - 00:05:20.466, Speaker B: I think a month is interesting. A month is possible. You'd have to just try to study some of the lines as far as possible and try to get it.
00:05:20.466 - 00:05:30.030, Speaker B: I mean, I think it's possible to get to a draw if you study really hard. Some of the very drawish openings because a lot of the top games end in draws. Right? So that's probably what I would do.
00:05:30.030 - 00:05:39.014, Speaker B: I'd probably study something that's very drawy, try to get it to that kind of an end game and then try to draw it and then maybe there's some chance she messes up and then you can win.
00:05:39.132 - 00:05:40.906, Speaker A: Or just bribe her to accept the.
00:05:40.928 - 00:05:43.274, Speaker B: Draw or just bribe that's right.
00:05:43.392 - 00:05:47.834, Speaker A: Find the right off chain strategy. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, really cool.
00:05:47.834 - 00:05:56.400, Speaker A: What else has been going on? Are you still thinking about crypto a lot or do you have any other outside interests at the moment?
00:05:56.850 - 00:06:06.210, Speaker B: I think still mainly crypto. I mean, I haven't picked up too many new hobbies. Let's see, I mean, there's a lot of interesting stuff we're doing on the business development side for Three Arrows.
00:06:06.210 - 00:06:13.854, Speaker B: Probably be able to announce more soon, but I think it's a really exciting time around the world, a lot of opportunities.
00:06:13.982 - 00:06:31.082, Speaker A: Yeah, this probably connects in some way to let me ask a different way. I mean, is Three Arrows at this point getting too big for crypto? Is that why you're sort of thinking about macro and some of these nation state level things and central bank things and so on?
00:06:31.216 - 00:07:09.510, Speaker B: No, I think the last few months we've had more of like a lull in crypto markets where people kind of we kind of had a lot of growth, tech guys get washed out as sort of zero revenue, zero cash flow. The tech stocks did very poorly and then people who held those, some of them also held crypto and it kind of got taken down together in a beating and so there was less opportunity for sort of crypto specific stuff to stand out just because it was kind of a washout. But I do think now, yeah, we're very much back in the idiosyncratic crypto world again in terms of things happening.
00:07:09.510 - 00:07:52.066, Speaker B: There's a lot of just different questions during the last three months, though, from investors on are we entering an age of stagflation? Are we entering an age of spiraling inflation or are we in fact just getting the final road bump for more secular deflation? In a sort of Kathy Woods sense? The jury is still out on a lot of these issues, these kind of big questions, and we can talk about those today or some other time. But I think that now it is becoming clear, I mean, just with the way the equities have bounced off the lows, that even if you raise rates, you still don't have the ability of cash to outperform inflation. It's just not possible.
00:07:52.066 - 00:08:17.674, Speaker B: And a lot of that has to do with the way our economy is structured as well and just the opportunity sets that are available. So that being the case, you've also seen bonds sell off quite a bit, right? You've seen longer duration rates go up and this was thought in the past to be very bearish for tech stocks, but we haven't really seen that play out. And it was always hypothesized in that way because tech being long duration, it's stories about the future, right? And it's ideas of what the future is worth.
00:08:17.674 - 00:08:44.500, Speaker B: So if you discount it back, then obviously the future is worth less if cash flows are worth more in the near term. But that hasn't really been what actually happens because the reality is that there's sort of no alternative, right, because bonds are locking in just huge losses and Fiat is locking in losses as well. People are sort of sticking to their guns and saying I have to own growth, I have to own the future, I don't have a choice to go and own.
00:08:44.500 - 00:09:08.442, Speaker B: First of all, I can't own commodities because if we get demand destruction, which we're getting, then once that comes in, then the commodities will fall also. And so I can't sit in commodities for three years or five years, and I can't sit in Fiat for very long at all, and I definitely can't sit in bonds. So there is no alternative kind of thesis coming out for sort of tech equities and also for crypto as well.
00:09:08.442 - 00:09:41.350, Speaker B: And that's what I think we've been seeing the past few weeks, which is just that realization that when people go into cash, it really is a cash bubble, right? Because when people go into Fiat, they're trying to time the market and then they need a greater fool, almost right, to be able to sell their assets for Fiat so that they can get back in cheaper. And so that's kind of the collectively people started to realize that they were just playing this kind of game of the greater fool. And once the final greater fool didn't want to sell their growth anymore, then you had huge bounces.
00:09:41.350 - 00:10:06.394, Speaker B: I think my personal view is regardless of whether we go into recession, regardless of whether we go into stagflation or secular deflation, I don't think the world can turn away from the disruption that is occurring in many industries, technology wise. And I don't think it's an environment where people have the luxury of saying I don't want to own tech, I will own something else that looks safer. Because we have seen a breakdown of what is safe.
00:10:06.394 - 00:10:31.794, Speaker B: Bonds were supposed to be safe in this environment, but because we went so far into the low negative rate environment, bonds were not able to go up anymore as stocks fell, right? So you had bonds even falling more than stocks. I think bonds are now down, 30 year bonds are down more in dollars than if you own stocks, if you own Nasdaq. And so also you haven't really seen much else be great at storing value in terms of the things that supposed to be safe.
00:10:31.794 - 00:10:43.206, Speaker B: They're also very volatile, right? Like you can own oil stocks, but you're making very specific bets now about supply chains. You're making very specific bets about how things will develop. And the volatility there is even higher than in crypto.
00:10:43.206 - 00:11:05.294, Speaker B: So it's also not quite something that you can hold for many years and feel good about it. I think longer term, what we're going to see is people just allocate a fixed percentage to crypto and this percentage will get higher and higher as they start to understand it more. And these kind of investors have been waiting for this move to get in and that's exactly why we're seeing the market be so firm now.
00:11:05.412 - 00:11:14.610, Speaker A: I want to zoom into the role of bonds here. So bonds used to be I think there have been very few times, historically speaking, where stocks and bonds have gone down at the same time, right.
00:11:14.680 - 00:11:30.386, Speaker B: Happened to eight briefly as well. But yeah, it's usually not the case. And the whole 60 40 portfolio, which a lot of bitcoiners talk about being very strange, it's really starting to play out now because the only natural buyer of bonds is really the pensions.
00:11:30.386 - 00:11:46.346, Speaker B: And the pensions are buying them because they need to deploy somewhere. And this has like a fixed annuity like properties that pension holders benefit from, right, because have a fixed amount of capital and then they get an income per month that pays for their expenses. So that's kind of the natural buyer of annuities.
00:11:46.346 - 00:12:07.010, Speaker B: But aside from them, you don't have any other natural buyers aside from them. And the central bank, right? So the central bank has ended up being the biggest buyer of bonds in many different nations now in Europe, in Japan and in the US. And that is actually extremely scary long term, because what it means is that the government is basically lending to itself, right? It's printing money to then lend to itself.
00:12:07.010 - 00:12:29.926, Speaker B: And this really only works if we are in secular deflation long term. And what secular deflation means is that despite printing money, we will not have inflation. And the reasons why we won't have inflation are that technology is advancing quickly enough and demographics are slowing quickly enough that you will never have that kind of demand for more goods, pushing up the price of goods.
00:12:29.926 - 00:13:05.094, Speaker B: And most importantly, you won't have wage inflation, because without wage inflation, it's very hard to get true price inflation, right? People have to be making more money, there has to be kind of a pushing up of the base wages. And technology, of course, is incredibly wage disinflationary these days, right? We've gone from call centers in Kansas to India to Manila and now just AI chatbots, right? So if you go to think things that used to be maybe a human on the side, now they just give you a chat bot and they say, go for it. Well, this is all you'd deserve, right? And maybe one in 100 problems can't be solved by the chat bot, but most actually can.
00:13:05.094 - 00:13:24.862, Speaker B: And that's why people always say in the markets, right, that if you get an inflationary spike, that's actually very disinflationary because it also makes people think about prices and it makes people scared to spend, and that cuts back demand and growth. But it also gives businesses social the overton window to do more things that would have been socially unacceptable. Yes, right.
00:13:24.862 - 00:13:37.838, Speaker B: So some of these things may be like, for instance, just having fewer waiters and using tablets. So I'm seeing this here everywhere. Like, people just order Via tablets now, and now we wonder, why do we ever have a waiter to order food? It just seems weird now.
00:13:37.838 - 00:13:56.514, Speaker B: And if you go to Japan, for instance, if you go to a ramen shop, there's just one guy cooking the ramen and he also gives you the menu and he also takes your money and then it's done. Yeah, there's like one dude in the whole shop for, let's say, 24 people, and he's making all the food for everybody and then he goes home and then he will usually have a shift with another guy. So there's two dudes that run the whole restaurant.
00:13:56.514 - 00:14:04.058, Speaker B: 24/7. That's it. People, if pushed, can add a lot of efficiencies to their business very quickly.
00:14:04.144 - 00:14:04.490, Speaker A: Yes.
00:14:04.560 - 00:14:33.460, Speaker B: And this actually, in my opinion, will only accelerate as older people start retiring from the workforce. Like, one of the interesting questions that economists have asked is, like, as the boomers retire, is it wage inflationary? Because wages will go up for those same jobs, as those people don't exist, so the skills, the people who are remaining will be able to demand higher wages. And I've gone back and forth about this in my own life for quite some time, but now I'm quite firmly in the camp that absolutely not wages will go up.
00:14:33.460 - 00:14:52.726, Speaker B: In fact, it will be the opposite, because it opens up the overton window for technology, finally, because up to now, it's incredibly socially unpopular to bring out technologies that smack the 55 year old out of his job or the 60 year old out of his job. But once they retire, are you going to train new people to do those jobs for another 30 years? You may not. Right.
00:14:52.726 - 00:15:08.686, Speaker B: So real estate brokers is an interesting one, because most real estate brokers now are quite old. In certain countries, there are obviously younger ones, but it's quite top heavy on older ones. And so, as they retire, can the younger realtors demand higher fees on selling houses? Probably not, right.
00:15:08.686 - 00:15:34.694, Speaker B: Probably the whole industry will just make do with fewer realtors or make do with fewer or use better technology. And I think we see this in every field. So the other interesting point on sort of deflation is that in the west, a lot of demand is psychological as well, and sort of the leftists have been talking about this for a long time, but the idea of behavioral change in the west and what do people actually spend money on and what do they do.
00:15:34.694 - 00:15:47.270, Speaker B: But I do think they have some points which is that if you think about the average person waking up in the US. Right, if he doesn't want to spend any money, he can just sit in his house and watch TV and play video games. It's incredibly deflationary.
00:15:47.270 - 00:16:05.850, Speaker B: He can get food delivered to him, he doesn't have to use any gas himself, he can walk around the street, he can meet his know, he can take a bike ride and meet his friends. So if people wanted to, they could live incredibly deflationary lives. And that's what we see in Japan, right? We see in the urban environment people can live incredibly cheaply.
00:16:05.850 - 00:16:14.866, Speaker B: They can even eat relatively healthy food in Japan, unlike in the US. Incredibly cheaply in the US. You do have a problem where you end up eating fast food if you're poor and things like that.
00:16:14.866 - 00:16:35.706, Speaker B: But in many countries in Asia you can actually be completely fine spending insanely low amount of money per year. So demographics pushing in that direction as well and behavioral changes pushing that direction are also very deflationary. Most of the spending is for say flexing or for showing off.
00:16:35.706 - 00:17:04.738, Speaker B: That can all go down quite a bit if you enter a negative growth environment or if you enter a different kind of economic environment. So I generally think inflation tops this year probably Q two and then we actually will start seeing a lot of signs of growth slowing down and deflation also. So I think that's also what the central banks in the west need, right? Because if this is not true, if we cannot create this deflation then there's actually no way for them to really get out of the situation that they're in.
00:17:04.738 - 00:17:25.946, Speaker B: You may end up in a situation where they start redefining the CPI basket to try to get people to buy different things or to do so on and so forth. But at the end of the day there's really no way they can get out of this issue of very large balance sheet debt on central banks. And the only buyer of this debt which is negative yielding being printing of their own money.
00:17:26.048 - 00:17:29.574, Speaker A: What do you think the decision makers want? Is it deflation or inflation?
00:17:29.702 - 00:17:52.466, Speaker B: The decision makers want deflation now, but they want to do it by creating fear for consumers so that they don't spend as much. They want to sort of crush demand. Essentially what they don't want is for people to stretch themselves out and start buying used cars at 80% higher than last year or start buying new houses that they can't afford and then mortgage rates go up.
00:17:52.466 - 00:18:04.550, Speaker B: So they want to scare everybody. They want to say okay, you better be spending within your limits, you better be sort of safe. But I don't believe for a second that they think that we will have inflation in like three years.
00:18:04.550 - 00:18:14.714, Speaker B: I don't think they believe that. So I think they know that it's transitory in a lot of ways, but they don't know how long it is. And they kind of oversold the transitory inflation stuff for too long right.
00:18:14.714 - 00:18:22.778, Speaker B: Because of energy. They didn't have energy security. They don't have food security at all because they oversold that and now they need to dampen that in.
00:18:22.778 - 00:18:31.054, Speaker B: That's kind of why they're going for the shock and awe effect on job owning inflation to the point that we start seeing these inflation prints come off.
00:18:31.172 - 00:18:42.146, Speaker A: There was a lot on secular deflation. Do you have any views on what speaks for stackflation as a possible outcome? So, first of all, maybe how would you define it, and then where do you see the ODS of that?
00:18:42.248 - 00:19:09.286, Speaker B: Yeah, so stackflation is kind of the idea that the economy slows down, we go into a recession, growth is low, but at the same time you get inflation, meaning you get wages higher and prices higher. And so the main people who believe this are kind of pointing to the 1970s and saying, look, we had similar type of environment in the sense of oil spike, which causes inflation and commodity spike, and then you probably enter a recession. But I think there are some key differences.
00:19:09.286 - 00:19:15.786, Speaker B: I think demographics are the biggest key difference. You don't have more people entering the workforce right now. In fact, you have people coming out of the workforce.
00:19:15.786 - 00:19:24.462, Speaker B: So in the 70s, you had huge amounts of people entering the workforce, right. You had women entering the workforce. You had just a very different demographic set.
00:19:24.462 - 00:19:50.694, Speaker B: And so now I don't know if we will be able to call top on commodities in general, but I do know that for quite a few of these commodities, they can be substituted by people just deciding they can't afford them. So the analogy I give is like, if you make $30,000 a year and you normally spend, let's say, $25,000 a year on a certain basket of goods, if that now costs you fifty K a year, you don't spend fifty K a year because you don't have fifty K a year. Yes.
00:19:50.694 - 00:19:58.920, Speaker B: Right. You may not even spend twenty five K a year. What you currently spend on you may somehow even spend less because you're just so shocked by the prices higher.
00:19:58.920 - 00:20:16.562, Speaker B: People always say when everyone's talking about oil prices being so high, that's usually very close to a top in oil prices because everyone's just seeing it and being like, you know what, instead of driving to the movie theater, I'm going to stay in and watch Netflix. These are kind of the things that you're already seeing now in the logistics markets and the shipping markets, right. Where shipping has come off, logistics have come off.
00:20:16.562 - 00:20:52.650, Speaker B: And it's not in the mainstream narrative of sort of spiraling inflation because people the other thing about inflation is that the media likes to talk about inflation a lot because it gets clicks and it's kind of now very obvious that we have inflation and it gets people riled up. But secular deflation is much harder for people to understand and also it's nonetheless been the reality of Japan for many, many years now, for about 30 years. So if we get into Japanification, as there are a lot of signs that the west will, then this is actually still the main game and in fact will be even more so by this kind of shock.
00:20:52.650 - 00:21:24.678, Speaker B: But I do think, Stagflation, if it were to happen, it would be very dangerous, because there's a lot of people with mortgages, there's a lot of people know if you get job destruction, plus you get rates going up quite a bit, you're going to have just a proper bankruptcy cycle and you get a lot of pain, basically. So I think kind of the Fed blinks both ways. It blinks on the high CPI prints, but then it's also confident enough that they can manage it that they won't let it sort of they won't basically margin call the man in the street to make him sell his house.
00:21:24.678 - 00:21:25.110, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:25.180 - 00:21:37.946, Speaker A: So in summary, Stackflation, you think any kind of inflationary scenario is very unlikely because we have huge secular trends towards deflation. For one, technology. The other, demographic change.
00:21:37.946 - 00:21:57.578, Speaker A: You think more secular deflation is more likely, but at the same time very dangerous because if nominal debt stayed the same but your income goes down, that's very bad for borrowers. Does this necessarily end in a recession or can this stretch out for decades? Where do we generally put the ODS of recession?
00:21:57.754 - 00:22:06.834, Speaker B: I mean, it's very difficult to say. I generally don't think it'll enter a recession unless the Fed forces it into a recession. And I don't think that's their goal either.
00:22:06.834 - 00:22:37.274, Speaker B: But with that said, I think zooming out, right? You're actually getting massive easing in China and Japan at the same time that the US is trying to say that they will crack down very hard on inflation. And I think there it's because China, more so than anyone, knows that they have a massive secular deflation problem coming because the public birth rate is like 1.1. But it's likely under one you have this kind of problem where you have all this housing, that they have the highest housing price to income ratio in the world in many cities.
00:22:37.274 - 00:22:55.618, Speaker B: And so you have six people basically saving up for one house, right? You have four parents plus the two, the man and the woman, saving to buy a place. And these asset prices are not able to be supported because there's just not enough new people being born and not enough immigration to buy these homes. And they also have all been told that these always go up.
00:22:55.618 - 00:23:19.114, Speaker B: So they need to print a lot of money to support asset markets and they need to print a lot of money to basically prop things up. And they're also quite sure they can print this money and not even have much inflation in the long run because of secular deflation. I think the only question there is can they handle the food price increases in the meantime? Because there's been a lot of food inflation as well.
00:23:19.114 - 00:23:47.534, Speaker B: And that's from the fact that so much of our current food systems come from fertilizer, right? And Russia, a few other places, control basically all the fertilizer supply in the world, the ammonium nitrate. And so you have prices of almost everything in agriculture at all time highs again, that can turn very quickly if you get a resolution to the war right, if you get some kind of a ceasefire. So barring World War II, those kind of things are also transitory.
00:23:47.534 - 00:24:06.426, Speaker B: We kind of have what's very common in markets, which is that you have in the near term, sort of the extreme fear of the war and the extreme conditions uncertainty. On the other hand, longer term, you see a whole different set of problems that are in a way opposite to those problems. That's where sort of the real push and pull are.
00:24:06.528 - 00:24:35.086, Speaker A: Where does primarily your interest in this come from? Is it sort of that crypto has just been a bit dull, as you said, for the last three to six months? Or is it that you're starting to look at the bigger game, sort of the macro game? Or do you think that this macro development is relevant for all crypto investors? And it's like earlier you basically compared crypto to tech stocks as well. Right. So do you think that crypto is just basically the outcome we have in crypto is fully dependent on what happens in macro?
00:24:35.198 - 00:25:16.814, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I think we're entering a phase now for crypto where it's in the big leaks. So people are wondering, when I own this, what sorts of things do I believe about the world? What kind of world am I investing into and what kinds of things will hurt my portfolio, what kind of things will help? Right, yeah, and I personally think, actually, regardless of my previous comments about secular deflation, I actually think it doesn't even matter that much for crypto itself because it's still very early that those forces are not strong enough to matter for the total market cap of crypto assets. So it's almost like the macro stuff is to understand the way that other traditional finance people view it.
00:25:16.814 - 00:25:51.014, Speaker B: And it's sort of our original background in three eras as well, which was mainly emerging market foreign exchange, just basically to get in the mindset of a tourist in this market how they think about whether or not that they should own bitcoin or they own ether and what are they hedging right. But separate from that, I think the real interesting stuff, aside from macro the past few weeks has been the political implications of Ukraine, Russia and there I think what we've seen, right, is where before people could. Criticize crypto as either frivolous and speculative or subversive and dangerous.
00:25:51.014 - 00:26:05.954, Speaker B: Now, absolutely no one says it's frivolous and speculative. They can only argue over how subversive it is, or is it creating net good or net bad in the world. And to that, I have two different arguments, sort of two very different philosophies, I would say.
00:26:05.954 - 00:26:32.460, Speaker B: One, we can say it's doing net good in the world because Ukrainians are using it to be able to get money in and out. They're able to receive donations and have that translate into supplies, and also Russians are able to leave with some of their wealth intact. So net it's good in that sense, right? But of course, some people might debate you on that, and they might say, well, Russians are also maybe they're avoiding sanctions or this and that, right? And we'll come back to that.
00:26:32.460 - 00:27:32.810, Speaker B: The second argument I would add to that, though, is that we are in a time now where in an unprecedented way, the way a normal person views things occurring in the world is in terms of whether it should happen or not. And this kind of is ought problem you can really see in all discourse, right? So there are things happening which are clearly not necessarily in the realm of us thinking should he have done it or should he not have done it? Yet? People will spend a long time debating this. So we talk about should Putin have invaded, should he have not invaded, should he have just stayed odomba, should he have just gone to Kiev or not? But these are all questions that are almost irrelevant, right? The more interesting questions is like, what happens next? Or what will be the reaction? And I think from that point of view, crypto the cat's out of the bag and you're seeing sort of both Ukraine and Russia do a lot more on crypto now, right? You're seeing Russia do a lot more with talking about mining, talking about using Bitcoin for oil and gas, talking about issuing digital assets.
00:27:32.810 - 00:27:53.762, Speaker B: On the Ukraine side, you have them minting NFTs, you have them doing whole hosts of things. And on top of that, you're seeing really interesting developments in the Middle East around crypto because they're also saying, we want to support a alternative parallel system of finance. And it turns out that the west also supports the system, but that's even better because it's just a credible neutral system.
00:27:53.762 - 00:28:22.806, Speaker B: And we love the idea of a credible neutral system because we believe in the multipolar world order, right? And we don't think that the US. For instance, should be able to sanction an individual, but moreover, we want to contribute to a world where it's more likely that they cannot sanction a world order. So we're kind of seeing geopolitical moves happening that are well outside the world of saying what should happen, and instead saying, what must we do next as a response to these things that are occurring.
00:28:22.918 - 00:28:31.118, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I mean, this is something that you learn in trading and in poker and in any form of professional gaming should be in the present. Right.
00:28:31.118 - 00:28:54.150, Speaker A: And don't waste your time thinking about the past unless it can give you an indication for what's going to happen in the future. I like what you said about the multipolar world order and also about the conflict in Russia and Ukraine. And it's my impression I mean, one thing has given me a bit of pause, which is I talked to a lot of people and sort of everybody is on the same page.
00:28:54.150 - 00:29:20.126, Speaker A: That really it's a good thing that the west has been able to freeze so many Russian assets and the assets of the Russian central bank and of Russian oligarchs and so on, and is able to enforce so many sanctions. And I feel like this could be used increasingly as an argument against crypto, and I'm not sure how I would respond to that. What do you think?
00:29:20.228 - 00:29:50.602, Speaker B: This is actually one of my sort of more controversial points, and it's something that I think I'm able to say because of where I am and the sort of seat that I'm in. I mean, it's very difficult for, let's say, a protocol founder or a Silicon Valley based fund to make similar arguments that I would make for me sitting in Singapore as a Singaporean. But I do think that there's two different questions here, right? One is, first of all, what are sanctions? Do they work? Who needs to follow them? Who doesn't need to follow them? Right.
00:29:50.602 - 00:30:12.650, Speaker B: And these are quite basic questions about sanctions. And just to give a thought experiment, the reason why we sanction people is because we can't actually arrest them, right? Because they haven't committed any crimes. So when we talk about sanctioning Russian oligarchs in London, the reason why they're not in jail is because there exists no laws to put them in jail.
00:30:12.650 - 00:30:13.774, Speaker B: So we actually have to.
00:30:13.812 - 00:30:18.798, Speaker A: And that's because they are not in London, they are outside the reach of the jurisdiction.
00:30:18.894 - 00:30:20.146, Speaker B: Well, there's sort of two because they.
00:30:20.168 - 00:30:21.762, Speaker A: Are breaking international law, right?
00:30:21.816 - 00:30:35.686, Speaker B: Yes. Well, there's sort of two ways to think about it, right? One is that they are breaking some laws, but in many cases, the imposition of sanctions against individuals that haven't contacted Putin for, let's say, 15 years or ten years, that is not as clear. Right.
00:30:35.686 - 00:31:08.654, Speaker B: And that's why you've seen only a few of the oligarchs actually end up getting their assets frozen, right? And in the US. In fact, very few of the oligarchs actually manage to get their assets frozen because their lawyers successfully argued that, in fact, these sanctions against their assets make no sense. And so even now, we still have some rule of law in the west, which is to say, okay, you still have to prove that something requires a sanctioning of financial assets, because this is something that is relatively extra judicial, right? Yes, it's a suspension of rule of law in pursuit of a higher purpose.
00:31:08.654 - 00:31:39.034, Speaker B: So then the question is what kinds of things can we draw a clear line on and what things can't we draw a clear line on? Right? So, for instance, we can't kill the children of people that are sort of even if they're war criminals, we cannot kill their children if they're know, let's say they're on the beach in Paris or not Paris, but on the beach in south of France. We cannot kill their children just because of who their father is. Right? That would be seen as like in modern day kind of we would draw a line, you know, in the old days, maybe you would not draw a line there.
00:31:39.034 - 00:32:02.418, Speaker B: Maybe you would say, well, that's a great move, that's an excellent move. So these kind of things are depending on norms and these norms are dictated by a lot of different things. But I think coming back to where I see it tying in with crypto is that crypto absolutely can be used for sanctions, just like cash can, just like to pervading sanctions, just like the Internet can, just like anything can.
00:32:02.418 - 00:32:18.050, Speaker B: And I always say that if something is useful for people, then it must necessarily be useful for criminals because criminals are people. There's no instance yet of a technology which is only useful for people who are not criminals. Doesn't exist.
00:32:18.050 - 00:32:44.738, Speaker B: Right? Criminals use the same phones, use the same technologies, use the same internet that we all use. And so crypto being in the nascent phase now where the regulatory rules haven't been written yet in many countries, it's a precarious subject to broach because they are in fact writing what those rules will be now. And they want to decide how draconian do we want them? Do we want them to be extremely draconian? Because we value the ability to sanction people as much as possible.
00:32:44.738 - 00:33:29.706, Speaker B: On the other hand, do we say, for instance, cash is used much more by criminals and therefore we should treat crypto as we treat other things on the Internet or cash in general and just allow that space? These are kind of very difficult questions and I think that each society will answer those questions very differently also based on their priorities. Right? So for instance, there were some talks about how India didn't follow the sanctions and is in fact planning to do a lot of these oil deals with Russia, right? But interestingly, some of the Indian famous that I speak with, they're incredibly skeptical of the US sanctions and they're incredibly against them as well. They would say, for instance, that sanctions have never worked, basically didn't work in Iran, didn't work in Venezuela, didn't work in North Korea.
00:33:29.706 - 00:33:45.646, Speaker B: Basically they would say there's not an instance of it having worked. And for them, if they were to follow the sanctions, their people would die because they need russian fertilizer for their people to eat. And so India would say to the US well, the west is still buying Russian oil after all this talk about secondary sanctions.
00:33:45.646 - 00:34:02.970, Speaker B: They themselves have not actually followed their current sanctions. And so this multipolar world is something that is very scared of the west because they don't know what comes after this. Is it world War II? Is it sort of breakdown of international world order? But I do think that there are real questions that people outside of the US.
00:34:02.970 - 00:34:25.902, Speaker B: They do ask about sanctions, which is to say how far does it go, how do we decide on these sanctions? And how do weigh the impact of sanctions not just on individuals in the countries even, but on the idea of shutting off a country trade, which may kill people, which may cause a revolution somewhere else. Right. Like with wheat prices this high, Sri Lanka has gone into default, gone into bankruptcy.
00:34:25.902 - 00:34:54.374, Speaker B: Many countries like Egypt can end up in very unstable situation as a result of this kind of, you know, what are the obligations of third world countries and poorer countries to follow the sanctions that Joe Biden talks about? And this is something that interestingly when you see with the UAE and with some other countries in the Middle East, they would say I don't want to be part of these sanctions. And I also know, interestingly that you will not dare secondary sanction me because I see you going to Iran for oil. I see you going to Venezuela for oil.
00:34:54.374 - 00:34:57.322, Speaker B: Say I already know your hand is not very strong. Basically. Yes, right.
00:34:57.322 - 00:35:21.726, Speaker B: I already kind of know that if you're going with a guy you just put in the actions of evil a few years ago, then me, I'm at least your ally, you can't play that card with me. This is kind of the big widening of the overton window that we're seeing now, which is that people are just ignoring what they say. And I do think kind of what's likely to happen is that you kind of see a short term victory for the west where probably Ukraine will get the better end of a deal with Russia.
00:35:21.726 - 00:35:40.594, Speaker B: But then longer term you will see countries really aggressively move away from over dependence on the existing financial systems. And so part of that is embracing technologies that are credibly neutral. Part of that is working on creating alternate systems to the ones that exist.
00:35:40.594 - 00:35:58.830, Speaker B: But this whole process will take years and years. And I think that the role that crypto plays in this is many fold. On the one hand, you will have the continued adoption of crypto by the west as an expression of liberal values and as an expression of freedom of speech and also freedom of money.
00:35:58.830 - 00:36:29.594, Speaker B: On the other hand, you will see adoption of it by governments and by sophisticated players outside of the west as to say this is a credible, neutral money. This is a credible, neutral platform that I can use to do trade. So I think crypto becomes all the things essentially I've been reading this book, I've been rereading it rather, I read it in the past called Sovereign Individual and what it calls the megapolitical force is a really good lens to view crypto in.
00:36:29.594 - 00:36:47.546, Speaker B: Crypto and more broadly, peer to peer encryption is a megapolitical force. Meaning that we cannot reason about it in terms of should we ban it or not because it is not banable in the sense that the printing press is not banable. Also in the sense that the iron horseshoe was not banable.
00:36:47.546 - 00:37:05.198, Speaker B: So in the book they make the point that we roughly have followed 500 year epochs and in each transition of epochs has been marked by technology changes. So he gives example of coming out of the dark ages into feudalism. We had cold spell, which was then followed by the invention of iron horseshoes.
00:37:05.198 - 00:37:32.066, Speaker B: And that enabled some farmers to put these iron horseshoes on their horses and be able to lord over other people because they were able to also then make metal weapons and metal armor. So they were able to have dominion over their neighbors and then eventually centralize farming and eventually do that via the Catholic Church as well. And then he points out that in the year about 1500 you had the printing press and you also had the boats and age of exploration.
00:37:32.066 - 00:37:57.262, Speaker B: And this in turn changed the locus of power drastically from the feudal system to a merchant system and in the merchant system. And that's why he pointed out that the aristocracy of that time they would have not believed that this was possible, that this transition. But it happened because of the megapolitical force of the technology which was changing the very nature of capital as well, because at that time land was very valuable.
00:37:57.262 - 00:38:34.318, Speaker B: But land started to fall a lot relative to financial capital as people realized through pamphlets which could be printed via printing press that actually there was so much happening in the rest of the world that suddenly the land you have right around you maybe isn't worth so much relative to what is possible outside of the world. And then you had people investing in the Dutch East India Company, you had people investing in some of these tremendous exploratory missions that ended up creating vast amounts of wealth, right? But interestingly, at that time the Catholic Church was fighting against it arm and fists, right? Because they were saying usury is against God. But really why they added those things is because they didn't want people to invest.
00:38:34.318 - 00:38:52.226, Speaker B: They wanted people to give all their money to the church. And they also banned the principal initially everywhere except a few parts where they were not able to penetrate those areas. And in those areas you had people slowly proliferating this idea that you don't need to give your money to the church, you can still practice religion.
00:38:52.226 - 00:39:21.710, Speaker B: And so they attacked at the power of the church by having the Bible printed in common language, meaning the language that the locals could read instead of in Latin. And they also explained the Bible itself instead of did it via the Catholic way, which is through the cathedrals and through the paintings and these kind of things which are very abstract. And so through that process, you had really a megapolitical revolution in people's minds about where the locus of power was, where a capital should be allocated.
00:39:21.710 - 00:39:27.890, Speaker B: And I think what we're seeing now is this, but with peer to peer encryption on the Internet, right?
00:39:27.960 - 00:39:28.290, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:28.360 - 00:39:40.118, Speaker B: Because in the 90s you had essentially the invention of peer to peer encryption by cryptographers. And the military in the US said, this is military grade encryption technology. This is weapons grade technology.
00:39:40.118 - 00:39:46.934, Speaker B: We should ban. You know, the professor said, well, sir, this is just code. These are just so.
00:39:46.934 - 00:39:51.818, Speaker B: And in the end, of course, information won out and it's just words and just numbers.
00:39:51.904 - 00:39:56.220, Speaker A: It's funny to think about the printing press as a disintermediating technology.
00:39:56.750 - 00:39:59.050, Speaker B: Incredibly so. Right? Incredibly so.
00:39:59.120 - 00:40:05.914, Speaker A: Who do you think is the present day equivalent of the Church that gets disintermediated? Is there any equivalent?
00:40:06.042 - 00:40:15.198, Speaker B: I think, the nation state apparatus today. A lot of people don't think about all the things we currently rely on it for. But this was not the case.
00:40:15.198 - 00:40:47.974, Speaker B: Even a couple of generations or three generations ago, there's kind of been a breakdown of the family and then an idea that instead you rely on your state for this. And this, I think, will get dialed back in a major way, especially in the countries which have a very large social welfare state, especially an unfunded social welfare state, because ultimately it will be financially unsustainable. One of the predictions that sovereign individual makes is that as we enter the information society, the work that people do will be predominantly on the Internet and digital.
00:40:47.974 - 00:41:03.806, Speaker B: And as this happens, the place that they live, the territorial claim to revenue, will get weaker and weaker. Their monopoly on violence will get weaker and weaker. Not in the sense that they don't have the monopoly on violence, but that what they can extract from that monopoly on violence becomes less and less.
00:41:03.806 - 00:41:37.450, Speaker B: And interestingly, what you're seeing now is that the same rails that companies used to use during globalization to do regulatory arbitrage and lower their own tax rates, individuals are now using en masse, right. In Europe, great example, where people are all going to Lisbon to get 0% tax and Europe can't even say anything about it because they have free movement of people that they added in for their own sake at that time. That's exactly what sovereign individual predicted, which is that the place that you are born in or the place that you grow up in is going to have very little claim over your productivity as we enter digital world.
00:41:37.450 - 00:41:54.606, Speaker B: And that, of course, breaks down the kind of ability of the nation state to command a lot of things from you. And this will be very disruptive to places that are used to a very large government doing many different things and will be good for ones that have a different government model that don't rely on this as much.
00:41:54.788 - 00:41:58.802, Speaker A: It would be so interesting to see an unbundling of the nation state.
00:41:58.856 - 00:41:59.266, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:59.368 - 00:42:19.890, Speaker A: I think the nation state is maybe one of the greatest innovations in human history. I think it has unlocked so much welfare and so much productivity gain and security and physical safety for people and just so many benefits. But at this point, I would also say I think it would be great to have more competition and more experimentation.
00:42:19.890 - 00:42:42.702, Speaker A: Right. For example, after creating Ethereum, vitalik went very deep into the governance rabbit hole and started to become really interested in funding of public goods and how humans organize and these ideas of novel forms of organizing human society and so on, and charter cities. And I can definitely understand why.
00:42:42.702 - 00:42:50.034, Speaker A: I think with a few years delay, I can definitely see how this is going to be such an interesting field in the next coming years.
00:42:50.232 - 00:43:11.322, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. We are not that far from a world where people will start moving to places with people that they've already met online to set up communities. And this, I think, is not as futuristic as it even sounds because if you think about the Pilgrims going to the East Coast, going to Plymouth Rock, that really was the same thing.
00:43:11.322 - 00:43:23.514, Speaker B: Right. These are people that kind of organized through their religious views and then left religious persecution to a land that they've never seen before together in a boat, the Mayflower. Right.
00:43:23.514 - 00:43:42.882, Speaker B: So that kind of move. And we've seen tons of this stuff throughout history, whether it's refugees, whether it's islanders, the sort of desire to form a clan or form a group and then go somewhere else and take the risk of the unknown versus the possibility of something bigger. This is native to our species, really.
00:43:42.882 - 00:44:01.906, Speaker B: So I think now what's interesting is that we're seeing these creations of groups be done entirely digitally. Yes, exactly. And the generational gap here has never been bigger because for the older generation who didn't grow up on the Internet, they're shocked by the idea that you can form bonds this strong on the Internet.
00:44:01.906 - 00:44:11.020, Speaker B: They're just completely shocked by it. I was just at an inter with some very old people who were just saying, you know what? The Internet? I think net was a bad thing. That's what the guy said.
00:44:11.020 - 00:44:27.018, Speaker B: I had the similar reaction to you, and I was like, I'm just not privileged enough to say something like this because it's the height of arrogance to even think the Internet cares if you think it's good or bad. Right. But that's kind of the gap, because for them, they can just turn off the Internet.
00:44:27.018 - 00:44:55.498, Speaker B: They can just say, you know what? And he showed me that he has a Nokia phone, like a flip phone from all these years ago and things like that, and he doesn't use a smartphone. But at the end of the day, what are young people actually doing? They're actually forming a lot of their most important moments online, whether it's socializing with people in their neighborhoods, but also making friends overseas and making friends through common interest. I think this kind of pluralism is something that will take real shape over the next few years.
00:44:55.498 - 00:45:17.586, Speaker B: And the ways that it does so is going to be really hard to predict and it's going to blow people's minds, in my opinion. Because I think in many ways those bonds are stronger than the bonds that can be made physically because they're done so through choice, they're done so through going into these places, doing actions together, taking these journeys together. Yeah.
00:45:17.608 - 00:45:40.074, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm sure you have heard of the idea of the cloud city, right? It's just kind of the same thing where people used to venture out into the unknown with the idea to settle down somewhere, form a new country or form a new city, and it would be built on the ideals of search for prosperity and freedom from oppression and so on. Right.
00:45:40.074 - 00:45:40.918, Speaker A: And exploration.
00:45:41.014 - 00:45:41.370, Speaker B: Yes.
00:45:41.440 - 00:46:08.974, Speaker A: But today, sort of the problem is that there is nothing to settle down on, right. Every point on the earth is kind of taken already, right. So instead, people form what was basically a cloud city, right? And I think what's missing, really, to bring this into the real world would be just one country going ahead and saying, we divide our land into like we have all of this free land, let's just divide this into 1000 parcels.
00:46:08.974 - 00:46:20.566, Speaker A: And anyone can make a charter city here. And this is the 10% of laws that you have to submit to, but the other 90% is kind of in your hand. Just go and experiment away.
00:46:20.566 - 00:46:24.950, Speaker A: I think this would be just so insanely cool if that was possible.
00:46:25.100 - 00:46:43.446, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think we absolutely will see it, actually for the same demographic reasons that I mentioned before. Just because in Japan, the average age of a farmer is 67 years old now. And a lot of these houses you can buy for free if you're willing to go there and live there, because they just need human beings to live in these dwellings.
00:46:43.446 - 00:47:00.770, Speaker B: And the same thing is happening all across Europe now, right, in Italy and some of these places where there's just no people because of the brain drain that we discussed. The young people who are productive, they go somewhere, zero tax, where all their friends are going, like Elizabeth. And then what's left is like 25% youth unemployment, bunch of old people.
00:47:00.770 - 00:47:27.462, Speaker B: And that's it, right? And that kind of environment is very they need that vitality, whatever it is, whoever it is at some point. So it'll happen through that in a big way. I also think there will be cities and places that sort of don't rely on the old models as much and therefore can kind of be almost like proto modern in ways that the things that they used to do might have seemed regressive, but now they seem modern.
00:47:27.462 - 00:47:58.642, Speaker B: A good example of this is if you look at Catholicism or if you look at Islam, right, like a lot of secular Western or confucian thinkers think of this as like regressive views, right? But interestingly, people live a different style of life. They don't believe in the possibility of work in many cases, in the sense that the point of life or what constitutes the good life is working really hard and then having that work transfer into a kind of material success. Whereas they much more would say the goal of life is to have a family and raise your kids.
00:47:58.642 - 00:48:17.334, Speaker B: And that's kind of the way that they're brought up. In a way, this can become a very futuristic viewpoint, right, in a post work society. If we really get secular deflation and there's robots, then the idea of training your kid really hard in memorizing a bunch of stuff is actually kind of stale, right? It's actually kind of an old school mentality that's not going to get you anywhere.
00:48:17.334 - 00:48:36.738, Speaker B: Right. Whereas maybe the approach of just, like, having good interpersonal skills, having good love of life, being able to just enjoy life without needing to, let's say, strive for something that is some part of a rat race, that actually something that China wishes it could teach its people to do, right. They're seeing a lot of signs now.
00:48:36.738 - 00:48:57.266, Speaker B: China gets this fully, so they're trying to start stopping a lot of educational testing, trying to support as much sort of relaxation as possible. Because they also get that you don't want to set up hundreds of millions of people to compete for something where there's no reward at the end of it. We've had globalization first attack at a lot of blue collar jobs.
00:48:57.266 - 00:49:14.522, Speaker B: The next wave will be attacking at white collar jobs, right? So accounting, we kind of already know, is like dead. But then banking, lawyer, even doctor, a lot of this stuff can be telemedicine, a lot of this stuff can be outsourced. And so the kinds of jobs that exist in 30 years will be very different from the kind of jobs that exist today.
00:49:14.522 - 00:49:43.462, Speaker B: And so I also think that the societies that are very much not prepared for this are going to find it really hard because they will have set up a huge generation for failure, essentially on that point as well. With crypto, I think there are places that understand this and so they don't. For instance, places like Dubai is quite interesting, right, because their model of how they capture value from their expats or the people that go there and move there is they sell them land.
00:49:43.462 - 00:49:49.942, Speaker B: It's like a metaverse model, almost. It's like I don't tax you anything by not taxing you anything. I don't have to track anything either.
00:49:49.942 - 00:49:56.870, Speaker B: I don't have to figure out if you're buying this or buying that. I don't have to figure out if you're doing this or doing that. I simply let you live here.
00:49:56.870 - 00:50:03.582, Speaker B: You do it with whatever you want. 0% tax on everything. I want you to buy something here, so I want you to buy a land.
00:50:03.716 - 00:50:05.520, Speaker A: It's a token gated community.
00:50:06.130 - 00:50:29.066, Speaker B: It's a token gated community, exactly. And that model works well for them because they have a lot of land that's not lived on, and if there's more demand, they'll just build on more land. And so this is a flywheel that is actually quite compelling, because they're able to offer, let's say, what I would call like, the freedoms of a liberal monarchy, right? Because in a liberal monarchy, which sounds like an oxymoron, because we're used to thinking of a monarchy as, like, a liberal.
00:50:29.066 - 00:50:55.082, Speaker B: But in a liberal monarchy, the monarch doesn't have to care as much about what you're doing on all these different things because it already knows it has absolute dominion, and also because it has created a business model which needs to attract talent and capital. Right? For instance, you can leave a liberal monarchy if you don't like it there anymore. So if Monaco became a very bad liberal monarchy, people would leave Monaco, right, or they would leave whatever it is.
00:50:55.082 - 00:51:10.366, Speaker B: And so I do think we may end up seeing more and more interest in these kinds of models. Because, of course, the promise of liberal democracy is that everyone gets a voice. But what often ends up happening is that you get sort of the tyranny of the majority over the minority.
00:51:10.366 - 00:51:19.158, Speaker B: So you get the tyranny of the poor over the rich, you get the tyranny of the major ethnic group over the minor ethnic group. You get all these kinds of things.
00:51:19.244 - 00:51:25.074, Speaker A: That's why, I mean, checks and balances and minority protection are the two other pillars of any liberal democracy.
00:51:25.202 - 00:51:59.202, Speaker B: Yes, but the question is, can these systems ultimately sustain themselves if people are able to leave? Because people can leave liberal monarchies and they can also leave liberal democracies. So will liberal democracies give people enough reason to stay? And what will those be? We have seen sort of the Nordic models where that has generally worked, but it was also with a generation where a lot of people did leave, but with those who stayed, they were interestingly, quite ethnically homogeneous, right. And they have a strong sense of culture and so they're willing to kind of fight through it together in that kind of a sense.
00:51:59.202 - 00:52:04.546, Speaker B: Right, but not every country is like that, right? Not every country has that kind of ability to.
00:52:04.568 - 00:52:25.514, Speaker A: Command that it's like the same thing. We are sort of speed running right now in crypto with Dows versus more streamlined forms of governance for projects where I think the main reason why liberal democracy has been so effective is because the exit cost on the system is so high. And so the cost of failure is so large as well.
00:52:25.514 - 00:52:35.514, Speaker A: So if you get someone bad in charge, then people cannot leave. And it's basically a horrible outcome for everyone. So you need a system that is very failure proof.
00:52:35.514 - 00:52:56.498, Speaker A: But I think when the incentives are set up different and the mobility of people between different systems and firms and capital and everything is much higher, then you do have more competition and you get more checks and balances that way, right. So you can have more smaller systems that each keep each other in check because if they don't perform well, then people would just leave.
00:52:56.664 - 00:53:16.998, Speaker B: Yes, I think so too. I think just as we've seen a lot of Dow deaths, we will also start to see a lot of liberal democracy debts. So in the book, the first one that he gave as kind of like a precursor example was in Peru, right, where Fujimori he at some point declared the end of the parliament.
00:53:16.998 - 00:53:27.390, Speaker B: And that was incredibly popular. It was over 70% of people wanted it into the parliament. Why? Because they thought the parliament was incredibly corrupt and they thought that it was not serving the issues, the needs of the people.
00:53:27.390 - 00:53:50.262, Speaker B: And so there was a case of a society transitioning from democracy back to monarchy or back to authoritarian. And so I do think that I don't know if Francis Fukuyama's end of history, where the end of history is liberal democracy, is actually historically likely. I have my personal views on what systems are the best, but I don't think they're relevant, my personal views on which are the best.
00:53:50.262 - 00:54:10.934, Speaker B: I do think that ethno states will be on the rise because ethnostates are one of the only ways that people are willing to sacrifice for the rest of their nation. You can't get someone to sacrifice for the idea of a continent. It's difficult because it's a made up concept.
00:54:10.934 - 00:54:18.926, Speaker B: Right. It's a concept that's not old enough for people to die for. And moreover, in many cases, they're not even willing to die for the country that they're in.
00:54:18.926 - 00:54:24.518, Speaker B: They may be only willing to die for their tribe. Right. And a really great example that I was bringing up is Catalunia.
00:54:24.518 - 00:54:44.790, Speaker B: Right? So Catalonia, 1997, in the referendum 92%, voted for autonomy, and they were promised autonomy as well by Ferdinand Franco in 1973. Yet Catalonia has no autonomy today. Right? And there were at some points where the European Union wanted to say, well, Spain is a flawed democracy because they didn't give.
00:54:44.790 - 00:55:39.858, Speaker B: But then, of course, they didn't do so because it would have been very politically inconvenient to call Spain a flawed democracy, right? And so you have these interesting questions of where do people's loyalties ultimately lie? What kinds of things do people believe about the world? And given globalization has now created the rails for free movement of people and free movement of labor, free movement of capital, how will the modern generations use this freedom to shape their own lives? And that question is a very open one because it's now not just information workers, not just software developers who are doing this. It's anyone working on the internet, right? So it's marketers, it's content creators, it's literally mass adoption of this idea. The book talks about how in the 1990s, even 50% of people polled in Europe said, I will not make my career in the place I was born.
00:55:39.858 - 00:55:56.138, Speaker B: And that was in the 90s. Right? And of course, now if that same poll were to be made, in some countries, that kind of idea is even higher. And so this kind of thing is very good for crypto because it already abstracts away the idea that you must save in your own country's fiat.
00:55:56.138 - 00:56:19.398, Speaker B: Right, yes. It abstracts us away and you're saving with whom instead, you're saving with groups of global like minded people who share a common purpose. So in the case of Bitcoin, that's the common ideas of the 21 million supply of currency whose crater is pseudonymous, the idea of something that is as changing as little as possible.
00:56:19.398 - 00:56:44.826, Speaker B: Right. And then with ethereum, you have the ideas there of global settlement layer that's powering very important economies, digital economies. So suddenly, once you abstract away the dependence on the state for the things you need because you're not getting them anyways, you also abstract away the need to save in the fiat of your country, especially if it's inflating away against real purchasable basket of goods.
00:56:44.826 - 00:57:03.554, Speaker B: Anyways, so this kind of twin occurrence is why we've seen incredible adoption by digital nomads, by millennials in the tech space, because they say, well, I would rather save with these people. These people are my nation. Right, and they like the fact that old people are still not really buying crypto yet.
00:57:03.554 - 00:57:14.374, Speaker B: They like the fact that despite here institutional adoption there, most institutions are generally quite scared to buy coins. They get scared in, scared out. That's actually very in a way, that's the most bullish part for me.
00:57:14.374 - 00:57:34.494, Speaker B: I would actually not like it as much if you had something where huge institutions were buying it and then staking it, it would seem weird almost, right? Yeah, it would seem like anachronism. So it's actually, in a way, I think that the shakeout has been incredibly healthy for the markets because it's shaken out institutions, but it hasn't shaken out individuals. Right.
00:57:34.494 - 00:57:52.334, Speaker B: If you look across exchanges, some of the proprietary data that we see, individuals have been buying the entire dip. There's been very little individuals selling. It's actually been mainly sort of the web, two funds that have been selling and these kinds of players that kind of just had to cut risk and so on and so forth.
00:57:52.334 - 00:58:16.754, Speaker B: So longer term, I don't think institutional adoption even matters for crypto. For me, the interesting end game is all about what are people doing on this earth to secure their wealth? What are people doing to transact with each other? And what are governments doing in reaction to the fact that people are already doing this? Not their opinion on whether people should do this, but their reaction to people matter of factly doing it back to first principles.
00:58:16.802 - 00:58:21.722, Speaker A: Yes, that's a very good ending and very fitting for our comeback episode.
00:58:21.786 - 00:58:22.062, Speaker B: Cool.
00:58:22.116 - 00:58:27.342, Speaker A: Thanks for the great discussion, sue, and see you hopefully sooner than in three months this time.
00:58:27.396 - 00:58:29.118, Speaker B: Yeah, sounds good. Take care.
00:58:29.204 - 00:58:29.500, Speaker A: Take care.
