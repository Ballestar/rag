00:00:00.650 - 00:00:18.538, Speaker A: Welcome to Uncommon Core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. This show is hosted by Su Zu, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of 3 Hours Capital and Me hasu a crypto researcher and writer. Welcome, sue.
00:00:18.634 - 00:00:19.374, Speaker B: Hey guys.
00:00:19.492 - 00:00:42.070, Speaker A: Together, we brought on Richard Galvin, the co founder and CEO of Sydney based digital Assets Capital Management, or DACM. His fund has been a top performing crypto venture fund in recent years and was also among the first to bet on the emergence of decentralized finance or DeFi on ethereum and other blockchains. Thanks so much for coming on the show, Richard.
00:00:42.510 - 00:00:45.658, Speaker C: Thanks for having me guys. I love the podcast. It's an honor to be here.
00:00:45.824 - 00:01:02.350, Speaker A: You're actually one of the sorry to say that you're actually one of the older people I've met, but that makes it even more fascinating to talk to you. Can you tell us a bit about your history and how you came to invest in crypto and start the ACM?
00:01:02.710 - 00:01:19.954, Speaker C: Sure, yeah, I am a little older. I started my career in the mid 90s in investment banking and spent 20 years at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Spent that time focused around the telco, media and technology sectors mainly.
00:01:19.954 - 00:01:53.098, Speaker C: So I saw the disruption of the Internet and as that came and started to disintermediate communications and media and the impact that had on the clients that I used to work with. So had two key roles through that career. I ended up running the co head of the TMT Advisory group at Goldman and then I switched back to financing and worked at JPMorgan for six years and ended up running their equity capital and derivatives markets team, again focused on sort of high growth TMT Space Left Bank in 2016.
00:01:53.098 - 00:02:16.306, Speaker C: Like a lot of people found their way to crypto through a mutual contact, fell in love with the technology but also fell in love with the markets and what the people had created around the trading ecosystem for this globally fungible, highly liquid token. And it kind of brought the two things that I'd worked on all my life together, which were really technology, high growth, technology disruption and markets.
00:02:16.418 - 00:02:33.518, Speaker A: You touched on some of the things that you like about crypto in more general terms. What is your thesis for investing in crypto? Why did you come to invest here and where do you place it on basically the map for macro investors or investors in general?
00:02:33.684 - 00:03:00.274, Speaker C: I think if you're going to invest in any asset or any thematic, if you can get sort of tailwinds behind you across the whole asset class, that makes your job a lot easier because you're kind of like you're sort of sailing with the wind. It can make your mistakes less brutal and it can make your wins much bigger. And I think when I first came to Crypto and we'll get to valuation in a minute, because I thought it was outlandishly cheap when I first found it.
00:03:00.274 - 00:03:21.842, Speaker C: But I think at a thematic level, it seemed to capture a lot of the disruption that I thought was going to come across the world over the next ten to 20 years. I think the three key categories I'd put that in is digitization. The unstoppable trend I think we'll see for the next 20 to 30 years, and we've been living through for the last 20 years, is the digitization of society and the digitization of assets.
00:03:21.842 - 00:03:42.866, Speaker C: And it's hard to think of any thematic that's more perfectly positioned for that than crypto. Decentralization, I think, is a key theme at a more macro level, not specifically on a technology level across society. I mean, people live their lives in a much more decentralized manner than they did 20 to 30 years ago with their social groups, with their work.
00:03:42.866 - 00:04:21.406, Speaker C: And that's partly driven by digitization and probably has been accelerated to a degree with COVID as well, pushing more and more people to think about how they can work in a decentralized manner and communicate with groups on a decentralized basis. And I think the third thing that kind of struck me and was well aware of that coming from, I guess, my previous career in investment banking, there was definitely a falling level of trust, I think, across society with the traditional institutions, particularly within the financial services sector. And I think some of that is frustrating, particularly for someone that used to work in that sector, but it's understandable to a level as well.
00:04:21.406 - 00:04:39.320, Speaker C: And I think it's undeniable, it's undeniably there and it's got even more so in the five years or so since I've left that sector. So if you wrap that together, you can think about sort of three very key trends that sort of play right into, right into crypto's hands. You've got the birth of a very new digital asset class.
00:04:39.320 - 00:05:07.920, Speaker C: It plays upon a theme which is pushing through society, which is decentralization, and its key disruption is amongst those traditional institutions that people have lost faith in, particularly since the financial crisis in the late two thousand s. And it provides a solution for that lack of trust in a trustless form of technology that disintermediates those institutions. So when you find an asset, an asset class where you've got those tailwinds to invest in, that's a pretty unique opportunity.
00:05:07.920 - 00:05:46.266, Speaker C: I think the other thing I've also learned, being a bit of a student of financial markets history, is new asset classes don't come along very often and when they do come along, they're an exciting place to be. There's a lot of innovation, there's a lot of opportunity, there's a lot of opportunity across to build new brands, new services, and to really sort of build an edge as an investor and to build a brand in financial services, which is not an easy thing to do when you're building like an investment business. I think those things together made it an easy choice for me for the next sort of career move.
00:05:46.266 - 00:05:49.626, Speaker C: Post investment banking, we know obviously a.
00:05:49.648 - 00:06:09.250, Speaker A: Lot about the Occupy Wall Street movement, and basically we know all about the people who lose their trust in the financial institutions and institutions in general. But how did you or did you at all notice this erosion of trust while you were inside the traditional finance sector?
00:06:10.470 - 00:06:42.154, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you actually see it from both angles. So there is a definite change within the attitude towards clients that we used to work with over my career from sort of the mid 90s through to the sort of the mid 2010s. There's a lot more skeptical view of the investment banking career and investment banks in general, and I'd say a lot more combative relationship between the banks and their clients that developed over those 20 to 30 years.
00:06:42.154 - 00:07:00.654, Speaker C: Now, it's not to say there's a complete breakdown of trust or anything. It was just a very different relationship, I guess, than the one that I walked into in the mid ninety s, I think. Adding to that, I think the level of trust within those organizations has also decreased over that period.
00:07:00.654 - 00:07:19.678, Speaker C: I was in the banks with the increased regulation they faced, with the ongoing fines and lawsuits and all those sorts of things. They do second guess themselves a lot more than they did when I started. The controls and compliance become quite stifling as you work through those institutions.
00:07:19.678 - 00:07:31.014, Speaker C: And I think that's probably been a societal push to make that happen. And that's understandable after what happened with the financial cris, but it particularly changed. The environment within those banks.
00:07:31.014 - 00:07:52.180, Speaker C: And I think they lost a lot of the innovation, a lot of the entrepreneurial spirit that they had when I joined those organizations in the mid ninety s and worked through them particularly before the financial crisis, and that's probably the goal of some of the regulation. But with someone working there, it definitely changed the attitudes or changed the environment in which you were working.
00:07:52.710 - 00:08:05.314, Speaker A: Did people ask themselves at all if they are the bad guys, like, as stupid as that sounds, or was it more like increasing content against government regulation and populism?
00:08:05.442 - 00:08:41.460, Speaker C: No, I think there's a realization in those banks that some things needed to change, and the excesses before the financial crisis, some of them needed to be wound back. I think those institutions also faced a lot of competition, which they hadn't faced for the last 20 to 30 years as well. I mean, we saw the rise of the fast super growth tech companies, which became quite competitive, particularly at a hiring level, amongst what would be traditionally seen as the sort of graduate market that those banks played in.
00:08:41.460 - 00:09:10.582, Speaker C: So I think they also started to see competitive threats they hadn't seen in a long time for top graduates, the top graduates out of most universities generally. The banks had a pretty good share of getting those top graduates into their graduate programs and that makes sense because they are a very good training ground and I found that myself and I'm very pleased with the training or very thankful for the training that I got working through those institutions. But they started to find a lot more competitive.
00:09:10.582 - 00:09:23.390, Speaker C: I think particularly as you saw the rise of the Googles and the Facebooks and those sorts of places. It became a pretty desirable place for some of the key graduates to go and that starts to sort of impact, I guess, some of the ways they react and some of the culture.
00:09:24.290 - 00:09:29.874, Speaker A: How do you think people who still work in traditional finance view crypto right now from the outside?
00:09:30.072 - 00:09:56.700, Speaker C: I think there's been a substantial change in the last probably twelve to six months. I always found it and to be honest, when I first got into this space I was amazed at and that was one of the things that excited me about it to be honest. That the lack of engagement or the lack of knowledge that my former colleagues had around this, what I had high conviction was a new asset class.
00:09:56.700 - 00:10:40.914, Speaker C: The people I used to work with are some of the most financially sophisticated people in the world and at a personal level, some of their investments across extremely exotic type investments around derivatives and assets and structured products and those sorts of things. So these aren't people that have very standard share index type portfolios, these are people that are highly sophisticated investors yet I didn't know one of them that had any exposure whatsoever to crypto. And I think part of the small part of my excitement at the time of finding the space was that none of them were there and it just seemed inevitable to me that investors with those sorts of diversified portfolios would find their way to this asset class over time and they haven't.
00:10:40.914 - 00:11:00.240, Speaker C: I think we've seen that in particular the last six months and also just gave me more comfort, I guess, of the valuation upside as those sort of people started to approach the sector at some point in the future. And apply some of the methodologies I guess I was looking at the sector with in the early days to what I thought was probably some of the most undervalued tech I'd ever found.
00:11:01.250 - 00:11:30.570, Speaker B: I guess a question I would have as a follow up is how do you see it interacting as more Wall Street people come into crypto? Do you think that Wall Street firms will, let's say for instance, put customer funds into DeFi? Do you think they'll start voting in governance or do you see it more as the people at these firms will look to build on DeFi and it kind of will. Just how do you see Wall Street and DeFi interacting?
00:11:30.990 - 00:11:52.970, Speaker C: I think it's a difficult one to answer just because the pace at which Wall Street and I guess financial services in general moves now is so encumbered. It traditionally hasn't been the fastest moving sector but I think even nowadays it's even slower than it has traditionally. It seems like a hard thing for them to keep up with to be frank.
00:11:52.970 - 00:12:21.740, Speaker C: And I mean we have seen it even in my part of the world. The ASX has been trying to build a blockchain solution now I think for three or four years and there's still no closer to launching that. And if you think of the innovation that's happened in this space over the three or four years since they've been looking to build this solution, I think it just shows the mismatch between what I'd say is the traditional financial market, the traditional financial services sector, and what the blockchain speed, what the blockchain economies move at.
00:12:21.740 - 00:12:31.366, Speaker C: And I think that's one of the things that I think we find so exciting about this tech. I mean, we saw a great page. Just to put it in context.
00:12:31.366 - 00:12:45.806, Speaker C: There's a great chart we use that shows how hard it is to open a bank account in Europe. How long it takes in terms of clicks and days. And I think on average, it's something I'll probably misquote it, but you'll get the quantums kind of the idea.
00:12:45.806 - 00:12:54.274, Speaker C: On average it takes something like 30 or 40 clicks to open a bank account in the UK and takes I think up to eight days on average and can be up to 60 days.
00:12:54.472 - 00:13:28.938, Speaker A: I actually tried to open a bank account a couple of days ago for a company and I was turned down by the biggest German bank. They just won't do it for compliance reasons because I have in the past made some of my money by playing online poker which is completely legal in Germany but the banks won't touch it. They won't even give a bank account to a company where I'm a shareholder because I had to deal with mean this just validates DeFi and well just permissionless blockchain technology on so many levels in my opinion.
00:13:29.034 - 00:14:04.474, Speaker C: Yeah well I mean the equivalent bank account although there's obviously still some way to go to make it as I guess user friendly in the traditional world as a normal bank account. But I mean you're talking about seconds in terms of interacting and what, two or three clicks for that to happen. So I think the problem they face is just the sheer disruption and I think I'd see a similar thing play out sue that I saw play out through the media sector while I was working and working in an advisory capacity there through the mid ninety s to the early 2000s.
00:14:04.474 - 00:14:30.446, Speaker C: Their ability to move, even at the Internet's disruptive speed. Big traditional corporates and telcos was just encumbered by, I guess, the bureaucracy around those businesses and some of the entrenched power structures. And we saw so much destruction of value from traditional media as they failed to grasp, I guess, the disintermediation power of the Internet.
00:14:30.446 - 00:14:57.014, Speaker C: And then by the time they realized the power of that, their ability to actually then adapt and get on the defensive in the right sort of way. Now, there has been some exceptions around the media space, those that have done it, but by and large it was a destructive outcome for media companies and communication companies. And I suspect we'll see a similar thing in financial services as they struggle to keep up with the speed of change and innovation.
00:14:57.062 - 00:15:42.220, Speaker A: Here you mentioned the three big tailwinds that led you to invest in crypto and see it as a very profitable asset class, digitization decentralization and the erosion of trust in society. How do you go about when you have big thesis like these, which I by the way, I strongly agree with, and I would add a fourth one, which is maybe just the level of demographic change and just the wealth distribution between different generations, then how do you go about thinking about replicating that thesis with a fund? The investable universe is so big, how do you decide what to buy on, what time frames and so on?
00:15:44.110 - 00:16:27.366, Speaker C: Well, that thesis is basically predicated on a huge disruptive wave that's going to move through based on this technology, right? And so the way we think about it is where will that disruption hit first and hit the hardest and where will it be monetizable? And I think we would take a lesson from, again Cape harping back to but what we saw with the internet. If you look today at what the initial digital revolution drove, the internet's basically disintermediated all through supply chains, communications, entertainment basically there's hardly anything that's been untouched by it. That wasn't the case in the early days.
00:16:27.366 - 00:16:54.020, Speaker C: The applications and the uses of internet technology that actually accrued value were relatively confined in that sort of initial wave of the technology, sort of through that sort of mid ninety s and early 2000s period. And it really was the value accrued largely around that sort of media, communications, telecommunications space first. And that's where I guess the most disruption happened.
00:16:54.020 - 00:17:31.986, Speaker C: When we looked at this technology, we try to find what would be the most disrupted traditional markets or traditional economies from this technology and time and time again we just kept coming back to finance, centralized finance, financial services, however you want to portray it to us. Every time we thought about what this technology causes in terms of disruption, where it focuses, where its best use cases or its most value occurring use cases are. Time and time again we came to finance.
00:17:31.986 - 00:17:41.120, Speaker C: And that's largely why, I guess we're focused largely on finance orientated investments, both at a layer one type of level and in the DeFi space as well.
00:17:41.890 - 00:17:46.850, Speaker A: Do you include store of value type assets in that category?
00:17:47.670 - 00:18:18.426, Speaker C: Yeah, we've always been a big proponent of the digital gold thesis for bitcoin and that's been, I guess, how we've always viewed our investment into Bitcoin as a firm, that it would take that position as digital gold. I actually think that is an alpha use case for any asset. I think if an asset was a person and you could ask them what role they would want in an economy, to be the store of value would probably be the first one you would choose.
00:18:18.426 - 00:18:56.066, Speaker C: It's an extremely valuable place to hold when you think of the stack of value in any economy. So I think that is absolutely a financially disruptive position to be in, and I also think it's a hugely valuable position to hold. And from my perspective, looking across all the different thesis people always had around what Bitcoin could be, from our perspective, the store of value was always going to be our view was always going to be the alpha use case that was going to be the most disruptive and the most value accruing end case for Bitcoin.
00:18:56.066 - 00:19:20.174, Speaker C: And it's played out that way, in our view. But we also think that would crowd out other use cases for Bitcoin. So we always had a view that some of the attributes that you want of your store of value robustness, just absolute security and certainty, means that you also don't want to change it, right? You don't want it to innovate, you don't want to add new attack vectors to it.
00:19:20.174 - 00:19:53.226, Speaker C: And therefore other potential use cases kind of get crowded out from the mix as the store of value kind of takes hold and becomes the key value driver. And I guess that's why we've always been I guess a portfolio investor is we always had a view that other use cases would go down, would trickle down to other chains and other technology solutions that weren't encumbered by that highly valuable use case. And they'd find a place where they could offer other use cases that would be just as disruptive and as value creative over time as well.
00:19:53.408 - 00:20:14.770, Speaker B: And how do you view, I guess, more broadly, application layer versus layer, one versus ether in terms of I mean, it's obviously a very complicated question, but in general, do you think that applications will be worth a lot more than the layers that they're on, or vice versa?
00:20:15.190 - 00:20:53.538, Speaker C: I think it's becoming even more blurred now, sue, because you're actually seeing applications that have their own yeah, particularly things like Kava and Terra, where you've effectively got like an application type offering that's also running its own chain. So we are seeing a much more blurred landscape than we had or we were theorizing about back when we sort of launched our firm back in 2017. We've always had a view that there would be a number of layer one solutions that would come out of this space that would be multitillion dollar assets.
00:20:53.538 - 00:21:17.670, Speaker C: And I think we've still got that view. I think the thing that's probably changed over the last few years is we can also see multitillion dollar type applications that could be somewhat layer agnostic built on top of those economies as well. But it is a rapidly moving and I'd have to say some of the views we had back in 2017 that's some of the things that's changed just as the space has kind of grown.
00:21:17.670 - 00:22:00.430, Speaker C: I think also knowing about how investors sometimes value assets and where, I guess investment capital accrues makes me think that layer one solutions will still be, at least over the medium term, a favorite investment choice for a lot of traditional capital just because it's an easier investment decision to make. This might be an Aussie saying, but I think it's more broadly used. It's more of a selling shovels to the miners type scenario, right? Where you can take a view on a thematic growth without having to take a specific view on a management's team to execute or a project's team to execute and an application to keep innovating.
00:22:00.430 - 00:22:32.640, Speaker C: You can take, I guess, an economy wide view as opposed to having to take an application specific view, which I think a number of investors, particularly in a new asset class will prefer. So I don't think we'll see the dilution of value or some of the premiums we see in layer ones removed anytime soon based on the fact that that'll still be the preferred investment place for a lot of new investors or what I'd say is more traditional, probably less native crypto investors into the space.
00:22:35.010 - 00:23:01.160, Speaker A: We did a sound check yesterday where we had a half hour conversation that I wish we had recorded because it was very interesting and we talked about the role of valuation models on how investors, on how viable basically investors see a particular asset class. Isn't it also the case that layer one blockchains are much harder to value than some of the application layer that we now see?
00:23:02.090 - 00:23:28.254, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they are, but I think that's a relatively new innovation and I think well, a relatively new change given the reworking of tokenomics and those sorts of things, particularly we've seen driven out of the DeFi space. And I think that's no surprise. That's why we're seeing some of those DeFi applications become I think uniswap is like the 8th biggest depends how you measure it, but 8th biggest crypto asset by market cap at the moment.
00:23:28.254 - 00:24:06.090, Speaker C: And it's no surprise that to me that that's the case given that you can build a traditional or kind of build a traditional valuation methodology around uniswap to get some comfort around what it could be worth based on a number of scenarios. I think you're right in terms of the layer one value mechanisms or the way to value them is harder than it would be for a DeFi app. Right, because DeFi app tokens have basically converted themselves into something that looks a lot more like an equity typical investment.
00:24:06.090 - 00:24:32.260, Speaker C: There's still a lot of changes than they used to some time ago and so that's no surprise to me. You've seen DeFi be a significant re rating as it's been that as it's a sector people can more comfortably invest in if they've got that traditional valuation driven approach. I still think though, the thematic of the layer ones with a whole raft of applications on top of them is still a pretty compelling investment story.
00:24:32.260 - 00:25:14.400, Speaker C: And I still think over time people will treat this technology like they treat most other technology, which is not get too worried about the valuation accrual in the short term, knowing that once the technology takes hold, once it starts to add value, the owners of the technology or the investors or the original capital providers will get rewarded in some way. And I think we've seen that play out in DeFi to a degree as well, where you've effectively started to see the tokenomics getting reworked only once they started to actually have a real value proposition and a real user base. And I think we're never in a hurry to see our projects start returning capital to us.
00:25:14.400 - 00:25:33.720, Speaker C: We're not even in too fast if the economic model is still somewhat hazy, if we think the use case holds because I guess we just have faith that if you can build a user base where you're adding value, it'll get worked out at some point that the providers of the capital that got that use case up and going will get some form of return.
00:25:36.730 - 00:26:01.514, Speaker A: You said something very interesting, which is that anything is investable, you think if the use case holds. And I would like to connect that to something that Paul Graham tweeted the other day. I think the tweet was something like his kid asked him why we need the financial sector in general and he couldn't come up with any explanation and try to then present that as some kind of gotcha.
00:26:01.514 - 00:26:22.070, Speaker A: So when we look at DeFi today, it seems to be very self referential. There's not a lot of real world use cases and I think most people see that as well when they look at the regular financial system. So I have a very general question for both of you why does the world need a financial system, a financial sector?
00:26:25.850 - 00:26:50.590, Speaker C: I'll have the first step at that. I think what people underplay or underrate is the importance of the cost of capital in an economy. And if you look across the world and the world's leading economies, you'll generally find a pretty strong correlation between the efficiency of capital that's available to entrepreneurs and businesses and the growth and the wealth that accrues in those economies.
00:26:50.590 - 00:27:18.562, Speaker C: And I would say that having a sophisticated financial system, you could argue, gets over sophisticated and goes down the wrong path at many times, but ultimately its purpose is to find the most efficient way to raise and use capital across the economy. And if you looked at the US economy it's clearly the biggest pool of capital in the world. On most measures, it's the most efficient and cheapest pool of capital.
00:27:18.562 - 00:28:02.390, Speaker C: Hence why so many companies like to list there and get access to that liquidity. And so it's no surprise that they've spawned some of the greatest companies the world's ever seen based off the fact of their extremely efficient capital market. So my response to that tweet would be that I see the key purpose of the financial services sector, apart from the services it provides to the retail mortgage holders and those sorts of things, is really to provide added efficiency at that capital formulation layer, allowing companies to lower their cost of capital and be the most efficient users of capital and most efficient financiers of the growth that they're trying to produce.
00:28:02.810 - 00:28:16.294, Speaker B: Yeah, those are all good points. And I think more broadly too, there's never been a society without finance. Then it's just a matter of how it's organized or how it's constructed.
00:28:16.294 - 00:28:38.980, Speaker B: Right. Because even when in the old days, when we use shells or we use things, when we use the promise of another person vouching for you, when you're on the Silk Road, the old Silk Road, people need a way to represent value and to exchange it in as efficient a way as they can think of. Right.
00:28:38.980 - 00:28:58.982, Speaker B: If you try to imagine a world without finance, for me, having been in finance so long, I don't know how you would have a supply chain. I don't know how you would be able to get a product from city A to city B. I don't get how anyone would invent anything or anything would get produced.
00:28:58.982 - 00:29:14.110, Speaker B: So I kind of see finance as really the glue that makes all that happen via systems of incentives. But I do think that Paul Graham has a point, which is that the financial sector is different from finance itself.
00:29:14.180 - 00:29:14.414, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:14.452 - 00:29:49.270, Speaker B: The financial sector, as it were, is the collection of people that are in suits and behave a certain way. And yes, this can obviously wear different faces over generations, and I think it will through crypto, but I don't think that the underlying ideas of borrow and lending, of trading, of these kinds of capital formation, I don't think these ideas are the things that can be overtaken. I don't think there's that much new under the sun in terms of those ideas.
00:29:49.610 - 00:30:20.500, Speaker C: I think it's interesting. One of the things I see it a lot in crypto is the I don't think people fully grasp the value that secondary liquid markets provide across the whole sort of value chain and economy. People think of trading as this one sort of spot incident of people moving assets around, and they forget that the trading is the it's probably the wrong way to portray, but it's the necessary evil of having a liquid and low cost primary market.
00:30:20.500 - 00:30:29.558, Speaker C: The fact that I can buy a share in a company that I've then got liquidity in. Means that I'm willing to pay a higher price for that share than if it wasn't liquid. Right.
00:30:29.558 - 00:31:13.134, Speaker C: So you can't really divorce that whole value chain of primary even from a VC level through to a pre IPO level, to then a secondary market placement or rights issue type financing, that whole value chain. And people sort of forget that it's all intertwined to basically producing the lowest cost of capital in my view, to those users of capital, which is generally corporations or entrepreneurs. And if you take one piece out of it so if you take the trading piece out of it and you reduce liquidity the flow on impact through that, through that primary capital part, like if I'm a VC investor and I can't get liquidity in the future, then clearly I'm going to ask for a bigger return when I make that investment.
00:31:13.134 - 00:31:43.550, Speaker C: Right? If my path to liquidity is longer, less certain, or is more unknown, then clearly I'm going to have a higher hurdle rate when I invest. But if my path to liquidity is to a very liquid share market or a very liquid crypto market or whatever it may be, clearly I'll lower my return threshold. I'll lower my cost of capital and in a way that allows entrepreneurs to also make more returns for their investments because they have to dilute less to investors like ourselves.
00:31:44.370 - 00:32:03.540, Speaker A: Fantastic. Yeah, I never heard it expressed that way. But thinking about secondary markets, I mean, yeah, on the one hand as a necessary evil where you then get sort of trading and arbitrage and whatnot, but on the other hand as it lowering the cost of capital to invest in the primary markets, that makes so much sense.
00:32:03.540 - 00:32:26.540, Speaker A: And the reason that I ask this is if we look at DeFi today and as investors, we need to build some confidence about bets that we can make use cases that will hold for a decade or longer. Right? So how do you think that DeFi actually improves on what we just talked about?
00:32:28.110 - 00:33:12.890, Speaker C: I think, and you guys did a great podcast after the GameStop incident about some of the barriers or some of the layers of value within the traditional markets and how it's harder to break down some of those barriers for smaller investors or they start at a disadvantage based on the market structure. I think that's one of the key advantages that DeFi has in terms of opening up a system that's become more and more closed as time has gone by. I think the concept and to be honest, I see this a lot in crypto people underestimate the revolutionary nature of what's happening in DeFi.
00:33:12.890 - 00:33:54.374, Speaker C: And I think I've probably got a fortunate position of having lived both sides of the markets and lived in the detail of the traditional markets and investment banks and how they work and how they make money. And then see how disruptive what DeFi is creating to that value chain that the investment banks have, or investment banks and hedge funds and large institutional players in those markets have had for decades now. I mean, the concept of anyone being able to provide liquidity into a market and earn a good return for providing that liquidity, be it putting current ethereum fees to one side, but be it from $100 up to $10.
00:33:54.374 - 00:34:38.550, Speaker C: Million is such a revolutionary concept compared to what happens in traditional markets now, where you've got a small club of key liquidity providers and everyone else is just trading at a disadvantage to them with imperfect information and the value accrues to that small club of liquidity providers. Whereas in DFI, if I provide $10 to uniswap or a billion dollars to uniswap, my percentage return of the pool is exactly the same and the return I get on my capital is exactly the same. That's incredibly revolutionary concept and extremely disruptive that just opens the playing field as to who can play and who can get a return on their capital.
00:34:38.550 - 00:34:48.250, Speaker C: That has really been sort of, I guess, ring fenced to a very elite group of corporates and investors to date. And more so lately.
00:34:49.150 - 00:35:10.846, Speaker A: Also I've heard a lot that when you're one of the super rich, then you have way more possibilities to basically rehypothecate your own collateral, if you will, right? So you can invest in a hedge fund and then you can take your shares in a hedge fund and use it to collateralize something else. What do you think about democratizing this particular use case?
00:35:11.028 - 00:35:34.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's probably why we get so excited about when we step below that sort of those macro thesis I spoke about, about the tailwinds around decentralization digitization and the like. Some of the other things we get really excited about as you step into a more specific crypto element to it is composable yield. And what composability brings to the table.
00:35:34.390 - 00:35:58.058, Speaker C: Again, the concept of composability is so foreign to anything you'd see for a typical investor into traditional markets. And I think to your point, what it does, it gives the power of capital efficiency to a smaller investor that's just not there today. And to be honest, you're basically replicating.
00:35:58.058 - 00:36:49.982, Speaker C: I guess probably the closest model to it, and I'd be interested in Sue's view. But the closest model to it today is that of a prime broker who basically provides whole of portfolio services to elite super large hedge funds and allows them to have a material capital advantage against a smaller investor into a market who doesn't get the chance to basically re hypothecate their capital or lever against existing positions. So the concept in DeFi of being able to provide liquidity into one platform and then take that liquidity and effectively use it as collateral for another use case where I'm also earning a return and start to get those kind of elite capital efficiency type metrics that the world's leading hedge funds have enjoyed for some time.
00:36:49.982 - 00:37:11.750, Speaker C: But to do it on a small investor retail level is a pretty disruptive outcome. And I guess something we got the most excited about when we started to find DeFi. And when you look across our portfolio, we think the people that provide those composable yield opportunities, we think they'll be some of the leading platforms that come out of this DeFi revolution.
00:37:11.750 - 00:37:19.882, Speaker C: As capital starts to accrue to those sorts of use cases and they start to be the ones that acquire scale, I think probably the fastest, maybe.
00:37:19.936 - 00:37:53.166, Speaker B: Just to think about the recent run in Nifties, I think is interesting as well, just to tie in with the idea that financialization does seem to make something more useful. It gives it liveness, right? So if you think about baseball cards or basketball cards, they originally weren't really meant to be collected as a store value or as a bet on collectibility. It was really you saw the player's stats, right? Like you wanted to know how many points he scored and people bought these things and it was like informational.
00:37:53.166 - 00:38:38.066, Speaker B: And then over time, as the sport became more popular, people thought these are cool because not that many people managed to keep theirs in good condition or whatever, but then it's still really just sitting in your house somewhere and you have to send it in to get it rated and you can't borrow against it. No one is going to do that for you. So you kind of see that with the financialization now, people can put out content and then they can do a lot of this peer to peer finance using creation, right? The artistic creation or any other kind of so I think that, like Richard said, a lot of the existing financial system is really intended for very wealthy people to do these kinds of things.
00:38:38.066 - 00:39:06.060, Speaker B: And these things exist well for them. So people can do very fancy foundations to split up their inheritance in cool ways and do tax arbitrage and things like that, or put their art in a certain way that they never have to pay tax for 25 years. But you're kind of seeing democratization of all these kinds of things where because the cost of each transaction is going lower, because there's a network effect to information.
00:39:06.060 - 00:39:26.210, Speaker B: Whereas in the traditional world, if you want to set up a certain legal entity might have to pay some lawyer fifty k, one hundred K to set it up. And it's just boilerplate, it's just copy paste, but there's no network effective information. But the same thing gets created again and again and again, which is the opposite of innovation, right? It's kind of stifling.
00:39:26.210 - 00:40:02.560, Speaker B: So I think from that lens, from seeing how Nifties have grown and how top shots are now, a lot of them are worth more than very well collected basketball cards for many years. It does appear that the market gives a big premium to liveness and it gives a big premium to being able to do stuff for individuals. So I think you're already seeing the democratization and I think it's going to be bigger than people realize or anyone can even imagine because we haven't really seen this before in human history.
00:40:03.170 - 00:40:24.050, Speaker A: How would you say compared to traditional finance, DeFi affects the cost of trust? As someone who's not in that system, it's really difficult for me to say. So how many transactions are actually prevented in the traditional finance space because trust is too expensive to establish or even impossible in some cases?
00:40:25.450 - 00:41:22.840, Speaker C: I think the information asymmetry in the traditional finance would be quite staggering to a lot of people that haven't worked in it before. Just the amount of information within the you know, within the large investment banks and trading firms around the world across multiple layers in terms of access, but even particularly down to information around order flows and those sorts of things that just tightly kept secrets that only the most senior people within investment bank see and traders within the bank see and the information asymmetry that they have. I guess those two parties, sort of larger investors and investment banks have given their status within a traditional financial system.
00:41:22.840 - 00:42:00.466, Speaker C: If you look at DeFi, everyone can see everyone's order, right? You can track wallets, you can see every transaction flow. You've basically broken down a lot of the information asymmetry that has been, I guess, create a lot of the barriers within traditional markets and that's how a lot of the values cut up is between who has that informational advantage over who doesn't. And I guess that was one of the interesting things you guys covered when you went through the game swap situation and I thought that was really valuable insight to a lot of people outside of the traditional market.
00:42:00.466 - 00:42:19.340, Speaker C: So to see DeFi disrupting that and breaking that value out into a very democratized level and distributing that value across the whole ecosystem as opposed into just a peer group or a very small group of people that have much better information over everyone else I think is a pretty exciting thing to see.
00:42:21.310 - 00:42:33.040, Speaker A: If DeFi breaks up these walls where value, quote unquote, sticks in traditional finance, then where do you think DeFi protocols can actually build their modes and retain that value into the future?
00:42:35.650 - 00:43:43.202, Speaker C: I think this comes back to I think we're starting to see in DeFi similar to what we'd see in traditional blockchains, that there is a moat around and I mean, these time frames are so small, it seems a bit weird saying it, but there is a moat around experience and longevity. And I mean, we are still only talking about platforms that are in many cases less than a year old, but a platform that survived or has innovated or has a longer track record than another I think will start to see the benefits of that accrue more over time as well. And it just stands to reason that a platform that's seen billions of dollars trade through it consistently over a long period of time and has been able to hand that, been able to handle that without sizable hacks or maintain a solid platform will be able to offer will only have to offer investors a lower return than a new platform that's doing the same thing.
00:43:43.202 - 00:44:12.714, Speaker C: So you start to get into that sort of cost of capital advantage topic that we spoke about earlier and you start to build a moat around. The reliable platforms that have a stronger track record will start to get access to capital, be it liquidity at a lower rate than the newer platform and that'll give them a moat to basically protect them against newer platforms. And then that just puts the onus on the newer platform to be more innovative and more value additive to make up for the higher cost of capital that it's going to have to pay.
00:44:12.714 - 00:44:39.186, Speaker C: That doesn't mean that moat is completely defensible and it never is if you look across any technology or any sector. But I think that's the first one we're starting to see accrue to some of the bigger DeFi apps and it doesn't mean people won't attack them. And you see things like sushi swap and those sorts of really innovative takes on competition that you'd never see in traditional markets to sort of test these thesis out.
00:44:39.186 - 00:44:44.406, Speaker C: But I think that's probably the first one that comes to mind in DeFi, the longevity and the trust based on.
00:44:44.428 - 00:44:51.850, Speaker A: This thesis that you have. Would you say then that money markets and exchanges are the primary investment cases for now inside DeFi?
00:44:52.750 - 00:45:25.298, Speaker C: I think they're the most obvious and I think they're the most disruptive. And that is when, as I said to you, when we looked back at the disruption that the internet caused and trying to find those sort of three or four sort of key industries or use cases that would get disrupted the most and where value would accrue to the disruptor, DEXes and money markets are a pretty obvious one. And it's no surprise that's where we've invested a lot of our capital, just because we think that's a highly disruptive use case.
00:45:25.298 - 00:45:47.580, Speaker C: And it's a use case where you can see a clear path to value. Now, it doesn't mean this technology is not going to disrupt whole sorts of other industries and sectors and things like supply chain and NFT and art and all those sorts of things that will come in time. Just the path to value there is probably more opaque now than it particularly is in the DeFi space.
00:45:47.580 - 00:46:00.000, Speaker C: And I think that'll come it's just for us and that's why we're focused on this sort of financial set, this financial disruption first. We just think that's kind of the killer use case number one for this technology.
00:46:01.970 - 00:46:13.460, Speaker A: How do you think about valuing these DeFi protocols and how much does it matter how you would value them versus how much you think everyone else is going to value them.
00:46:14.790 - 00:46:38.620, Speaker C: Look, there are some similarities to traditional assets, and then there's a lot of differences. I think one of the things that got us most excited about investing in DeFi was the fact that you could attempt traditional valuation methodology on some of these tokens. And I think that does a number of things that opens up a whole new world of potential investors into the space.
00:46:38.620 - 00:46:57.090, Speaker C: If you look through all markets, the pool of speculative capital is a lot smaller than the pool of fundamental driven capital. And it just stands to reason, as you go through the risk curve, that's what happens. As you get lower risk, usually you get bigger pools of capital.
00:46:57.090 - 00:47:28.502, Speaker C: With DeFi tokens. With the DeFi business models and the economics we started to see coming through there, it became clear to us that you would start to see models where you could build a traditional type DCF type approach and you could start to build multiples, comparable multiples across different platforms to start to form a relative view on value. And when you have that, that opens up a whole new world of, I guess, more fundamental driven investors that can get comfortable with buying those assets.
00:47:28.502 - 00:47:50.690, Speaker C: And I think we're starting to see that. And we see that in our discussions with our LPs, and particularly with some of my old peers in traditional finance. When I run them through these DFI protocols or DFI applications, they get super excited about the ability to use, or sort of use the methodologies that they've learned for the last 20 or 30 years to try and analyze these investments.
00:47:50.690 - 00:48:19.926, Speaker C: And to be honest, when we started to use that methodology, and we've tried to use that since day one, and with some success, but it's been difficult at times. It comes out pretty favorably when we compare it to most other technology, and particularly given, I guess, the re rating we've seen in technology over the last three or four years as well. So it's always been our view that when you started to apply those methodologies, this technology would stand out as cheap or undervalued.
00:48:19.926 - 00:48:41.998, Speaker C: And the more people that applied that, we'd start to see a re rating. And I think we've probably seen that play out through DeFi. I think the other thing that you shouldn't underestimate is when you hold an asset that you have a fundamental view on value, it's much easier to hold that asset through volatility, and it's much easier to hold that asset, particularly in a bear market or a downturn.
00:48:41.998 - 00:49:07.878, Speaker C: And I think that partly goes to the psychology of our firm. If we build a thesis around value and the market sells off 30 or 40%, like crypto markets do, it's a lot easier to hold a token that the valuation still stays the same, right? If the usage metrics or the revenue looks the same, but the market's off 30 or 40%. It gives you a lot more conviction to sort of ride out those downturns.
00:49:07.878 - 00:49:29.806, Speaker C: If you're holding something that's much more speculative in nature, it's a lot easier to get worried out of out of it in a down market. So it's partly maybe that's just a personal style type approach to investing, but we find it much easier in volatile markets like this to build a fundamental view of value and help that give us conviction through that volatility.
00:49:29.998 - 00:49:48.166, Speaker A: You said when the DFI market turns down 30% to 40% and the valuation stays the same. So how do you think about reflexivity in DFI? Because I feel like we see this a lot, right? The value of a particular token goes up. The value of its liquidity mining reward goes up.
00:49:48.166 - 00:49:59.260, Speaker A: It attracts more TVL, the valuation goes up. And so you have this kind of flywheel that makes everything more valuable on the way up, but then also make it crash way harder on the way down.
00:50:00.430 - 00:50:30.114, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it can be overplayed a little bit because I think the quantum of capital or the quantum of, I guess, incremental buyer or seller in up or down ticks in crypto can often make those sort of inflationary impacts somewhat negligible. I think, for example, Salana is probably a decent example. It's gone through a vesting of 90% plus through January.
00:50:30.114 - 00:51:07.810, Speaker C: So you've had a huge uptick in liquidity in the token, yet it's risen over that period from a dollar 50 to like twelve or $13. So I think the concept in crypto that sometimes that reflexivity is driven by price or driven by liquidity upticks or vesting or those sorts of things, I think can be overplayed a little bit. Like it's not something to be completely disregarded, but to me, the incremental buyer on an uptick or a downtick outweighs any of the I guess the impact that some of those metrics or some of those supply changes will have on how a token trades or a coin trades.
00:51:08.390 - 00:52:00.706, Speaker B: I think also that because we're still very early in the cycle, there's this big benefit to zooming out, like you said, which is to compare it with tech, big tech, listed tech in the real world, where people are comfortable paying quite high multiples on a sector of a sector, an app of an app. I think once people across the world have said now crypto is a viable asset class, there is massive disruption happening here and massive waves of innovation. Then all of a sudden, everything looks cheap, actually, because where else can you get 10%, 15% dividend yields, cash flow yields on something that's growing at 50% a month or 30% a month? That's unheard of in the traditional space at this point.
00:52:00.706 - 00:52:40.778, Speaker B: But yet you see all sorts of examples of this in DFI and in crypto more broadly, to be honest. And I think that because we've had the derisking of crypto. Now we have the re rating, where now people say, given that this could one day be the workflow of these processes, these kinds of activities, then the price is you know, Paul tudor Jones said that if bitcoin is anywhere near Digital Gold, then the price is wrong because it can already be as much as gold.
00:52:40.778 - 00:53:13.786, Speaker B: And then probably be much higher because gold itself is so constrained. And now with D Five, people are saying, well, if this is the way people trade, if users are going to put their assets not in these brokerages that get their shares lent out, but instead in these AMM pools where they get paid to hold similar assets. Yeah, I've seen a lot of natives get shaken out this year, the past twelve months because of this fear of the next dump, right, the fear of the next cycle break.
00:53:13.786 - 00:53:47.934, Speaker B: And so I just sometimes need to remind myself and sort of the people that we invest with too, that this is the time to actually see it play through. And I think that if it plays through anywhere near the hype, then everything now is still very undervalued. But if it does play through much more than the hype, which historically, like you mentioned, with the internet just being absolutely pervasive, people first thought it was like a TMT concept.
00:53:47.934 - 00:53:57.954, Speaker B: Then they thought it was going to be like a consumer concept. And then people realized, wait a second, there's now mobile, there's now smartphones, and now everyone's like, there's no such thing as ecommerce. It's just commerce.
00:53:57.954 - 00:54:11.850, Speaker B: There's no such thing as there's no e needed anymore. It's just the thing itself. And for me, I try to challenge myself every day to think about what would it look like in that kind of scenario.
00:54:11.850 - 00:54:26.660, Speaker B: I think that the fundamental pull of investors coming in from the cash flow is inextricably tied to the fact that we are in the usage part of the cycle, we are in the building and using part.
00:54:27.190 - 00:54:39.240, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you're exactly right. We use the phrase we've gone from that concept to adoption cycle in crypto. And I think to your point.
00:54:41.610 - 00:54:41.878, Speaker A: If.
00:54:41.884 - 00:55:12.990, Speaker C: You take out the zero as a downside case, you get a very different return profile. There might be some freaks out there, but I don't think anyone really thinks this stuff is going away now and I don't think that wasn't the case back in kind of late 2018, 2019. And so it's no surprise to us that you've also seen a raft of investment on the periphery services to this space as that sort of zero use case went out and you could see like traditional firms starting to get their head around.
00:55:12.990 - 00:55:48.906, Speaker C: Well, I can now go through the compliance headache of launching a crypto trading desk because I know it's still going to be here in five years time. Whereas I think the mindset for those guys back in sort of late 2018 is why would I bother taking the political pain of pushing a crypto desk through compliance when that whole thing might fizzle out in a year's time? And I think we've taken that case off the table. And I think the thing that gets me most excited and it's something we've been speaking about for years with our investors and it's so nice to actually have the results to show them now, is that the users will come and start to use this technology.
00:55:48.906 - 00:56:11.090, Speaker C: So all those concepts that everyone was talking about in 2017, a lot of them didn't play out and that's the same in any tech market. But jeez, a lot of them really are playing out and we are starting to see just such staggering levels of growth. I mean, that's probably something the gain that crypto people underestimate underrate, because we're just so close to it and we just sort of live it as a sort of native asset class.
00:56:11.090 - 00:56:29.382, Speaker C: But you just don't see growth like this really in any other market, like 300%, 400% month on month growth in users at scale. I mean, it's just staggering amounts of growth in a world where growth is really hard to find across any asset. And I think that's why we formed that view.
00:56:29.382 - 00:56:51.214, Speaker C: And we remain with conviction that this is the cheapest deck in the world. And as it becomes more accessible to traditional investors, as you start to see more cash flow driven type returns and more metrics that they can use and put into their traditional models, it just becomes obvious to them how cheap it is. And we'll see that re rating that we've started to see already for some.
00:56:51.252 - 00:57:17.314, Speaker A: Of the benefits of DeFi that we discussed. It arguably needs to be able to reach a bigger audience, whereas in practice we are already running against the walls of ethereum. So how do you think about the execution risk to get to the necessary scale on the layer ones to support this kind of DeFi growth? Because you do underwrite that risk, right, when you invest in DeFi.
00:57:17.442 - 00:57:56.642, Speaker C: Yeah, I think again, stepping back to another internet analogy, I think we're kind of coming out of that sort of dial up phase into that sort of broadband phase, right? So if I think back to the sort of again, showing my age here, if I think back to the early ninety s and the mid 90s when there was internet cafes and people would go down to a cafe to log on through a dial up service to look at this thing called the Internet. They did that not because it was adding any efficiency or adding any value. They did that because they wanted to sort of check out a new technology, be part of it and see what it did.
00:57:56.642 - 00:58:18.986, Speaker C: Basically, back at that stage, everything you could do on the Internet was less efficient than you could do it in the real world or using traditional channels. But people like it was much easier to read a paper than it was to sit there for half an hour and download some form of page that would give you the news. But people did it because they kind of had conviction about a technology or they were involved in it and they wanted to push it forward.
00:58:18.986 - 00:58:42.562, Speaker C: I think in Crypto, we're at a similar stage where we're coming out of that where particularly the early days of DeFi and we're getting further down there now, particularly the early days you really needed to be dedicated to. It. To do it, you needed to have a passion for it or have some outside interest as opposed to just using the service for what it was, to actually persist with it and use it.
00:58:42.562 - 00:59:50.934, Speaker C: And I think what we're starting to see in DeFi, and this is really encouraging a lot of the user interfaces and a lot of the technology is leaping forward at a pretty rapid rate. And I think where we get excited and when we're investing now, we think about what is that next leg? How will the technology simplify itself and improve the user experience to make it accessible to that less passionate user? I guess the person that just wants to use it for what it is as opposed to wants to be part of using some form of blockchain technology, right? And I think when we look across our portfolio as well, there's some of the investments we've made at some of the people that are looking to add efficiency through that sort of stack to make it easier for the new users to make it easier for the developers to get to market faster and focus on what they're good at, which is building user interfaces and coming up with new ways to innovate and disrupt. And so we're starting to see a surge of activity sort of below that sort of user level, which I think you'll start to see at a user level as developers get to focus more on the stuff they should.
00:59:50.934 - 01:00:42.166, Speaker C: Be focusing on with their users and making it easier for them as they sort of can, I guess, right, with almost outsource or just plug into services that traditionally they've had to build themselves and waste capital on or waste time on building. I mean, the graph is a good example of that, right? Like you've basically got an incredible middleware layer of the whole of the defly ecosystem that any new app builder can plug straight into and save themselves an incredible amount of time, get a more efficient service, and can save their capital for where it matters, which is on their user interface and on their product development as opposed to on that sort of infrastructure layer, which isn't really going to add any real differentiation to them when they come into the marketplace. So things like that, we get pretty excited about investing alongside with DeFi.
01:00:42.358 - 01:00:57.210, Speaker A: Nassim Taleb said. The other day that unlike crypto, he said crypto can't be compared to the Internet because the Internet was useful from day one. Do you think he romanticizes, basically, the history of the Internet?
01:00:57.370 - 01:01:08.370, Speaker C: Yeah, I think he's very much romanticized. As someone who was using the Internet, and I wasn't even using it super early, it wasn't that usable at all. It was slow, it was frustrating.
01:01:08.370 - 01:01:16.840, Speaker C: Dial up modems were extremely unreliable. They went offline all the time. They froze all the time.
01:01:16.840 - 01:01:45.634, Speaker C: To even have the most simple of information presented to you took an ordinary amount of time. And as I said earlier, if you didn't have some external desire to push forward with it, it wasn't just the user experience that you were doing it for. In those early days of using the Internet, there was no way that it was easier to read something online than it would have been to find it in a traditional source.
01:01:45.634 - 01:01:55.326, Speaker C: I mean, you could see the promise of it and it was kind of obvious to a lot of people at the mean. You could see it could get there, but it was no way it was usable from day one.
01:01:55.428 - 01:02:03.246, Speaker A: Richard, thank you so much for taking the time today. Coming on the show, we are both huge fans of you, so it was a pleasure talking to you.
01:02:03.428 - 01:02:13.606, Speaker C: Thanks for having me, guys. Keep up the good work. Your podcast is by far the best in the industry, so it's a pleasure to be involved and I look forward to all the future episodes as well.
01:02:13.788 - 01:02:15.334, Speaker B: All right, thanks for coming on.
01:02:15.452 - 01:02:16.340, Speaker C: Cheers. Thanks, guys.
