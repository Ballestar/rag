00:00:02.810 - 00:00:21.614, Speaker A: Hey guys. So we have an episode today that's a little bit out of the usual because we were actually meeting someone to record an episode today on options trading. And this episode will be recorded later this week when we have our audio problems fixed up.
00:00:21.614 - 00:00:47.994, Speaker A: But since sue and I were already here, we thought, why not use the time to record something that's very spontaneous for you guys and something that we actually never have done before. And the quickest idea that came to our mind was just to look at the top 20 coins on coin gecko and well, just kind of freestyle about them, just kind of talk about what comes to mind. Yeah.
00:00:47.994 - 00:00:49.260, Speaker A: Should we start off?
00:00:49.710 - 00:00:51.100, Speaker B: No, let's do it.
00:00:51.490 - 00:00:56.478, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So I have my coin gecko open.
00:00:56.478 - 00:01:14.430, Speaker A: I think this could maybe be interesting for some of our less experienced listeners who are not as familiar. Like with all of the coins that exist in kind of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Top 20 is actually CDI compound die.
00:01:14.430 - 00:01:27.480, Speaker A: So I think this is actually a pretty interesting one because it highlights a pretty interesting property of DeFi. Can you maybe explain what CDI even is?
00:01:27.950 - 00:01:55.630, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So DeFi being decentralized finance, CDI is kind of a building block of so it's basically there's a stable coin called Dai which exists when people collateralize their assets in the maker protocol and then borrow the stablecoin from that. And that stablecoin's name is Dai.
00:01:55.630 - 00:02:10.914, Speaker B: So they usually use Ether or WBDC or USDC to collateralize. And then when they have that Dai, they can then do various things with it. Right? They can trade it for Ether, they can trade it for other coins.
00:02:10.914 - 00:02:32.206, Speaker B: They can also deposit it in various DeFi protocols to earn a yield. So CDI happens to be when people deposit Dai into compound, which is one of the two or three biggest borrow and lending platforms, then this will generate CDI. So as you can see, the market cap of CDI is like 1.5
00:02:32.206 - 00:03:25.866, Speaker B: billion. One of the reasons it's so high is that because the compound platform has a coin distribution of its native token comp based on how much you're supplying and borrowing from compound, people are basically farming comp by depositing and borrowing Dai. And because the governance of compound has been such that it's incentivized people to use Dai as the double sided asset, because the comp is paid out to people when they are borrowing and depositing as much as possible, dai becomes the best asset to use because its yield settings are the tightest.
00:03:25.866 - 00:03:49.560, Speaker B: So you don't lose as much by borrowing it and then depositing it, borrowing it and then depositing it again. So that's why you end up with a lot of CDI as market cap. And as we saw a few days ago, some of these double sided Dai farmers actually got stopped out on compound because the Oracle price shot up way past 1.2.
00:03:49.560 - 00:04:01.480, Speaker B: So in other words, the Dai stablecoin actually traded very high relative to one dollars. And these farmers, these yield farmers were a little bit caught off guard by that.
00:04:02.010 - 00:04:15.646, Speaker A: I had never looked at the market cap before and when we just looked at it, I was like, why could it be like 1.5 billion when the market cap of Dai is actually only 1 billion? So yeah, it's kind of leveraged in that sense.
00:04:15.748 - 00:04:17.482, Speaker B: Yes, precisely.
00:04:17.626 - 00:04:30.686, Speaker A: If liquidations happen on compound, then this kind of Dai would it's kind of almost the synthetic in that sense. It would disappear from circulation again. So do you think maybe one last question for CDI.
00:04:30.686 - 00:04:37.090, Speaker A: Do you think that a coin like CDAI could become something that people use as money instead of Dai?
00:04:37.530 - 00:05:18.660, Speaker B: That's what people are kind of wondering right now, because this coin kind of pays interest in real time, like you're earning interest on it in real time. But there are some problems with that too, because the UX or the user experience of a coin that's constantly accruing value isn't that great for conversion factors, things like that. I tend to think it's going to be more likely that people will just deposit onto aggregators such as WiFi, like the Y curve and then that will re aggregate into compound and then that asset could end up being used.
00:05:18.660 - 00:05:47.514, Speaker B: But I don't think that the tokenized balance of a specific borrow lend protocol is likely to get that network effect where people use it as money just because it always will beg the question, why don't you deposit it on Aave instead, or on dYdX instead? You're just not going to be able to guarantee that you have that best rate. And so as a result, the money is going to keep moving back. And so it's a tricky one though.
00:05:47.514 - 00:05:50.300, Speaker B: A lot of people have different theories on it.
00:05:54.450 - 00:06:08.126, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. So moving on to Tezos, I think Tezos is a pretty interesting coin, western fundamentals. It's the first kind of chain.
00:06:08.126 - 00:06:20.838, Speaker A: They call it like chain based proof of stake. So it actually has a kind of sort of like longest chain rule similar to Bitcoin. And that's how that consensus mechanism works.
00:06:20.838 - 00:06:53.700, Speaker A: It's pretty different from the BFT based style proof of stake that everyone else goes for. They were also the first ones to kind of complete the decentralized on chain governance, right, where you kind of have, where you deploy kind of a new set of code and then people vote on that code and if the vote succeeds, then the code is activated. Right.
00:06:53.700 - 00:07:22.826, Speaker A: We just talked about CDI and compound kind of took that concept from Tezos of on chain governance and they imported it into DeFi, if you will. Right. And now the kind of compound governance module has emerged as the de facto, I don't know if we can say like the gold standard in DeFi, but it's being copied by a lot of other protocols and I actually like it a lot.
00:07:22.826 - 00:07:41.262, Speaker A: That would be in contrast to something like WiFi, where you have a kind of informal governance, where you have maybe people voting via snapshot, for example, on what feature they'd like to see and then the governance or like the developers look at what people voted on, they implemented maybe a few weeks or months later.
00:07:41.316 - 00:08:34.350, Speaker B: Right, yeah, I think also Tezo is being interesting in that it's kind of the first proof of stake, but also kind of first attempt to experiment more with on chain governance. And I think as a result, because it was in the backdrop of bitcoin scaling debate and so on, I think it got a lot of interest from bitcoiners at that time as well. Not just ethereum people who were kind of really interested in the idea of would this ultimately be a governance model that larger coins would use as well, if it worked? So I think now it's not as popular to talk about on chain governance for Bitcoin or Ethereum, but I think back then there was more interest in that as a test case for those coins.
00:08:35.490 - 00:08:57.490, Speaker A: Tesla also took a different kind of approach than all the Ethereum, quote unquote, Ethereum killers that you see today who are all EVM compatible. And I'm pretty sure Tezos is not, right? They have their own virtual machine. What do you think for their chances of kind of getting developer traction?
00:08:57.650 - 00:09:11.030, Speaker B: I think that's been their challenge. Right. Because it's OCaml based, which is a functional programming language, it's a little bit difficult to get people onboarded into the framework and to sort of benefit from developer tooling.
00:09:11.030 - 00:09:37.654, Speaker B: That's been kind of the big strength that Ethereum has had. Right, which is that it's relatively easy for anyone to just come in and do something within a couple of weeks and find people who can support them as well. So I think that I think some of these projects that were in the 2015 to 2017 phase of development, they weren't exactly sure what their product market fit was going to be.
00:09:37.654 - 00:10:03.734, Speaker B: They were just wanting to put these ideas into action and put it on mainnet, which Tezos has mean it's already impressive that they've done that at that time and that they have this community that they do now. But yeah, it's definitely a struggle to find the application fit and to find the use case. Know, given the advantages that Ethereum has and some of the other newer coins.
00:10:03.782 - 00:10:37.640, Speaker A: Have, what do you think is the what will happen to chains like Tezos who are kind of intellectually very interesting but kind of struggling to get traction? Do you think we can have another bull run like we had in 2017 where projects like or base layer projects blow up purely on the possibility that they could get some kind of developer traction years later? Or do you think that this run people will expect some kind of adoption already?
00:10:38.410 - 00:11:06.690, Speaker B: Tasers is an interesting one because it probably has more money ness about it than most other proof of stake coins. I mean, for one, from the private sale or from the crowd sale, people contributed BTC and ETH into it and then since then they've kind of safeguarded their treasury relatively robustly in terms of investing. So kind of has that treasury value that people do talk about when it comes to Tezos.
00:11:06.690 - 00:11:43.018, Speaker B: And then for two, they do have very smart people who are committed to it and kind of working on it every day. So I think that it has a better chance of keeping up with the market than most coins do. But at the same time, the application side is likely not going to be what pushes it through because ultimately, because it doesn't have the grassroots participation of smart contract developers, it's very difficult for them to really get that adoption.
00:11:43.018 - 00:12:13.814, Speaker B: And so you just have to hope that it's the Staking game, right? Where Tesos went up a lot a few months ago or around a year ago, plus where people said Coinbase has to buy it because as more people buy Tesos and stake, the exchanges have to also buy it to be able to stake on behalf of their clients because of the way that they call it baking in Tesos. But the way that baking works. So stuff like that, it could happen again because it has moneyness to it.
00:12:13.814 - 00:12:23.740, Speaker B: Its price history is long. So yeah, I definitely wouldn't rule it out as a coin, but if you're buying it based on an adoption thesis, it's definitely a tougher play.
00:12:26.990 - 00:12:33.420, Speaker A: Speaking of adoption, coin number 18, NEM. Okay, I have actually no idea what this is.
00:12:34.190 - 00:12:47.060, Speaker B: Yeah, NEM is a tricky one. I'm going to pull up the Coin gecko. I know it's very popular in Japan in that during the Coin check, this is the hacked coin from Coin Check at that time.
00:12:47.060 - 00:12:56.626, Speaker B: This is also a top ten coin at one point, I remember. So it's a very 2017 coin, I'll put it that way. I haven't seen much adoption.
00:12:56.626 - 00:13:00.882, Speaker B: I haven't seen much that they're doing at this stage.
00:13:01.026 - 00:13:13.930, Speaker A: It sounds like an Asian ripple, like just from reading the kind of description here. Right. It's supposed to be used for payment and settlement and clearing in a kind of interbank environment.
00:13:14.270 - 00:13:21.680, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll leave it there. It's definitely not something you hear about a lot these days, for sure.
00:13:22.210 - 00:13:35.314, Speaker A: Probably likely to fall out from the top 20. If not this year, then next year. I think there are now some very interesting coins that are not actually quite far away from the top 20.
00:13:35.314 - 00:13:48.594, Speaker A: Right. All the kind of application layer on top of Ethereum, especially all the DFI applications. I think we'll see many of those break into the top 20 at the expense of those kind of debt.
00:13:48.594 - 00:14:02.742, Speaker A: Ghost layer one chain. That would be my thesis for 2021. What about Tron, though? I'm not sure that I would call it a ghost chain.
00:14:02.742 - 00:14:15.310, Speaker A: I've actually definitely not a ghost chain. Yeah, exactly. I've used it for the first time this year when there was this kind of just dabbled around a little bit with the sun mining, liquidity mining.
00:14:15.310 - 00:14:22.782, Speaker A: You can say it's a rip off of ethereum. It's a fork of ethereum. And that's true.
00:14:22.782 - 00:14:30.862, Speaker A: But I thought that they are very smart about it in a way. Right. So they basically have their own exact copy of MetaMask.
00:14:30.862 - 00:14:43.574, Speaker A: And just the way that you use it feels extremely familiar and fast and it's just super easy to use, which you can't say about any of the other coins on here.
00:14:43.692 - 00:14:54.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I think just the fact that there's so much USDT on Tron is kind of interesting as well. Right. Because a lot of that are probably just Tron whales as well.
00:14:54.794 - 00:15:21.902, Speaker B: But also some of it is the fact that when the fees get really high on the ethereum blockchain, a lot of ODC will use Tron USDT instead. A lot of exchanges will even try to push you to deposit and withdraw in Tron USDT. So I think for some reason or another, tron has managed to kind of get that kind of cheaper ethereum use case somewhat.
00:15:21.902 - 00:15:42.214, Speaker B: And I think you saw that with some of the gambling D apps too, right? That did okay. During the bear market in 2018, 2019, where people were using these to play a bunch of it was kind of like precursor to DFI type stuff, right? Where you would have a governance staking token. Not really governance, mainly a staking token with revenues.
00:15:42.214 - 00:15:55.198, Speaker B: And then there would be people playing these dice games or these betting games. And that was actually all happening on Tron and EOS at that time. So it's unclear how much of it was real or not real, but they definitely do have a community in China, in the US.
00:15:55.198 - 00:16:15.620, Speaker B: And a lot of these countries. I think that where they may struggle is as newer blockchains come out and do offer more technological innovation, it's going to be more difficult to get mind share, especially as people have now realized that they really are just copying everything. Right.
00:16:15.620 - 00:16:35.958, Speaker B: There really is no sort of novel thinking behind what they're trying to think. BitTorrent excited some people, but then people realized that it really wasn't going to help Tron that much. I think it's already surprised everyone by just not disappearing.
00:16:35.958 - 00:16:38.860, Speaker B: So credit to them on that.
00:16:39.870 - 00:17:06.660, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the best case thesis at this point is that it becomes something like litecoin, something that's used by some, has nothing innovative about it at all, but that just kind of sticks around just based on its kind. Of network and lindy effect and is seen as something where maybe people don't like it, but they kind of grudgingly tolerate it being there.
00:17:07.290 - 00:17:08.040, Speaker B: Sure.
00:17:10.970 - 00:17:34.990, Speaker A: So repbtc. I mean, this is kind of like Bitcoin, but I'd be happy to talk about kind of the intricacies of WBTC and actually how it works because many people don't actually repbtc the sole custodian is Bitgor right? Do you know where they're located? Like jurisdictionally?
00:17:35.330 - 00:17:54.434, Speaker B: I actually don't know jurisdiction. It could actually be anything because I haven't myself read the legal docs for it. But yeah, my firm Three Arrows is one of the bigger minters of WBTC and I think one of the reasons why, as you see, the market cap 2.3
00:17:54.434 - 00:18:19.366, Speaker B: billion, not nothing to scoff at, mainly because of the primacy that it's managed to achieve in key DeFi apps. So maker being one, you can draw Dai, you can borrow Dai against WBDC and also Compound and Aave, you can do the same. And then obviously with Uniswap as well, where it was one of the four incentivized pools.
00:18:19.366 - 00:18:50.710, Speaker B: So I think all of these things kind of got together and I kind of always believe this about BDC on Ethereum, which is that you're going to need a network effect for it to really take off and it's likely going to go toward a single one just because it's easier. So I think you've seen WBDC and Renbdc do pretty well and then like everything else kind of just no one knows how exactly they're supposed to try to use. Definitely, definitely a custodial coin.
00:18:50.710 - 00:19:34.100, Speaker B: You're kind of depending on BitCo to have those BTC and they do approve of reserves by a chain link, I think, but it's not as bad as people think because USDT, USDC themselves are also custodial and we don't care anymore about those either. So ultimately it kind of shows the power of DeFi in a way. It shows that it's so useful to transact on chain with BTC like this that people are willing to take that risk, the market is willing to take that risk and so eventually when they have more decentralized versions of it, then that'll be just even better, I guess.
00:19:35.030 - 00:20:08.062, Speaker A: I was going to ask you that mean WBTC is kind of racing ahead. It was way easier to construct and to launch early on when DeFi was still very immature and solutions like TBTC, which is already decentralized, but it's kind of more expensive to use and it's still very immature in terms of network effect, in terms of like ranbtc which is currently completely centralized. But I think their goal is to also add these kind of security bonds that TBTC has.
00:20:08.062 - 00:20:20.180, Speaker A: So do you think that one of those costlier more decentralized solutions can eventually overtake WBTC? Or will it just kind of run away with its current Head Start network effect?
00:20:21.030 - 00:20:50.350, Speaker B: I think it'll run away because liquidity is the most important part of the user experience. You want to be able to get in and out of it quickly, you want to be able to create and redeem it sometimes if you want to put in 1000 BDC into DeFi with the other approaches, it's really difficult to do that, but with wrap BDC or Renbdc, you can do it pretty fast. So I actually think it's more likely that WBDC and Renbdc ultimately find ways to decentralize than that.
00:20:50.350 - 00:21:19.750, Speaker B: The current decentralized coins find mass adoption interesting. Okay, I don't know if it's likely, but I see a higher chance of that happening than a decentralized bitcoin launching now and rapidly gaining market share to the detriment of WBDC and renBTC. I think that's very unlikely.
00:21:21.050 - 00:21:31.526, Speaker A: Kind of goes into the whole debate of how is regulation going to play out. So far it seems that regulation on bitcoin has actually been pretty dovish, right?
00:21:31.708 - 00:21:32.198, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:21:32.284 - 00:21:37.526, Speaker A: Like regulators kind of like no one is actually thinking about banning bitcoin anymore.
00:21:37.558 - 00:21:37.754, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:37.792 - 00:21:41.086, Speaker A: That was kind of topic four to five years ago, but nowadays and they.
00:21:41.108 - 00:21:56.740, Speaker B: May think it's the devil they know, right? If they go and ban WBTC, maybe it pushes the market toward a direction they can't even fathom. So that also must weigh in for regulators when it comes to this kind of stuff.
00:21:58.870 - 00:22:05.778, Speaker A: I agree. Actually brings us to the next coin on the list, which is Monero. Right, monero.
00:22:05.778 - 00:22:30.570, Speaker A: The coin that's getting a lot more attention from financial regulators than Bitcoin. So monero is the coin that hides the transaction, sender the recipient and the amount, and it's privacy by default. So you can't opt out of using monero in a private way because of the ring signatures.
00:22:30.570 - 00:22:53.380, Speaker A: It's a coin that I actually like a lot. But at the same time, I must say I was very surprised about how well it performed this year because I thought there was a lot of the thesis that you need a privacy coin rather than a privacy solution on top of an existing coin was kind of falling out of favor.
00:22:55.450 - 00:23:08.860, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think privacy coins were incredibly popular in 2017 just because they kind of seemed like they would be an investment class unto themselves. Right.
00:23:08.860 - 00:23:32.794, Speaker B: And then I think 2018 just bad for all non BDC coins. Quite bad. And I think 2019, because these coins are proof of work, it's very tough for them to go up because there's just this nonstop, so it's hard for people to just imagine them going up when they're not in a bullish accumulation.
00:23:32.794 - 00:23:47.602, Speaker B: So I think monero clearly has gotten some traction in its original use case, which is being private money in the past few months. And kind of the beauty of Monero too, is that you don't even know why it's going up. Someone somewhere likes it now.
00:23:47.602 - 00:24:08.060, Speaker B: So that's pretty cool, I think. And one of the bearish cases for privacy coins that people were making was that these coins, because they would have a hard time getting listed on a coinbase or these kind of regulated on ramps, that it wouldn't have the money effect. And that's not wrong.
00:24:08.060 - 00:24:34.546, Speaker B: But I do think that to say that privacy is not a use case because you can just add some privacy onto ethereum or onto some of the other coins. I'd like to see it happen first because I don't know if that will happen even for one and for two is I don't think it's something that is preordained. Right.
00:24:34.546 - 00:24:53.446, Speaker B: It could be that the monero approach where you just create minimal viable privacy, does have a lot of value because there's the idea that that privacy will be protected right. Because the network exists to defend that privacy. Whereas even that's added as a feature on ethereum.
00:24:53.446 - 00:25:15.860, Speaker B: It can be taken out as a feature too. It can be de anonymized one day by a new hard fork. There's no stability on which that privacy sits in my think, you know, if you're someone that really does value privacy and you want that, it's pretty much only monero at this point in terms of that kind of raw privacy set.
00:25:18.630 - 00:25:30.546, Speaker A: Yeah, right. It goes into where privacy is actually part of the key social contract of a particular coin. And ultimately you don't just buy the financial asset, you buy into a social contract.
00:25:30.546 - 00:25:47.706, Speaker A: And the social contract is kind of important in the sense that the community is actually committed to defending these core values and making the uncomfortable decisions that kind of are necessary when push comes to shove. Kind of.
00:25:47.728 - 00:25:48.154, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:48.272 - 00:26:24.120, Speaker A: So what do you think about this is a very old question, I guess, but what do you think about the kind of mandatory privacy of monero versus the kind of opt in privacy of mean we are supposed to kind of talk about monero but I mean zcash is a coin that has performed like it's almost a meme at this point. How fully it has performed since it launched. So just doing I don't want to call it like a post mortem, but do you think that there was something wrong about their approach to privacy that kind of made it perform this way?
00:26:26.010 - 00:26:40.166, Speaker B: It's a good question. I think that there's two schools of thought on Zcash. I think there's one that would say that it's already a success because it's managed to deliver opt in privacy on a coin which no one else has.
00:26:40.166 - 00:27:02.370, Speaker B: And so it has the exchange listings, but it also has shielded accounts, albeit not that many people use them, but they could and you can now mine directly into a shielded account, a shielded address. It definitely works. So it's success in that it actually works.
00:27:02.370 - 00:27:17.254, Speaker B: It does what it says. I think the small privacy set or the fact that not that many people use the privacy yet is just the fact that so much of crypto is people buying in anticipation of other people using. Right.
00:27:17.254 - 00:27:41.870, Speaker B: So you got like Zcash Investment trust, you've got Zcash investors that are in highly regulated entities. So I think that during 2017 that was part of the Zcash thesis for people, which was that it was going to be a very good privacy coin, but in the meantime, you could invest in it. It wouldn't be like Monero, where it would be very difficult to invest in a regulated entity.
00:27:41.870 - 00:28:02.626, Speaker B: But I think one of the things that was challenging for them is that they had the founders reward right. Which was a pretty big percentage of the emissions. And I think that it put a bit of a tinge on some of their narrative and I think also just their emissions curve, which is modeled after Bitcoin.
00:28:02.626 - 00:28:12.922, Speaker B: Exactly. I think people are starting to realize now that if you have an emissions curve that's modeled after Bitcoin, you're going to have just incredible amounts of minor dumping. Right.
00:28:12.922 - 00:28:33.982, Speaker B: Because miners are just doing energy arbitrage all day and that process definitely takes a toll on holders. On the other hand, for people in the first camp who think that this is all going according to plan, they would say Zcash has one of the fairest distributions ever created in crypto. Because literally, the earlier you heard about it, the poorer you are.
00:28:33.982 - 00:28:48.054, Speaker B: Right, yeah. If you hear about it now, you're not disadvantaged for someone who heard about it four years ago. Where else can you say that? And the chain actually works, so I can kind of see some truth in that, too.
00:28:48.054 - 00:29:06.774, Speaker B: Right. Where anyone who owns Ecash now, you know that they paid a price for it that is not an unfair price versus what you have that you can pay for it. And the question is, will it go up at any point? But even the market cap now isn't that low, so it could be achieving a goal while the investors are not achieving a goal.
00:29:06.774 - 00:29:16.526, Speaker B: You see what I mean? And then maybe when the emissions are sufficiently low one day, then the investors will get their chance too. So that's kind of the way I view it.
00:29:16.708 - 00:29:30.530, Speaker A: Yeah. It's a coin that I don't know, I think it will stay around. It has a good future, but I'd probably rather buy it at like $100 than at $70.
00:29:30.600 - 00:29:31.026, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:31.128 - 00:29:40.054, Speaker A: Even though that may sound counterintuitive, but I just want to see some confirmation first. Yeah. So both Monero and Zcash, I think.
00:29:40.054 - 00:29:48.230, Speaker A: Very interesting coins. Monero in the top 20. So moving on to EOS.
00:29:48.230 - 00:29:58.742, Speaker A: EOS is kind of the original ethereum killer, right. When it launched in, what was it? 2018. Right, yeah.
00:29:58.796 - 00:30:15.282, Speaker B: Mint to in May 2018, they had been doing an ongoing crowd sale for months before. I think the coin started as an ERC 20 token that you could get by contributing ether. And I think at some point, 11% of all ether got contributed to it.
00:30:15.282 - 00:30:26.820, Speaker B: It's impossible to know how much. Something pretty high like that. Definitely very hyped at the time.
00:30:26.820 - 00:31:05.214, Speaker B: I think it kind of was the it was kind of the ultimate delegated proof of stake play, where people thought because Ethereum had scaling issues, you could do delegated proof of stake and you could kind of solve some of those scaling issues. You could have lower fees, you could have more throughput, and you could also have some element of governance through this delegation process or through this block producer. Basically, they're called block producers on EOS, and I think it definitely had a lot of adoption from developers.
00:31:05.214 - 00:31:34.890, Speaker B: They wanted to build stuff on it. I followed it relatively closely in 2018, but I think they had a lot of economic incentive issues with the way that resources were allocated across whether you're a user, an application, or a block producer, I think that allocation of resources is very tricky to handle. And I think without getting into too many details, I think EOS struggled with that.
00:31:34.890 - 00:31:56.862, Speaker B: I think it struggled to figure out how that would ultimately work. And I think because of that rising complexity too, it kind of got to the point where there were attack vectors that people didn't foresee in the beginning. So there was a lot of things where they weren't sure what was solid ground and what was not for the protocol.
00:31:56.862 - 00:32:07.910, Speaker B: So I think that's been one of the reasons why it's $3 now. It was hit over $20 in May 2018. It's still got a strong community.
00:32:07.910 - 00:32:25.846, Speaker B: The existing block producers now are a lot of them are the big exchanges. So that also has raised some eyebrows in terms of just how that works exactly. In terms of the decentralization, it's still a $2.8
00:32:25.846 - 00:32:40.110, Speaker B: billion coin. It's still got a pretty wide distribution, and they're definitely still working hard on it. But it's something that has generally not delivered as much as people hoped in 2018.
00:32:41.730 - 00:32:56.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's interesting how that goes with the exchanges becoming the large block producers, in my opinion. Do you think that's an issue that's kind of localized to EOS or not at all? I think that's a risk for all POS coins.
00:32:57.042 - 00:33:30.714, Speaker B: It's a risk for all POS coins, right? I mean, with ETH Two, you see that finance coinbase, Kraken, these all have E Two staking. A lot of these validators may end up getting run in exchanges because they are the ones that will provide liquidity from your ETH Two to ETH One, right? So if you stake on an exchange, you can get that money out for real ETH very quickly, whereas if you stake it on your own, you can't. So you end up possibly with concentration from that aspect.
00:33:30.714 - 00:33:46.120, Speaker B: And so I think definitely all exchanges will have I mean, all proof of stake coins will have to figure out how do you mitigate against that? How do you encourage people to stake on their mean? EOS kind of showed the dangers of that.
00:33:46.970 - 00:34:12.170, Speaker A: I think it's also interesting in the sense that it was the largest ICO ever, right? I mean, they had an obscenely large kind of treasury. I actually thought they would be able to do more with that just because the raw force that you can generate. With that kind of money, you could pay every developer on Ethereum one hundred k a year in salary.
00:34:12.170 - 00:34:15.280, Speaker A: In theory, you would have enough money for that.
00:34:17.090 - 00:34:38.082, Speaker B: And I believe their treasury is mainly BTC. So I think they have over 140,000 BTC, which is I think the largest foundation, the largest ICO foundation in terms of Bitcoin notional, and they also have a lot of dollars as well, and some other coins. So definitely a very formidable player in the space.
00:34:38.082 - 00:35:03.440, Speaker B: It could be that they're biting their time and trying to figure out where can we really achieve product market fit. I think they definitely wouldn't count them out in terms of be able to deliver something, but it could be that they want to see better what use cases are actually that they can actually go after with their community and with what they've done. And they're kind of buying their time till then.
00:35:05.170 - 00:35:26.014, Speaker A: So, rank number 13 USD. Coin USDC. I think maybe the interesting angle to explore here is the kind of regulated stablecoin or more strongly regulated stablecoin versus Tether, which is more lightly regulated.
00:35:26.014 - 00:35:58.382, Speaker A: It's still regulated, still compliant with US. Regulation. But the main difference, I'd say Tether doesn't offer the kind of proofs of reserves that USDC does and it doesn't have the same kind of exchange support, or it does have a lot of exchange support, right? It's kind of the trading pair on Binance mostly, but it's not actually supported by a lot of other exchanges like Coinbase and all the US.
00:35:58.382 - 00:36:02.890, Speaker A: Ones. So what do you think about the kind of head to head race between Tether and USDC?
00:36:03.050 - 00:36:40.570, Speaker B: Definitely been a big rise in USDC, and I think they have run away with it in some sense among the US based stablecoins. So I remember when they first came out, people were saying, is it going to be PAX? Is it going to be USDC, is it going to be GUSD? And we've now seen PAX go toward a white label model mainly, where when you use BUSD, which is binance USD, or when you use USD, which is hobby USD, those are actually PAX white labels. They run on the PAX infrastructure.
00:36:40.570 - 00:37:16.226, Speaker B: And basically the brand is the exchange that is using those rails. So I think USDC, because of the strength of their brand, the Circle brand, and then because of their tie in with Coinbase having being one of the easiest ways to mint USDC, I think that's been the main source of their strength, actually. And I think DeFi has really helped USDC, right? Because in Curve you have these pools where you have USDC, dai USDT.
00:37:16.226 - 00:37:35.738, Speaker B: And so people have to mint more USDC to participate in DeFi. It's a key on ramp into DeFi and then on top of that, Dai maker because they wanted to create a lot of help the peg get closer to one and be more liquid. Now, you can mint Dai through USDC on very high leverage.
00:37:35.738 - 00:38:03.990, Speaker B: So that creates another use case for USDC. So I would say USDC has been a huge beneficiary of DeFi. It's also increasingly commonly used in OTC trading now, where rather than sending bank cash, we send USDC because it's instantly convertible to bank cash at Silvergate Bank with no you know, sometimes it's just easier to pay via stablecoin than to pay via a bank transfer because it's faster.
00:38:03.990 - 00:38:24.606, Speaker B: So USDC kind of becomes like the proxy bank transfer, if you will, because of the ease of creating and redeeming it. Whereas for tether, because there's slightly more fees, when you want to create redeem it to dollars in a bank account, it's not able to serve that function. So I think that kind of creates it.
00:38:24.606 - 00:38:34.942, Speaker B: But I also think it's symbiotic as well. I think USDT has also benefited a lot from DeFi. It's also benefited a lot from OTC as well.
00:38:34.942 - 00:38:54.920, Speaker B: So it's very much not either or at this point. I think a bit more of like tether is more like euro dollars, where it's more offshore dollars. It's still regulated and still very legitimate, but just slightly different clientele, and then USDC being more focused toward a separate clientele as well.
00:38:55.290 - 00:39:13.398, Speaker A: Do you think USDC coin like, do you see any chance that USD coin could become the official central bank digital currency of the US. Because we do see it used now to export US. Dollars, right?
00:39:13.504 - 00:39:21.374, Speaker B: Yeah, that was really interesting to see. That was really interesting to see. I think there's definitely a non zero chance because it already works.
00:39:21.374 - 00:39:34.146, Speaker B: It has a network effect. So if you're a CBDC issuer, you could just do that. But I guess I don't really know how regulators think.
00:39:34.146 - 00:39:52.182, Speaker B: I don't really know how government bureaus think about this. Do they want to create their own from scratch to seem very smart, or do they want to do public private partnership? If it's the latter, then they'll definitely partner with USDC. They'll definitely partner.
00:39:52.182 - 00:40:24.740, Speaker B: And I think this could lead to some interesting use cases for some of the non ETH chains as well. Because if you want to give a UBI to everyone, you're definitely not going to congest the ethereum chain and give out 300 million transfers. So I think there could be some blue sky use cases for slightly more centralized blockchains that are kind of nonetheless, the government thinks they work.
00:40:24.740 - 00:40:36.950, Speaker B: That will be my guess, what a CBDC will ultimately look like. I don't think it'll run on bitcoin or ethereum type chains just because it's fundamentally too expensive.
00:40:39.950 - 00:40:41.242, Speaker A: Then there's no need, right?
00:40:41.296 - 00:40:46.220, Speaker B: There's no need. You're paying for the censorship resistance that you don't need. Right, exactly.
00:40:48.430 - 00:40:55.520, Speaker A: Actually now, very fun coin to talk about. Bitcoin, SV. This is ranked twelve.
00:40:55.520 - 00:40:59.258, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's still alive.
00:40:59.354 - 00:41:09.186, Speaker B: Still alive. It forked off BCH in late 2018. Yeah.
00:41:09.186 - 00:41:30.220, Speaker B: And it actually flipped in BCH for a couple of moments. And I think you're probably more familiar with the technical debates that they had. But I recall it, there were two key differences, but mainly that they wanted a much bigger block size, whereas BCH wanted an adaptive block size.
00:41:30.220 - 00:41:41.306, Speaker B: And then two being that the people behind it kind of always wanted their own coin all along. So this kind of gave them the reason to do it. Not sure that's in line with what.
00:41:41.328 - 00:41:50.218, Speaker A: You know about mean, they're obviously ever increasing kind of the block size and making it I mean, for no reasons.
00:41:50.314 - 00:42:07.046, Speaker B: Really, because no one uses it. And they're pushing through a lot of transactions and then saying that these transactions show that this is the real bitcoin because it's got this massive throughput. But these transactions are they don't need to be on a blockchain and they also are not economically meaningful at all.
00:42:07.046 - 00:42:40.794, Speaker B: So it's kind of interesting to me though that they've actually pivoted toward a lot of what I consider actually like ethereum based arguments for utility of blockchain. If you follow the rhetoric that BSV has gone toward now it's much more about like well, we're going to also do put everything on the chain, we're also going to do non financial applications. It actually reminds me a lot of early 2017 ethereum rhetoric, the kind of stuff that they think is going to accrue value to BSV.
00:42:40.794 - 00:43:29.454, Speaker B: But no one can explain how those things are ultimately useful and no one can explain if those are their goals, why are they doing this on a proof of work? Fork of a fork, right? It's not clear why they're doing that. My view on it is that it's something that like you said, it has an end game which is ultimately very different than what they say it is. That could be something which is very like I don't think people should go around shorting it because it's something that they don't think is a good idea because you don't know what the end game is.
00:43:29.454 - 00:44:00.318, Speaker B: And the thing to keep in mind too is that when BCH forked from BDC in August 2017, even up to now, tons of BCH has never been claimed, right? Because people don't bother claiming it because such a small percentage of the BDC value, people don't bother to wake up their cold storage to claim and sell it. And then you have BSV on top of BCH. So the actual circulating supply of BSV is far less, is far less than what people think, right? I don't know exactly what it is, but it could be 3 million coins, 4 million coins, 2 million coins.
00:44:00.318 - 00:44:13.238, Speaker B: I don't know what it is. So what that actually means is that the market cap is very overstated, basically because a lot of that supply is not even activating. They may not activate because of tax reasons too.
00:44:13.238 - 00:44:26.020, Speaker B: They may not activate because of they don't want to DOX their account, right? Because if they send that fork into finance, they've now doxed let's say maybe a very large 2015 2014 Bitcoin accumulation. Right?
00:44:26.710 - 00:44:30.770, Speaker A: Yeah. It also puts a kind of cap on where it could go.
00:44:30.840 - 00:44:31.074, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:31.112 - 00:44:33.618, Speaker A: So let's say Bitcoin SV goes like.
00:44:33.704 - 00:44:39.650, Speaker B: If it goes to $5,000 yeah, if it goes to $5,000, people are going to pay tax and claim their BSV.
00:44:39.810 - 00:45:02.810, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of selling pressure on a coin like this that applies to PCH too, but to a lesser degree and much more to BSV, for sure, where once it rises too much, then a lot of dormant supply will activate and crush it back down. And I wanted to go back to what you just said about like, you wouldn't short it.
00:45:02.810 - 00:45:22.980, Speaker A: So I strongly agree. The way I think about shorting in general with these coins is you don't want to short something where like 95% of people think it's a terrible idea and 5% of people think it's a great idea if you short a coin, you want to short a coin where almost everyone is kind of indifferent about it. Right.
00:45:22.980 - 00:45:48.538, Speaker A: Not ones that have this kind of rabid supporters. Regarding the end game for BSV, I think that I saw a proposal quite recently, actually, where I don't think you can actually run a node anymore for BSV unless you have an industrial scale setup. But they are also now getting rid of the peer to peer network in general.
00:45:48.538 - 00:45:59.706, Speaker A: Right. So they don't actually broadcast the blocks anymore. So I saw the most recent proposal was that just wallets just connect directly to a mining node.
00:45:59.706 - 00:46:24.040, Speaker A: And I mean, at that point, you can definitely get rid of the proof of work as well. You are fully at the server client model at this point that all the rest of the Internet is already built on. So Bitcoin SV has lost everything that made it different from the existing Internet infrastructure at this point.
00:46:26.490 - 00:46:29.580, Speaker B: All right. Stellar yeah.
00:46:30.270 - 00:46:32.890, Speaker A: Is a fork of Ripple, right?
00:46:32.960 - 00:46:33.242, Speaker B: Yes.
00:46:33.296 - 00:46:35.114, Speaker A: Pretty early fork, yeah.
00:46:35.232 - 00:46:49.146, Speaker B: Not a distribution fork. Not a coin distribution fork like BSV. But I think Jed McCaleb, he would have been at Ripple, right? He was one of the founders there, and then he went and did Stellar.
00:46:49.146 - 00:47:02.722, Speaker B: And so he actually has a lot of XRP, as well as being the founder of Stellar, and correct me if I'm wrong, but Stellar also is one of the few coins that is a little more interoperable with Bitcoin because of.
00:47:02.776 - 00:47:04.210, Speaker A: I actually don't know that.
00:47:04.360 - 00:47:19.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I learned this one a while back. I don't know if it's still true, but like, it's Lightning Network. What's the word? It can, in theory run on Lightning Network.
00:47:19.290 - 00:47:44.442, Speaker B: I think also Stellar had a huge Bitcoin AirDrop in early 2017, and that kind of got some Bitcoiners to back Stellar because they thought that it's like a Ripple fork that Bitcoiners hold more of in that sense. I know very little about their adoption path. I haven't been following it too closely.
00:47:44.442 - 00:48:00.982, Speaker B: But the coin has been doing well in recent days. I think with a lot of the CBDC stuff coming out recently, I wouldn't rule out one of these more payment, micro payment focused coins to be able to deliver some of that stuff. I don't know if seller can do it.
00:48:00.982 - 00:48:18.090, Speaker B: I don't know the technology well enough. But like we mentioned, you don't really need censorship resistance in a CBDC. You need some kind of technology that the governments adopt.
00:48:18.090 - 00:48:24.320, Speaker B: I don't know how that's going to look, but I do know that a lot of these kind of payment coins are going to be buying for that.
00:48:25.090 - 00:48:59.960, Speaker A: I wouldn't want to be buying for mean, especially after we talked about yeah, I think actually USDC, the existence of USDC and how popular it has become and the kind of public private partnerships that it has already racked up at this pretty early stage, I think it totally destroys the kind of long tail investment thesis for something like stellar. If you ask me. I've never been more bearish on Ripple and by extension Stellar than I have been today.
00:49:00.330 - 00:49:09.002, Speaker B: I think. Another point to add about Stellar too, we'll probably get into this talking about ripple as well, but a ton of the supply is not active. Right.
00:49:09.002 - 00:49:35.134, Speaker B: So again, the market cap is high, but you don't actually know how many of those coins can be sold. And I think a few months ago they announced that they're going to burn some of their escrow and then price went up for a while and then it came down. And then it's something where the coin supply is not well defined.
00:49:35.134 - 00:49:45.606, Speaker B: Right. It's centralized in that sense, right. Where large amounts of the supply can be moving around, can be doing interesting things that you don't know about.
00:49:45.606 - 00:50:14.106, Speaker B: That historically has been the strength of the Ripple Stellar model, which is that they can distribute large amounts of supply to key partners in return for them backing, publicly supporting their project. Right. Now the question is how do they use this if they're burning it? That could be bullish or bearish, right? It's bullish in the sense that the supply is decreasing, so scarcity is increasing.
00:50:14.106 - 00:50:23.780, Speaker B: But it could bearish in the sense that they're not able to figure out any other use case for this coin other than burning it to try to get the price higher.
00:50:25.290 - 00:50:36.594, Speaker A: So number ten breaking into the top ten Binance coin. I think Binance has done pretty much obscene amounts of volume, trading volume.
00:50:36.642 - 00:50:36.806, Speaker B: Right.
00:50:36.828 - 00:50:45.382, Speaker A: And I think they hit a few days where they had like $30 billion of volume in November. So what do you think about the exchange token?
00:50:45.526 - 00:50:58.270, Speaker B: They've really been running away with the offshore market, I think because you had big issues with Okx, right. You had the fact that you couldn't withdraw for over a month. That wasn't great.
00:50:58.270 - 00:51:23.126, Speaker B: And then Huobi had the it still has the issue where I think three of the key people there are in prison. So it's also not a good look. So I think for a lot of traders, they've just been saying, okay, why am I even on these exchanges? Why don't I just go to Binance and trade where I at least know that it's got less of a chance that the guy is going to be in jail? So I think Binance has been a huge beneficiary of that.
00:51:23.126 - 00:52:02.642, Speaker B: I think also, ever since they started, I've always felt that Binance is the most focused on trying to make sure that their users are going to do well. So even the way that they did their launchpad, the IEO phase, right. It was very clear that they were the only ones who actually knew how to do the IEO because they brought on reputable projects that are still active today, and they made sure that they negotiated good terms for the launch pads so that the people who own BNB and then get to buy these coins, they get a good deal and they're able to make money in the long run.
00:52:02.642 - 00:52:14.342, Speaker B: So I think that kind of very direct to client relationship. I think it really helped them. Whereas the other exchanges, they then came in and emulated this.
00:52:14.342 - 00:52:39.680, Speaker B: But before Binance, there wasn't really this idea that the client comes first and that the management is very kind of reachable by the client base. Right. I think now with FTX and SBF, he's kind of trying to do that kind of CZ game as well, where he's know, I'm very accessible, you can tell me things about my platform, and then I'll change.
00:52:39.680 - 00:53:15.018, Speaker B: It's been, it's been a huge success. I think the other thing that people underestimate about, like since the beginning really, is that because they've had this exchange token and they were one of the first to have a good exchange token, a lot of their user base are very loyal because they got BNB early and they made money from that. And BNB gets a lot of value accrued back to it through launchpad, through BNB, staking, through finance, smart chain, a lot of these different ways.
00:53:15.018 - 00:53:33.454, Speaker B: But so it's something where people inherently trust it because the token of it has done really well. Right. Whereas for a lot of the other exchanges, they also then came out with an exchange token, but they didn't have a focus on how do you accrue value to this thing, they just kind of let it be out there too.
00:53:33.454 - 00:53:46.790, Speaker B: As a second thought, as an afterthought those exchanges, some of the users actually left because they were disillusioned that they bought this coin and then the exchange kind of didn't care about it anymore.
00:53:48.330 - 00:53:50.646, Speaker A: Maybe Leo good example of that.
00:53:50.748 - 00:54:09.100, Speaker B: Possibly. Possibly. But even if you look at Huawei, token hasn't really done anything in quite some time to the same price as in 2018, to Binance credit, they really were able to pull out that vision in a huge way, right?
00:54:09.550 - 00:54:35.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I really like, I mean, exchanges are kind of the big winners, right? Beside the originally the kind of layer one coins and now this year we can say, okay, some application layer coins also did really well. But besides that, the only really big winners so far in crypto world exchanges. And I think that the binance token was a way for people kind of to participate in that success for the first time, right.
00:54:35.140 - 00:54:42.982, Speaker A: In a very democratic mean. I like pretty much everything about this token. I think it does actually.
00:54:42.982 - 00:55:03.406, Speaker A: I mean, even though a lot of people kind of disagree with that, I think it does kind of behave like binance equity so far and I don't really mind. I think what most people criticize about is the kind of buy and burn model. For some reason, I don't understand why people dislike it.
00:55:03.406 - 00:55:12.602, Speaker A: I think it's functionally equivalent to a dividend, but it's actually better if you have to worry about taxes in your jurisdiction.
00:55:12.666 - 00:55:24.900, Speaker B: It's better tax wise. But people think psychologically, the aspect of forcing the user to sell it in order to realize some of their cash flows is like a bad user experience, which is not wrong.
00:55:26.150 - 00:55:27.302, Speaker A: That's true, that's true.
00:55:27.356 - 00:55:27.670, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:27.740 - 00:55:47.946, Speaker A: I mean, we see that kind of is the number of your token, like actually the number of tokens you have goes up. You just prefer that over the value of the token going up. And that is kind of the psychological success story behind all the rebasing that we saw in the last nine months.
00:55:48.048 - 00:55:49.500, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:55:50.670 - 00:56:40.374, Speaker A: So that could also explain why Maker so unpopular is they changed from, I mean, we could always come back to that topic, but objectively speaking, like, maker is on track to burn over 6% of all MKR supply this year, which is a lot, right. That's kind of the most cash flow of any token in DFI, actually. And if they change the kind of model from buy and burn to paying like dividend, maybe even in Dai or whatever, I think that would probably go a long way to changing kind of the narrative around this coin.
00:56:40.502 - 00:56:43.100, Speaker B: Possibly there's some other issues too.
00:56:46.530 - 00:57:06.760, Speaker A: Okay, I think that settles it for binance number nine, polkadot. I think it's very interesting coins, probably the coin like after bitcoin and Ethereum that I'd be most inclined to own of all the coins in the top 20 so far.
00:57:07.290 - 00:57:40.814, Speaker B: Yeah, we are definitely big fans of polka dot. I think the approach the team are a bit unparalleled in the sense that the team behind polka dot, which is Parity, Gavin Wood, they already have the experience of launching Ethereum, of being key in launching Ethereum and building that community and bootstrapping developer interest and adoption. And I think that their motivations for creating polkadot were highly sound at that time as well.
00:57:40.814 - 00:58:26.446, Speaker B: Which is to say that the architecture of Ethereum may ultimately not be the way that you'd want to do it if you wanted, let's say, application specific projects to really do well. And if you wanted sort of I think their other big gripe would have been on chain governance versus Ethereum based fuzzy governance, right? Where I think Ethereum with the Dow hack and then with the EIP One Nine Nine issue, which is that Parity had gotten some of their ETH funds locked in a multi SIG wallet and then they had asked for the next hard fork to restore those funds. Right? And then the Ethereum community at that time rejected that.
00:58:26.446 - 00:58:54.600, Speaker B: I think that sort of the polkadot approach is to say that if you're an application, you secure the resources required to then have participation in a network. You're sort of one chain within other chains. And through this, you can have full autonomy, right? You can deploy whatever it is you want, whatever makes sense for your project.
00:58:54.600 - 00:59:22.174, Speaker B: And you can also make sure that you have sovereignty, right? Like, there cannot be another hard fork that makes this not work. Right. Whereas in Ethereum, where you saw that, I think in the Constance in, like, Aragon guys were saying you've changed things in this which require my application to change a bunch of lines of code because you've now done this thing in your hard fork and that kind of stuff.
00:59:22.174 - 00:59:56.730, Speaker B: If you think about just like, as it gets bigger and bigger, how does that work? Right? How do we know what the implications of these hard forks will be on live applications? That kind of messiness. And I think polka dot for me, I see it as the highly engineered approach to smart contract applications. I think its direct kind of analog would be Cosmos, which has a slightly different approach.
00:59:56.730 - 01:00:17.506, Speaker B: But, yeah, I do tend to see these kind of plays as covering OD number of bases and likely being synergistic with Ethereum as well, where applications can be on both and they can access both and they can ultimately decide where they live the best. Right?
01:00:17.688 - 01:00:31.320, Speaker A: I mean, we always hear that polkadot is very popular in Asia. It has a large grassroots community. So are there any projects on top of Polkadot that you kind of track that you think would be worth checking out?
01:00:31.690 - 01:00:52.622, Speaker B: I think it's a little too early for me to promote any specific projects, but I think the next few weeks and months will be key. I think a good way to learn is, like, Kusama as well, because Kusama was the canary network for polkadot, basically the litecoin to Bitcoin. And Kusama was super interesting in that.
01:00:52.622 - 01:01:09.058, Speaker B: So it had four times faster block speeds, it had faster governance module, it had a lot of these kinds of things. And that's had tremendous amount of grassroots developer interest. The Kusama price has outperformed the Polkadot price in large part because of that.
01:01:09.058 - 01:01:23.206, Speaker B: And there are even some people debating, like, well, why can't I just exist on Kusama forever. Why do I need the prestige of being a polkadot pair chain, right? And all these kind of debates. So it's been very interesting to see.
01:01:23.206 - 01:01:53.294, Speaker B: All I can say is it's very fluid and it's definitely a lot of people interested in seeing if it makes sense for what they're building. I think you'll see a lot of DeFi applications sort of plant a flag in polkadot over the next few months. I think Compound recently announced they forked substrate to explore that and I think there's going to be a lot more others in the works because I think the nice thing about polkadot too, is that it has a lot of EVM compatible tools now.
01:01:53.294 - 01:02:34.042, Speaker B: So you can just decide if you want to try it out, if you want to see if it makes sense to deploy instead on polkadot. I think that that approach is ultimately good because of how much stuff has been done on Ethereum and how much people already know how to write in that. I think there was a big eWASM kind of thesis as well for some time in the ETH Killers, and I think the more practical of these are kind of hedging their bets and saying, well, I also want people to just be able to deploy EVM solidity and just be able to map it and then not have to necessarily write it in rust.
01:02:34.042 - 01:02:43.614, Speaker B: Not necessarily have to do that. So I see them as the most practical. They just want adoption, but yet it's also like the most engineered, I guess.
01:02:43.812 - 01:02:58.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And I think mostly I think the case, as we also said, the case for polkadot, it's in its very strong kind of community and kind of all the time. It has already existed, right.
01:02:58.214 - 01:03:18.422, Speaker A: It has already some kind of lindy effect that a network effect that the others might not have and social credibility behind it. A coin that has existed for as long as polka dot, or maybe even longer, I'm not sure. It's in rank eight cardano.
01:03:18.422 - 01:03:34.020, Speaker A: And this one is like a complete mystery to me. I mean, it's kind of here in the top ten of our cryptocurrencies, but I know it's a proof of stake coin and that's pretty much the extent of it. I have no idea what it actually does.
01:03:34.710 - 01:04:11.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I think charles Hoskinson founder also early in Ethereum, named as a co founder, I think they raised 50,000 BDC in Japan mainly, but also in other countries, which is quite a bit of BDC to raise. And I think that it's definitely done very well price wise, even despite being down, I think still 85% versus all time high. But yeah, I don't fully understand the roadmap at this stage for them in terms of adoption roadmap.
01:04:11.450 - 01:04:35.842, Speaker B: I think it's become it's one of the coins that's on BitMEX, when BitMEX had all BTC perps and not alt BTC perps, all BTC futures. So it's been one of the coins that people like to trade a lot. It's a little bit like Tron, right? A lot of the mex traders, they like to trade Tron and cardano because it's a nice shelling point.
01:04:35.842 - 01:04:45.894, Speaker B: Like if people believe in an alt season, they like buying cardano because it's high market cap. It's liquid, but it also moves a ton. So it's benefited from that.
01:04:45.894 - 01:04:51.674, Speaker B: I think that kind of lindiness where people buy it as a proxy, right?
01:04:51.872 - 01:04:54.810, Speaker A: Yeah. It's almost more like it represents something.
01:04:54.880 - 01:05:03.898, Speaker B: The idea represents the idea of a coin, which is a low price. Right? It's a 15 cent coin, so it is one of the lower price coins.
01:05:03.994 - 01:05:12.438, Speaker A: Interesting. It is the only coin below a dollar in the top ten. So it does have XRP.
01:05:12.554 - 01:05:15.794, Speaker B: XRP is XRP is also oh, you're right.
01:05:15.832 - 01:05:28.070, Speaker A: Yeah, XRP is sorry. Cardano $0.15. Chain link in ring seven is pretty interesting.
01:05:28.070 - 01:05:57.658, Speaker A: I think it wasn't really taken seriously for the longest time, but I mean, chain Link, you can't really debate a, it has done extremely well price wise. It has a highly dedicated community. Besides Bitcoin has kind of the best memes and they're actually doing interesting engineering work that I respect.
01:05:57.658 - 01:06:12.740, Speaker A: So they are poaching some very prominent academics. Kind of. Yeah, they they are they are doing just doing overall very interesting work, I think.
01:06:12.740 - 01:06:21.670, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of partnerships, like not the kind of partnerships that we saw in like 20, 17, 18, but like actual integrations with DFI.
01:06:22.330 - 01:06:59.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Chain Link definitely like one that we miss mainly and I think that nonetheless kind of is the poster boy, I think, of application thesis for DFI because I think when Chain Link came out and you told people that Chain Link could become 10% of ethereum market cap or something like that, people would have thought that's quite insane. Right? Whereas now this is very comfortably so. And I think that it kind of shows that we don't really know still how value will accrue in this ecosystem.
01:06:59.054 - 01:07:55.650, Speaker B: We don't know if the native token of the smart contract platform that wins or if there is one winner will accrue the value or will the Oracle layer that is queried, will that accrue the value? And is that winner take all or will it be the user facing applications? No one knows the answer to these questions. So if the application thesis is correct, then I think you'll see a lot of DFI coins enter the top 20 over the next few months because these are actually used by people and they have a way to accrue value. If the thesis is wrong, it may be wrong because applications somehow can't maintain value because of forks, because of war to zero or something like that, or governance being captured, whatever it is.
01:07:55.650 - 01:08:08.246, Speaker B: But then you'll see like base layers ultimately benefit from the economic activity, kind of the city versus the countryside analogy that people use. So I. Think chainlink is very emblematic of that.
01:08:08.246 - 01:08:18.710, Speaker B: I think it's definitely the best Oracle solution now. And it's got the credibility too. So everyone is now forced to use it, or if they don't use it, then they get harassed.
01:08:18.710 - 01:08:23.180, Speaker B: Right. So it kind of has that network effect.
01:08:25.650 - 01:08:37.858, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, chainlink, there are still a lot of things that I don't understand about it. I haven't looked into it too deeply. I think it might be interesting to eventually invite some chainlink person to just learn about it a bit more.
01:08:38.024 - 01:08:41.106, Speaker B: Let's get some chain link experts on in a few weeks.
01:08:41.208 - 01:08:48.600, Speaker A: That'd be fun. Would be interesting. Bitcoin cash in number six.
01:08:48.600 - 01:09:27.058, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's still there, but it has lost a lot of value against BTC over the years. And, I mean, it just makes kind of the whole idea that you can fork bitcoin and kind of destroy its scarcity, I think bitcoin cash, I'm very grateful that it exists because back in 2017, people were extremely scared of bitcoin forking. They thought if bitcoin can be forked, it would invalidate the scarcity of bitcoin, so there's unlimited supply of it.
01:09:27.058 - 01:09:42.822, Speaker A: But the fact that bitcoin cash lost so much value against BTC is actually, I think there's even like, at the end of the day, you could say that the fork actually generated value for bitcoin, even though it looked like it would destroy value at first.
01:09:42.956 - 01:10:05.358, Speaker B: I think so. And I think people have started to realize that it's kind of anti lindy when you have a fork and the fork doesn't achieve what it says it will. The longer it doesn't do so, the more it'll kind of decay against the original coin, because the narrative for it is very difficult to resuscitate, I think.
01:10:05.358 - 01:10:35.000, Speaker B: Right. Because the longer that it doesn't do what it does, it is harder to convince people that it can do it. So I think bitcoin cash, it'll actually always be around, I think, because it's got a lot of OG support from people that will probably never give up, mainly because they're also quite big, they still have a lot of BTC and they also still quite active in the crypto markets as a whole.
01:10:35.000 - 01:11:00.794, Speaker B: But I think, yeah, it's also been damaged, not even more so from bitcoin, but also from Ethereum. Right. Because I think the people who bought into the idea, who buy into the idea of blockchain utility being the main driver of price and network effects, a lot of them went to Ethereum because that's where all the utility actually came about, right, where stablecoins were getting created.
01:11:00.794 - 01:11:24.086, Speaker B: ERC, 20 massive network effect. So it kind of lost the bitcoin network effect, the brand and the investor community, and then it also lost the utility mantle to Ethereum. Like I always say, if bitcoin cash had forked off in 2015 or 2016, it could be very different now.
01:11:24.086 - 01:11:56.818, Speaker B: Right? It could be that bitcoin cash is worth a lot more it could even be that that model, because where we would have been in, let's say in sort of mice's regression theorem, where which money is the more useful one? In the beginning, it could have been that this is now the one we think of as bitcoin. And we don't even know that because the one that wins is the one that we think now is the real one. Right.
01:11:56.818 - 01:12:12.920, Speaker B: We don't know which one the fork is. So ethereum is actually like a fork, right? It is clearly the fork of ethereum classic, right. In the sense that it is a more aggressive act, to put it that way.
01:12:15.050 - 01:12:28.106, Speaker A: All blockchain forking has this kind of like ship of theses aspect to it, right. Where bitcoin has forked and has hard forked when there was a bug. Right.
01:12:28.106 - 01:12:31.706, Speaker A: And in theory, someone could keep running the kind of original they can keep.
01:12:31.728 - 01:12:35.390, Speaker B: Running the original that has like exactly billions of bitcoins. Exactly.
01:12:35.460 - 01:12:46.762, Speaker A: I mean, this wouldn't be the original bitcoin. I think that it is indeed the kind of social contract. It's hard to say what determines what is bitcoin or what is ethereum.
01:12:46.762 - 01:12:48.446, Speaker A: It's just you can talk endlessly.
01:12:48.478 - 01:13:12.490, Speaker B: It's whatever we decide it is. Right. So, yeah, I think bitcoin cash now, the struggle is to I think the struggle now is to figure out what is the roadmap, what is the adoption roadmap, how do they create a larger community than just the OGS that forked off bitcoin during the scaling debate? Those are all tough questions.
01:13:12.490 - 01:13:29.470, Speaker B: I think that ethereum having the utility that it is, it really doesn't help bitcoin cash at all. Yeah, I think bitcoin cash, they try to do simple ledger protocol where you can do transfers of tokens on bitcoin cash. You can do dividend payments, kinds of things.
01:13:29.470 - 01:13:43.374, Speaker B: A lot of it is a little bit too little too late. I think where those ideas were kind of cool in 2016. But ethereum, the grassroots community and just the power of that ecosystem is tremendous.
01:13:43.374 - 01:13:51.522, Speaker B: Right. I think in a single day, ethereum grassroots thinkers create more stuff than bitcoin cash creates in a year, in my opinion.
01:13:51.586 - 01:13:52.200, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:13:54.250 - 01:13:57.800, Speaker B: That'S tough. I think that's very tough. On the utility side.
01:13:58.490 - 01:14:24.100, Speaker A: It's always interesting to do the kind of post mortem on what they could have done differently. And I think for me, the biggest thing that I see with bitcoin cash is they didn't give bitcoin people any reason to own it, really, because it's not, in my opinion, it's okay that you want to fork off bitcoin and that you want to do follow the kind of payments and utility vision. But they didn't really lean into it enough.
01:14:25.270 - 01:14:36.454, Speaker B: I think they spent too much time arguing and not enough time delivering their roadmap. Right. If they had delivered the roadmap and earlier, they could have gotten there.
01:14:36.454 - 01:14:53.530, Speaker B: But I think also their playbook was a little bit more focused toward payments and toward merchants. Right. Toward the idea that merchants would accept it and that would be the way that it gets adoption and becomes useless money.
01:14:53.530 - 01:15:29.800, Speaker B: And I think, again, like, stablecoins definitely hurts that a lot because USDT got used instead, USDC. And it's just tough because once you have that, then how do you tell people, well, people are going to use this volatile coin as a medium of exchange and ultimately you have to carve out that niche for people to own it, like you said, and they haven't done that. And proof of work itself is very challenging because in the meantime, you will have miners selling it, doing energy arbitrage on it, right, who may not even believe in it.
01:15:29.800 - 01:15:38.220, Speaker B: So if you try to move the price up, they will move hash over to sell it. So it's very difficult, I think.
01:15:38.990 - 01:16:00.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, bitcoin really has no like bitcoin in its current form has no competition, right? It's basically the only real store of value that's recognized by everyone. And it's kind of like the pristine collateral. Like every other blockchain wants to import it to be used in its applications and so on.
01:16:00.830 - 01:16:18.120, Speaker A: Whereas with bitcoin cash, you have the competition. Like, you have coins that are blockchains that are more useful, like Ethereum can deliver more utility. You have stable coins that beat you on the payment side, you have more centralized blockchains that beat you on confirmation time.
01:16:18.120 - 01:16:31.674, Speaker A: That's like my big problem with bitcoin cash. There's nothing that it does really well. And I think that is the best way to lose, right, in a game that's all about network effect and winner take all.
01:16:31.674 - 01:16:48.606, Speaker A: I mean, it really only matters in this space to be the very best at something and that's how you carve out your niche. But it's not enough to just be there and do various things a little bit.
01:16:48.708 - 01:17:15.094, Speaker B: Yeah. With that said, I wouldn't be that surprised to see bitcoin cash price do relatively well over the next year just because you had so many waves of flushing out now. And with this recent BCHA wave, where now, from what I'm told, there's more developers that can get more of a say because you've had sort of a calling via that process and so they have a better chance now.
01:17:15.094 - 01:18:01.542, Speaker B: And also, I think the investors in BCH, a lot of the ones who got disillusioned, they have quit. The supply is getting increasingly centralized. Also from that, you know, it's ultimately a question of can BCH track BDC as it goes up? Because people buy it as a philosophical hedge against, let's say, lightning network, against the bitcoin vision? Because if so, then BCH can move in a ratio versus BTC, let's say like zero one to zero one for the rest of time because it'll always exist as this philosophical hedge, right? But people definitely do that much less now than they did, let's say, in 2018, where they said the blocks are full we buy BCH or the blocks are not full? It remains to be seen.
01:18:01.542 - 01:18:16.074, Speaker B: Can they push that narrative? So if BDC blocks get full, will people buy BCH? If not, if they just buy ETH instead, then it's not good. And it's going to be tough for them because they decouple from that.
01:18:16.272 - 01:18:31.354, Speaker A: There used to be a lot of triggers where people actually bought Bitcoin cash or where you saw kind of on social media kind of narrative shift right. Would go very high on BTC, and immediately you would see people price BCH. But that just doesn't happen anymore.
01:18:31.402 - 01:18:32.880, Speaker B: No, it doesn't happen at all.
01:18:33.570 - 01:18:51.254, Speaker A: So we originally wanted to record an episode on options, right. And I really love what you said earlier. We have a project, forks off another project, and has this kind of vision that it wants to realize every day, that it doesn't realize that vision, you have this kind of time decay, right.
01:18:51.254 - 01:19:14.782, Speaker A: That you have an options where forks I think it makes a lot of sense, actually, to think of these forks as options on realizing some kind of vision, and then you have the time decay where it gets worth. A little bit less every day where it doesn't get closer to mean. You do have this kind of counterforce, which is the kind of lindy effect.
01:19:14.782 - 01:19:30.270, Speaker A: Right? So you have, on the one hand, the time decay and other hand, the lindy effect. So it gets worth a little bit more every day where it's still around. So, yeah, it really goes into, I guess, which of those forces prevails.
01:19:30.430 - 01:19:31.140, Speaker B: Definitely.
01:19:32.950 - 01:19:48.090, Speaker A: A coin that actually is very similar to BCH, right. In rank five, litecoin, why is it still in rank five? How do we explain this?
01:19:48.240 - 01:20:21.646, Speaker B: I think Litecoin is actually the second most lendy coin after Bitcoin because of actually how early it was created, and also because I think because the gold silver meme is very strong in the traditional markets, it's kind of put itself into this digital silver concept. And I think to their credit, I think what they've done really well is they've kind of aligned themselves very closely with the bitcoin community. They never claim they're going to flip in bitcoin.
01:20:21.646 - 01:20:39.770, Speaker B: They never claim that they're going to overtake it. They're just like the kid brother. Right? But as a result, I think they've actually been able to capture a lot of retail interest, because when bitcoin is really high price, people say, okay, well, you know what? I just buy litecoin.
01:20:39.770 - 01:21:02.960, Speaker B: The unit price is lower, so I can own whole coins. I kind of see Litecoin as the ultimate beneficiary of unit bias on Bitcoin, more so even than XRP, because I think XRP, it still requires a narrative. You still need to believe some things to be true, that banks will use it, that X rapid, that will happen.
01:21:02.960 - 01:21:27.442, Speaker B: Whereas Litecoin, you don't need to believe anything. You just need to think that it's digital silver, digital gold. And if you look back in time, you look at a long chart, you can see, wow, it's been around almost as long as Bitcoin, right? And actually, the more years that go by, the more it'll look like it's been around almost the same time as Bitcoin, right? Like, if it goes around 50 years, litecoin is around 48 years, it's basically the same.
01:21:27.442 - 01:21:42.560, Speaker B: Right. And you kind of see that because it's also one of the only coins that is definitely not a security, right. Because it was not pre mined proof of work.
01:21:42.560 - 01:21:53.920, Speaker B: And it is dominant in its proof of work chain, right. It shares an algorithm with Dogecoin, but it's dominant on its so. So I think that that's also good for it.
01:21:53.920 - 01:22:18.040, Speaker B: And it has all the on ramps as well, right? Like, it has the PayPal on ramp. It has the other on ramps because it's not a security and because it's mean I think Litecoin definitely triggers people because it seems like a regressive bet, because it's not betting on any technology. Right.
01:22:18.040 - 01:22:34.702, Speaker B: It does function as a testnet for a lot of bitcoin innovation, right? So it's a testnet for SegWit, it's testnet for some other things that I can't remember right now, but the Lightning Network. Lightning Network as well. Yeah.
01:22:34.702 - 01:22:47.486, Speaker B: So it does serve that purpose. And so it has value because of that as well, because of that prestige. And there are a lot of more hardline bitcoiners that will only trade between Litecoin and Bitcoin.
01:22:47.486 - 01:22:51.038, Speaker B: So if they think there's an alt cycle, they'll refuse to buy any alt except Litecoin.
01:22:51.134 - 01:22:51.954, Speaker A: Interesting, right.
01:22:51.992 - 01:23:14.506, Speaker B: So that also gives it a kind of lindiness to it, I would say, canonically, right. Some of the most OG bitcoiners in certain countries, they only will touch BTC, LTC, and XMR because they think these are the only coins that are clean. Right.
01:23:14.506 - 01:23:24.910, Speaker B: In that sense, that's why it's number five, I think, despite the fact that no one knows if there is a roadmap, if there needs to be a roadmap.
01:23:25.890 - 01:23:37.002, Speaker A: All these really I think Litecoin really tells an interesting story in the sense that you have a ton of I mean, you really do have money crypto and tech crypto, right? These kind of two.
01:23:37.076 - 01:23:38.302, Speaker B: This is the pure money crypto.
01:23:38.366 - 01:23:53.186, Speaker A: Exactly, yes, exactly. There's so many people in this space who think that basically this is like a technological revolution and we need to innovate in order to make the price go up. But Litecoin is the purest version.
01:23:53.186 - 01:24:12.246, Speaker A: I mean, nowadays, bitcoin is also getting more and more pure in that sense that it kind of ossifies, unfortunately. But, yeah, Litecoin is really it doesn't change, it doesn't innovate whatsoever. There's nothing interesting about it technologically.
01:24:12.246 - 01:24:26.882, Speaker A: It's just a network of people who kind of respect its value and yeah, I mean, it's been around for a long time. It's probably going to be around for a long time. And yeah, I mean, the regular case as you say, for it is also extremely clear.
01:24:26.882 - 01:24:37.606, Speaker A: I think it has more going for it than what people who are in the tech crypto camp are willing to believe.
01:24:37.708 - 01:24:39.320, Speaker B: I think certainly.
01:24:41.370 - 01:24:55.370, Speaker A: Number four is USDT. So I think the big story, I mean for one, has reached 20 billion market cap, so really insane growth. But I think the even bigger story is in 2019.
01:24:55.370 - 01:25:24.738, Speaker A: Basically you could have asked almost anyone, they would have said what are the ODS that tether goes belly up in the next twelve months? And a lot of them would have said very likely, but we're kind of seeing the opposite, right? I mean, kind of all the talk about tether going down and kind of the has completely disappeared, right? And trust in it is basically at completely new levels. So why is that?
01:25:24.904 - 01:26:04.738, Speaker B: I think people underestimated the network effect it already had at that time, right, where if you're binance, if you're hubby, if you're okx, you need USDT to work, because if it doesn't work, then nobody can trade spot on your exchanges because to this day there is no spot USD on these exchanges. You have to use a stablecoin and you have to use a relatively neutral one too. I think for a while finance and Hoy thought that they could get everyone else to use their own stablecoin, but that's a tough sell, right, because you're now trusting that exchange to run the custody of it.
01:26:04.738 - 01:26:33.514, Speaker B: What if they don't like the way that you're competing? It makes sense for it to be run more independently. Right. And I think with USDT it's really benefited from the fact that when the markets go up, also people sell into stablecoin and they'll naturally sell into USDT because this is the coin that they're most sure that they can buy back in in a liquid way.
01:26:33.514 - 01:26:54.730, Speaker B: Right. Whereas there's no real USDC trading pairs, like anywhere on any exchange for BTC. And for think, I think USDC shows the big liquidity network effect that the top stablecoin will get because people want to own what everyone else owns.
01:26:54.730 - 01:27:14.150, Speaker B: So people want to own the stablecoin that everyone else wants to own because they know that they can get in and out of it with big size right, without having to go and create and redeem it. Whereas if you hold USDC or any of these other coins, you have to actually get someone to redeem it for you. You have to actually do a fiat on and off ramp to be able to get the value here.
01:27:14.150 - 01:27:31.914, Speaker B: You know, it's become the de facto dollar of crypto as a result. And to their credit, they've sorted out their issues, they sorted out their banking issues, they moved to the right jurisdictions, they got the right partners, and so they really managed to grow from yeah, yeah.
01:27:31.952 - 01:27:47.762, Speaker A: And I mean, tether is like six times bigger than USDC, but it's probably more than six times more liquid right. Much more, because actually USDC is a lot of it is locked up in DeFi and it's sitting in these kind of liquidity pools, sitting in maker a couple hundred million of it.
01:27:47.816 - 01:27:48.322, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:27:48.456 - 01:27:57.474, Speaker A: And I mean, it's really not serving a lot of usefulness there. It's more used as collateral than used as a trading pair. Right.
01:27:57.474 - 01:28:01.830, Speaker A: So Tether is predominantly used as a trading pair and not as collateral.
01:28:03.690 - 01:28:32.798, Speaker B: All right. XRP, I think it's kind of a hybrid of different narratives. I think it's very early, right? So it has some lineiness from that because everyone has heard about XRP and Ripple and this kind of stuff, and for a long time it appeals especially to traditional finance people when they first learn about crypto, because they think XRP, it doesn't have proof of work.
01:28:32.798 - 01:28:40.900, Speaker B: So it seems like you're getting something for free. You're kind of getting consensus without having to work for it, without having to expend energy. So that appeals to some people.
01:28:40.900 - 01:29:07.210, Speaker B: It's also got the unit bias going for it with the 100 billion supply. And I think mainly it's been able to do these partnerships and then use the partnerships to parlay it into what looks like adoption, and they get very motivated partners to come on and sort of collaborate with them on that. Right.
01:29:07.210 - 01:29:34.078, Speaker B: But whether it's actually going to be able to deliver its roadmap, which is that people banks use XRP to transact value, to do remittances, to do payments, that remains to be seen. Right. And I think that now that there are CBDCs, like you said, and other stable coins, it's very difficult to sell that narrative.
01:29:34.078 - 01:30:10.830, Speaker B: And I think people, the markets do get smarter over time. So I do see tech thesis crypto as having a slightly lesser version of that same anti Lindiness, where the longer you go on and talk about bank adoption and the longer it takes for you to get it, it does hurt, right? Because people say, you've been around fucking seven years. Where's your adoption? Right? Why is no one using it yet? So I tend to think that fresh narratives will in general do better this cycle.
01:30:10.830 - 01:30:29.542, Speaker B: And I think that the less fresh narratives, they almost have to pivot into fresh ones. Right. And so you're seeing that now with XRP because they're planning the flare network fork in maybe three or four days, where basically it's going to allow you.
01:30:29.542 - 01:31:01.710, Speaker B: So it forks out Ripple's XRP, Ripple Labs XRP, and it takes the distribution and it gives the Ripple Labs equivalent coins of the supply of Spark, it's called on the flare network. It gives this to the users, it gives this to the company behind it. But the idea is that you can then use DeFi on Ripple because it's EVM compatible the fork.
01:31:01.710 - 01:31:27.310, Speaker B: So the idea is that you're going to be able to use XRP on ethereum. So you kind of see how that's almost the capitulation, right? Because it's like, and Labs is supporting this for quite heavily. So that's kind of why it's gotten support now from Coinbase, gotten support from Binance, that you can claim your spark from your XRP that's sitting on those exchanges.
01:31:27.310 - 01:31:48.318, Speaker B: But I see this as actually very bearish because you're now turning XRP into a full copycat of Ethereum, right? You're basically saying that there's nothing compelling on the XRP roadmap. You're literally going to copy, you're going to say, we can also use this in Ethereum DeFi. Right.
01:31:48.318 - 01:31:58.020, Speaker B: And that, to me, seems like even retail will catch on to this, I think.
01:32:00.150 - 01:32:12.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't really have a lot to add about XRP. I pretty much agree with all of that. I think it's always a long shot to bet that any of those are going to disappear from the top ten.
01:32:12.022 - 01:32:37.294, Speaker A: I think if you actually go back on Coin market cap and look at, like, I like it that you can look at the top 100 list by a year, find it a really cool feature. And in every year, you have bitcoin and you have XRP and you have Litecoin pretty much in the top three. And until Ethereum came around and eventually Ethereum broke into the top three and Litecoin slowly fell out of it.
01:32:37.294 - 01:33:13.642, Speaker A: But, yeah, it is really hard to see with kind of the CBDC narrative dying. I think it had some supporters, right? I mean, XRP, even in the traditional finance sector, who were very skeptical about bitcoin, mainly because they thought that bitcoin gains popularity, then it's going to be banned. But at the same time, they were big believers in digitization and those were the kind of people who thought that, well, XRP is maybe going to replace Swift or whatever.
01:33:13.642 - 01:33:19.818, Speaker A: Right. But I don't really see the case for that. And it's increasingly going away.
01:33:19.818 - 01:33:34.020, Speaker A: I agree that now them burning supply can be interpreted as a kind of capitulation and yeah, I wouldn't surely wouldn't want to hold it.
01:33:35.670 - 01:33:36.594, Speaker B: All right, last two.
01:33:36.632 - 01:33:36.786, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:33:36.808 - 01:33:40.050, Speaker B: So the big two, big two bitcoin Ethereum.
01:33:40.950 - 01:34:04.790, Speaker A: I think it's super interesting, actually, you talk about Ethereum because our podcast with Light, it got so much attention and we actually said some bearish stuff about Ethereum that got a lot of attention on crypto. Twitter sparked a lot of responses. So maybe we could do like a kind of recap of what happened since then.
01:34:04.940 - 01:34:30.900, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that one of the reasons why Ethereum prices is a very hot, I guess, hot headed topic, is because it did so poorly, right, in 2018. And so a lot of the community, they feel I think it was best described in one of the tweets, I think, described it as like PTSD. Right.
01:34:30.900 - 01:34:56.166, Speaker B: So I think that now that it's doing well, I think to hear that people are not ultra bullish on Ethereum versus bitcoin, I think it does trigger some people. But, I mean, with that said, I am bullish ether versus almost 95% of coins, right? Maybe 90% of coins. I think it's the only smart contract chain that can legitimately say it has adoption.
01:34:56.166 - 01:35:03.886, Speaker B: Right? People use it. You can earn a living on Ethereum using the Ethereum chain. You can't say that about anything else.
01:35:03.886 - 01:35:15.614, Speaker B: Everything else is still a promise in a white paper to a large extent, right. Especially outside of the top 20. And I think people have really underestimated, ERC, 20 network effects.
01:35:15.614 - 01:35:47.100, Speaker B: People have really underestimated MetaMask network effects. People have really underestimated just the fact that Ethereum, even with its high fees or even with its sort of transaction ordering issues and things like that, it doesn't matter because it has so much of the other stuff, right? It has the composability, it has the developer community, and it has the users that actually want to use the application. So I think that that's important to remember.
01:35:47.100 - 01:36:16.498, Speaker B: It is number two, because it has all that. I think that also I can definitely see a world where we go more into power law, where Bitcoin is 80%, let's say, and Ethereum is 20%, and you kind of have this power law distribution. It's getting quite popular in some of the chats I'm in, where people think this will be the way that crypto evolves, it'll all grow together, and then you have this power law ratio.
01:36:16.498 - 01:36:29.578, Speaker B: I could see that happening. I still don't really buy into the flipping narrative because I think it's fundamentally flawed from the point of view of understanding why Bitcoin right now has value. Right.
01:36:29.578 - 01:36:47.646, Speaker B: If you think of it as a contrapositive, if you know, Ethereum already has higher fees than BDC, has more on chain fees than miners, it already has more transaction value transacted, it's easier to use, then why hasn't it already it.
01:36:47.668 - 01:36:50.362, Speaker A: Actually still has substantially less transaction volume.
01:36:50.506 - 01:36:53.954, Speaker B: Right? I meant fees per day. Fees per day.
01:36:53.992 - 01:36:54.786, Speaker A: That's much higher.
01:36:54.888 - 01:37:13.462, Speaker B: Yeah. So why doesn't it already flip in Bitcoin? And I think for Ethereum people, they would say the reason is that people don't know yet. People are just kind of stale, longs in Bitcoin, and once they realize this utility, then they'll switch over.
01:37:13.462 - 01:37:14.120, Speaker B: Right?
01:37:15.050 - 01:37:15.800, Speaker A: And.
01:37:18.570 - 01:37:44.874, Speaker B: I think what some of them are missing, I think, to be honest, most people like in Ethereum, they understand why people also own Bitcoin. I think they get that to be the digital numerator, to be the digital money, it requires a high degree of trust minimization. It requires a high degree of possibly ossification at some point, once it works as intended.
01:37:44.874 - 01:38:09.970, Speaker B: Right. And there's a debate on whether it reached that point yet or if it's too dangerous for it to already ossify, I think that that can be a debate. But I do think that it's very difficult for people to imagine a digital money that is, let's say, hard forking, quite often the monetary policy.
01:38:09.970 - 01:38:21.546, Speaker B: No one can really define it. And especially given the fact that Ethereum doesn't have on chain governance. It's impossible to describe even the process with which the monetary policy is created.
01:38:21.546 - 01:38:50.674, Speaker B: Right. I think that reality makes it a relatively less appealing as a money for a lot of people who are coming into crypto buying due to the premise of digital scarcity. I think that there is also a unit bias element to Ethereum right now that may help it, which is that bitcoin is at all time highs.
01:38:50.674 - 01:39:00.390, Speaker B: A lot of people missed it, so they may see ETH at 40% of all time highs. It seems like a good value. Right? I think that element is there.
01:39:00.390 - 01:39:23.410, Speaker B: But it is worth noting that even with the ETH to deposit contracts hitting over 1 million ETH, even with all the DFI coins breaking, all time highs, even with all that Fbtc ratio is still zero point 31. Right. It does tell you something about where the fiat inflows have been, and that's been very Bitcoin USD driven.
01:39:23.410 - 01:39:43.330, Speaker B: I personally think Ethereum has already achieved so much, though, that it's almost not that useful for the average person to debate bitcoin versus Ethereum. I think it's clearly, if you own a basket of those two, you're not going to go wrong, in my opinion. If you're betting on flipping, I think it's a little bit ambitious.
01:39:43.330 - 01:40:32.626, Speaker B: But you'll probably still make money in dollars, I think, and you'll probably still be quite okay. I think that those are valid approaches that people can kind of take. I think that the biggest thing that I would say that people who own mainly ETH should consider is the fact that DeFi applications, whether that's aave, sushi, WiFi, whatever it is these coins, they benefit a lot from the theorem network, but they also want to accrue value for their own token holders and deliver utility to their own users.
01:40:32.626 - 01:41:04.546, Speaker B: So I do think that there is this myth or not myth, but there is this know, and I think Molly, the founder of Hedgek, kind of talked about this very nicely, where she said, I don't care about your Ethos money vitalik, buteric she spelled it wrong on purpose. There's vitalik, buteric stuff like I'm using Ethereum because it's permissionless and I can deploy my app there.
01:41:04.728 - 01:41:29.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of the strong Ethereum supporters who get very angry, like when we say something bearish about Ethereum, they kind of misconstrue criticism or bearishness about ETH the token with criticism of ETH the platform. And I think it's very hard to overstate how bullish I am for Ethereum as a platform. Right.
01:41:29.820 - 01:42:03.522, Speaker A: But there's no guarantee that kind of adoption of Ethereum as a network will transfer with the same degree that it would in something like Bitcoin, right. Where there's only one investable token in the bitcoin universe, whereas in Ethereum the app layer can go 100 x from here and there's no rational link why that should make the Ethereum like Ether as a token more valuable. You can argue that.
01:42:03.522 - 01:42:34.060, Speaker A: Once we have proof of stake and once we have ERP one five nine, that it will kind of increase the amount of fees that are generated on the network and it also makes east more useful as collateral in these networks. But especially from the collateral side, that's where I see kind of east challenge the most, right, with more and more bitcoin coming on Ethereum. And I think it's quite likely, actually, that bitcoin on Ethereum will flip ETH on Ethereum in 2021.
01:42:34.060 - 01:43:15.126, Speaker A: Maybe not in 2021, but I definitely the amount of stable coins plus BTC, I think that's where I'd commit to a bet that will probably flip east in 2021. And then you get so many other options for coins to use as collateral in DFI that yeah, I would not want to own east, but I'm still not nearly as bullish on it as I'm on. Like, I don't know if you saw this tweet, but Amin had actually a great tweet and was kind of at the bottom of the ETH BTC ratio.
01:43:15.126 - 01:43:40.930, Speaker A: And what he tweeted is that it's all kind of short term and people underestimate the kind of reflexivity that you have in crypto where if for whatever reason, ETH was to go to like 500, then the entire narrative would flip. Right, because it's not actually that much based on fundamentals, but then people would say, I mean, come on, it generates that amount of fees. Like, how can it not be worth like 500 or $600?
01:43:41.000 - 01:43:41.474, Speaker B: Right?
01:43:41.592 - 01:43:55.606, Speaker A: And I thought it was such a great case study where actually a lot of people did change that even, right, once ETH recovered. So it's actually the price informs the narrative and not the other way around. Many of these cases, definitely.
01:43:55.708 - 01:44:25.150, Speaker B: And I think ETH is the kind of token where if it breaks all time highs when it breaks, it's a very good buy through all time highs because of the fact that it would mean that it took out all the natural selling supply up to that point and it would radically enter price discovery. Right. Because of the fact that something will have been validated in its token value accrual and something will have been validated in the idea of investing in ether.
01:44:25.150 - 01:44:52.474, Speaker B: I think that Ether is definitely the most reflexive asset in the space. When it's at $80, $100, people are like, you don't even need ETH to have any value for Ethereum to work, right? Like economic abstraction. And then when ETH is at like $800 or $1,000, people say, this is going to flip in bitcoin, it's like a bitcoin superset and all that kind of stuff.
01:44:52.474 - 01:45:25.140, Speaker B: Right. But people don't realize, too, a lot of those big high and big lows, it only lasts there a few weeks because as soon as it changes, the hot money goes the other way. What worries me the most about it is that it's still very hot money driven, but over time you have more sort of long term holders now you have more sort of long term believers that it's kind of become the bitcoin cash.
01:45:25.140 - 01:45:52.830, Speaker B: It's kind of inherited that bitcoin cash mantle more so than I think a lot of people have realized, which is that it's a hedge against BTC. Like, if BTC truly ossifies and it ossifies too early and it just doesn't work, ether will become the money and it'll kind of inherit that role. I think that a lot of the existing and the sort of more sustainable monetary premium that ETH has will be from as a hedge to bitcoin.
01:45:52.830 - 01:46:01.998, Speaker B: I do think that's the case. That does give it a floor price that the other tokens don't have, right?
01:46:02.164 - 01:46:15.138, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it has sort of predictable amount of upside and downside against bitcoin, actually. I don't think it can flip in bitcoin, but I'm also 100% sure that's not going away.
01:46:15.138 - 01:46:43.290, Speaker A: If I had to recommend two tokens to buy to people coming into this space, and actually I did that even when I owned very little ethereum never owned no ethereum, but for a time, I owned very little of it. Even then, poker friends of mine were buying crypto for the first time, and I told them, hold them for at least a year and buy bitcoin and ethereum. Buy them sort of based on the kind of market cap weight ratio.
01:46:43.290 - 01:47:32.606, Speaker A: Because long term, I'm definitely bullish on the existence, at least the continued existence of both of them. Let's just talk about, like okay, so what is there to say about bitcoin at this point, right? Bitcoin has almost, I think, breached past all time highs and their thesis, or what a lot of people said is, it super quiet, it has been super quieter on bitcoin on the run up, but once we breach the all time highs, kind of the media machine is going to turn on. A lot of people will get this kind of for a lot of people, the moment they actually end up buying bitcoin is the second time they hear about it, right? Because the first time they think it's some stupid idea or it's a bubble or it's tulips, right? But the second time they hear it often, like, years later.
01:47:32.606 - 01:47:40.302, Speaker A: That's the moment when they realize, oh, it hasn't gone away. Right. So something about my mental model has been wrong.
01:47:40.302 - 01:48:08.354, Speaker A: And Eric wall has written phenomenal posts about this that kind of verbalized this concept very well, which I would recommend everyone to read. But I think that's why I am actually bought into this idea that once bitcoin makes a new all time high, that's when you do get this ramp up in attention and then a lot of people will get the second look on bitcoin, and it's the second look that will turn them into believers.
01:48:08.402 - 01:48:33.562, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think also just seeing a lot of the people that they do respect in traditional finance and traditional figures coming out and saying that they see merit in bitcoin. I think that barry silver had a really good quote in 2018 where he said, 2019 is where crypto gets more respectability and bitcoin gets more respectability, but 2020 is where you really get social proof from bitcoin.
01:48:33.562 - 01:48:59.842, Speaker B: It becomes prestigious in its own right, and I think you're seeing that a lot this year. And definitely you'll see a lot more of that as it breaks all time highs, just even interacting with a lot of traditional finance people in singapore. The social prestige of bitcoin, I don't think has ever been higher than it is now, right, where even you speak with bankers who are against it, they're like, it's impressive now to be associated with bitcoin.
01:48:59.842 - 01:49:31.134, Speaker B: So I think that that is a sea change. And I think that's also why you've been seeing a lot of high net worth buying, you've been seeing a lot of family office buying, because for them, it's not about outperforming, it's about keeping up. It's about, okay, if this is going to be an enumerator, if this is going to be digital scarcity, then I need my own piece, right? If I own, let's say, x basis points of the total wealth in my city, I need to own x percent of bitcoin just to get back to my original wealth distribution.
01:49:31.134 - 01:49:53.162, Speaker B: Right? So that's the way a lot of these guys are viewing it. And I think that if you speak to the ODC desk out there, they'll tell you the ODC buy flow from high net worth is 100% BTC right now, and that's spread across whether asia or europe or us. You kind of see that in the price as well.
01:49:53.162 - 01:50:20.894, Speaker B: But I think it just goes to show they have been studying it for years. Some of them have dabbled in it earlier, and they've seen it fend off the forks, as you mentioned, and they've also seen it kind of get more regulatory clarity in some sense as well. So I think that all that has kind of come together in a backdrop of very heavy monetary easing and money printing.
01:50:20.894 - 01:50:33.030, Speaker B: So I think there's no surprise that we're at all time highs now. And I think that the thesis for bitcoin as a store of value has never been stronger.
01:50:33.930 - 01:50:53.622, Speaker A: Yeah, you used to have kind of career risk from owning bitcoin, and I think we are approaching the point where you have career risk from not owning bitcoin. And I think people underestimate how fast this kind of can flip in zero to one moment.
01:50:53.776 - 01:50:54.480, Speaker B: Sure.
01:50:55.010 - 01:51:08.000, Speaker A: So, yeah, that was an unusual episode, but I thought it was very fun to just, I don't know this catch up about, like, with you, of course, but also about the different coins. But some of these, I haven't really thought about them in a long time.
01:51:08.930 - 01:51:19.320, Speaker B: Definitely it's been unusual, for sure, but I hope people got something out of it and and anything we say is just our opinions. It's nothing more.
