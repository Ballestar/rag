00:00:08.810 - 00:00:14.190, Speaker A: Let's see how much time we have for this panel. So we go until 1530. Perfect.
00:00:14.190 - 00:00:23.466, Speaker A: 25 minutes. All right, so it's me again, Stefan. I'm also still the founder and steward and architect at Flashbots.
00:00:23.466 - 00:01:12.770, Speaker A: I'll put my other hat on, which is one of trying to design an auction system, and maybe I should say a block building system that is compatible with Ethereum and the goals that Ethereum has longer term. So the way I'll frame this conversation is right now we live in a paradigm where block building is happening at the same place as Validating is happening. So for miners right now on Ethereum, they have the task of collecting transactions, collecting bundles from various different sources, like Flashbots, like blockshrout, and putting them together into a block, and then also doing the whole thing that miners do where they mine for a hash, submit a proof of work, and then propagate that to the network.
00:01:12.770 - 00:01:50.970, Speaker A: Vitali gave a talk earlier today, which was about the future of mev within the protocol level of Ethereum. And one of the key objectives is separating out this role of block construction of block building from the role of validating. So taking this task of assembling transactions together into a block, letting specialized parties build on this, and limiting the role of validators to the proposal and voting on top of these blocks.
00:01:50.970 - 00:02:00.690, Speaker A: So I'll go one by one here and we'll do name and where you work. And then also after that, I'll guide a discussion into blockbuilding.
00:02:01.670 - 00:02:09.960, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Tim, I work at Infira. I'm an engineer there. I've been there for three and a half years now, so a pretty long time for the company.
00:02:09.960 - 00:02:20.438, Speaker B: I've worked on a lot of things during that time. Over the past few years, I've mostly led the addition of all our new networks. So that's been support on inferior for everything from filecoin to the layer.
00:02:20.438 - 00:02:24.010, Speaker B: Two networks now that you hear so much about, and it's only growing.
00:02:25.230 - 00:02:31.770, Speaker C: Hi, Ayal, can you hear me? Ayal Malkovich, co founder in Luxor.
00:02:33.150 - 00:02:44.190, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Thomas Stentok. I work as a product manager at Flashbots Relay and also worked on the protocol development on Ethereum with Netamind client.
00:02:45.490 - 00:03:02.600, Speaker A: Okay, Tomas, I'll start with you. Can you talk a bit about the unique challenge of blockbuilding and how you sort of see the blockbuilding ecosystem sort of evolve and what types of players maybe will be doing blockbuilding in the future?
00:03:03.770 - 00:03:25.034, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. I think that what we started by introducing Flashbots to the proof of work systems was because we noticed that there are already some problems, there were already some problems with block building. We needed to avoid the potential risks of the private arrangements between the searchers and miners.
00:03:25.034 - 00:03:56.040, Speaker D: We wanted to make sure that the access to mev is democratized. And now when we look at the proof of stake, those risks might be much, much more serious because of leading to centralization of the stakeholders. So the big operators of Staking might be the ones that will simply cause all the solo validators to not have enough space.
00:03:56.040 - 00:05:06.874, Speaker D: So this risk of centralization, as I think was mentioned by Vitalik many times, is one of the main challenges for Ethereum after the merge. And for the block builders, the challenges themselves is like how to participate in that drive, making everything properly decentralized, how to avoid the pressure of censorship of the transactions, how to collect all the mempool transactions, how to collect proper transactions, to build valuable blocks and really take that role. And this may require a lot of specializations, lots of skills of knowing how to merge different transactions, how to prioritize things, how to really simulate that in a very, very fast way and that skill, again, there is a risk that the builder itself becomes the centralization factor, that the builder requires so much skills.
00:05:06.874 - 00:05:18.690, Speaker D: That is a risk by itself in the mev world. So balancing all of those centralization factors, decentralization requirements, censorship, resistance is a challenge.
00:05:19.910 - 00:05:42.220, Speaker A: Okay, question for you about block building. This is not a role really that exists right now, but projecting into the future. What do you think are sort of the differences between a block builder that's going to be most successful and one that isn't? So maybe another way to frame this question is what would make one block builder more competitive than another or better than another?
00:05:44.990 - 00:06:23.314, Speaker C: Great question. So I think in a sense you have to think what's going to be the advantages, what's going to be the gain? So obviously the first thing is getting the information faster. Okay, so the one that are going to optimize their infrastructure, the one that are going to make sure that they hear about the opportunities, about the transaction in general and obviously the transaction with mev faster, they are the one who going to get the gain, the advantage.
00:06:23.314 - 00:06:39.254, Speaker C: So that's the first thing. There are going to be some advantages in simulation. So again, a lot of it is infrastructure, but a lot of it might be within the logic.
00:06:39.254 - 00:07:16.280, Speaker C: But from my view, this is the things that even if one block builder will have an advantage, it's going to be very fast to imitate. And the last thing is the step of the execution, which in a sense I'm not that sure that there will be a performance problem here, but there might be when you can see it in different chain where a validator are creating a block, but they're still being uncled and losing the opportunity.
00:07:17.390 - 00:07:30.410, Speaker A: Okay, perfect. Thank you, Tim. So one of the big, I think, things around block building and potentially one of the big concerns is censorship.
00:07:30.410 - 00:08:34.190, Speaker A: So if we sort of abide to a vision of the future where we do have proposer builder separation, there might be a lot of economies of scales involved in block building, which means that there'll be much fewer block builders than there will be validators in the network. This is something where you can get in a scenario is where the block builders get all the transactions and can start making decisions around. Should we include this transaction or not include it? I think Infura, as being the largest aggregator of transaction for as long as I can remember on Ethereum, has had to tackle a lot of these questions around what does it mean to be an aggregator of transactions and how do we deal with it? So I want to hear a bit about your understanding within Infura and how Infura thinks about sort of this role of being a custodian in the ecosystem of transactions and how that relates to censorship and some of the other characteristics that are a bit more undesirable.
00:08:35.010 - 00:08:43.810, Speaker B: Sure. So I mean, Infuria's goal has always been to enable developers and enable Ethereum in the ecosystem to be successful. And we've had a lot of success.
00:08:43.810 - 00:09:00.406, Speaker B: As you said, we're probably the biggest transaction aggregator receiving all the transactions through MetaMask and other sources. We get a lot of them and mostly we just are trying to keep up. You might think that our transaction infrastructure might have all sorts of craziness in there.
00:09:00.406 - 00:09:17.802, Speaker B: We might be doing order flow, we might be selling it to whoever and of course you have to take my word on this but we're doing very little. We're really just trying to take your transactions and propagate them out as best as we possibly can. And at the scale that we are, that is actually quite a huge challenge.
00:09:17.802 - 00:09:54.202, Speaker B: And so we spend all our time really just trying to provide the best quality of service to users that we can and we're not always perfect at that, of course. As one interesting tidbit you might imagine that the amount of transactions that receive is maybe somewhere on the scale that go through Ethereum, right? Obviously there's going to be more because there's ones that the gas price are too low, et cetera, et cetera. But in reality we get many orders of magnitude more transactions than that and so just dealing with that is an enormous challenge and we're in a very precarious position in that we have all this data.
00:09:54.202 - 00:10:12.480, Speaker B: We want to be responsible with it. We don't want to do anything to hurt the network, to hurt our users and so we move slowly in that regard. So we're hesitant to make any big changes to how we handle things to start sending transactions through some other mechanism than what we currently do which is just through the PDP network right now.
00:10:13.810 - 00:10:45.530, Speaker A: So one of the things, Ayal, that you brought up right, the advantage of a block builder is the speed at which it receives information. So searchers today and block builders in the future would obviously be willing to pay a lot to get access to this aggregated set of transactions as quickly as possible. This is a question for the whole panel I want to hear what are your thoughts on what the future holds for Ethereum with regards to things like payment for order flow or exclusive order flow and how that could evolve?
00:10:48.350 - 00:11:21.526, Speaker D: Well, that's a big topic. I think there is a massive interest from the industry to introduce solutions that would allow to monetize transaction flow to start playing very competitive game between the players. So if we hear now that infuria's role now is to really look at the network as the health of the network, not interfering with it, I think there is a lot of appetite to change it in the future.
00:11:21.526 - 00:12:17.106, Speaker D: And at the same time from the core development perspective there is a push to prevent it as much as possible. Right, so we can think of the split between nowadays world of mostly public mempools and all the path towards the private mempools which if we compare here the builders and potentially create the ways of creating advantage as a builder, then whether it's a private order flow or payment for order flow, this properly enables the builder centralization. So I think that the dynamic of the fight for public mempole, accessible mempole and the private order flow, payment for order flow will be an interesting game to look at and whether we'll be approaching it from the perspective of just economic models or maybe some cryptographic models.
00:12:17.106 - 00:12:35.322, Speaker D: So introducing properly private encrypted transactions. I think if you've listened to Justin Drake earlier today, these are some solutions towards that. And yeah, probably the next two, three years we'll be showing how that grows.
00:12:35.466 - 00:12:44.660, Speaker A: Is the future of exclusive order flow and payment for order flow a good one? Is it a bad one? Is it somewhere in between? How do we assess this?
00:12:46.470 - 00:13:38.100, Speaker D: Yeah, it's myself, I'm in the interesting place of just constantly looking at those two different paths and I'm wondering if I look at them from the perspective of this market payment for order flow markets creation, but also from the perspective of the core development, is it good or bad? It might be unavoidable, it might be something very natural and saying that this is what the open market of transactions is. But if there is some very neat solution that is protecting everyone against this isolation separation of transaction pools into multiple containers, that would be great to introduce. It probably the challenges on the cryptography research that would be better.
00:13:38.100 - 00:13:50.520, Speaker D: If the solutions are not neat and are just creating a very bad user experience, then probably we want it to continue for a while to see how it plays by itself.
00:13:52.010 - 00:14:07.514, Speaker A: Yeah, similar question around payment for order flow, exclusive order flow, maybe even preferential access. Maybe it's not about having exclusivity, it's just about getting the transactions a few milliseconds before your competition. How do you think about this?
00:14:07.632 - 00:14:13.280, Speaker C: Okay. And that's my personal view. First of all, I don't think it's bad.
00:14:13.280 - 00:14:42.134, Speaker C: It's not bad in a sense that we must prevent it okay. I can see use cases where it's good for example, if this benefits the user. So if it's for example, when a user submit a transaction, that's an option that the user can pick and the user will say I don't mind sending it to a specific few builders, giving them a few millisecond difference if they are going to pay me back.
00:14:42.134 - 00:14:56.138, Speaker C: This is not a bad thing for the user. So I don't think that we want to treat it as something that we must find a solution and completely avoid. That's the first thing.
00:14:56.138 - 00:15:52.438, Speaker C: Second thing is I view that as an infrastructure issue, okay? So it's kind of like at least some builder might pay and maybe blocks out will have some solution around. It might pay for a faster network to get some of the transaction and that's going to be a decision that the builder as the user can make a decision if they want to upgrade their network and get transaction faster or they want to use the peer to peer and get it slower. The most important thing is that we are not delivering some transaction just to a few builder because they are paying for the service but everyone are getting the transaction if somebody wants to pay to get them faster.
00:15:52.438 - 00:15:59.470, Speaker C: That's kind of like why am I running with SSD and not without Is? Because I want to pay a little bit more and get faster performance.
00:16:01.330 - 00:16:05.114, Speaker A: Do you have any thoughts on payment for overflow?
00:16:05.162 - 00:16:17.538, Speaker B: So I'm far from qualified to really have an opinion on this matter. I really come from a web two infrastructure world and I do a lot of that in fura. So to be honest, today for me has been learning about mev and all these things.
00:16:17.538 - 00:16:28.166, Speaker B: So I don't have an opinion. But what I like is that this conversation is happening. I mean these are things that exist just kind of by default in TradFi and people just kind of accepted them.
00:16:28.166 - 00:16:52.000, Speaker B: But it's coming to the conversation with situations like Robinhood and you have more people trading and then it's found out that oh, how does Robinhood make their money with zero commission trades? It's because they sell your order flow off to people, right? And so now people are starting to think about it and like well maybe maybe we don't like that, maybe we should come up with alternatives and I think this space just has a lot more interest in conversation and reevaluating what we should do, which I like.
00:16:53.250 - 00:17:28.550, Speaker A: So there's this idea or this concept of decentralized block building. So we could be in a future in which a lot of the block building, a lot of transaction aggregation, the exploration and searching of mev and the block construction happens in an integrated, sort of vertically integrated manner. And then an idea in which maybe there's a way to decentralize that avoid a future in which a single entity is doing this entire pipeline and say it's an ecosystem of entities who are doing this entire pipeline.
00:17:28.550 - 00:17:54.980, Speaker A: So my question is, if we believe that the future will be brighter under a decentralized block building future, what are the properties of the platform, or what are the properties of the system? Maybe you could say the market structure, what are the characteristics that it needs to have to succeed? I'll let anyone pick up on that.
00:17:55.690 - 00:18:32.894, Speaker D: Okay. I think we should keep thinking about the security of the network, and not only from the decentralization perspective, also the fact that you have to end up paying proper rewards to validators miners for not so long more, but validators, for sure. So there are many other risks of what will happen, really, with the borrowing yields versus securing the system yields, and whether we'll build the tools to protect us against it.
00:18:32.894 - 00:19:10.606, Speaker D: And the same thing will be with the block building. So if all those dynamics will lead to the insecure system, then we have to act very quickly, we have to predict it, we have to plan it and use whatever tools we can. What are properties really, for block building? I think we want to democratize it, right? So if we think that there is some value that should always be that will always be extractable, right? Like so simply, unavoidable arbitrage, so misalignments of decentralized exchanges, the positions to be liquidated and so on.
00:19:10.606 - 00:19:39.080, Speaker D: So all of those natural functions of arbitragers, of mev extractors that are actually desired by the market, should be executed as fast as possible. You don't want to wait with liquidation for two blocks just because you introduce some mechanisms that democratize it. Liquidators want to execute fast, and the protocols want liquidators to act as fast as possible because their protocols are at risk, if not liquidated quickly.
00:19:39.080 - 00:20:15.490, Speaker D: So you have to have mechanisms that satisfy those requirements. And by democratization, I mean that anyone should be able, without too much of the capital allocation, to build a builder, relatively efficient builder, that will enable that extraction. Decentralized in what way? Probably, again, through privacy, maybe some solutions using in the very distant future, the fully homomorphic encryption, maybe in the short term, some hardware solutions, like trusted execution environments.
00:20:18.230 - 00:20:26.994, Speaker C: Yeah, I can continue. So I agree. I think the capitalization is key, okay, to make it success.
00:20:26.994 - 00:20:58.746, Speaker C: We don't want to end up with five builders, we want to have thousands, we want to have 100. If we are going to end up with thousands and hundred, we want to make sure that, as I said earlier, the simulation, the process of building, proposing building the block, is something that thousands or hundreds of builders can do. And the network, I fear, is going to become a Balneg.
00:20:58.746 - 00:21:19.590, Speaker C: Okay? We landed in Ethereum, we're seeing it in Polygon with hundreds of validator and block propagation started to become a problem. We're seeing it in BSc. That's a huge mess.
00:21:19.590 - 00:21:43.294, Speaker C: The network and if the network will become a problem. Guaranteed there are not going to be hundreds of block. So we need to make sure that the infrastructure supports scaling in the block builder and that is going to allow us to get to where we want to be.
00:21:43.294 - 00:22:08.280, Speaker C: The good thing is, I think after the merge, we're not going to be in a stage where we have hundreds of builders, so we can approach it in two stages. The first stage is let's just roll it out, learn what is broken and fix it quickly. And I think that will allow us to get to where we want to be.
00:22:10.090 - 00:22:49.060, Speaker A: I have personally two questions with regards to decentralized block building, which are at the top of my mind, and they're the ones that keep me up at night. One of them is how latency sensitive is the system? Is it feasible to believe that there will be network communication in between the actors in this pipeline, in this transaction supply chain? Or is the system so latency sensitive that the only way to go about it is to colocate every single role next to each other in the same server rack? So I want to talk a bit about latency sensitivity in these systems and the direction that we see things going.
00:22:49.830 - 00:23:03.926, Speaker B: Yes, I could say something on this. I think in general, and with the previous question too, a lot of it comes down to the user experience and also educating the user. So there's always a lot of focus in crypto at the protocols and sort of the Web Three side.
00:23:03.926 - 00:23:17.382, Speaker B: But if you send a transaction, your choices are send it to inferior IO, run your own node, send it to that directly, and then it gets gossiped by the peer to peer network or those are basically your only choices.
00:23:17.526 - 00:23:19.980, Speaker A: Flashboss protect RPC, right?
00:23:21.950 - 00:23:29.598, Speaker B: Exactly. It still is an endpoint and you have to provide the user with a good experience to use that endpoint. And so you called out the MetaMask issue.
00:23:29.598 - 00:23:49.526, Speaker B: And so I believe in MetaMask it is possible to set a custom RPC endpoint, but it's not a clear UX, it's not using the main network like you would expect. And so we need to improve those user experiences so users have the options and the knowledge of how their transactions are going to be routed. And we also have to do things at the boring Web Two layer to make things work better.
00:23:49.526 - 00:24:05.350, Speaker B: We can't necessarily rely on a peer to peer network which has indeterministic behavior to propagate out your transaction. To off the block builders. Responsibly we maybe need to give the user in where they first interact with the network, which is at the client.
00:24:05.350 - 00:24:26.420, Speaker B: The ability to send a direction directly over the web. Two mechanisms that we know work and are secure HTPs to multiple block builders that satisfy their latency requirements, their privacy requirements, et cetera. So I think some of these things are simpler to solve and really just come down to user experience and design in that level.
00:24:27.750 - 00:25:07.838, Speaker A: Maybe a final question as we're running out of time. The other question I have about decentralized block building is will there only be five block builders or will there be hundreds or will there be thousands? And a big question for that in my mind is would it be feasible to just run an open source version of a block builder and remain competitive with all of the other block builders? I think as an infrastructure provider, you guys have put a lot of time and investment into scaling your system to deal with just like the sheer load. And you sort of mentioned this a bit.
00:25:07.838 - 00:25:31.910, Speaker A: I think block builders will have to figure out this immense amount of transaction throughput and how to deal with it. Is there a way to build this highly scalable infrastructure in a way that is open source and in a way that many, many different actors can run? Or is that like a fundamental constraint on block building that will lead to centralization?
00:25:33.850 - 00:25:47.690, Speaker B: Well, okay, so ignoring maybe the details of block building and assuming that to run a block builder, it's going to be similar to running an ethereum node and having to scale that, I think it's really hard. I think that's why we exist. I think that's why we're successful.
00:25:47.690 - 00:26:17.042, Speaker B: That said, we've always been thinking about how to decentralize the infira experience of being able to run your own RPC in a way that is easy, that can scale well. We are working very hard still on that idea, and I think that will come into block building and just this whole ecosystem in general. I think that a lot of the nodes where you actually have to interact with them are just not designed with that true intent of making them easy for many people to run.
00:26:17.042 - 00:26:24.530, Speaker B: And so we're trying to figure out how to do that. We hope we can figure it out. We hope that results in tens of thousands of block producers, as you said, block builders.
00:26:24.530 - 00:26:25.800, Speaker B: But we'll see.
00:26:28.670 - 00:26:59.758, Speaker D: Yeah, if I think about the most probable scenario, there are multiple hints that would point at maybe a few block builders. So rather five. If you are saying, is it five or ten or 100? And also like coming back to payment for order flow, while we say that maybe it might be undesired, again, there are many hints that suggest that this is also unavoidable path until we find some very powerful solutions.
00:26:59.758 - 00:28:06.850, Speaker D: So again, this would strengthen this impression that there'll be just a handful of block builders. But now if we say that we have this very desired property of Democratized extraction of mev, then the question is among those five builders, will it be a builder that will be playing for a specific actor? And all the extraction will be for that actor? Or the builder will be actually representing multiple users, and the access to the builder block creation will be somehow democratized through the systems like Flashbots, relay and so on. And again, will there be some solution like mevsgx? Will mev boost support it enough through the Flashbot system to make sure that we won't be really too worried that there's just five builders? Even Vitalik's paper The End Game talks about just a handful of builders and then really tries to address it in the future like this, can we really create a system that is still satisfactory for everyone? And there we go a bit further.
00:28:06.850 - 00:28:31.840, Speaker D: It's not only one chain, it's possibly a block builder that really looks at multidomain mev extraction. And you can already imagine the complexity of the system grows. Right, so the builder doesn't build only one block, but really looks at multiple chains together and requires to have a very good understanding of the market, very good access to all the transactions that possibly are spanning across multiple bridges, domains and so on.
00:28:31.840 - 00:28:41.618, Speaker D: Possibly worth to read all the research materials from Flashbots on multidomain to get better understanding of this as well.
00:28:41.784 - 00:28:47.750, Speaker A: All right, so we're out of time. Thank you so much to the panelists. Give a nice round of applause.
00:28:47.750 - 00:29:05.160, Speaker A: Yeah, just parting word for the audience. I think block building is just at the cusp and it's like a new entrant into the space. I expect it's something that we'll hear a lot more about and talk more about in the future.
00:29:05.160 - 00:29:13.690, Speaker A: So if you're interested in some of the topics that we discussed here, there's so many open questions, so thank you all for attending.
00:29:13.850 - 00:29:14.540, Speaker D: Thank you so much.
