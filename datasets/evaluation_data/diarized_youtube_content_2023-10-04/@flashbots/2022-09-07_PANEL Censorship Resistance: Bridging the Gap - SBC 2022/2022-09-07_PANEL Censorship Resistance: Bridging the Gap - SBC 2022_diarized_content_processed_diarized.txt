00:00:00.250 - 00:00:18.026, Speaker A: Welcome to the censorship resistance panel. We can start with some brief formalities of, like, a quick intro of everyone. And what are you working on these days, and how do you think about censorship resistance in your daily life, maybe starting from that side of the panel?
00:00:18.138 - 00:00:34.178, Speaker B: Hi. I'm Zucky. I've been working on proof of stake technologies and tendermint, and tender comes up a lot in censorship resistance because it's a toolkit for building sort of BFT systems.
00:00:34.178 - 00:01:08.654, Speaker B: And so if you want to do mempool encryption, you can build, like, a threshold decryption gadget on top of tendermint and the tendermint core dev team, of which I am sort of in part of. We have this thing called the tendermint council now is working on new features for tendermint to make this stuff easier. We are also redoing atom tokenomics and including a lot of mev in that we have sort of been building out Cosmos as like an mev battleground lately in general and we have been worrying a lot about the censorship resistance problem in the Cosmos ecosystem.
00:01:08.654 - 00:01:20.790, Speaker B: In addition to talking to people in Flashbots and Shutter who is also using tendermint for EVM and ETH like censorship resistance stuff. So this is just kind of like where I exist in the ecosystem.
00:01:21.530 - 00:01:22.038, Speaker C: Hi.
00:01:22.124 - 00:01:40.220, Speaker D: I'm Francesco. I work in the ethereum foundation research. At the moment, I'm not really focusing so much on censorship resistance, though I did at some point last year, but I'm mostly working on fork choice, which, I mean, in some sense, it's really related to censorship resistance, but at the moment, that's not really my focus.
00:01:42.450 - 00:01:52.074, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. I'm phil. I am a PhD student at cornell and co founder of flashbots, and I work on mev and censorship resistance.
00:01:52.074 - 00:02:04.770, Speaker A: Xmev is hopefully a spicy thing as we'll explore in this panel. So mostly concerned about decentralizing effects of mev and the resulting effects on the rest of the network.
00:02:05.210 - 00:02:15.830, Speaker E: I'm vitalik from the ethereum project, so I've also done some work on censorship resistance in the context of the ethereum protocol and the application layer.
00:02:16.650 - 00:02:43.182, Speaker C: Yeah, justin from the ethereum foundation. I've been deep diving censorship resistance in the last few weeks and basically came out extremely optimistic. Usually when I do research, I notice this FUD curve where for a long time, people just ignore a topic and then suddenly, suddenly very important, and it requires a lot of our attention.
00:02:43.182 - 00:02:59.110, Speaker C: And I think maybe a few days ago was peak FUD, and now I'm optimistic that we have very good long term fundamentals, and just through education, we can just bring this curve down to the fundamentals.
00:03:00.570 - 00:03:18.700, Speaker A: All right, amazing. So we can ask a bunch of more boring questions, which maybe we'll get to later if we run out of steam, but maybe let's start with a spicy one. So do we want full censorship resistance in the systems we're building? And if so, in your opinion why or why not?
00:03:22.110 - 00:03:23.580, Speaker C: Yes, we do.
00:03:27.230 - 00:03:28.090, Speaker E: Whoo.
00:03:30.930 - 00:03:54.418, Speaker C: And I guess the reason is that if we don't, then we'd be under some sort of influence of a sensor. And then the question is, who would the sensor be? And it turns out that because weak censorship is solved with pure technology, we only need to focus on strong censorship. And strong censorship effectively is these 51% attacks.
00:03:54.418 - 00:04:20.720, Speaker C: And then we need to ask ourselves, who can even pull off these 51% attacks? Who can even do the censorship? And it turns out that it is effectively just only nation states. Okay, maybe Elon Musk can pull it off, but let's say it's nation states or Elon Musk, then we basically become Elon chain or we become US chain or we become China chain or EU chain. And this is not what we want to be.
00:04:20.720 - 00:04:50.410, Speaker C: We lose a lot of properties, like we lose permissionlessness, right, because now we need to ask the US permission or ask Elon his permission. We also lose World War Three resistance, right, because the fact that we're being censored is the fact that we're being permanently being 51% attacked. And so if Walt Three were to break, then the 51% attacker could do things, all sorts of other things other than censorship.
00:04:50.410 - 00:05:03.498, Speaker C: And we also lose credible neutrality. We lose the ability to gain monetary premium because now Ether, the asset becomes like US. Efer.
00:05:03.498 - 00:05:16.130, Speaker C: And we want to be building this global settlement layer for the whole internet of value, not just US. Efer. So I guess the answer is, yeah, we definitely do want strong censorship resistance.
00:05:17.190 - 00:05:51.674, Speaker B: So I guess my take would be it's not important or it's not essential that all parts of the system be censorship resistant. So in the sort of MultiChain interchain world, you can have chains that perhaps are not censorship resistant but are still useful, and you can have the USA censored roll up, like the OFAC compliant roll up. But for ethereum to fulfill its vision, ethereum's base layer must be censorship resistance in sort of the cosmos world.
00:05:51.674 - 00:06:01.120, Speaker B: I think a lot about how we can have some chains that are strongly censorship resistant and other chains that are not, and they can interoperate and we can accommodate that world.
00:06:02.130 - 00:07:00.702, Speaker E: Yeah, I think my take is similar, and not every application on the application layer should be infinitely censorship resistant. And I think there are some cases where the thing that sort of the professional blabbers call regulation at the edges actually can work and actually can be incentive compatible, right? Like, if someone does come up with a way to make some tornado cash like thing that excludes billion dollar hackers, then regular people have a greater interest in using it because they don't want to be mistaken for the billion dollar hacker, right? I think people even underestimate the extent to which that sort of stuff can happen. But the reason why it's just absolutely important to have a red line for the core protocol to be censorship resistant is because that is the ability for transactions to get included just as a core property of the protocol, its core to its credible neutrality.
00:07:00.702 - 00:07:24.780, Speaker E: And the entire function of the blockchain I think is to kind of be a shared base layer between people who do not agree on a lot of what those other ground rulers are. And so in order for that to even work at all, the technological and the social core of the base layer needs to be fairly simple.
00:07:25.950 - 00:07:40.954, Speaker D: I think I'm going to be saying this a lot, but I don't think I have much to add at this point after all of these good comments. But yeah, of course I agree with this. I think the whole point of the ethereum based layer and applications can have their own requirements.
00:07:40.954 - 00:07:46.900, Speaker D: They can be or not censorship resistance, but the ethereum based layer should be and that's the whole point of what we're building.
00:07:48.870 - 00:08:04.520, Speaker A: So I'm hearing a lot about neutrality and the effect of censorship on neutrality, which I think is a good point. What does mev have to do with all of this? Since this is the mev workshop, obviously I have my own opinion on this.
00:08:06.570 - 00:08:43.794, Speaker E: Well, mev is like one of those things that's neutral in theory and not neutral in practice, right? It's like neutral in theory because, well, anyone can go and collect mev, it's just a bunch of algorithms and you can go do it. But in practice there's economies of scale which often lead to the outcome that whoever happens to be the larger mev collector at a particular time could easily become even more entrenched over time. There's latency issues which mean that people in particular locations have better access to mev than others.
00:08:43.794 - 00:09:17.550, Speaker E: And just to this long list of reasons why mev, just like anything with economies of scale, is not a very level playing field. And so the neutrality of not just the kind of formally the ethereum protocol itself, but also the kind of core critical ecosystem around the base layer is something like preserving that does I think, require kind of taming the mev issue to some extent.
00:09:18.690 - 00:10:00.834, Speaker B: Okay, so I'll try and break down the idea a little bit more. So what does mev have to do with this? So in the proof of work world, we observed economies of scale, right? There was an economy of scale to cheap energy access and so block production did end up being sort of oligopolized, but that didn't seem so like that's been basically the state of play in blockchain since 2013, but it didn't seem to undermine censorship resistance. But now we're in this long transition to proof of stake and at the same time as we've transitioned to proof of stake, financial applications that are natively hosted on blockchains have become sort of much more widely, much more mature, widely adopted monetized.
00:10:00.834 - 00:10:28.730, Speaker B: And so the sequencing is monetizable. And then the other thing we observe in conventional financial world is that institutionalization of information advantage, institutionalization of edge, can persist for decades. That you have hedge funds like Jane Street and the Jane Streets, the jumps, the renaissances of the world that have been just better at the markets than competing institutions for essentially two generations.
00:10:28.730 - 00:11:00.560, Speaker B: So then you can imagine that in this world where you have proof of stake and you have these auctions for block, you have sort of a marketplace for block production, that you could end up in a world where you have institutions that persistently are the best block producer or a small oligopoly of the best block producers, and then you run into this question of, okay, what is the censorship resistance of this system? And does it behave differently from the economies of scale that we observed, like sort of post 2013 approval work?
00:11:01.730 - 00:11:26.338, Speaker C: I guess my take is that blockchains give us these amazing properties of credible neural clarity and whatnot, because they kind of smooth out the whole world. They kind of integrate over the whole world. But in order to get there, when you really zoom in, there's this very local process of block building where you're literally giving one guy monopoly power over this one block.
00:11:26.338 - 00:11:46.394, Speaker C: And this one guy is not going to be smoothed over the whole world. He's going to be in a very specific jurisdiction with very specific ideals or thoughts. And so now suddenly you're losing credible neutrality because you're zooming in on this one person, and this one person can work with specific builders and whatnot.
00:11:46.394 - 00:12:04.980, Speaker C: And so I think part of the solution space is to try and smooth things out and remove this monopoly power that the proposal has. And that's one example of literally mev smoothing, where you involve the testers and you remove the monopoly power that this one proposal has.
00:12:10.910 - 00:12:26.670, Speaker A: You have something to add, Francesco? I can see it. So we touched on a few things there that maybe might be worth zooming into. One was the status quo and proof of work and the transition to proof of stake, which is right around the corner.
00:12:26.670 - 00:12:57.880, Speaker A: What do you think? I have two questions. Maybe answer them together. What do you think in your heuristic? Or how would you compare the quote unquote, censorship resistance? Or how would you quantify, I guess, of, let's say, ETH proof of work versus ETH proof of stake? What are the differences there and how are they relevant? And also of, let's say, Bitcoin versus Ethpow, are there any differences there, or is it kind of the same story?
00:13:00.510 - 00:13:19.870, Speaker C: So I think one improvement of proof of stake is that we've dramatically reduced the barrier for self building. Like, if you're a miner, it's extremely risky to be solar mining. And so with proof of stake, we've now opened up the ability to be self building.
00:13:19.870 - 00:13:33.426, Speaker C: And so in this kind of situation where, let's say, the top mining pools have all collectively decided that they're going to censor, it's much harder to exit, whereas in Proof of Stake we have.
00:13:33.448 - 00:14:01.706, Speaker E: The same, at least in the bitcoin world, there are mining protocols, right? Like I think Stratum does this where the individual miner chooses the template and then they right. But I think on the other side it's important to stress that there isn't anything inherently about Proof of stake that's more sensory. And I think this is something that a lot of people miss because the scare about censoring just happens to be happening at the same time as the merge narrative.
00:14:01.706 - 00:14:25.602, Speaker E: But there is one major ethereum pool at least that has censoring some transactions already. And I don't know whether or not that's happening in the bitcoin world. Well, the problem is that just because of internal political dynamics, anyone who's doing it has an incentive to do it as quietly as possible.
00:14:25.602 - 00:14:33.126, Speaker E: And so this is the sort of thing that needs to be kind of more actively whistleblown on and on that.
00:14:33.148 - 00:14:58.190, Speaker C: Point of doing things quietly. Right now these gas markets are very opaque and in a way mefgap is a reflection of that. There's a few pools that are running and we don't have much visibility, but I think with Proof of Stake now suddenly untrusted, solo validators will have the same visibility as these really powerful pools and I think that's shedding a lot of light on the stock forest.
00:14:59.810 - 00:15:26.022, Speaker D: I think one aspect maybe I don't know how important it is, is that in maybe bitcoin it's easier to recall kind of a yield from censorship if you're in a situation where the set of mining proofs that you have the hash power is kind of as decided, a majority of the hash power is decided to censor. It's something that can happen kind of naturally. Provost yes, it can happen, but also maybe it's a much slower process, but this is maybe it's a parameter in the system.
00:15:26.022 - 00:15:39.914, Speaker D: And also I'm not sure how realistic it is to think that a situation of adversarial majority in hash rate can just be resolved by people starting all of a sudden to increase positive hash rate.
00:15:39.952 - 00:15:40.742, Speaker B: In this sense.
00:15:40.896 - 00:16:15.666, Speaker D: Maybe another aspect is that mining pools don't have the same aren't different entities from a lot of the entities that we have as being big staking pools. In proof of stake. Centralized exchanges have this role that is very I mean, they have lots of other services and lots of I think the centralizing pressures are a bit stronger in proof of stake due to the existence of centralized exchanges and the fact that they are kind of facilitating and extracting me key so maybe this is another aspect.
00:16:15.666 - 00:16:44.026, Speaker D: It might be that it's like a faster path to centralization in that sense. But we also I think one really key advantage that we have in Proof of Stake is that I think we can really reduce the problem of fighting censorship to just secure it. Essentially we can make sure that the only way to censor is for the fourth choice to be censored censorship.
00:16:44.026 - 00:16:58.654, Speaker D: Essentially what Justin was talking about. We can utilize the fact that we have all of this kind of long tail of validators to make sure that if you really want to censor, you have to kind of go all out, and maybe that's something that's easier to react to, even in terms of social.
00:16:58.712 - 00:17:00.120, Speaker B: Coordination and so on.
00:17:00.490 - 00:17:07.720, Speaker C: And even when there's this strong censorship, proof of stake has this recovery process where we can do social slashing, which proof of work does not.
00:17:08.730 - 00:17:11.426, Speaker A: Well, you could change the power, I guess would be the rough equivalent.
00:17:11.458 - 00:17:16.186, Speaker E: Right, right. But that kills the good guys and that you can only do it once.
00:17:16.288 - 00:17:25.454, Speaker C: So, yeah, imagine the body with a cancer option one, you remove the cancer. Option two, you kill the body. Changing the proof of work is like killing the body.
00:17:25.652 - 00:17:31.726, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, we have an audience question, which I want to get to, so yeah, go ahead.
00:17:31.908 - 00:17:50.230, Speaker F: I'll try to make it spicy. The strongest form of censorship resistance is first in, first out ordering. You're not only guaranteeing that the transaction enters the system, you are guaranteeing that the transaction enters the system in the order that it was actually received.
00:17:50.230 - 00:17:54.790, Speaker F: We need first in, first out ordering. Agree or disagree?
00:17:57.210 - 00:18:13.040, Speaker E: I think I'll probably challenge that directly. I think a transaction getting included in 20 seconds instead of 1 second is like more than ten times, possibly more than 100 times smaller a deal than a transaction getting included in 20 seconds instead of 20 days.
00:18:15.170 - 00:19:01.790, Speaker B: So all I will say is that first in, first out ordering trades sort of bidding preference, like auction preference for time preference, so you can invest in capital to always be first. Zcash is like a perfect example of zcash has been dealing with this in practice, which is just like spamming the shielded pool and congesting the network and not allowing sort of real transactions to get in, taking advantage of opaque ordering. So I think that not being able to bid to get your transaction in in the time and window that you want is actually worse for censorship resistance.
00:19:03.330 - 00:19:21.154, Speaker D: I would disagree that we need to do that, because for me, it seems like once you've protected users, you make sure maybe with encryption or other ways that data transactions cannot be abused. Maybe we can remove sandwiches. Such things I don't really see the benefit of.
00:19:21.154 - 00:19:51.500, Speaker D: It seems like auctioning the first part of a block and getting some value out of that is preferable, at least for these kind of liquidations arbitrage, these things that are not really harming anyone. And other than that, I guess I'm happy to be convinced otherwise, but I haven't really ever understood how first in, first out, it's supposed to work in a permissionless network, like in the underlying PTP. Being permissionless seems like really problematic in trying to do any such system.
00:19:54.510 - 00:20:10.580, Speaker F: Just a minor follow up. What is the timescale at which censorship resistance is meaningful? Is it seven days? Is it 20 seconds? Is it 1 hour? What should we aim for? Because this also impacts performance, for example, for optimistic roll ups and all other kinds of things.
00:20:12.150 - 00:20:32.360, Speaker C: Well, I think what we should be aiming for is that you have the guarantee with 80% chance that your transaction will get included in the next lock. And where does the 20% chance that it doesn't get included come in? Is that if the block is full because there's a spike of demand, that's what we should be aiming for. And I believe this is where we can get.
00:20:35.080 - 00:20:46.232, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I'll pop back to the first question, because I think it's fun. By the way, I packed this panel full of first in, first out minimalists, and no one told you, so sorry about that. Whoops.
00:20:46.232 - 00:20:51.304, Speaker A: Just kidding. Just kidding. But I think I broadly agree with a lot of the panelists.
00:20:51.304 - 00:21:17.748, Speaker A: I think if you think about the broader economy, even transactions that some validators might want to censor may expose mev, which actually makes them more attractive for other validators to include. And I think there's two types of pressure we can exert on censorship. One is, like, altruistic participants who just don't like censoring, like pushing back on anyone who's censoring, which is things we've seen, like the inclusionless idea and things like that.
00:21:17.748 - 00:21:30.840, Speaker A: And another one is like economic pressure, which is kind of what Justin was speaking to in his talk of, like, you'll be less profitable if you can't touch all these states. And things like that is like an incentive not to censor. So maybe that's an alternative.
00:21:30.840 - 00:21:39.148, Speaker A: I actually don't know. To the question of we want first in, first out or not, I think that's an open problem. I think it's interesting.
00:21:39.148 - 00:22:00.668, Speaker A: I think we don't exactly we're writing a post on this in Flashbot's research about the trade offs. I'd say with Mev auctions, but I think more experimentation is good for the world, and we're very early in these systems, and we don't really know what works really well. I would say if we do want to deploy a bunch of things we should think about very carefully.
00:22:00.668 - 00:22:25.820, Speaker A: What metrics do we want to optimize for, and how do we actually prove that X is better than Y so it doesn't become some sort of weird religious war? That would be like, the worst case scenario, which is kind of TradFi today. It's like, is HFT making the market more efficient, or is it like a parasite that's like sucking the blood of America? Both of these beliefs exist, at least in people I talk to. More audience questions.
00:22:25.820 - 00:22:26.510, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:22:27.120 - 00:22:29.708, Speaker G: I don't think this is a very spicy one, though.
00:22:29.874 - 00:22:30.684, Speaker A: It's okay.
00:22:30.802 - 00:23:09.784, Speaker G: My question is around how ready some of these solutions are, like the Encrypted mempool MEB smoothing transaction inclusion list, because the merge is like happening in a couple of weeks time and I think the best solutions that are going to be working and up and ready for the merge are things like relay monitors. But I haven't really heard much about monitoring tools for monitoring block builder centralization. I'm wondering if there's any of the solutions discussed today that you guys think are more ready for implementation by Shanghai or even earlier than others.
00:23:09.784 - 00:23:17.964, Speaker G: And if not, if there's community tools that you'd like to see built for the merge to address this problem of.
00:23:18.002 - 00:23:25.790, Speaker E: Block builder centralization, I'd say transaction inclusion lists are like by far the most short term viable one.
00:23:26.580 - 00:23:35.170, Speaker A: I would agree. I think transaction inclusion lists are like potentially even on the order of hours of engineering time away if we really need them.
00:23:35.540 - 00:23:39.330, Speaker G: Oh really? How easy is that?
00:23:39.700 - 00:23:42.124, Speaker A: Have you read my proposal? You haven't even read my proposal.
00:23:42.172 - 00:23:45.744, Speaker C: Oh, maybe off chain, but on chain everything takes at least six months on chain.
00:23:45.792 - 00:24:03.480, Speaker A: Yeah. So we don't need an on chain patch for I'd say enough transaction inclusion list to handle what will probably happen at the merge would be my rough estimate of the status quo of research today. Yes, things that are on chain and in consensus are probably at least six months away from the merge, if not more.
00:24:03.480 - 00:24:18.270, Speaker A: So we should think about it. But yeah, there need to be stop gaps. Also there is a lot of conversation on the Mev Boost repo and probably other places like E Three search and things like that where people are looking at every possible kind of angle and thing to develop.
00:24:18.270 - 00:24:31.756, Speaker A: I think the community needs more resources with that obviously EF probably and we are all hands on deck for the merge so we're all doing our best and yes, we could use the help. I don't know.
00:24:31.878 - 00:24:50.136, Speaker D: Is that I think transaction pollution lists yeah. On chain also I'm not really sure what you would use them for if you don't have PBS. It seems to me at that point, if you're a Validator that wants to do this altruistic kind of using this list, you might as well do what just you're saying.
00:24:50.136 - 00:25:14.930, Speaker D: Like maybe just build your own blocks or try to just use a relay which is trying to provide you some guarantees of not censoring or something like this. Other than that, I think both maybe smoothing you mentioned that also is something that would come potentially with PBS and I think PBS is something that's very much not ready. It's not going to be there in six months.
00:25:14.930 - 00:25:17.488, Speaker D: That's going to take some time.
00:25:17.654 - 00:25:40.420, Speaker E: Yeah, I think there's interesting hybrid options that are even simpler than the Mev Boost inclusion list. You could just run a validator that checks whether or not it's aware of any transactions that pay enough of a priority fee and haven't been included for 1 minute. And if they have, then it flips a switch and goes to self building, and if they haven't, then it goes to mev boost.
00:25:40.420 - 00:25:44.876, Speaker E: So there's lots of fairly simple short term stuff that can be done, but.
00:25:44.898 - 00:25:47.304, Speaker A: That is the mev boost inclusion proposal.
00:25:47.352 - 00:25:51.164, Speaker E: I think basically I think I meant the Eigen layer one.
00:25:51.282 - 00:25:54.510, Speaker A: Okay, I see.
00:25:55.200 - 00:26:25.112, Speaker B: Another just other aspect of this is that censorship resistance is fundamentally a game of deterrence. The censor is basically going to threaten violence against some group of people to censor transactions. And the deterrence is that there is some other entity that has some meaningful countermeasure that will make that threat ineffective and make the threatener look stupid and look illegitimate and like an idiot, which censors seem to actually be very worried about.
00:26:25.112 - 00:26:36.510, Speaker B: This is like the game of a deterrence that we've been playing as long as blockchains have existed. And so the point of this conversation is like, oh, we do have credible deterrence in a post merge world.
00:26:39.830 - 00:26:40.482, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:26:40.616 - 00:26:41.298, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:26:41.384 - 00:26:49.800, Speaker A: Thank you. Next question from the audience. Maybe we'll go there and then there, and then I will throw some bombs because I'm ready to stir the pot a little bit.
00:26:49.800 - 00:27:30.260, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. So, kind of a clarification question based on the previous is what does first in, first out actually mean? Right. If we're going to even consider this as an option, isn't the ordering the thing that we're coming to consensus on? How can you define what it means for a transaction to be first if there's not, like, one mempool even to sort of consider that conceptually as an option? Doesn't that imply that there's some other consensus of what the stuff that we're about to come to consensus on?
00:27:32.150 - 00:27:37.730, Speaker E: What you your question is like equivalents to asking a panel of vegans, but what do you think about factory farming?
00:27:38.810 - 00:27:47.030, Speaker A: But I want to get Sri Rahman, and I would agree with Vitalik's assessment.
00:27:48.650 - 00:28:06.934, Speaker F: I thought the same, too. First and first ordering effectively means that a transaction that is received through the majority of the network actually gets included before another. If transaction one is received in a majority of the network before transaction two, then one should be ahead of two.
00:28:06.934 - 00:28:32.470, Speaker F: Roughly what it does is it gives you first and first oat ordering at the coarseness of network latency rather than giving ordering guarantees at the scale of block time. In addition to doing censorship resistance or other things, first and first out ordering also fundamentally changes the clock of the system. Instead of having timing resolution at block level, you have timing resolution at native network latency.
00:28:34.090 - 00:28:36.646, Speaker A: Wow. That's the best description I've ever heard.
00:28:36.828 - 00:28:56.826, Speaker D: Sorry, one quick point as well. You can actually parameterize the sort of granularity that you want first in, first out ordering at, so you can bucketize time to the granularity of fairness that you want. So if you want no fairness up to 1 second, so you have latency till that time, but you're not reordering across that time interval.
00:28:56.858 - 00:28:57.694, Speaker C: You can do that as well.
00:28:57.732 - 00:29:01.646, Speaker D: So you can have some notion of, like, fuzzy first and first out ordering as well.
00:29:01.668 - 00:29:06.434, Speaker C: If that's something that's more amenable just that's the point.
00:29:06.632 - 00:29:18.660, Speaker A: Amazing. So that is the definition, whether it's the right definition again, vegans or carnivores, your choice. Yeah, we need metrics, guys, please.
00:29:18.660 - 00:29:21.158, Speaker A: All right. Another audience question.
00:29:21.244 - 00:29:23.014, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll try a spicy one.
00:29:23.212 - 00:29:25.846, Speaker A: Do you see any mainstream system or.
00:29:25.868 - 00:29:31.660, Speaker E: Products that is doing a really good job in terms of censorship resistance? If not, why?
00:29:32.670 - 00:29:37.210, Speaker A: So who's doing a good job in terms of censorship, resistance, and crypto?
00:29:37.790 - 00:29:46.030, Speaker B: Swift is the classic example. Swift does not censor. They do not enforce sanctions at the Swift level.
00:29:46.030 - 00:30:05.730, Speaker B: And basically the entire global financial industry realized it would be very stupid to try and operate a global financial system where you tried to regulate in the Swift where you tried to enforce censorship in the Swift system. That's like the classic prior art for why blockchain should also be censorship resistant.
00:30:08.170 - 00:30:18.454, Speaker A: Didn't they just take a country out of Swift? We have some dissent, so go ahead.
00:30:18.492 - 00:30:21.210, Speaker E: I was just asking what was the question, because I didn't hear it.
00:30:21.360 - 00:30:27.418, Speaker A: The question was, is there a mainstream whether Swift censors or not?
00:30:27.584 - 00:30:38.670, Speaker B: Swift doesn't censor at the message level. This is true. I can show you the policy document from Swift.
00:30:38.670 - 00:30:40.880, Speaker B: The banks do.
00:30:41.970 - 00:30:51.380, Speaker A: All right, our first take it outside moments, guys. At least three more before the all right. Right.
00:30:51.380 - 00:31:07.346, Speaker A: Let's keep going. So, yeah, mainstream projects, swift, I think, is an interesting one. I think there is a game theory there because they don't censor necessarily at the message layer, but they also don't not enforce any peering or censorship requirements.
00:31:07.538 - 00:31:10.686, Speaker B: Get globally disconnected. Right. They can globally disconnect a bank.
00:31:10.738 - 00:31:12.300, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:31:14.830 - 00:31:17.260, Speaker B: Yes. At the bank level.
00:31:19.150 - 00:31:23.680, Speaker A: All right, any other projects? Mainstream censorship, resistance, good.
00:31:25.570 - 00:31:27.230, Speaker C: IP, TCP.
00:31:29.570 - 00:31:30.990, Speaker E: Voting in elections.
00:31:35.430 - 00:31:39.570, Speaker A: All very cool answers. Facebook ad auctions during elections.
00:31:43.590 - 00:31:44.610, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
00:31:44.760 - 00:31:48.210, Speaker A: All right, we'll go there and then tarun.
00:31:48.890 - 00:31:49.254, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:31:49.292 - 00:32:13.958, Speaker A: Sorry if this is kind of a basic question, but earlier in the panel, you were talking about a possible oligopoly of block producers. If you have a group like that and they're censoring some kind of transaction, the more of that kind of transaction accumulates in the mem pool, the more of an advantage a block producer outside of the group has. Because of 1559, they can include all those take those extra fees.
00:32:13.958 - 00:32:22.270, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm curious how much of a problem you see it as being and how long it's acceptable for a mem pool to be stuck or sorry, a transaction to be stuck.
00:32:23.650 - 00:32:40.434, Speaker C: Right. So going back to kind of the handicap that the centering builders have, as you said, it kind of grows over time as more and more centered transactions accumulate, and then suddenly the sum of all these transactions is just way much larger than the edge that these censoring builders could have. And so now.
00:32:40.434 - 00:33:13.200, Speaker C: A non centering builder comes in and they can overwhelm the censorship. And one of the really cool kind of observations is that if you're censoring, let's say, one E worth of transactions, then you're losing one E every single slot in terms of profit if you want to maintain the censorship. So if you want to censoring over, let's say, 1000 slots and you're willing to pay for it, and you're censoring one E worth of transaction fees, that's going to cost you 1000 E.
00:33:16.280 - 00:33:37.610, Speaker A: Well, 1000 ETH in, like, lost profits. Well, you can't actually make the 1000 ETH though, right? Like, you can only ever make the One ETH. I agree with you in the ideal, if, let's say, you're forced to include every transaction that pays, but if you have the discretion, then it seems like you really only lose the one E.
00:33:37.610 - 00:33:39.416, Speaker A: No.
00:33:39.438 - 00:34:01.964, Speaker C: So you lose 1000 E. And let's say that you're a really good builder that's censoring, and you have a one E edge versus the non censoring builders. So you should be able to capture one E every single block, but now you're losing that because the non censoring builders will be pushing up your bid.
00:34:02.092 - 00:34:14.532, Speaker A: Yeah, but even if you take it, then you can only beat the non censoring builder once with the One ETH boost, and then that's worth One ETH. Right. Anyway, we're bike shedding, so it doesn't really matter.
00:34:14.532 - 00:34:22.330, Speaker A: But I'm just trolling a little bit. I do think that is a good ideal of the system. I just don't know if I buy that we have that.
00:34:23.740 - 00:34:26.260, Speaker C: I think we do, but I'd be interested in your arguments.
00:34:26.340 - 00:34:30.970, Speaker A: Okay, maybe we do. I'm open to talking about it.
00:34:31.900 - 00:34:57.212, Speaker H: Tarun yeah, I mean, I'm also equally FIFO minimalist. I tend to also think that there's not really everything like Dalia or Shiram works on. They kind of forget a little bit about the information theory bounds of, like, what's the land hour limit for these things? There is some lower bound of information processing per second that is changed by doing fair ordering.
00:34:57.212 - 00:35:26.396, Speaker H: So my question is, what do you think the land hour limit sorry, land hour limit is the minimum amount of entropy you can extract from a single sort of qubit. And it's sort of the lower bound in information theory on sort of the amount of energy you have to have to do a single bit flip. So my question is, what is the equivalent for mev? Because it's clear there is something, right? It's either a temporal thing, it's either a unit of information per unit time, it's either a notion of fees per unit time.
00:35:26.396 - 00:35:32.220, Speaker H: What do you think that limit looks like and how close will we get to approaching it in practice?
00:35:32.720 - 00:35:46.544, Speaker A: So you're asking for how does the activation energy work in extracting a single unit of mev. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, I mean, I think this is one of the arguments and actually I have a blog post coming out that kind of will also directly address this.
00:35:46.544 - 00:36:20.984, Speaker A: I was hoping to pump it today, but maybe later next week. So this is like a question of can through fair ordering, maybe you also just increase the cost of, let's say, MEB extraction. If you think of it in traditional economics as like, okay, there's a cost to extract and like a profit from extracting can you maybe increase the cost such that there's less energy being extracted just because the process to activate it is more complex? And maybe if you have, let's say, a distributed ordering protocol with some honesty mixed in, you can maybe achieve something like this just through the pressure of honesty.
00:36:20.984 - 00:36:32.496, Speaker A: Maybe this also interfaces with censorship resistance in some ways. I think my opinion is you also want to energize this unit right. For the system.
00:36:32.496 - 00:36:53.350, Speaker A: It's not good to have latent energy over time. That's just not actualized for the cost. So I think you actually want to make this as efficient as possible for the system itself to efficiently capture the mev and use it towards whatever economic goal it's intended for by the people who are creating it.
00:36:53.350 - 00:37:07.964, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think there is some argument to be made that maybe through honesty or other weird pressure valves, you can have it kind of sit there for longer. And I don't know if that's good or not. I think we both think it's not good, but I don't know.
00:37:07.964 - 00:37:09.420, Speaker A: Like, open question.
00:37:09.490 - 00:37:23.424, Speaker H: I just am sort of making this claim there's some limit that is being in sort of like time versus energy versus information process per unit, time versus fees collected per unit time.
00:37:23.462 - 00:37:23.904, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:24.022 - 00:37:43.450, Speaker H: And somehow we haven't really defined what the boundary surface is of that limit. I'm just curious, where do you think we're missing that? Are we not looking on the information axis very much? Are we not looking on the fee axis very much? I mean, clearly we have tried with fees a little bit, but.
00:37:53.910 - 00:38:02.306, Speaker B: There seems to be some correlation between if you have more than one venue where an asset is trading, it increases the amount of potentially extractable mev.
00:38:02.498 - 00:38:02.902, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:02.956 - 00:38:06.022, Speaker H: Well, more venues is just like more particles in a physical system.
00:38:06.076 - 00:38:06.246, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:06.268 - 00:38:10.326, Speaker H: There's a lower bound on entropy per unit system.
00:38:10.428 - 00:38:11.078, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:11.244 - 00:38:27.094, Speaker H: So I guess that's what I'm saying. Somehow we seem to be focusing on mev ignoring information process that's going on. We just focus on the temporal process, which misses like 90% of the reason I think the auctions succeed anyway.
00:38:27.232 - 00:38:29.550, Speaker A: So how do you think this impacts censorship?
00:38:30.770 - 00:38:52.390, Speaker H: I think the information if you understand what the lower bound of information is, then you can actually reason about what bounds on how much censorship resistance you can kind of possibly have in the system from a purely information theoretic standpoint, not from I forced everyone to kind of do FIFO by doing 50 rounds of communication.
00:38:53.050 - 00:39:32.814, Speaker A: I think fees over time is like a relevant thing. There's also some expertise, like some human metric, right, of, like, you have this state space, and to efficiently process all these things together, you need some smart heuristic to search it, because there's no real fully mechanized way to do it. So there's like, fees, time, expertise, maybe are some dimensions, like nonexhaustive? I haven't really fully thought about it, but I guess the corollary to censorship resistance here to bring it back for people is, like, maybe the way to achieve censorship resistance has to be inherently creating more of this free energy that is censored by some subset of the network.
00:39:32.814 - 00:39:43.960, Speaker A: So starting economies that are actually meaningful to create pressure through mev not to censor them. So maybe that's the yeah. Yeah.
00:39:47.450 - 00:39:59.558, Speaker I: All right, I got a spicy one. So Flashbots has announced that the relay and builder that they'll be operating after the merge will continue to be OFAC compliant. They won't include OFAC transactions.
00:39:59.558 - 00:40:32.518, Speaker I: Blocksroute will also have an option that does that. I'd say the most extreme stance on that has been what probably Micah has expressed of he would prefer that Blocks, Wrap and Flash Pots actually step away from even operating a relay if you feel that you don't want to go to jail, which kind of makes sense for putting OFAC transactions in. Do you agree or disagree that actually operating the relay is harming Ethereum? If you walk away, does that actually solve the problem of someone else can do it?
00:40:32.684 - 00:40:40.040, Speaker A: I want to flip this question on the panel. What do you all think? Should flashbots operate a relay. Is it harming Ethereum are the questions.
00:40:42.330 - 00:40:58.526, Speaker E: I mean, I've been in favor of Flashbots, like, splitting into the side that researches how to build the game and the side that plays the game, and having a hard wall between the two for a year before censorship stuff came about. I guess even more reason to do it.
00:40:58.708 - 00:41:01.520, Speaker A: So which one of these would this fall into to you?
00:41:02.130 - 00:41:09.426, Speaker E: Well, running a relay would fall into the ladder. Was that so, like, playing the game?
00:41:09.608 - 00:41:10.340, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:41:13.350 - 00:41:35.290, Speaker C: Yeah. I would be inclined to saying that Flashbot should be running some infrastructure and I think maybe having the separation and maybe incorporating in a different country or having a different team, or maybe having a bit more risk appetite from a legal perspective. To be fair, I was a little surprised that there was this decision to be OFAC compliant.
00:41:35.290 - 00:42:13.030, Speaker C: My observation is that there's multiple parties in the block building process, and even today, in the context of proof of work, some subset of these parties are one not abiding by OFAC and OFAC censorship has existed for months and years. If you look at the actual list, there's like hundreds of Ethereum and Bitcoin addresses there. And to my knowledge, there hasn't been any enforcement action or any kind of guidance that the block builders should be involved in this kind of censorship.
00:42:16.170 - 00:42:42.366, Speaker B: Um, one thing that like, I guess that popped into my head and this is not a very well formed thought, but it's like there seems to be like a reluctance in a lot of this infrastructure to run things with leader election protocols. So it's like, instead of like we have the one Flashbots relayer, there's like some community of Flashbots relayer and some sort of leader election mechanism between them with some sort of failover. We have a thing for that.
00:42:42.366 - 00:42:58.260, Speaker B: It's called tendermint. There are ways of building this stuff with existing infrastructure and maybe there's an unwillingness there's sort of like a willingness to treat this as optional in the Ethereum community that I kind of wish was not the case.
00:42:58.810 - 00:43:15.894, Speaker D: Why would that help with this problem since anyway, it really has to be trusted. So you can run a leader election protocol, but it has to be permission. So would that really help in their decision of what to do with central compliance?
00:43:16.022 - 00:43:32.400, Speaker B: Because a big part of the way we've done censorship, resistance for things like Tor and all these things is you do find physical jurisdictions that where people are either willing to take more risk or people are less afraid and physically locate the infrastructure there.
00:43:35.010 - 00:43:55.080, Speaker A: From my perspective, geographical diversity and competitiveness are super important. I think Flashbots is in kind of a unique position as an entity, given the past and future of mev. I don't think Flashbots knows yet as an entity exactly.
00:43:55.080 - 00:44:28.574, Speaker A: Is the relay even going to exist in six months? Right? Because we may have in protocol PBS. So a lot of what Flashbots thinks about in terms of running a relay is decentralizing the existing position of Flashbots power by rather than having this vertically integrated mevgeth having many competitive parties and open sourcing as much infrastructure as possible to kind of get to that path. So along those axes, I hope we're not hurting Ethereum because Flashbots itself gets actually very little benefit from mevboost as like an actor.
00:44:28.574 - 00:44:41.638, Speaker A: And it's mostly supposed to be a public good to tide us over until PBS. So from that perspective, I don't know, hopefully we're not hurting Ethereum is my two cent. But I'm not asking you to trust me.
00:44:41.638 - 00:44:42.502, Speaker A: Time will tell.
00:44:42.556 - 00:44:52.890, Speaker E: I would say, Justin, what would your estimated timeline be for PBS if we assumed that we abandon everything else except for Dank Sharding and maybe single swap finality.
00:44:57.390 - 00:44:58.378, Speaker A: Six months?
00:44:58.544 - 00:45:00.730, Speaker C: Do these two things before PBS?
00:45:02.430 - 00:45:07.030, Speaker E: They might have to be done at the same time because PBS is sort of inherently enmeshed with them.
00:45:07.120 - 00:45:17.874, Speaker A: All you have to do for some PBS, like some accrued PBS though, is add a payment type and a transaction type, right. That makes the payment unconditional to the builder. You don't have to care if they choose the max one or not.
00:45:17.874 - 00:45:25.380, Speaker A: And that can be six months, in my opinion, 18 months, two Ethereum years.
00:45:28.310 - 00:46:00.670, Speaker C: I mean, one of the observations is that we're getting slower and slower and slower at shipping things. And I think that's partly by design, right? Because we want this endgame of Ossification, but there is something to be said as well for just front loading a lot of work. So doing as much work as we can at the research level, maybe having one of the clients implement prototypes so that we're only bottlenecked by the governance if and when we do decide to prioritize this and bring it on chain.
00:46:01.410 - 00:46:06.638, Speaker E: Can we go through this simple PBS thing that's just one transaction type? Because I haven't heard this before.
00:46:06.724 - 00:46:21.334, Speaker A: All right, let's do it after. Well, we can do it now, I guess, but we only have eight minutes and there's some people standing. But yeah, maybe we can have a little circle afterwards or a corner or something and maybe it doesn't work.
00:46:21.334 - 00:47:03.342, Speaker A: So maybe I would love to hear your thoughts on it. So I'm curious, is this like an accurate assessment? Because this is my read on, like, obviously we want to see in protocol PBS so we don't have to answer questions like, oh, is Flashbots running in relay? And is that horrible for the system? My gut feeling was like, the PBS kind of how much that's front loaded on the roadmap kind of depends on how bad the practical issues with mev boost are, where if it's a complete shit show, it'll happen a lot faster than if it works. Well, then it probably will drag on for a while and we'll seek more perfection on the PBS research side before deployment versus doing something quick and dirty.
00:47:03.342 - 00:47:06.178, Speaker A: Is that like an accurate gut check?
00:47:06.264 - 00:47:31.980, Speaker C: I guess, yeah, I think so. And some people have this thesis actually, that these quick and dirty solutions might live much, much longer than we expect. And so, for example, it's possible that proto dank sharding, the initial step might last five years and we'll only do full dank sharding at the very end because it's just good enough for a very long period of time.
00:47:33.950 - 00:47:43.054, Speaker A: Amazing trade off calculation to have to do, so don't envy you. All right, two more audience questions. I'm locking in the audience since we only have six minutes, but let's get to them.
00:47:43.054 - 00:47:46.658, Speaker A: Go ahead. So I wanted to know what is.
00:47:46.744 - 00:47:51.380, Speaker H: One thing that you most disagree with someone else on the panel about?
00:47:57.790 - 00:48:20.820, Speaker A: I'll start and I don't think we actually disagree anymore, but Vitalik, your post on like, let's just have a centralized builder and maybe it's okay, like, triggered me for like a week, no offense. And I work at Flashbile, so yeah, curious about.
00:48:22.870 - 00:48:27.590, Speaker E: I'm happy that viable maps to pass to decentralized builders exist.
00:48:30.250 - 00:48:34.280, Speaker A: Cool. What about you all? What do you really disagree with someone about?
00:48:35.530 - 00:49:03.730, Speaker C: So the general, heuristic is that disagreement is temporary and we reach rough consensus pretty quickly. But I guess one thing that Vitalik did recently is he set himself this challenge to give a whole talk on censorship resistance without mentioning the word censorship. But you did use the word exclusion, I guess, and I would have just gone ahead and explicitly said censorship, but it's just different styles.
00:49:06.310 - 00:49:26.920, Speaker D: I disagree with Phil, maybe a bit on Hemi V smoothing, because he said multiple times that there's some side channel problem, which I don't think is the problem. I've, in the meantime, come to think that it's not really going to work, but not for that reason. And I still haven't understood why he thinks that amazing.
00:49:28.170 - 00:49:47.440, Speaker B: So I actually think that flashbox centralization is perhaps better for Ethereum than most people think because of the way it is a sort of political bulwark against actors like Binance as centralized exchanges who could extract a lot of mev from their cross domain mev information.
00:49:49.170 - 00:49:51.114, Speaker A: Don't spill the secret sauce, Safi.
00:49:51.162 - 00:49:51.814, Speaker E: Jesus.
00:49:51.962 - 00:49:58.370, Speaker A: I'm just kidding. Yes, I actually agree with that, but maybe other people on the panel don't.
00:50:01.110 - 00:50:22.570, Speaker C: I'm also just generally more optimistic about the mev situation, I think maybe disagreeing with Phil, maybe this idea of building a whole business around mev when maybe in five years mev just won't be a problem and it'll be just so boring to work on the topic.
00:50:22.990 - 00:50:28.486, Speaker A: Yeah, so no, that's a great point. I don't think we actually disagree. That would be my best case outcome.
00:50:28.486 - 00:50:40.400, Speaker A: Then I can just go in the mountains and meditate all day and not have to come talk in front of a lot of people who want answers from me. So that would be incredible. If you can make that happen, let's do it.
00:50:40.400 - 00:50:50.420, Speaker A: But I did try to also go down that path for like, years, and it failed. So my faith is low. I'm a cynic, but I'm open to it.
00:50:50.420 - 00:50:55.362, Speaker A: V, what do you disagree with before we go to the last question?
00:50:55.496 - 00:51:04.358, Speaker E: I'm trying to think. Well, to be fair, I already gave my comments that I thought it would be better if Flashbots did not exist in its current configuration. I don't know, was that big enough?
00:51:04.524 - 00:51:11.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's fair. I guess you and Zaki are disagreeing there. So it's like a meta.
00:51:11.894 - 00:51:20.730, Speaker A: Two birds with 1 st situation. Yeah. All right, Sriram, last audience question, and then we're going to have some lunch.
00:51:21.410 - 00:51:46.790, Speaker F: I'll finish with a spicy question again. Proof of stake has one specific feature which proof of work does not have, which is closure. We know the set of participants a priority, and they could commit, they could make credible commitments on Eigen layer or otherwise, that they will censor and extort just that one ETH rather than 1000 ETH to actually credibly censor a transaction.
00:51:46.790 - 00:51:57.266, Speaker F: What solutions should we work towards to make sure this kind of thing does not happen? One idea I have is we should have light clients actually contribute to censorship.
00:51:57.298 - 00:52:01.366, Speaker E: Resistance sorry, to make sure what does not happen? What's the thing?
00:52:01.388 - 00:52:11.958, Speaker F: You're sure this kind of like because it's a closed system where a fixed set of stakers are known a priority. They could make a credible commitment to censor creating, like, an extortion market.
00:52:12.064 - 00:52:12.830, Speaker E: I see it.
00:52:12.900 - 00:52:26.340, Speaker F: And what things can we do to actually prevent this? And one thing I was saying is that maybe we have light clients actually contribute to censorship, resistance, and social slashing much more effectively than we have done till now.
00:52:26.790 - 00:52:36.454, Speaker E: By light clients contributing to social slashing, you mean like, light clients running protocols, like the sort of stuff I talked about two days ago? Or do you mean something else?
00:52:36.572 - 00:52:55.334, Speaker F: Light clients, for example, receive transactions which pay like ten x priority fee or whatever, and then they can actually if that transaction is not included, for example, then alarm goes off on every light client so that we have a much bigger monitoring base than just full nodes inside the network.
00:52:55.382 - 00:53:05.230, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think I generally agree with the goal of trying to get as many people in the ecosystem as possible to independently run monitoring software.
00:53:05.970 - 00:53:18.580, Speaker B: I've been waiting to see someone try an on chain extortion market for like, three years. Been tempted to build one myself. I think it would be a cool thing to let the world burn and see what happens.
00:53:19.830 - 00:53:23.010, Speaker A: Wow, we're talking about some risk tolerance. That was bold.
00:53:23.750 - 00:53:24.114, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:24.152 - 00:53:29.350, Speaker A: I might just do it under an anon. It might already be running. You might be able to access it at www.
00:53:29.350 - 00:53:35.800, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah.
00:53:40.670 - 00:53:45.610, Speaker F: Anybody can switch on, whereas to switch into stake has some frictions.
00:53:46.190 - 00:53:51.360, Speaker B: If proof of stake exists anywhere, you can build an extortion market for proof of work.
00:53:54.050 - 00:53:57.642, Speaker A: So is proof of work more censorship resistant than proof of stake?
00:53:57.786 - 00:54:04.146, Speaker B: You can build, on top of an existing proof of stake chain, a bunch of incentives to give people to the.
00:54:04.168 - 00:54:08.340, Speaker A: Bad strategies of POS and POW. I see, yeah. Makes sense.
00:54:10.150 - 00:54:19.560, Speaker E: Yeah. I'm not sure it's impossible to build similar kind of credible commitment markets on top of proof of work. Right.
00:54:19.560 - 00:54:23.910, Speaker E: What would you say?
00:54:23.980 - 00:54:26.646, Speaker F: The difference being it's an open system and anybody can switch on?
00:54:26.668 - 00:54:34.486, Speaker E: It's not an open system in practice. Capital costs are really high. Supplies is quite inelastic, I assume.
00:54:34.598 - 00:54:51.354, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. The counterargument is, if most miners wanted to, it might be even easier to do, like a full fork, permanent censorship, hard censorship, whatever you called it. Justin, in proof of work because you can easily kind of 51% attack upstart actors.
00:54:51.354 - 00:55:07.174, Speaker A: So once you have 51% in one jurisdiction, I mean, I guess it's kind of that way with proof of stake too, but finality is not exactly the same. Right. So there's like a slightly different cost curve of doing it than to a random bitcoin block, or am I wrong about that?
00:55:07.212 - 00:55:14.930, Speaker C: No, I'd say the same. Very similar dynamics. There's two aspects.
00:55:14.930 - 00:55:45.490, Speaker C: One is once you do reach this threshold, all the solutions that I presented just start breaking down. But the other thing around, why haven't we seen? This is like there's a huge barrier to entry to getting to this 50%. And so I guess the two things we can do one is we can do this deterrent work, but the other thing we can do is just raising the barrier to attack super high with very high comic security on the one hand, and also this jurisdictional diversity.
00:55:47.430 - 00:56:06.706, Speaker D: One thing that you could do, you cannot do improv work is that you can, I think, raise the barrier to censor to two thirds. One thing you can do is raise basically the amount of stake that needs to collude to two thirds. Sorry, closer.
00:56:06.706 - 00:56:24.154, Speaker D: Okay. Yeah. Let's say that you have on tendermint or if you had singles law finality, you could make it so that if you want to censor the encrypted transactions, assuming you have some portion that is threshold encrypted, you really need at least two thirds to collude to know in advance before they finalize that there's something that they shouldn't finalize.
00:56:24.154 - 00:56:29.360, Speaker D: Because otherwise that point they can't really do anything. So that's maybe a minor advantage that we have.
00:56:31.970 - 00:57:13.066, Speaker E: Actually one other sort of family of censorship resistance that I think is kind of esoteric, but I remember thinking about years ago that is not threshold based and not VDF based is kind of what I would call halting problem based censorship resistance. So the idea here is that if the Ethereum protocol gets extended with some kind of delayed call feature where you can make a transaction like an EVM opcode in block N that forces a call in block N plus three. Then it becomes possible for people to engineer some collection of transactions and calls in block N such that any possible transaction at some point is what actually lead to the transaction.
00:57:13.066 - 00:57:41.430, Speaker E: That's being censored, sort of being reconstructed and created. But the only way you'd be able to properly censor that is to essentially simulate the entire blockchain kind of going forward a few blocks every time you check for a transaction, it's a backup that you could have. And it's something that's not super easy but not super difficult to construct because all you need is like a guaranteed delayed execution opcode.
00:57:41.850 - 00:57:45.046, Speaker B: This is like something we learned during the Dow hard fork that it was.
00:57:45.068 - 00:57:49.078, Speaker E: Like right, it's like that. But this is like a more extreme version of that.
00:57:49.244 - 00:57:52.170, Speaker B: Ethereum was more censorship resistant than anyone realized.
00:57:52.670 - 00:58:06.300, Speaker A: The counterargument is if you really want to censor it, you can just have a heuristic that only allows for templates. And then you just exclude all that and you're done, depending on how much control you have in the protocol. But there's more of a cost for sure.
00:58:08.190 - 00:58:17.730, Speaker E: I guess the argument there would be, once you start doing that, then you really do exclude enough that after four blocks, whoever the first builder is would just make a block.
00:58:18.950 - 00:58:26.340, Speaker A: All right, folks, I think we've had the clock reset on us like, six times. So I think we're censoring people's lunch at this point. Thank you.
