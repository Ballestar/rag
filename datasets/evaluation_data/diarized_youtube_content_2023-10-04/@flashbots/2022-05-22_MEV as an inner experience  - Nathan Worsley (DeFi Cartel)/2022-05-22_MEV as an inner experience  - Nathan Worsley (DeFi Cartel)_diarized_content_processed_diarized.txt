00:00:08.970 - 00:00:24.170, Speaker A: Hey everyone. Thank you for coming to my talk on the inner experience of searching for mev. So I guess before we get started, a couple of quick sort of definitions of the way searchers see mev from from their orientation.
00:00:24.170 - 00:00:45.990, Speaker A: So I guess firstly, what is a blockchain? Well, in my opinion, a blockchain is a game. And specifically it's a game theoretic system of incentives that is coordinating the rational and selfish behavior of participants to achieve some kind of socially beneficial outcome. So one thing you can always rely on is that people will be extremely selfish and will act in their own best interests.
00:00:45.990 - 00:00:59.838, Speaker A: And one of the beautiful things about blockchain is that it's coordinating this purely selfish behavior to achieve something. For example, payments with Bitcoin, Smart, contracts with Ethereum and so on. Mev is the emergent value of this game.
00:00:59.838 - 00:01:12.770, Speaker A: So it's any financial reward which is ultimately available to the person who will be building the block. And one thing I wanted to point out and push on is that mev is a neutral force. It's an emergent property of consensus and it's not good or bad.
00:01:12.770 - 00:01:34.694, Speaker A: There is good mev and there is bad mev, but mev by itself is neutral. So an mev engineer often called a searcher is a player who is competing in a game with other players to capture this mev. And they're usually doing this by building algorithms which are evaluating the state of the blocks that are arriving and evaluating the state of transactions that are arriving in the mempool.
00:01:34.694 - 00:01:49.674, Speaker A: And they're making execution decisions based on this. Why did I call this talk mev as an inner experience? Well, there's a sort of trend at the moment in blockchain to think of mev as a purely extractive and profit driven activity. And there's definitely money in searching.
00:01:49.674 - 00:02:02.578, Speaker A: But one thing I really want to try and convince you is that searching is not just about making money any more than poker is just about making money. It's an intellectual and it's a sporting pursuit. And if you're only interested in the money, it's probably not the best pursuit for you.
00:02:02.578 - 00:02:23.574, Speaker A: If you just build something and get VC funding, you'll probably get wealthier with a lot less stress than if you try to do the same thing searching. For mev, it's something that combines the intellectual challenge that you'll see in competitive programming with the financial psychology and the game theory that you often see in poker. And it's often called the Olympics of software development, which I think is a very apt description.
00:02:23.574 - 00:02:58.334, Speaker A: So if you want to be a searcher, there's a couple of questions that I would ask you. Firstly, does the sheer difficulty of a problem excite you if you're faced with something you don't understand and it hurts your head, it's so confusing, are you filled with the desire to understand it? To push yourself through that problem and get yourself to a point where everything finally makes sense? Is that something that you really get on board with? Are you willing to work across the entire technology stack as a searcher? We do everything from minute gas optimizations, using assembly on smart contracts, all the way to assembly level optimizations to save clock cycles on the CPU. We do network topology, we do hardware.
00:02:58.334 - 00:03:13.914, Speaker A: There's not really any level of the stack that we don't touch as a searcher. Can you work quickly and can you work for a long time and under a very high amount of pressure and face a lot of failures before you finally achieve something meaningful? As a searcher, you fail a lot. You don't start doing it and make a lot of money.
00:03:13.914 - 00:03:20.890, Speaker A: You fail, you fail again, you fail again, you fail again. Sometimes you just don't stop failing and you have to give up. Sometimes you achieve something beautiful.
00:03:20.890 - 00:03:52.838, Speaker A: And are you prepared to test yourself against some of the most intelligent engineers of our generation? The other people searching are smart and you'll have to run very fast to catch up with them. And lastly, are you a team player? Can you be a productive part of a team which is greater than the sum of its parts? So apart from just building software, searchers are also engaged in a sort of complex game of psychological warfare, using various strategies to trick each other. And this often plays out in discord forums, twitter, various searcher communities, or even when searchers are networking with each other.
00:03:52.838 - 00:04:07.018, Speaker A: So a lot of alpha leaking is actually fake, as designed to waste the time of the person receiving the alpha leak. Someone might want you to spend 50 to 100 hours engaging in some activity which is ultimately completely fruitless. At the same time, some alpha leaks are real.
00:04:07.018 - 00:04:20.858, Speaker A: Maybe that person wants to make friends with you, maybe they want to network with you. It's kind of hard to differentiate sometimes whether the alpha leak that you're dealing with is real or fake. And one sort of philosophy that we have as searches is that everything can be an alpha leak.
00:04:20.858 - 00:04:42.786, Speaker A: You don't really know what someone else doesn't know, so you don't know if you're revealing something that is kind of bringing them over a threshold to something they didn't understand before. Just for an example, I was networking with someone recently and they told me their team size and blockchain and that was enough for me to figure out their smart contract strategy and everything. So the smallest things can be an alpha leak.
00:04:42.786 - 00:04:59.466, Speaker A: Just what blockchain, what strategy you're doing can be a major alpha leak. Apart from the outside sort of challenges of performing Psyops on other people, there's also a lot of personal challenges involved in searching. It will push the limits of what you're capable of, it will push the limits of what you're capable of.
00:04:59.466 - 00:05:14.158, Speaker A: Intellectually you'll realize the limits of your intelligence, that you're not the smartest person in the room, and it'll push limits of what you're capable of physically. The work often resembles a hackathon rather than regular work. And as Dean said earlier, one thing that is guaranteed is that you will burn out.
00:05:14.158 - 00:05:29.774, Speaker A: You will burn out a lot. Can you push yourself to the edge of burnout but just not fall apart completely and keep going? And one thing I wanted to touch on is there's a spectrum that you can optimize for in life about. And one side of the spectrum is people who are very delusional and overconfident.
00:05:29.774 - 00:05:35.826, Speaker A: They have like a messiah complex. They think they're the best thing ever. And the other side are people who are very humble and in touch with reality.
00:05:35.826 - 00:05:51.878, Speaker A: And often in a lot of pursuits, it actually makes sense to sort of optimize on the side of delusion. People who are very overconfident often do things like start WeWork or become a great UFC fighter or whatever. But in mev it actually usually helps to optimize on the side of being humble.
00:05:51.878 - 00:06:12.558, Speaker A: People who think they're smarter than everyone else tend to actually leak a lot of alpha without realizing it because they just don't think that anyone else is intelligent enough to capitalize on it. So what does the state of the game look like today? Well, there are some loan searches out there that still exist. They're mostly doing very long tail stuff, but they're being pushed out now by teams.
00:06:12.558 - 00:06:27.570, Speaker A: And the market is currently dominated by less than 20 teams, three to four TradFi firms. Some of the names you would recognize and some of them are probably sitting around you today, and the rest are crypto native teams. And the sophistication of searcher strategies is growing exponentially.
00:06:27.570 - 00:06:40.954, Speaker A: Most firms and teams are now contesting the longer tail of the standard strategies. So, like the more esoteric types of ARB or the more esoteric types of liquidation, it's getting very crowded. The majority of searchers lose money when their time is factored in.
00:06:40.954 - 00:06:53.646, Speaker A: It's not something where you're guaranteed to make money. Most people would be better off doing another kind of activity. One quote that a search I really respect said to me was, I really underestimated how hard people will work for $100 a day.
00:06:53.646 - 00:07:13.190, Speaker A: There's people out there who will work 100 hours a week to steal that $100 a day off you, and that's the kind of competition that you will be up against. Cool. So I wanted to, I guess, dive into a few war stories to sort of give you examples of some of the games that you might find yourself in if you become a searcher and this kind of lifestyle appeals to you.
00:07:13.190 - 00:07:23.818, Speaker A: So the first thing is DDoS attacks. This is like a very common thing that you'll see as a searcher. And the strategy here is to disable competitors or create some kind of latency to slow you down.
00:07:23.818 - 00:07:37.866, Speaker A: So generally you'll be running some infrastructure and the attacker will connect to you with nodes that are created for the purpose of DDoSing you. And this can be a very subtle attack. Sometimes they don't want you to notice the DDoS, they just want to introduce enough latency that you are no longer profitable.
00:07:37.866 - 00:07:47.094, Speaker A: And sometimes the traffic can be very deceptive. It might be pings and pongs. It might be transactions that have already been included in a previous block that are coming through the Memport.
00:07:47.094 - 00:08:04.600, Speaker A: It will generally be tailored towards the client that you're using. And it's a challenge as a searcher to detect and drop these bad peers, throttle this kind of malicious DDoS traffic and maintain healthy connections. And a lot of people don't realize this is kind of like an undercurrent war that is going on on most blockchains at the moment.
00:08:04.600 - 00:08:14.998, Speaker A: WebSocket warfare. This was an interesting scenario I was in a few months ago. It was an EVM based blockchain where having a bigger stake as a Validator was beneficial for trading.
00:08:14.998 - 00:08:34.826, Speaker A: And one of the big Validators on the network had a WebSocket connection exposed on a port, an unusual port. And they didn't realize that this was kind of exposed. And there were a few searchers that had scanned this Validator and realized this port was exposed and dominating the mev on the chain became a game of just gaming this Validator when it would restart.
00:08:34.826 - 00:08:50.782, Speaker A: This Validator would restart about once a day. And every time the Validator would restart, it became a sort of war to just connect to the Validator as quickly as possible, open as many connections as you possibly can. And that sort of gave you the advantage in the game because it was pure latency, everyone's receiving the same information.
00:08:50.782 - 00:08:58.194, Speaker A: It was kind of interesting because restarting your bot here was deadly. A lot of people, their bots will crash and restart. It's kind of like a normal part of operating a bot.
00:08:58.194 - 00:09:14.638, Speaker A: But if you restarted your bot wallet, you just lost all your connections to this Validator. It was kind of like game over, until the next day when the Validator would restart. So eventually the Validator just, I guess, discovered that we were just massacring its traffic and internet with this game that was going on and they shut us down.
00:09:14.638 - 00:09:31.246, Speaker A: But it was pretty cool while it lasted. The next is another cool example, the consensus leader strategy. So prior to the snowman plus plus hard fork on avalanche, it was possible for any Validator to propose a block.
00:09:31.246 - 00:09:48.466, Speaker A: So first of all, it started off as sort of like normal mev extraction. And then people started realizing that they could reorg the blockchain. So you would capture some mev in a block and then the attacker would publish a longer chain of blocks with their validator and sort of convince the chain that that was a legitimate head of the blocks.
00:09:48.466 - 00:10:12.250, Speaker A: And then you would lose the mev and the chain would get reorganed. And this was really damaging the user experience of the chain and Ava labs at the time just didn't care or they weren't really interested in even talking about it or recognizing the problem. So we created a coalition of Virtuous Validators with the idea that the Virtuous Validators would confirm each other's blocks more quickly and would discredit the blocks of the reorg attackers.
00:10:12.250 - 00:10:27.550, Speaker A: So when we saw a reorg chain, the Virtuous Validators would try and basically create a longer chain on top of the existing chain to discredit this chain. And this got really aggressive, the reorgurs just got more intense. We had to create more intense chains of blocks to fight back against the reorgas.
00:10:27.550 - 00:10:57.114, Speaker A: And eventually Arvalabs did notice because the block times on the chain was just exploding and they just hard forked the entire blockchain to fix this problem and shut down the war that was going on. Inventory Drain so here the strategy is to drain the inventory of other bots and normally this is draining gas from the sending addresses of people's smart contracts. Sometimes it's more direct approaches like Salmonella where you're exploiting some kind of vulnerability in their contract to drain their inventory.
00:10:57.114 - 00:11:11.134, Speaker A: And this is kind of an attack surface that is opening up from the generalized nature of people's strategies. So normally this will be fake trade opportunities. Someone will try and figure out how you evaluate trade opportunities and put something in the mem pool where you start spitting out a lot of trades.
00:11:11.134 - 00:11:29.206, Speaker A: It doesn't cost them anything, you drain your inventory. I've seen a few really unlucky situations where someone had an automated service set up to retop up their sending addresses from their smart contract. So this inventory drain would just cycle through not only all the money on their sending addresses, but all the money on their smart contract too.
00:11:29.206 - 00:11:40.790, Speaker A: So they just lost all of their funds. And this is like something you have to be very careful of. And one thing to point out here is sometimes the line between inventory drain and hacking can be a little bit blurry.
00:11:40.790 - 00:12:02.050, Speaker A: For example, with the Chum exploit recently, someone was actually tailoring this exploit for every smart contract that they attacked. So they would find your smart contract, figure out an exploit specifically for your smart contract, and I'll target you. I guess in my opinion, that's probably falling more on the side of hacking, but I guess it's sort of up to you to decide where you are morally comfortable.
00:12:02.050 - 00:12:19.142, Speaker A: Cool. So I hope I've done a little bit of work to convince you that searching is not just about getting rich and that if you are just in it for the money, you probably won't succeed. It's a beautiful art form, it has a lot of depth, it's rich, you'll be versing really intelligent people, you'll fail a lot.
00:12:19.142 - 00:12:34.590, Speaker A: But when you do succeed, it's one of the most beautiful and meaningful experiences that you can have as a software engineer. What does the future hold for searchers? Well, I mean, strategies are going to increase in complexity. There's more of a need now for searches to do everything at the same time.
00:12:34.590 - 00:13:10.970, Speaker A: Whereas previously searchers would specialize more in one strategy, there's increased competition from teams, from traditional finance. So as a searcher, if you're crypto native you do tend to have a little bit of a moat, but traditional finance is sort of expanding in this domain and becoming a lot more competitive and there's a move in the direction of more statistical strategies which are a bit higher risk and play out over multiple blocks. And my hope is that crypto native trading firms will be able to sort of hold the fort here and become the dominant players in the next couple of years rather than letting this be an industry, another industry that traditional finance dominates.
00:13:10.970 - 00:13:19.100, Speaker A: Cool. So I guess I'll see everyone in the mempool, but I will take some questions if anyone has any.
00:13:34.850 - 00:13:39.520, Speaker B: If you had to start all over again with what would you start?
00:13:40.450 - 00:13:51.800, Speaker A: If I was to start right now, I'd say I would probably be looking to join an existing team. I don't think I would go on my own. I would try and do something cool that would appeal to an existing team and join them.
00:13:52.490 - 00:13:59.394, Speaker B: So you would do more general strategies like Arbitrage and liquidations?
00:13:59.522 - 00:14:09.322, Speaker A: No, I would probably be focusing more on the longer tail. The shorter tail stuff is very competitive at the moment. There's a lot of people who have been trading V two Arbitrage for years for example.
00:14:09.322 - 00:14:28.942, Speaker A: And if you're going to dive into that, it's extremely difficult, extremely competitive, and even if you are winning, it's really not the profit opportunity is probably not there like it used to be. So I'll be looking at more stuff that is less noticed and this is something that you see playing out on the mem pool. People who have a profitable strategy are often taking steps to hide it.
00:14:28.942 - 00:14:44.470, Speaker A: So like one alpha leak is to look for people who have reinitialized contracts because when you reinitialize a contract it's actually like hiding sort of your transaction history on ether scan. So there's a lot of long tail people looking for these sort of edge cases here where this alpha that is not really the highly contested.
00:14:45.290 - 00:14:46.280, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:14:57.050 - 00:15:18.154, Speaker A: Do you see any mev opportunities for NFT trading? Yeah, there's a lot of mev opportunities in NFT. Unfortunately I've only ever lost money trading NFTs. There was this NFT, I think it was like black text on a white background or white text on a black background or something and there was like a new one that came out that was just like the opposite.
00:15:18.154 - 00:15:36.434, Speaker A: The first one was black text on a white background, the second one was like white text on the black background. I spent heaps of effort just gaming the randomness here, trying to get a rare version of this NFT and then I ended up holding all these rare NFTs, but now you've got to sell them, so you got to shield your bags to your friends. It's not a very pleasant sort of way to end the trade.
00:15:36.434 - 00:15:42.600, Speaker A: So there is a lot of money that can be made in NFT mev, but personally I've failed at it.
00:15:51.060 - 00:15:52.816, Speaker B: So do you actually code in the.
00:15:52.838 - 00:16:07.830, Speaker A: Sauna or is that Psyops? Well, at the moment I'm not coding in the Sauna because I haven't been able to find a laptop that can withstand that kind of temperature. But who knows, I'll give it a try. Maybe the Sauna is somewhere you should just be relaxing and forgetting about the stresses of your life.
00:16:16.200 - 00:16:33.356, Speaker C: Is there a skill cap? And do you expect teams will reach a sort of saturation level beyond which they can grow and maintain alpha competitiveness or say like people forking off and starting firms that duplicate or something of that sort? Do the advantages just keep stacking and when does the exponentiality stop?
00:16:33.458 - 00:16:49.480, Speaker A: I think there is kind of like a limit to where strategies can go. Like for example, gas optimization. At the moment there's a lot of work on optimizing more and more with sort of standard strategies, but there's like a theoretical limit to where you can gas optimize and at some point most people are going to be pretty close to that theoretical limit.
00:16:49.480 - 00:16:57.668, Speaker A: And the same with creativity of strategies. At some point you've sort of like done all the standard strategies, you've got all the standard long tail. There's sort of like not a lot of places left to go.
00:16:57.668 - 00:17:12.970, Speaker A: I'm sure that there will always be things that will pop up now and then, but I do think that there will be a point in time where things are very saturated. But I think we're very far away from that. Even if you're just beginning to search, I still think you got like a good number of years before you have to worry about this sort of stuff.
00:17:12.970 - 00:17:30.416, Speaker A: I'm managing a team of searches. Yeah. So I started by myself and I was just like working 100 hours a week.
00:17:30.416 - 00:17:44.052, Speaker A: It was just way too crazy. And I had this idea that, okay, I will work less, I'll make less money and sort of hire other people and share the profits. But actually turns out that as I said in the talk, a good team is greater than the sum of its part.
00:17:44.052 - 00:18:01.950, Speaker A: So if you're like a solo searcher now, I'd recommend looking for people that you're very cohesive with, where you have a team of three or four people, but you're so cohesive that you're operating like a team of five or six. And building and maintaining a good team is very hard to do. I've failed at it before, but when you can achieve it, it is like a beautiful environment to work in.
00:18:03.120 - 00:18:11.470, Speaker B: How did the transition worked out on your work routine and stuff?
00:18:12.000 - 00:18:23.936, Speaker A: How did the transition go from solo to team. It was bumpy. So sort of had some failures at first, but eventually found a good cohesive working relationship with some really gifted people.
00:18:23.936 - 00:18:38.292, Speaker A: But yeah, one thing I would advise if you are solo and you're looking to join a team is don't skimp on the legal stuff. Don't just have sort of like ad hoc relationships. It's just like any other business, right, where everything's sort of like fun and everyone's friends.
00:18:38.292 - 00:18:48.170, Speaker A: But if there's real money involved, then it gets a bit more serious. So I recommend if you want to start a team, do it properly. Start a company, get agreements, get employment contracts and so on.
00:18:48.170 - 00:18:51.710, Speaker A: You're setting yourself up for success doing that.
00:19:02.730 - 00:19:07.126, Speaker B: Hey, on the topic of contracts, et cetera, what do you think about these.
00:19:07.148 - 00:19:22.358, Speaker A: Teams being regulated generally from an idealistic perspective, I'm sort of like opposed to regulation. I'd hope that blockchains can sort of self regulate. Yeah, I guess regulators at some point will sort of step into the mev sphere.
00:19:22.358 - 00:19:35.150, Speaker A: I hope that they will do it with guidance from people inside this industry rather than just doing stupid stuff that they normally do where they just do it. It's like top down regulation. It doesn't make any sense, but this is a very permissionless market.
00:19:35.150 - 00:19:44.210, Speaker A: Anyone can do it. It can be hard to figure out who the people that you're trading against are. So regulators will probably struggle to institute these top down laws.
00:19:45.430 - 00:19:46.420, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:19:56.730 - 00:20:41.964, Speaker A: How much of the mev that you see is actually sort of traded against the centralized markets rather than just being on the blockchain? The distinction between atomic and non atomic mev, I'd say at the moment it's probably more there's like more non atomic mev that's being traded. I mean, if you look at the biggest traders on ethereum, the bulk of their profits are coming from stuff that's between centralized and decentralized exchanges. So, yeah, atomic is probably becoming less profitable, especially on a chain like hi.
00:20:42.002 - 00:20:55.888, Speaker D: Nathan, thanks for the talk. Just at a higher level, it seems to me that this very secretive game of cat and mouse where you're incentivized to be secret is very exciting for the people involved. But you mentioned some societal benefit at the top.
00:20:55.888 - 00:21:01.088, Speaker D: Do you think this just like to hear your take on how it trends towards societal good over the long term?
00:21:01.264 - 00:21:11.144, Speaker A: I'd love to be able to give you this beautiful answer about how mev is like the greatest thing ever for society. I guess you could ask yourself, is like poker the best thing ever for society? It's a fun pursuit. Yeah.
00:21:11.144 - 00:21:22.660, Speaker A: You could make the argument that you're sort of like driving efficiency in mev and you're exposing some issues with blockchain and acceleration in a sense. Maybe you're sandwich trading. You're exposing that that is a problem that needs to be fixed.
00:21:22.660 - 00:21:35.888, Speaker A: Maybe you're targeting like a reorg strategy. You're exposing that that is like a problem that needs to be fixed. But yeah, I generally think most people are doing it for the art form and the pursuit not sort of to provide some value add to society as a whole.
00:21:36.054 - 00:21:46.544, Speaker D: Just a follow up question, do you think the technical innovations that mev searchers end up inventing actually over long term kind of osmosis out into the blockchains that they are working on?
00:21:46.662 - 00:22:06.820, Speaker A: I would hope that they will eventually. I think at the moment a lot of some of the most intelligent human capital in the world is being spent getting two extra gas saved on an execution or speed optimizations on Geth that never actually make it into the mainstream client. So this is like a lot of human capital that's being spent on these things and it doesn't really surface.
00:22:06.820 - 00:22:13.550, Speaker A: I would hope that though that there is a sort of like trend long term where some of this brain power does end up being put to a social use.
00:22:14.000 - 00:22:14.990, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:22:22.250 - 00:22:27.300, Speaker A: Cool. If there's no more questions then thank you very much everyone for bringing me out.
