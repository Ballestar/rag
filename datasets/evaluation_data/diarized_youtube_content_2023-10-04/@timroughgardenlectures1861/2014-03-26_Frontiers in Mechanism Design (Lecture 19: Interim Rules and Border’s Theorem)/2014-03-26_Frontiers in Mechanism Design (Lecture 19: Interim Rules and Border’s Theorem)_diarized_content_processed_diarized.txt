00:00:00.810 - 00:00:18.698, Speaker A: All right, well, I'm going to go ahead and get started. So, last lecture, the topic is revenue maximization in multiparameter settings. So let me just remind you, we had these four parts of the course where we were just obsessed with welfare maximization, maximizing the sum of the vis.
00:00:18.698 - 00:00:39.514, Speaker A: At the very end, I'm talking about maximizing the sum of the PiS, maximizing the sum of the payments to the seller. So if, you know, we're thinking about things from the perspective of some monopolists that wants to maximize their own revenue. Other thing I want to remind you is in the single parameter case, so this is where there's only one type of stuff and players'values are just linear in the amount of stuff they get.
00:00:39.514 - 00:00:50.566, Speaker A: That was last quarter very well developed theory. That was Myerson's theory, which gave us basically a very crisp understanding of optimal auctions. It's just maximize virtual welfare.
00:00:50.566 - 00:01:22.642, Speaker A: And so the hope and what I want to talk about today is the extent to which we can get a multipramter analog of Myerson's theory, this idea that revenue maximization reduces to virtual welfare maximization. And amazingly, there's been progress, significant progress on this issue just in the last few years, even though Myerson's paper is from 1981. So that's pretty cool, right? And then just why is it interesting? There's this theorem that in the single parameter world that revenue maximization reduces to virtual welfare maximization.
00:01:22.642 - 00:01:38.598, Speaker A: There's both the sort of conceptual structural we have a good handle on what an optimal auction looks like. We know, for example, that even if you optimize over Bayesian incentive compatible mechanisms, you get a dominant strategy, incentive compatible optimal solution. You get deterministic mechanisms as long as the distributions are regular.
00:01:38.598 - 00:02:01.426, Speaker A: And then there's also the computational interpretation which says, well, as long as it's a problem domain where you can maximize welfare, this automatically means you can maximize revenue too, because you just feed in the virtual values into your black box that maximizes welfare and boom, you're done. You've got a revenue, a computationally tractable revenue maximizing auction. So those are the analogues we're going to be striving for today for multiparameter problems.
00:02:01.426 - 00:02:12.018, Speaker A: Now, the main point of last lecture was to show that that's a pretty ambitious goal. So we started with just these examples. We just had one buyer.
00:02:12.018 - 00:02:24.678, Speaker A: We had two items. The buyer had an additive valuation over the two items and its values for each were even IID from these super simple distributions. And already in that very simple case, the optimal auction could be really weird.
00:02:24.678 - 00:02:38.442, Speaker A: And we showed that it varies a lot with exactly what the prior is. And we showed that in fact, you may need randomization to be an optimal revenue maximizing auction. So it's no longer true that deterministic suffices to be optimal you need randomization.
00:02:38.442 - 00:02:55.490, Speaker A: So that's an important lesson that we learned. So we know things are going to look more complicated in the multi parameter world, but know even knowing that we want to get as close as possible to sort of the holy grail of Myerson's single parameter theory. So that's the context, let me just remind you, the formal setup.
00:02:55.490 - 00:03:14.874, Speaker A: So we're now not talking about just one buyer, we're talking about multiple buyers. We're talking about auction or mechanism design setting. So we have items M of them and we're going to stick with additive evaluations for now.
00:03:14.874 - 00:03:43.940, Speaker A: Next lecture we'll talk about unit demand as an example of how to push theory further. But as we saw last lecture, additive evaluations already pose a number of complexity and we're working on the finite support case. So capital V sub I denotes the potential additive valuations that bidder I might have.
00:03:43.940 - 00:04:01.386, Speaker A: And it has some density little F. And again, these are additive. So a bidder's value for a bundle S is just the sum of its values for the individual items J in that bundle S.
00:04:01.386 - 00:04:18.778, Speaker A: Okay? So there are these Vijs drawn from this prior. So just to be clear, I will be assuming throughout today that we have independence across bidders. Okay? So the FIS need not be identical, certainly, but bidder one and bidder two, I'm going to assume that their valuations are independent.
00:04:18.778 - 00:04:38.390, Speaker A: Some of the stuff I'll say extend the correlated distributions, but I won't make a big deal of it. Nowhere will we need that for a given bidder i, its value for different items is independent. Okay? So for a fixed bidder I, it can have an arbitrary correlated distribution over its values for the different items j, but independence between the bidders.
00:04:38.390 - 00:05:04.350, Speaker A: Okay, so what we were talking about the end of last lecture was it was clear with all these examples we're looking at, that we probably, it didn't seem like some nice closed form formula was going to be sufficient to talk about revenue maximization like it was in the single parameter setting. There's just too much complexity going on. So we needed some more sort of general tool for getting a handle on it.
00:05:04.350 - 00:05:31.970, Speaker A: So we were looking at linear programming formulations. And so we made the observation, although it wasn't really clear if it's useful or not yet, that the revenue maximizing auction for this kind of setup can be expressed as a linear program, a really big linear program, but a linear program. And so the decision variables, so we have the revelation principle, so we can think about just direct revelation mechanisms.
00:05:31.970 - 00:05:38.260, Speaker A: And so the decision variables of this linear program are going to correspond to the allocation rule and the payment rule of that.
