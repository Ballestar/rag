00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.960, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:01.810 - 00:00:26.040, Speaker B: Okay, welcome back. So I promised to say a little bit about course expectations and that kind of thing. There'll be some similarities, but also some differences from the fall. So there'll be no so in the fall, we had exercise sets and problem sets and that was it. So no problem sets. Probably many of you will not miss them, but so no problem sets. Those are the hard ones.
00:00:26.040 - 00:01:13.250, Speaker B: Instead, there's going to be so the focus of this class, sort of today notwithstanding, the focus of this class is on recent research, like I said, last five years mostly. And so it's a good opportunity to do a research project. So maybe around the fourth week of the class or something like that, I'll post a list of various research papers that I think might be fun to read in more depth. And so the deliverable will be some kind of research report, say, ballpark, 15 pages, something like that. If you want, you can just do sort of a paper summary, paper synthesis. But for those of you that are looking for kind of research problems to work on, this is another natural opportunity to spend some time on that exercise sets. There will be some, including starting this week, exercise set number one.
00:01:13.250 - 00:01:54.014, Speaker B: There's a very, very bare bones web page at the moment, but exercise number one is linked to from the web page and those have the same format as last quarter, meeting only once a week. I actually think they're sort of probably even more crucial for the first part of the class, just to keep you engaged with the material and just to keep you sort of to get you solid on all these concepts. I'm probably going to have them tail off once we get to the midpoint of the quarter and where I'm expecting you to spend more time on the research projects. So expect kind of maybe four or five exercise sets of a similar length to the fall and then maybe ones that have, say, two to four exercises for the second half of the class, something like that.
00:01:54.212 - 00:01:57.342, Speaker A: Do we turn in the exercise sets or are they just for our practice?
00:01:57.406 - 00:02:33.260, Speaker B: You turn them in, yeah. And if you look at the PDF, I'm not going to bring hard copies, but the PDF has a full instructions about exactly what resources you can use and working with other people and so on. Those of you who took it in the fall, it's the same policies as in the fall. Then also like last quarter, we are videotaping the lecturers. That said, I am thinking of attendance as roughly required. We're a small enough group. It would be sort of a shame if half of you didn't come just to watch it on YouTube later.
00:02:33.260 - 00:03:02.118, Speaker B: I know some of you are going to have interviews and stuff and I realize there'll be conflicts, but barring kind of hard conflicts, I do actually expect you to attend the lectures and use the videos for review or for the few lectures that you absolutely have to miss. And there will be lecture notes just like last quarter. Also just like last quarter. I'm not really going to promise abound on the latency of the lecture notes. Sometimes they'll be fast. If I have a lot of other deadlines, they may not be so fast. So I'll do my best, but I'll get them out when I can.
00:03:02.118 - 00:03:13.560, Speaker B: And the website, as usual, will have sort of related readings to the lectures. I'll get that up probably tomorrow. Questions? Yeah.
00:03:14.490 - 00:03:16.118, Speaker A: We're taking this class for credit.
00:03:16.204 - 00:03:18.570, Speaker B: Yeah. Pass fail, you mean?
00:03:18.640 - 00:03:19.210, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:19.360 - 00:03:22.058, Speaker B: You do not have to do the research project if you're taking a pass fail.
00:03:22.154 - 00:03:27.230, Speaker A: And how would you compare this in terms of workload to the process version?
00:03:27.970 - 00:04:09.906, Speaker B: It's hard for me to say. I'm nervous of saying anything on the record about that because it's a little apples and oranges with the research project, which to a large extent I hope some of you will feel motivated to work extremely hard on the research project. And on the one hand, there are these brutal problem sets in 364 A, but there are also groups of size three that you could work on them together. So that makes it a little hard for me to do the arithmetic as far as what I'm shooting for. I'm shooting for it to be a little less time consuming overall. Feel free to let me know on the evals if I succeed or not at the end of the quarter. But last quarter, I imagine, was pretty time consuming.
00:04:09.906 - 00:05:05.440, Speaker B: And this quarter, I mean to be rigorous but not quite as time consuming, but we'll see your mileage may vary. Other questions? All right, so hopefully now it's sort of clear what the plan is. So we want to look at more interesting, more complex scenarios of allocating scarce goods to people in a way that gets good performance, in this case good surplus. And ultimately our focus is on having ascending auctions which are exposed and Senate compatible. Sincere bidding leads to good performance and are simpler polynomial time. And I left you last lecture with the observation that a prerequisite is you need to at least have good direct revelation dominance strategy mechanisms before you could hope to have this. So that's the paradigm I want to start exploring for scenario number three, a more complex scenario in this lecture now.
00:05:05.440 - 00:06:02.202, Speaker B: So scenario three is going to be a strict generalization of scenario one, and it's still going to be incomparable to the added evaluation scenario number two. So like scenario number two, we're going to have non identical items. And, like scenario one, we're going to have unit demand, bidders or valuations, by which I mean bidder. I has a private value vij for good. J and we define bidder I's value for a bundle of goods. S so in the additive case, it was the sum over the goods in the bundle. Here it's going to be the max over the goods in the bundle.
00:06:02.202 - 00:06:58.094, Speaker B: Okay? So again, unit demand means you're not interested in more than one item, but you do have preferences amongst them. Houses, for example, might is often used as an application here. So you're not going to buy more than one house potentially, but there are some that you would be willing to pay for more than others. So the goal which is actually going to take all of this lecture and a little bit of the beginning of next lecture as well, next week, but the following goal is to construct an auction with all of these properties for scenario three. That turns out to be a really interesting problem. The solution is really nice, but we have to develop a reasonably deep understanding of the scenario to justify the eventual solution. Okay, so as we said, the sanity check just to even wonder if this exists for unit demand, bidders and different items.
00:06:58.094 - 00:07:51.678, Speaker B: Well, do we at least have a direct revelation DSIC implementation for scenario number three? And we do. So first, I think I put this on an exercise in the fall, but I want to point out that there's a very strong connection between seeking to maximize surplus with unit demand bidders, unit demand valuations, and bipartite matching. So suppose we just wanted an algorithm to maximize surplus. If you want, think of this as the allocation rule in a VCG mechanism. So suppose you actually knew all the Vijs and you just wanted to compute a surplus maximizing valuation. Well, because bidders are unit demand, it's pointless to give a good or more than one good. If you gave it two goods, it's just going to throw out the one that it likes less anyways.
00:07:51.678 - 00:08:48.710, Speaker B: So without loss, each bidder gets at most one good. So to max surplus without loss of generality at most one good per person. And of course, each good only goes to one person. You can't give a good to two different people. So we can think of this as a bipartite graph with bidders on one side and goods on the other side, and the edge weight is just equal to the valuation that a given bidder I has for the given good j. Okay, maximizing surplus is just maximizing the Vijs over all pairs IJ where bitter I gets good j. So that just corresponds to computing a max weight bipartite matching in this graph.
00:08:48.710 - 00:09:40.006, Speaker B: So corollary maximizing surplus, ignoring incentive issues, maximizing surplus with these unit demand valuations is equivalent to max weight bipartite matching. So something I hope many of you have seen at some point in your education is a polynomial time algorithm for max weight bipartite matching. You can solve it using linear programming. There are lots of combinatorial algorithms for it as well. In fact, next week we're going to see possibly one of the simplest algorithms known that computes a maxweight bipartite matching. Okay, up to an epsilon. But it'll still be a very simple algorithm that shows that this is a computationally trackable problem.
00:09:40.006 - 00:10:35.698, Speaker B: It's not trivial. I don't teach it in my undergrad algorithms class, for example, but this can be solved quickly. All right, so what what about incentives? Well, something that I hope you might maybe remember from last quarter is that the surplus objective, if you want to maximize it with a DSIC mechanism, is a very special objective. We basically have a universal solution for doing surplus maximization in a dominant strategy way and that's called the VCG mechanism. And so again, what I'm doing here is I'm doing a direct revelation d six solution to this problem as a sanity check before we move to the ascending implementation, which is the hard part. Okay, so what is the VCG mechanism? Let me jog your memory, I guess I should say. So the VCG mechanism is defined super generally.
00:10:35.698 - 00:11:06.530, Speaker B: This is just very powerful tool if you only care about dominant strategy implementations. And surplus maximization kind of always gets you those two properties. Very often it's computationally intractable. But one thing that's special about scenario three is that it's not going to be computationally intractable, it's going to be polynomial time implementable because surplus maximization is just a matching problem. So it's direct revelation. So you just ask people for their private information. So you collect the BIJS.
00:11:06.530 - 00:11:43.982, Speaker B: Now you're thinking of these as being truthful and you want a surplus maximizing outcome. So it's clear what your allocation rule should be. You just take the bids at face value, assume they're the valuations and compute the thing with a maximum surplus. That is the second step is you compute a max weight bipartite matching with the bids being the weights. So here's the allocation rule. So you compute the max weight matching with respect to the bids and then you charge the right prices. And I'm going to be a little informal about the VCG prices right now.
00:11:43.982 - 00:12:17.798, Speaker B: We did go through them in detail last quarter. I'll remind you about the actual formula a little later. But the gist is you charge people their externality. So charge each bidder its externality. What do I mean it's externality? I mean like, well, first imagine that this bidder I didn't exist and we only optimized for the other N minus one bidders. We get some number. Now suppose instead we optimize jointly for all N bidders and we just look at how much of that surplus the other N minus one bidders get.
00:12:17.798 - 00:12:55.140, Speaker B: That's an only lower number. They're going to get more surplus if I optimize specially for them. So the difference of these is a non negative number and that's the payment under the VCG mechanism of this bidder. Why do you charge people their externalities? The externality can also be thought of as the difference between the social objective function of surplus and the individual objective function of just what you get minus your payment. And we proved last quarter was a simple proof that these payments align those objectives and therefore, indeed, truthful revelation is a dominant strategy with these payments. So I just wanted to remind you, conceptually what these payments are. I'll give you the formula when we actually need the formula in a little bit.
00:12:55.140 - 00:13:28.398, Speaker B: Okay, so this is good. So this means the sanity check passes. We won an ascending implementation. We asked, is there at least a polynomial time DSIC implementation? Yes. The reason we can implement VCG in polynomial time in this particular case. So we pass the sanity check. Now, the hard part or the interesting part perhaps, I guess it's still here.
00:13:28.398 - 00:14:18.266, Speaker B: So the goal is just to get these three properties for scenario number three. So high level design plan. I should also mention scenario one, that was identical goods and unit demand. That's the special case where these Vijs are independent of I sorry, independent of J, where all bidders have the same vij for every good J. Sorry, each bidder I has the same vij for every J. It's incomparable to additive evaluations because here it's unit demand, and that's just a different thing than additive. Okay, so we're generalizing scenario one, we're incomparable to scenario two, but somehow we'd still like to apply the same type of thinking when we design an ascending implementation.
00:14:18.266 - 00:15:09.710, Speaker B: And the two auctions we've seen so far are based on you start prices at zero, things are over demanded, people want lots of goods, but then you increase prices until supply equals demand. So that was true in the original English auction where we had a supply of K. It was true in the parallel English auctions where we had a supply of one for each of the M different goods. So I'm not even going to tell you the final auction until next week. But at a high level, where we're going is we want to initialize P equals zero, and we want to raise prices for the various goods as needed till supply equals demand. Okay. All right, so what does this mean? I want to drill down on this.
00:15:09.710 - 00:15:49.446, Speaker B: So this is like our 30,000 foot high level idea of what this thing might look like. All right, so supply is clear. So we have one copy of each of the M items. What's demanding you give me a vector of prices and say, at these prices, which single item would I most prefer? Good. So in the original English auction, where there was only one kind of good for sale and we were looking at a given price, we just asked people, do you want it or not? So every bidder contributed a zero or one. We added up how many people wanted it. We just compared it to k.
00:15:49.446 - 00:16:10.094, Speaker B: So it was yes, no question. Sort of the same thing with the parallel English auctions. For each English auction, it was a yes no question. Do you want this or not. Now, with unit demand bidders here and different goods, at the end of the day, we know a bidder is only going to get one item at most. So we're actually not going to ask it a yes no question. We're going to ask it a richer question.
00:16:10.094 - 00:16:57.182, Speaker B: We're going to say, well, given the prices that we've currently set for each of the M items, which one's your favorite? What does favorite mean? Well, it means your net utility for it is the highest, your value for it, minus the price you'd have to pay. And so now a bidder, instead of just contributing one number, it contributes in some sense, one number to one of the goods. Exactly. One of the goods or at most one of the goods. So rather than overall demand, let me just say demand of I a bitter I is going to be it's fave good at the current prices, q. And again, by fave, I mean highest Vij minus QJ. And of course, if all of these are negative, then the bidder says, I don't want any of them at the current prices.
00:16:57.182 - 00:17:22.134, Speaker B: So your demand can be the empty set as well. So with that notion of demand, we can start thinking about, does supply equal demand or not? So we look at a good if it's more than one bidder's favorite, then it's over demanded. If there's a good that nobody wants, then it's under demanded. Okay. And so certainly, if you're over demanded, that suggests the price is too low. It suggests maybe you should raise the price. So again, the full description will have to wait till next week.
00:17:22.134 - 00:17:59.570, Speaker B: But I wanted you to kind of have in mind what's the general form of the ascending option going to look like. What are we shooting for? So this is sort of how we're thinking it's going to work at a high level. Good. Now it so another goal. In addition to having this kind of description, we want sincere bidding, by which I mean, every time we ask a bidder for its favorite good, it tells us which one is its favorite with respect to its actual valuations, we want sincere bidding.
