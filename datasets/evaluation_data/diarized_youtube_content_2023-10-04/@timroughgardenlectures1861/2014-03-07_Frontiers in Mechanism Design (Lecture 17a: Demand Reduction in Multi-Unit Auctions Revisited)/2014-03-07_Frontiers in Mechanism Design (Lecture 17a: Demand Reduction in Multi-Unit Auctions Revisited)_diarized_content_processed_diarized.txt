00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.718, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:00:00.804 - 00:00:49.546, Speaker B: All right, so let's go ahead and get started. So the first of the two lectures is going to be the culmination of part four of the course. So remember, this is where we insist on simple auction formats, and we're asking for which formats and under which conditions. For example, on the valuations are Equilibria guaranteed to be good? Is the Price of anarchy guaranteed to be close to one? So in the last so we've had three lectures on this topic so far, and for concreteness, all three of those have been on exactly the same type of auction format, simultaneous, single item auctions. We've looked at both the second price version and the first price version, and it's been convenient to be concrete to develop our toolbox. And now we have both extension theorems and composition theorems to prove bounds in the price of anarchy. But what I want to emphasize in this lecture is that our toolbox is rich enough to cover other kinds of interesting auction formats as well.
00:00:49.546 - 00:01:29.514, Speaker B: And so the first topic for today's lecture, we're going to revisit sort of an old friend and applied the same toolbox to prove some interesting new bounds. And then I'm going to show you basically how you can go beyond the smoothness framework and cover even more general settings than we've done so far. So both of these results are just from the past three to six months or so. So all of you are really completely up on the cutting edge. Okay? So let's go to the first topic. So the price of anarchy of demand reduction. So let me remind you about both a setting and an auction format and incentive issues that we were discussing in the very first part of the course.
00:01:29.514 - 00:01:41.070, Speaker B: So this was in lectures, I think, three and four. So this was at the time we were calling it scenario number four. So this was where we had identical items.
00:01:43.170 - 00:01:43.920, Speaker A: Okay?
00:01:48.610 - 00:02:28.060, Speaker B: And bidders are not necessarily unit demand. They want many items. But the assumption in scenario four is that the valuations are downward sloping. So the marginal value of each additional item at most is non increasing, is decreasing as you get more and more items. So downward sloping valuations, and such a valuation is specified by the marginal values of getting A jth copy of the good A jth good. And so downward sloping just means that the marginal values are only going down.
00:02:32.930 - 00:02:33.680, Speaker A: Okay?
00:02:35.090 - 00:03:21.190, Speaker B: So this is the special case of the gross substitutes scenario, when you have identical items. So gross substitutes was the extension of this to heterogeneous items. And let me just remind you a little bit about this scenario. So let's recall what the welfare maximizing allocation rule is, because it's very simple in this setting, and we used it back in the day, and we're going to use it again today. So suppose you knew the actual marginal valuations. How would you allocate the M items, how would you split them up amongst the N bidders to make the welfare as big as possible. Well, remember, this is just a simple greedy algorithm.
00:03:21.190 - 00:04:08.598, Speaker B: So you would just sort the marginal values. You basically just sort of write so you have N times M numbers, n bidders, M marginal values for each of them. Of those Nm numbers, you would look at the highest M of them and those would correspond to the allocations of the M items that you've got. So really, all you'd do, you'd sort all the mijs depending it may be that one bidder gets all of them that's fine. It may be these are split amongst the bidders in different ways. So sort all the marginal values allocate to the highest end of them. And this makes sense because valuations are downward sloping.
00:04:08.598 - 00:04:44.134, Speaker B: So because the MU's are only going down as J increases, this means that by giving allocating to the highest mu IJs, each bidder, I will get an allocation corresponding to a prefix. So the highest ten mu IJs for a corresponding bidder I will be those with J equal one through ten. So that's why this makes sense. Downward sloping is important for that to successfully maximize welfare. Okay, so this is the allocation rule. So suppose you wanted to turn this into a mechanism. How would you do it? Well, so we're back into settings that we understand well.
00:04:44.134 - 00:05:46.378, Speaker B: So if you could just do a direct revelation mechanism, you could just run the VCG mechanism, that would be fine. Our main concern when we talked about scenario number four was at the time we were concerned about ascending implementations. So yes, there's the VCG mechanism, but we worked hard to develop this other ascending auction, the clinching auction, which at termination, assuming sincere bidding, terminated with the appropriate allocation and the VCG payments. So the clinching auction was what was the main thing we studied in scenario four a couple of months ago? And one thing I want you to remember about either the VCG mechanism or the clinching auction, whichever in this setting, is that different items are sold at different prices, even though all the items are identical. The clinching auction, for example, we had this price, the price went up over time and as the auction proceeded as a bidder, you would clinch items successively at higher and higher prices. So you'd end up with like ten items. You'd pay something for item one, something larger for item two, something larger for item three, and so on.
00:05:46.464 - 00:05:46.954, Speaker A: Okay?
00:05:47.072 - 00:06:17.730, Speaker B: So to get dominant strategy incentive compatibility or expose incentive compatibility, we had to sell the items for different prices. So that's what we did in scenario four. Now, to motivate the clinching auction, what I did is I actually said, well, let's do something even simpler and see where it goes wrong. And where it went wrong is what motivated the VCG mechanism. So even simpler than the clinching auction, the VCG mechanism would, you know, all the items are the same. Let's just sort of draw a supply curve and draw a demand curve. Wait till they cross and set the price where they cross.
00:06:17.730 - 00:06:45.470, Speaker B: So in other words, in addition to the clinching auction, our punching bag in that lecture was uniform pricing, which was if you're given bids. So I'm going to call the bids BIJS. You just sell to the highest or the top BIJS at a price equal to the M plus one highest bid.
00:06:49.090 - 00:06:49.840, Speaker A: Okay?
00:06:52.130 - 00:07:22.010, Speaker B: So in other words, this mechanism has exactly the same allocation rule as VCG, as we said over here, given the BIJS, you allocate according to the highest M of them, but the payment rule is different and simpler. So VCG, the clinching auction, you charge different things for different items. Here we're going to charge exactly the same thing if you're going to charge exactly the same thing for all of them. Well, inspired by the vicary auction, one thing you might try to do would just be you take the highest losing bid and that sets the price for everybody else.
00:07:22.160 - 00:07:22.860, Speaker A: Okay?
00:07:23.790 - 00:07:52.930, Speaker B: So this, I hope, is all review. Another thing we were sort of using to illustrate at this time, this is also when we were talking about Walraze and equilibria. And so you can think of uniform pricing as basically trying to implement the smallest Walrazan equilibrium in a mechanism. So in this identical good setting, they're all in equilibria. So that's just the price where the market clears. Those are just going to be all the prices between the Mth highest and the M plus one highest bij. So this price corresponds to the smallest of the wars in equilibrium.
00:07:52.930 - 00:08:36.370, Speaker B: And we were just coming from settings while the lowest wars in equilibrium in fact gave us incentive compatible mechanisms, unit demand bidders. And we used this mechanism to illustrate that that doesn't continue to work when you have identical items. Okay, let me remind you why this doesn't continue to work. Why? This isn't incentive compatible. It's because of something called demand reduction. So even suppose M equals two. So again, the point of this example is just to show that in the mechanism where you use the welfare maximizing allocation rule and you use uniform pricing, it's not dominant strategy incentive compatible.
00:08:36.370 - 00:08:50.790, Speaker B: You allow players to report downward sloping valuations. They have the option of telling the truth, but they're not going to in general. So why? Well, just suppose you have one additive bidder and one unit demand bidder.
00:08:52.410 - 00:08:53.160, Speaker A: Okay?
00:08:53.690 - 00:09:33.380, Speaker B: So bidder one is additive, it gets three for each item that it gets. And bidder two is unit demand. So it wants one item for a value of two and it has no marginal value for a second item. So the claim is that the first bidder does not have an incentive to bid truthfully. Okay, so assume the second bidder does bid truthfully. So why not? Well, if bidder one did bid truthfully, how many items would it get.
00:09:35.830 - 00:09:36.242, Speaker A: Two?
00:09:36.296 - 00:09:37.142, Speaker B: It would get both.
00:09:37.196 - 00:09:37.800, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:38.170 - 00:09:47.076, Speaker B: What would be the price for each one? Also two.
00:09:47.178 - 00:09:47.732, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:47.866 - 00:10:03.992, Speaker B: So there's sort of four if all the bids are truthful. Well, in any case, there's four bids, four BIJS, there's M goods. The top two win with the truthful bids. These will be the winners. What's the clearing price? It's just the highest losing bid. This is the highest losing bid. Okay, so that's what would happen.
00:10:03.992 - 00:10:32.964, Speaker B: Bidder one tells the truth. It would get six value, but it would pay two each for a utility of two. Okay, suppose instead that bidder one engages in demand reduction. That is, it replaces this with a zero. Sorry, it replaces mu one two with a zero says actually, I'll just pretend to be unit demand and my value is three. Okay, so now in the allocation so now that the second thing is a zero. The highest two bids are the first unit bid from each bidder, three and two.
00:10:32.964 - 00:10:52.552, Speaker B: So those are the winners. Each bidder gets exactly one unit and allegedly nobody wanted a second unit. So the highest losing bid is zero. So we just give both goods away for free, one to each bidder. So then bidder one, it gets fewer items, only gets one, but it pays nothing. So its utility is three better than two. Okay, so that's demand reduction and it's real.
00:10:52.552 - 00:11:04.716, Speaker B: And you see this in practice when people implement this auction, and sometimes they do bidders have an incentive to get fewer quantities than they would otherwise want because they wind up getting it at a much cheaper price. And so overall it's a win.
00:11:04.818 - 00:11:05.470, Speaker A: Okay.
00:11:10.580 - 00:12:19.210, Speaker B: So number one would prefer one unit at price zero, which it gets with a false report over two units at price two each, which would give it only utility two. Okay, so that's a concrete demonstration that the uniform pricing mechanism is not Dsick because of demand reduction. But now that we're in this part four of the course, maybe we were tempted to say, well, so what? Maybe we want to use this anyways. So now we have a toolbox for reasoning about mechanisms which are not truthful, which are not Dsick, where we don't even know what bidders are going to do, where we don't can't even solve for equilibria. So maybe actually this simple mechanism, maybe its equilibria are pretty good anyways, and then maybe there are contexts in which we'd want to use it. Okay, so that's the first half of this first lecture is the price of anarchy of demand reduction. So what's the price of anarchy of this mechanism? So any questions about up to that point? Okay, and then a quick full disclosure.
00:12:19.210 - 00:12:41.682, Speaker B: So of the two lectures we're going to do today, so the first one is the last lecture of a part. So this first half is going to be kind of a little on the technical side, but comparable to last week. And it might be a little bit longer. It might be more like 90 minutes. But then the second lecture being the introduction to a new topic is going to be shorter and easier. So you're duly warned. All right.
00:12:41.682 - 00:13:23.390, Speaker B: So here's what we're going to prove. We are going to prove a bound on the price of anarchy of demand reduction. And so I'm going to show you sort of a blend of two papers just from the past few months. I'll put links up on the website so you might recall from simultaneous single item auction discussion for the second price rules we had these no overbidding conditions which were necessary for good bounds. And here this has the flavor of a second price auction. So we're not charging people what they bid, we're charging them something that could be quite a bit less than what they're bidding. So again the guarantee will be under a no overbidding assumption.
00:13:23.390 - 00:14:02.494, Speaker B: So with no overbidding we're going to prove that the Bayes Nash price of anarchy is a constant bounded below by a quarter. And this is going to be actually even for correlated prior distributions, which is pretty cool. We've seen almost no results for correlated priors. The only one we ever saw was when we talked about a single item auction with the first price rule. So we're going to see a second example of that today. Okay, so that's the main result. So demand reduction while definitely as we know, can affect efficiency at equilibrium, it can only affect you so much.
00:14:02.612 - 00:14:03.360, Speaker A: All right.
00:14:05.490 - 00:14:57.390, Speaker B: All right. So what we now know we have this toolbox of extension theorems and I'm not going to go back over them again. We know that proving bounds like this just boils down to proving a suitable smoothness condition. So I'm just going to state the smoothness condition. It will be familiar from the last several lectures. So it boils down to the following smoothness condition. So we want to prove is that for every valuation profile mu there exists hypothetical deviations which are allowed to depend on mu such that and again this is exactly the same order of quantifiers we've been talking about the last couple of lectures.
00:14:57.390 - 00:15:51.870, Speaker B: It's okay if you don't remember the details, but this is exactly what it was before, just trust me. So we're given a valuation profile, we sort of figure out how to deviate. What we were doing in simultaneous second price auctions is we were saying, well, compute the optimal allocation for this valuation. Look at the items I'm supposed to get in the optimal allocation and now bid all in for that allocation. Those were the b stars we were talking about last time. So for every valuation profile, figure out deviations b star and then remember smoothest conditions, you're always proving some inequality with respect to every possible bid vector b, whether or not it's an equilibrium such that for all bid vectors b and then it's this disentangling inequality. Okay, so we say, well, let's look at the utility of people after they deviate unilaterally.
00:15:51.870 - 00:16:33.274, Speaker B: So this is an entangled version of the deviations and of this arbitrary vector B. And we want to disentangle it. We want to say it's at least in this case, we're going to say it's at least half of the opt welfare for the valuation profile under consideration. And then, as usual, it's going to be the sum of all of the winning equilibrium bids. So again, this is going to be exactly the same as what it was before. So here's going to be the notation I sum over the bidders. I'm going to look at how many so XIB this denotes how many copies of the item bidder I gets in this bid profiles is going to be like seven items, something like that.
00:16:33.274 - 00:16:45.326, Speaker B: And then I just look at the bid that the player submitted for each of those copies. So this is the sum of the bid submitted by bidder I on the items that it wins in the outcome.
00:16:45.438 - 00:16:46.100, Speaker A: Okay?
00:16:47.030 - 00:17:07.282, Speaker B: And again, all of this is exactly what it was last time. So we're going to call this star. And I'm just going to ask you to verify offline or recall if it's fresh in your mind that if we prove this inequality, then we're going to get this bound.
00:17:07.426 - 00:17:08.120, Speaker A: Okay?
00:17:08.730 - 00:17:26.190, Speaker B: We're going to get this bound assuming that we have no overbidding. So no overbidding just asserts that this is at most sum over j equal one to x I of B of the marginal values.
00:17:30.210 - 00:17:30.960, Speaker A: Okay?
00:17:35.890 - 00:17:52.390, Speaker B: It and recall that the way we use no forbidding conditions is that allows us to take this error term upper bounded by the welfare in B. That's the term that winds up getting subtracted and then divided back through. Okay, so it's all the usual maneuvers. So if we can prove star, then we get our bound of one fourth.
00:17:52.810 - 00:17:56.370, Speaker A: Do we have any idea of how bad it gets if we do allow overbidding?
00:17:56.450 - 00:18:26.974, Speaker B: Yes, and in fact, if I was still doing exercise sets, this would be an exercise. It's at that level of easiness. And actually, if you go back and you stare at the proofs, it's quite clear. So if you overbid by most a factor of gamma, then this bound is going to degrade in some linear way in gamma. So the proofs just wind up working very nicely. So certainly people are not I mean, certainly if people are overbidding by 1020 percent, then all of the qualitative conclusions are totally exactly the same. If they're overbidding by a factor of ten, you still have a constant.
00:18:26.974 - 00:18:38.942, Speaker B: But it's not looking like such a good constant anymore. Yeah, good question. Okay, good. So assuming this no overbidding condition, assuming we prove star, we'll get the bound of one fourth.
00:18:39.006 - 00:18:39.234, Speaker A: Okay?
00:18:39.272 - 00:18:57.530, Speaker B: And it's exactly like the simultaneous second price auction analysis there. We had a one half the reason we got a one half there, and we're getting a one quarter there for simultaneous second price auctions. We did not have a one half here. We just had a coefficient of one. So this extra coefficient of one half is why we're getting a one four instead of the one half we got two lectures ago.
00:18:57.680 - 00:18:58.380, Speaker A: Okay.
00:19:00.990 - 00:19:56.126, Speaker B: All right, so any questions about that? So the rest of this part of the lecture is just going to be I'm just going to show you the b stars, which gets you an equality star. And then I forgot to say, right, so that's how you get the one fourth for what equilibrium concepts do you get them? We saw a bunch of different extension theorems for Bayesian's equilibrium in the last couple of lectures, but there were sort of two main different ones. And it boiled down to how these b stars are chosen. The one that you've seen mostly remember, we have these canonical b stars in mind. Like, you compute the optimal allocation, and then you go all in for what you're supposed to get in the optimal allocation. So then the b stars depend not only b star I depends not only on VI, it depends on the full valuation profile. So to compute the optimal allocation, it's not enough to just know what my valuation is.
00:19:56.126 - 00:20:34.342, Speaker B: I need to know everybody's valuation to compute the optimal allocation. And so then for deviations defined in that way, where b star depends on the full valuation profile, we're able to extend the price of anarchy bounds to Bayesnash equilibria for an arbitrary product prior distribution. So we had to assume that the valuations were independent. And the proof where that showed up is we had to use this doppelganger trick. So for a bidder to be able to actually execute b star, it had to have some imaginary valuation profile. Remember, when you reason in a game of incomplete information, you only know your valuation, you don't know the other people's valuations. So b star is not defined if you only know your valuation.
00:20:34.342 - 00:21:02.094, Speaker B: So you just make some up. You just sample some from the publicly known prior distribution. That's the doppelganger trick. And we had a non trivial proof that extended the Bayes Nash price of energy bound to product prior distributions. There's this one case, okay? This was I called a corollary two last lecture. It was just a single item first price auction, and we could get away with super simple b stars. Everybody just bid half their valuation, and you can bid your half your valuation without knowing anything about other valuations.
00:21:02.094 - 00:21:21.986, Speaker B: And what we saw is that in that simple type of b star, simple type of deviation, where it depends only on your valuation VI and not on others, not on V minus I, you actually get the extension theorem for correlated distributions, for totally arbitrary prior distributions. F that's the way proof that was actually a much easier proof that was basically just linearity of expectation.
00:21:22.098 - 00:21:22.710, Speaker A: Okay?
00:21:22.860 - 00:21:51.106, Speaker B: So that's the thing to remember. We have two genres of extension theorems. If b star depends on the full profile, you get it for product priors. If b star I depends only on I's valuation, you get it for correlated priors. So by stating this for correlated priors, what you should be sort of anticipating is that I'm going to show you hypothetical deviations b star, where b star I depends only on, in this case, mu i. That's what's going to enable the extension theorem, which should get me this conclusion. And that's what I'm going to do.
00:21:51.208 - 00:21:51.860, Speaker A: Okay?
00:21:52.390 - 00:22:00.334, Speaker B: All right, so that's the recap of how you compile smoothness conditions like star into Bayes Nash price of energy bounds.
00:22:00.382 - 00:22:00.594, Speaker A: Okay?
00:22:00.632 - 00:22:07.186, Speaker B: And again, it's just exactly the same as before. So I'm just going to show you this. And to show you this, I just need to show you the B stars.
00:22:07.298 - 00:22:08.680, Speaker A: Okay, everyone clear?
00:22:09.450 - 00:22:18.102, Speaker B: So once you get used to this whole template, it becomes very algorithmic. Basically, there's just this way that you prove bounds like this. Just show me the b stars.
00:22:18.166 - 00:22:18.780, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:20.030 - 00:23:01.334, Speaker B: Okay, good. So the B stars are maybe not the first thing you'd try, but they're the second thing you'd try. Okay, so let me explain. All right, so, so far what everything I've said sounds the most like is second price auction, simultaneous second price auctions, right. We have this no overbidding condition, we're charging people less than their bids, et cetera. And so what did we do for what were our b stars in that case? Well, like we said, you compute the optimum allocation and you go all in for the optimal allocation, where in that context we had these XOS valuations. So going all in.
00:23:01.334 - 00:23:26.180, Speaker B: You just looked at the relevant additive valuation that met your optimal bundle and that sort of told you how to bid on the different items. So here it's simpler. That high level idea is simpler. Compute the optimal allocation, go all in on the bundle you're supposed to get. Here's the first thing you try to implement that conceptual idea. So you just bid your value.
00:23:28.790 - 00:23:29.106, Speaker A: Up.
00:23:29.128 - 00:23:59.882, Speaker B: To the number of items you're supposed to get in the optimalocation, and then you just bid zero everywhere after that. Okay, so this is a deviation that depends on the full profile. I look at the full profile, I compute the number of items I get. That's this notation. So this notation is for the profile. Mu, how many items do I get? So this is just a number, like seven. So I bid truthfully up to the number of items I'm supposed to get that's going all in for them, and then I bid zero after that.
00:23:59.882 - 00:24:04.380, Speaker B: Okay, this I think, would be the first thing you would try given what we've done so far.
00:24:06.590 - 00:24:07.340, Speaker A: Okay.
00:24:10.750 - 00:24:12.550, Speaker B: So I'm not going to do the details of this. I'll.
