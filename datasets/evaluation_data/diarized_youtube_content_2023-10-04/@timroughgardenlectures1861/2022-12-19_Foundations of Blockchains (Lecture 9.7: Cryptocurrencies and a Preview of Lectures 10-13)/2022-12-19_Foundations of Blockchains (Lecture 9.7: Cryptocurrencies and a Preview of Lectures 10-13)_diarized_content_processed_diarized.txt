00:00:00.570 - 00:00:51.906, Speaker A: All right, so let me wrap up lecture nine, just kind of giving you a quick orientation of where we're going from here, specifically, starting with the next lecture, starting with lecture number ten, we will for the first time be introducing cryptocurrencies native currencies into our blockchains. It's worth actually pointing out we've now completed nine fairly lengthy lectures on the foundations of blockchain s, and the entire time we have not mentioned cryptocurrencies. And so while it's true that the story of blockchain technology and the story of cryptocurrencies, at least up to this point, has been very sort of tightly intertwined, and while it's true that a native currency is a very natural feature to add to a blockchain, it has a lot of sort of convenient uses.
00:00:51.906 - 00:01:06.806, Speaker A: In my opinion, cryptocurrencies are not fundamental to blockchain technologies. Again, they may continue to be very closely intertwined for many years to come. But I really think it's worth understanding which parts of blockchains are independent of whether or not the blockchain has a native currency.
00:01:06.806 - 00:01:28.114, Speaker A: And then separately, what if the blockchain does have a native currency? What additional technical challenges does that pose? And that's exactly what we're segue in between right now. So lectures one through nine, that's been technical challenges of building blockchain technologies, specifically around consensus protocols. It's really independent of whether the blockchain has a cryptocurrency or not.
00:01:28.114 - 00:01:43.494, Speaker A: And with lectures ten and then 11, 12, 13, we're going to be thinking about sort of extra things you have to worry about if you have a native currency. So there's a lot of reasons why you might want a cryptocurrency as part of your blockchain. I mean, the first reason is just it might be interesting in its own right.
00:01:43.494 - 00:01:59.020, Speaker A: Like maybe actually your goal is to invent a new currency. And the point of the blockchain is just to sort of mint that currency and keep track of the ownership of that currency. And it would seem that that was Nakamoto's primary motivation for inventing Bitcoin back in 2008.
00:01:59.020 - 00:02:16.702, Speaker A: But even if you're not trying to challenge the US. Dollar or really kind of have a sort of currency in the usual sense, even if that's not your goal, there's a number of reasons why you might want to introduce a native currency into a blockchain. So, for example, we've been talking about these proof of work blockchains.
00:02:16.702 - 00:03:02.510, Speaker A: And so nodes running the protocol have to be sort of solving these kind of hard puzzles and sort of investing sort of time and energy into producing a given hash rate in order to produce blocks. And a natural question, especially in the permissionless setting, if we're just thinking about people, random people kind of downloading software off the internet and sort of running a node, you kind of got to wonder, why would people bother to do this? Why would I sort of download software that's going to chew up sort of a ton of my computer's computational power to run this random blockchain protocol. And so one thing you can do is you can use a native currency to incentivize nodes to run the protocol by giving them rewards, rewards for actively participating in the protocol with those rewards denominated in the blockchain's native currency.
00:03:02.510 - 00:03:36.150, Speaker A: So for longest chain consensus protocols, a very sort of simple way to do that is that whenever anyone solves a hard puzzle and sort of creates a new block that winds up on the longest chain, that there's sort of a block reward. So there's some fixed amount of native currency that gets transferred to whoever successfully solved the puzzle, whoever successfully produced a block. So, for example, at this time of recording, if you're producing blocks for the Bitcoin protocol, you will be rewarded in the form of six and a quarter Bitcoins.
00:03:36.150 - 00:04:04.242, Speaker A: So six and a quarter coins in the Bitcoin protocol's native currency as of this recording, that has a dollar value in the low six figures. So definitely a nontrivial monetary reward for producing blocks for the Bitcoin protocol. Now, if you're doling out sort of meaningful monetary rewards for producing blocks, it seems intuitively clear there's going to be people who sort of buy machines to try to produce blocks because they might be able to make a profit off of it.
00:04:04.242 - 00:04:51.726, Speaker A: So that's good, right? So you're incentivizing people to actually sort of run the protocol, but as soon as you kind of introduce rewards into the picture, you have to kind of step back and worry, wait a minute, are we at all incentivizing them kind of too much or sort of in the wrong way? Right? Because the worry is that nodes, even if they're not Byzantine, even if they have no interest in sort of bringing down your protocol, it's pretty reasonable to assume they'd be profit maximizing, right? And so we kind of want to sanity check that we've introduced incentives in a way that motivates nodes to run the protocol as we intended to run the protocol, as if they were honest nodes. So that's going to be exactly the topic of the next lecture of lecture number ten. We're going to ask that question with the way block rewards are handled traditionally in Nakamoto Consensus, like in the Bitcoin protocol.
00:04:51.726 - 00:05:18.630, Speaker A: Is it true that acting like an honest node is a profit maximizing behavior for nodes running the protocol? And we'll see that at least in some cases, the answer is actually no. So there are some additional incentive issues that sort of enter the picture when you introduce block rewards into longest chain consensus, and we'll study that in detail in lecture number ten. A second very convenient use of a native currency is to charge for the usage of a blockchain.
00:05:18.630 - 00:05:28.334, Speaker A: So thus far, we haven't really been talking at all about sort of capacity constraints. We've just been kind of assuming blocks in a blockchain can be arbitrarily large. As you can imagine in practice, that's not true.
00:05:28.334 - 00:05:49.830, Speaker A: You have to sort of have some cap on how large blocks can be. So there's some cap on sort of how many transactions are realistically going to be added to a blockchain per second, say. And so especially if the demand for the blockchain exceeds that supply, right? So if really there isn't enough capacity to sort of handle everybody who would like to be included in the blockchain, then it's very natural to start pricing for transactions.
00:05:49.830 - 00:06:04.826, Speaker A: All right? So that's sort of supernatural. But notice that that is going to necessitate sort of a new piece of a blockchain protocol that we haven't talked about so far. A piece of the protocol that decides kind of which transactions are the ones that get included and what are the prices that they are going to have to pay.
00:06:04.826 - 00:06:25.504, Speaker A: So that's something known as a transaction fee mechanism. And that'll be the subject of lecture number eleven. Having a native currency also unlocks alternative approaches to civil resistance beyond proof of work, and in particular proof of stake, which will be the subject of lecture number twelve.
00:06:25.504 - 00:06:56.632, Speaker A: That's sort of a different kind of incomparable, civil resistant mechanism that's used in a number of major blockchains today that obviously only makes sense if you have a native currency in which nodes can stake. Finally, sort of as a consequence of rewarding nodes for running the protocol, they're going to wind up devoting economic resources to running the protocol. So they're going to buy machines to increase their hash rate, like in a proof of work context, they're going to lock up stake, incurring capital costs in a proof of stake context.
00:06:56.632 - 00:07:22.480, Speaker A: But in any case, the nodes running the protocol basically have incurred economic costs in order to help run the protocol, which they're then getting rewarded for. So they'll make profit at the end, but they're sort of investing in the running of the protocol. And what we're going to see in lecture number 13 is that basically that means that an attacker who, for example, wants to sort of buy machines to control 51% of the overall hash rate to sort of control the blockchain.
00:07:22.480 - 00:07:53.110, Speaker A: The cost it would take to mount that kind of attack will scale with the amount of economic investment being done by the non Byzantine nodes. So having a native currency, by enabling these incentives, it also basically forces an attacker to spend a lot of money to successfully attack a blockchain. So that's what you have to look forward to over the next four lectures.
00:07:53.110 - 00:08:04.760, Speaker A: So next up is lecture number ten, where we're going to introduce block rewards and talk about sort of at least academically very famous attack on proof of work blockchains known as selfish mining. So I'll see you there.
