00:00:00.490 - 00:00:23.178, Speaker A: All right, so just the story so far. So let's just sort of recap where we are. So what we've accomplished is we have this linear program with a reasonably small number of decision variables, where the whole point is that we phrase everything only in terms of the interim allocation and payment rules.
00:00:23.178 - 00:00:29.126, Speaker A: And so what are the constraints? We have Bayesian compatibility constraints. Those are easy. The individual rationality constraints are easy.
00:00:29.126 - 00:00:53.214, Speaker A: And then we have these border constraints saying that one is at most two. There aren't too many of these incentive compatibility constraints. They're just for all I, for all true tripes, for all reported types, there are even fewer individual rationality constraints for all bidders, for all true types, there's a ton of border constraints, tons of them.
00:00:53.214 - 00:01:24.770, Speaker A: Okay? So these are for all J, all items. And then for each fixed J, you have to have a choice of the restricted set of valuations. Okay? So certainly exponentially many constraints, okay? And then non negativity and feasible solutions are exactly the reduced forms.
00:01:24.770 - 00:01:28.830, Speaker A: And remember, reduced form is just the fancy word for the Y's and the Q's.
00:01:28.930 - 00:01:29.434, Speaker B: Okay?
00:01:29.552 - 00:01:34.486, Speaker A: But the point is they're actual Y's and Q's induced by bona fide mechanisms, XP.
00:01:34.598 - 00:01:35.258, Speaker B: Okay?
00:01:35.424 - 00:02:09.110, Speaker A: So we have a linear program with much smaller dimensions that does indeed capture all of the reduced forms. And I think it's useful to have a sort of very coarse geometric view of what's going on. Okay, so the geometric view is a projection.
00:02:09.110 - 00:02:22.006, Speaker A: Okay? And again, as you've seen, because all of the complications are with feasibility and feasibility in the problems we're studying only references. The allocation rule, I'm often just going to ignore the P's and Q's. I'm just going to focus on the X's and Y's.
00:02:22.006 - 00:02:44.020, Speaker A: That's where all the hard stuff is. So in general, what we're doing is we have this high dimensional set of X's. This is my attempt at a high dimensional polytope, and then we're projecting it onto a lower dimensional space.
00:02:45.990 - 00:02:46.740, Speaker B: Okay?
00:02:48.550 - 00:03:17.210, Speaker A: So I'm going to call this set X, and these are the Y's, which I'm going to call capital Y. And so this mapping so just to be clear, so what is this projection? So the Xijv arrows, so this is the X post allocation rule, are inducing the yijvis via this average. So just this weighted sum.
00:03:17.210 - 00:03:41.394, Speaker A: So this again is just the definition of the interim rule. But again, what I want to emphasize here is just this is just some linear function, okay? So we get the Y's by just applying some linear projection type operator to the X's. So this is basically what's going on.
00:03:41.394 - 00:03:52.518, Speaker A: So this high dimensional polytope, we had an explicit description of. That's what we started today with. That's when we had the variables, the X's and the P's indexed over all of the valuation profiles v.
00:03:52.518 - 00:04:01.500, Speaker A: So it's huge dimensions, but it was very easy to just write down all of the constraints. Okay, so we had this exact character. We had an explicit description of what this was.
00:04:01.500 - 00:04:15.818, Speaker A: So then what did we do? So then we said, let's pass to the interim rules. So we basically figured out what dimension we wanted, what the variables were. And what we just did is we just figured out an explicit description of the projection of this polytope.
00:04:15.914 - 00:04:16.174, Speaker B: Okay?
00:04:16.212 - 00:04:33.630, Speaker A: So we said take all the real allocation rules, project them into the Y's, and now what happens to the constraints? And can we get a handle on what those constraints look like? And this is them. Okay, so these are exactly the defining half spaces for the projection of the polytope.
00:04:33.710 - 00:04:33.954, Speaker B: Okay?
00:04:33.992 - 00:04:51.450, Speaker A: So that's what this is. Explicit description of the projected polytope. Okay, so that's just worth kind of keeping in mind as a rough guide because we're going to have some geometric arguments in this lecture.
00:04:51.450 - 00:05:25.810, Speaker A: Now, remember, so in this lecture, what I want to focus on is really structurally, can we have an analog of can we have some version that says revenue reduces to some variant on virtual welfare maximization? And I claim, if you think about it, here would be the best case scenario. So a special case of what we're trying to do is the single parameter theory, which requires virtual welfare maximization we've seen even in a single buyer. We need randomization.
00:05:25.810 - 00:05:41.658, Speaker A: So what would be the simplest imaginable description of optimal auctions? Well, I guess it would be a randomization over virtual welfare maximizers. That's kind of the conceptually simplest thing we could possibly hope to be true. And shockingly, it actually is true in problems we care about.
00:05:41.658 - 00:06:13.294, Speaker A: Okay, so that's going to be the point of this lecture. So best case scenario, opt auction is a distribution over virtual welfare maximizers, which I'll define exactly what that means a little later. Okay, so vwms so the two things that are going to be more complicated than in the single parameter theory.
00:06:13.294 - 00:06:25.558, Speaker A: First of all, there's the randomization, but we know that's necessary. The second thing is, and this is not surprising, we're not going to have some formula, we're not going to have this V minus one minus capital F divided by little F. I mean, that's just way too good to hope for.
00:06:25.558 - 00:06:35.900, Speaker A: So the analog of those virtual values is just going to be computed from some linear program. But once you compute it, it gives you the functions and then you do a suitable randomization and you're good to go.
00:06:38.190 - 00:06:38.906, Speaker B: All right?
00:06:39.008 - 00:06:57.242, Speaker A: So at the same time, I'm going to go beyond additive, okay? And I'm not going to define generally what one can handle, but I just want to think about this representative special case of unit demand bidders.
00:06:57.386 - 00:07:06.120, Speaker B: Okay? It.
00:07:09.610 - 00:07:36.734, Speaker A: Yeah, so not additive is the point. Um, and if you think about it, this already, so what we did last lecture does not apply to unit demand bidders. Okay? And the reason is is because for unit demand bidders, we basically want to add some constraints to the original x post linear program, the high dimensional linear program.
00:07:36.734 - 00:07:51.274, Speaker A: So change in the non reduced LP. So, remember, a unit demand bidder. So, again, like additive bidders, you have these Vijs, but when you get a bundle, you don't take the sum, you take the max.
00:07:51.274 - 00:08:11.220, Speaker A: And the way we normally think about that is like, well, okay, if people only want their best them, let's just only give them one. And so you usually just restrict allocations to give each bidder at most one item, and then it's basically like bipartite matching, right? So if you think about that, you're like, okay, so now, back in the original non reduced LP last lecture, we had the constraint that every item was allocated to only one.
