00:00:01.690 - 00:00:14.494, Speaker A: So at this point, all of you know as much about the Price of Anarchy with simultaneous second price auctions as anyone in the world. I'm not kidding. So not much more to say about that.
00:00:14.494 - 00:00:41.014, Speaker A: So but I do want to show you that there are some other auction formats. And for this lecture, I actually just want to focus totally on first price auctions. Even for single item auctions, it's sort of interesting to talk about first price auctions, which we haven't done yet, but then we'll also be able to extend those results to simultaneous first price auctions, by which, of course, I just mean you actually pay your bid.
00:00:41.014 - 00:00:54.714, Speaker A: You don't pay the second highest bid. If you win, you really pay what you said you'd pay. And both this quarter and last quarter, we've talked very little about first price auctions, at least in comparison to second price auctions.
00:00:54.714 - 00:01:14.110, Speaker A: And the main reason that that's been true is because of our focus on these strong incentive compatibility guarantees, these DSIC guarantees, which of course the vicary auction has and the first price auction hasn't. So the first price auction just hasn't come up very much. But actually, now that we're talking about these simultaneous auctions, it's not like using the second price rule.
00:01:14.110 - 00:01:24.306, Speaker A: You certainly don't have a dominant strategy in these simultaneous second price auctions. We know that. In fact, if you just think intuitively, this is not a rigorous statement, but it's not even clear it helps.
00:01:24.306 - 00:01:29.794, Speaker A: It being easier to play at all right? In a single item auction, it's great. You don't reason about the rest of the world at all. You just bid your valuation.
00:01:29.794 - 00:01:48.314, Speaker A: It's guaranteed to be good if it's the simultaneous thing. If I asked you, which would you prefer? Would it be easier for you if I used a second price rule or a first price rule? Probably a lot of people would say a first price rule. Frankly, it might actually be easier to reason about how to bid in one of these with a first price rule.
00:01:48.314 - 00:02:15.842, Speaker A: Certainly, though, at least first price rule would be at least as well motivated, if not more so, than the second price rule. Once we pass to these sort of simple mechanisms for complex settings, and actually, as we'll see, we'll be able to get better bounds for first price rules, so we'll do even better than we did in the second price case, which is pretty cool. All right, so let me just sort of remind you of the very, very basics.
00:02:15.842 - 00:02:43.642, Speaker A: So I'm going to talk for the beginning part of the lecture, even just about a single item, which we have talked about some now and again. But so, just to remind you, suppose there's just one item, and sort of the canonical example would be you have Nbidders IID, let's say, uniform distribution between zero and one. Okay, certainly there's no dominant strategy.
00:02:43.642 - 00:02:51.730, Speaker A: You want to shade your bid, the amount by which you want to shade your bid. Sort of depends on what other people are doing. But in this case there's a unique Bayes Nash equilibrium.
00:02:51.730 - 00:03:06.326, Speaker A: And so given that your value is VI, you want to shade it. And if everybody's uniform zero one, the amount you want to shade it by is exactly an N minus one over N factor. So we certainly talked about this when N equals two.
00:03:06.326 - 00:03:23.898, Speaker A: And we did a derivation on the board showing that bidding half your value is optimal assuming the other player is also bidding half their value. Same calculation shows this. In fact, more generally, if all bidders are IID and a first price auction, there's a very nice explanation of what you should do at the Bayes Nash equilibrium.
00:03:23.898 - 00:03:36.638, Speaker A: You should say, well, suppose I actually am going to win. Suppose I actually am the highest bidder. Then let me condition on that fact that's sort of the only relevant case for me is when I am the highest.
00:03:36.638 - 00:04:03.366, Speaker A: And then conditional on the event that I have the highest valuation, what is the expected value of the second highest valuation? So, like, think if there's just two bidders and we're both uniform zero one, I have some valuation zero six or whatever condition on me being the highest. Well now, conditional on that, the other person's uniform between zero and zero six and the expected value of the other person is zero three. And so in that case I bid.
00:04:03.366 - 00:04:12.538, Speaker A: Exactly. So this bidding half your value is exactly bidding your expected value sorry, the expected other person's value, given that you're the higher one. Same thing here.
00:04:12.538 - 00:04:25.910, Speaker A: This is the expected second highest given that you're the highest and everybody's uniform. And actually that exact same formula gives you the unique Bayes Nash equilibrium for any IID setting. It's not that easy to prove uniqueness, but it can be proved.
00:04:25.910 - 00:04:35.426, Speaker A: Okay, right. And so this is also sort of intuitive, I think. So basically this says as the competition increases, you can get away with Shading less and less and less.
00:04:35.426 - 00:04:41.730, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. When you say unique, you mean there's no other equilibrium. There's no other Bayes Nash Equilibria in the ID setting.
00:04:41.730 - 00:04:45.320, Speaker A: Exactly. But that's not very easy to prove. That takes some work.
00:04:45.320 - 00:04:59.820, Speaker A: What's not too hard to prove is that there's no other symmetric Equilibria where everybody uses exactly the same biding function. So notice here it's symmetric. So this formula does not depend on I.
00:04:59.820 - 00:05:11.006, Speaker A: What's sort of a pain to rule out is asymmetric Bayes Nash Equilibria where different people use different biding strategies, but it can be done. Okay, good. Right.
00:05:11.006 - 00:05:19.620, Speaker A: So as the competition increases, you can get away with Shading less and less. Which sort of makes some sense. All right.
00:05:19.620 - 00:05:40.730, Speaker A: So as a consequence of what I just said in ID settings, it's not very interesting to talk about the price of anarchy. But the news is good. Price of anarchy is simply equal to one in IID settings.
00:05:40.730 - 00:05:58.094, Speaker A: So in the unique Bayes Natch equilibrium, everybody follows exactly the same biding strategy. And the amount that you bid is strictly increasing in your value. So if everybody uses the same biding strategy that's strictly increasing, it means the highest bidder is always going to be the person with the highest value.
00:05:58.094 - 00:06:04.740, Speaker A: And that means you have full efficiency with probability one. Okay, that's great. So ID case, single item auction, first price.
00:06:04.740 - 00:06:22.386, Speaker A: No problem. Okay, now let's just even stick with the M equals one case for now, but relax the ID assumption. Okay, so we'll stick with it being independent, right? The results.
00:06:22.386 - 00:06:28.310, Speaker A: Last lecture, we needed a product distribution, but we certainly never used identical distributions. Last lecture. That never came up at all.
00:06:28.310 - 00:06:42.186, Speaker A: So let's think about distinct independent distributions. And now this is no longer true. Okay, so if we're running a second price auction, wouldn't matter, right? You don't need a prior at all for the second price auction.
00:06:42.186 - 00:06:54.780, Speaker A: As long as players play dominant strategies, you have full welfare first price auction. If you pass two priors that are not ID, you lose the full welfare property. Okay, so.
