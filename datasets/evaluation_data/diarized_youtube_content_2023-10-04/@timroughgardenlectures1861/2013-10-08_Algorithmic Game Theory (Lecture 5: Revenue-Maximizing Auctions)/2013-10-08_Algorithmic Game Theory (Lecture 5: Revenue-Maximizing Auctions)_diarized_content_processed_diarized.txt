00:00:01.210 - 00:00:18.030, Speaker A: So today I want to begin our discussion of revenue maximizing auctions. So, revenue is a topic we really haven't touched on yet in this class. Ever since we began with the Vic re auction, we've been focused on the objective of social surplus maximization.
00:00:18.030 - 00:00:46.374, Speaker A: So that's all we've talked about so far. We've designed for a number of different application domains, DSIC auctions which maximize surplus. So it's not that we haven't seen payments, there are payments even there in the Vicory auction.
00:00:46.374 - 00:01:00.298, Speaker A: But the point was not really to raise revenue per se. We had payments only to encourage people to do the right thing, only so that we could get a DSIC implementation. Revenue in some sense was a side effect of the incentive constraints.
00:01:00.298 - 00:01:16.486, Speaker A: So today we want to talk about when raising revenue is a first order goal. So let me explain just for a second why I started out by talking about surplus maximizing auctions. And one is just, it's just something you should know.
00:01:16.486 - 00:01:34.634, Speaker A: So it's one of the most fundamental objectives in the theory and practice of auctions. There are definitely real world scenarios where more or less what you want is to do surplus maximization. So one example would be when something like a government auctions off a public good.
00:01:34.634 - 00:02:00.754, Speaker A: So you see that with these auctions run by the FCC to figure out which telecom should own wireless spectrum, for example, then revenue is a consideration for the government in those auctions. But still, the first order goal more or less is surplus maximization, not revenue maximization. Another thing is, in competitive environments, it's thought that you generally are forced to surplus maximization because if you don't maximize the surplus, one of your competitors will.
00:02:00.754 - 00:02:21.580, Speaker A: So sometimes it really is what you want. But a second reason that I started with surplus maximization is pedagogical. So it turns out surplus is special in a technical sense, and that made it easy to start with.
00:02:21.580 - 00:02:57.490, Speaker A: And the reason it's special is because you can maximize surplus in an unusually strong sense, in a sense we will not be able to do with revenue. One way that this would be described is we can maximize surplus, even X post. And essentially what I mean is, just like I said many times in the past, we were designing these auctions that had the cool property, that they were maximizing the surplus as well, as if they had known all of the private information, the bidder valuations up front.
00:02:57.490 - 00:03:06.678, Speaker A: So even if after the fact, I told you what everybody's valuations were, you'd be like, yeah, whatever. I mean, I did the optimal thing anyways, I already figured out the valuations, thank you very much. Okay.
00:03:06.678 - 00:03:36.450, Speaker A: So surplus can be maximized even in the strong sense, as well as if you knew the private information in advance. A different way of thinking about this is you get the DSIC, the incentive constraints for free. They impose no surplus loss.
00:03:36.450 - 00:03:49.190, Speaker A: So let me now do a very simple example. It may seem stupid, but it's actually very illuminating. And I'll drive home this point that profit maximization is just not as simple to think about as surplus maximization.
00:03:49.190 - 00:04:11.390, Speaker A: So I want to look at a single item auction with the additional simplification that there is only one bidder. So one item, one bidder. So the bidder has a private valuation unknown to the seller, and there's one item.
00:04:11.390 - 00:04:31.566, Speaker A: Now, when there's only one bidder, turns out the design space, the space of all auctions you could run, it's not that rich. There aren't that many different things you can do when there's only one bidder you're interacting with. Essentially all you can do is offer that bidder a take it or leave it offer.
00:04:31.566 - 00:04:55.010, Speaker A: Those are the DSIC mechanisms. These are also called prices. It's not going to matter DSIC options.
00:04:55.010 - 00:05:09.646, Speaker A: You don't care generally, so you can think about it either way. So you walk up to the bidder and you say, look, basically you show them the item. You put a price tag on it.
00:05:09.646 - 00:05:11.854, Speaker A: You say, Take it at this price or not.
00:05:11.972 - 00:05:12.640, Speaker B: Okay?
00:05:13.490 - 00:05:45.020, Speaker A: So in a take it or leave it offer with a posted price at a value of R as the seller, your revenue is going to be one of two things. So what happens if it turns out this unknown valuation v is at least the take it or leave it offer that you gave the bidder? What's your revenue going to be? How much money will you make R? And otherwise nothing. They walk away.
00:05:45.020 - 00:06:00.160, Speaker A: So that's kind of the space of possibilities for one bidder and one item. You can also randomize over posted prices. That's not going to change the point I'm making here.
00:06:00.160 - 00:06:28.858, Speaker A: Okay, so suppose this was your situation and you wanted to maximize the surplus. How would you choose R? You didn't care about how much money you make. All you want to do is sort of have the greatest global good possible zero good easy problem.
00:06:28.858 - 00:06:31.674, Speaker A: And if you think about it, that's basically what the vicary auction would do.
00:06:31.712 - 00:06:31.878, Speaker B: Okay?
00:06:31.904 - 00:06:46.450, Speaker A: There's no second bidder, but you could think as if there was a second bidder of bid zero. So to max surplus, just set R equals zero.
00:06:46.600 - 00:06:47.300, Speaker B: Okay?
00:06:47.670 - 00:07:04.150, Speaker A: And notice the answer did not depend on the private valuation v, okay? We don't actually care what this private information is. What we should do is unequivocally defined. That's the sense in which we can even x post maximize surplus.
00:07:04.150 - 00:07:42.660, Speaker A: What if we wanted to maximize revenue? So let me give you sort of an unreasonable, easy version of this question first. What if we wanted to maximize revenue x post? That is, what if we actually knew V? By our telepathic powers, we knew V in advance? How would we set R to raise revenue? We just set it to V, right? We'd set it to be as high as possible, subject to the bidder actually taking it. That would make us the most money? What if we don't know V? How should we set R? You get to set it once.
00:07:42.660 - 00:08:00.966, Speaker A: So in other words, the revelation principle says that boils down to figuring out the last price you're willing to offer. So what's that going to be? It's actually not even really clear how to think about that question. Right? It's not even clear.
00:08:00.966 - 00:08:17.694, Speaker A: It's a well defined, meaningful mathematical question. All right, so we have some kind of fundamental work to do to get a theory of revenue maximizing options up and running. It's not going to be as simple as surplus maximization, but I'm happy to tell you that in very reasonable senses, it's a well solved problem.
00:08:17.694 - 00:08:54.300, Speaker A: So that's what we're going to learn starting today. So, upshot for revenue, unlike for surplus, different auctions do better on different inputs. So, for example, with one bidder, the auction which posts a price of 20, well, that's going to do really great on inputs where the private value is close to 20.
00:08:57.390 - 00:08:58.140, Speaker B: Wow.
00:08:59.630 - 00:09:07.098, Speaker A: And at least 20. And it's going to do extremely poorly on inputs that are close to 20 but below 20. Okay.
00:09:07.098 - 00:09:16.346, Speaker A: And on those inputs, auction that's a posted price of 15 will do better. So which auction is better? It depends on the input. And you don't know what the input is? That's exactly what's private.
00:09:16.346 - 00:09:24.418, Speaker A: Now, as computer scientists, this is not a quandary that is foreign to us. Right. When we reason about algorithms, we face exactly the same problem.
00:09:24.418 - 00:09:33.110, Speaker A: If I ask you which sorting algorithm is better, A or B? Well, sometimes the answer is obvious. Some sorting algorithms are just stupid. But if it's like insertion sort and Quick sort, it's going to depend.
00:09:33.110 - 00:09:44.954, Speaker A: I mean, some inputs, Quicksort will be better, some insertion sort will be better. Same thing with Heuristics for NP, hard problems, traveling salesman problem. What's better? Local search, integer programming? It's going to depends on your input class.
00:09:44.954 - 00:10:40.794, Speaker A: So this is not a new problem, but that doesn't mean it's an easy problem. So what we need then, to even sort of get started is a model which tells us how we should reason about trade offs between our performance on different inputs, because whatever option we wind up advocating will do well on some inputs, worse on the others. So how are we going to argue that our auction is better than some other auction whoops? There are multiple such models that have been well studied, but today we're going to discuss the most classical and most well studied one, which in economics they would call a Bayesian model.
00:10:40.794 - 00:10:56.690, Speaker A: Bayesian analysis. Computer science, you generally call it average case analysis. That is, we will posit a distribution over inputs, that is, a distribution over the private valuations, and seek to do as well as possible on expectation with respect to those distributions.
00:10:56.690 - 00:11:35.920, Speaker A: I'm going to keep working with single parameter environments, the same sort of generality at which Myerson's Lemma applies. As we discussed last week, though, I encourage you in this lecture to go ahead and think about the special case of single item auctions. That's already a very interesting motivating example.
00:11:35.920 - 00:12:02.006, Speaker A: And what's going to be new is that VI, the private valuation of participant I is drawn from a distribution F sub i. So just to jog, you may remember a distribution function if you plug in some value z. What this spits back is the probability that the realization is at most z.
00:12:02.006 - 00:12:22.700, Speaker A: So the range here is zero one. I'm going to assume just a couple of technical points. I'm going to assume that our distributions have densities little F sub I and bounded support.
00:12:22.700 - 00:12:40.530, Speaker A: Let's say valuations lie between zero and some finite upper bound V max. Also, the FIS need not be the same. You can have some bidders that are aggressive, some bidders which are cheapskates, but they should be independent.
00:12:40.530 - 00:13:00.978, Speaker A: For theory we'll discuss today, they cannot be correlated, and they also should be known to the mechanism designer. So the whole point is we're going to optimize with respect to these distributions. And of course, to do that, we need to know what the distributions are.
00:13:00.978 - 00:13:04.220, Speaker A: So known to the mechanism design.
00:13:08.030 - 00:13:08.298, Speaker B: The.
00:13:08.304 - 00:13:21.280, Speaker A: Mechanism designer knows the distribution from which a value is drawn. It does not, of course, know the actual realization, the actual valuation that would trivialize the problem. Maybe I know your uniform from zero to one, but I don't know what the draw actually is.
00:13:21.280 - 00:13:41.320, Speaker A: There's a question? Correct. So distribution F sub I is associated with bidder B sub I and its evaluation of V sub i.
00:13:45.290 - 00:13:45.686, Speaker B: All right?
00:13:45.708 - 00:13:54.314, Speaker A: So the mechanism designer needs to know these distributions just to reason about trade offs between different auctions. So what about the bidders themselves? Well, it depends on the model. I want to keep things simple today.
00:13:54.314 - 00:14:15.098, Speaker A: So I'm going to continue to discuss only DSIC auctions, only auctions where bidders have dominant strategies, although the theory we'll talk about today actually generalize very easily beyond those. But when auctions have dominant strategies, then the bidders either don't need to know or they really don't care about the distribution from which other valuations are drawn. They have a dominant strategy.
00:14:15.098 - 00:14:16.718, Speaker A: It doesn't matter what else is going on.
00:14:16.804 - 00:14:17.198, Speaker B: Okay?
00:14:17.284 - 00:14:35.240, Speaker A: So for today only, the seller really needs to know about the distribution or have an estimate of the distribution. For example, if these are some sort of Internet auctions, there's a good chance you have piles of data that you've built up over time. That's where you'd get these distributions, these F sub I's, from looking at your logs of what people have done in the past.
00:14:36.490 - 00:14:37.240, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:39.370 - 00:15:11.918, Speaker A: So let's now notice that this problem that we were totally unable to think about five minutes ago, we can now reason about almost trivially now that we've posited these distributions. So back to the one bidder case, one item, and this bidder's private valuation is drawn from some known distribution capital F. So now, for a given auction, when we want to know how well it does, we can just look at its expected revenue.
00:15:11.918 - 00:15:36.700, Speaker A: And again, the expectation is with respect to this private valuation V. So the expected revenue of some posted price R. Well, the easiest way to think about it is it's the so we know that if there's a sale, right, in the event that there's a sale, we know we're going to make R dollars.
00:15:36.700 - 00:16:06.900, Speaker A: And what does that have to get multiplied by? Well, sometimes we're going to have a sale, sometimes we're not, right? So this needs to be multiplied by the probability of a sale, okay? And so the probability of a sale is just the probability that the value, the private value is at least the posted price R that we chose. So capital F tell you the probability of something be at most a given value. So what we want here is one minus capital F of R.
00:16:06.900 - 00:16:16.040, Speaker A: And again, the reason being is that just by definition, the second term is the probability that V is at least R.
00:16:20.750 - 00:16:21.500, Speaker B: Okay?
00:16:22.670 - 00:16:51.860, Speaker A: And this is revenue of a sale. That's a simple expression. If you told me some distribution capital F, I could now just search for the best R, okay? And whatever R makes that number as high as possible, that would be the optimal auction, the revenue maximizing auction with respect to this distribution capital F.
00:16:51.860 - 00:17:09.400, Speaker A: So, for example, if V is drawn from a uniform distribution on zero one, a simple calculation shows that best R is one half.
00:17:10.650 - 00:17:11.400, Speaker B: Okay?
00:17:12.010 - 00:17:31.406, Speaker A: So what would be the revenue of this posted price, for example, if V is drawn uniformly from zero one? So how much money would you make? What would be your expected revenue with this posted price and this distribution? One fourth, right? You have a sale half the time and you make half a buck every time it happens.
00:17:31.508 - 00:17:32.160, Speaker B: Okay?
00:17:32.770 - 00:17:45.106, Speaker A: And some terminology that will come up later is the notion of a monopoly price. And that is just the value of R that makes this number as large as possible. So that's a monopoly price.
00:17:45.106 - 00:18:03.270, Speaker A: So for this distribution, the monopoly price is one half. All right? So good. So at least for this sort of very silly example, which I used to sort of illustrate that we needed a sort of richer model, we know what to do, but we probably don't care that much about one bitter settings.
00:18:03.270 - 00:18:16.198, Speaker A: We'd like to do something a little more interesting. And it gets interesting already with two bidders. So I'll leave the computations as an exercise, but let me just sort of tell you some results.
00:18:16.198 - 00:18:28.020, Speaker A: So now let's just make it so there's two bidders, one item, and both the valuations. These are going to be IID bidders. So both evaluations are drawn from uniform zero one.
00:18:33.350 - 00:18:35.286, Speaker B: Excuse me, does it matter whether or.
00:18:35.288 - 00:18:39.026, Speaker A: Not the bidders know that the bidders are speak up.
00:18:39.128 - 00:18:41.346, Speaker B: Does it matter whether or not bidders know that?
00:18:41.448 - 00:19:03.994, Speaker A: Know what? As long as we're considering DSIC auctions? No, because you have a dominant strategy. But let's think about it from the designer perspective, right? Suppose you know there's two bidders and your model is that their valuations are drawn, IID from uniform one. With two bidders, there's more auctions you can start to think about doing.
00:19:03.994 - 00:19:14.080, Speaker A: So, for example, the vicary auction now makes sense. So you can just run the vicary auction again, the point of the Victory auction is to maximize surplus, but it inadvertently generates revenue. We can see how much we get.
00:19:14.080 - 00:19:46.300, Speaker A: So, Vicory, by a simple calculation, which I'll leave to you, the expected vicary revenue turns out to be one third. You allocate to the high bidder, charge the second highest bid, you'll make some money, you'll make a third. So what else could you do? Well, you could do a few different things, but the first thing you might think about doing is in the same way that we sort of had this auxiliary price for the one bidder case, we could augment the bickery auction with a reserve price.
00:19:46.300 - 00:20:06.570, Speaker A: And in ebay auctions, for those of you that are familiar with them, these are just opening bids. So when there's a reserve price, it just says, look, for me to even consider you, your bid has to be at least as high as the reserve. Moreover, what's the benefit of the reserve price? This can potentially push up the amount of money paid by the winner.
00:20:06.570 - 00:20:23.006, Speaker A: So there's going to be a trade off if we add a reserve and it's going to be a reserve of one half, two things happen. So, first of all, there'll be cases in the Vicary auction where we would have made some money if the two bids were one third and one 6th, you'd make a 6th. If you had a reserve of one half, you would filter both bids.
00:20:23.006 - 00:20:34.694, Speaker A: You wouldn't sell the item, you'd make nothing. So that's an input where you do worse with a reserve of one half. On the other hand, if you get one bid of two thirds and one bid of one third, in the vicary auction, the winner is charged a third.
00:20:34.694 - 00:20:50.638, Speaker A: But if you had a reserve price of one half, you filter the one third bid, and that's now the price charged by the winner. Okay, so just like in ebay the opening bid, you're never going to get away with paying lower than the opening bid. When you have a reserve price, the winner will never pay less than the reserve price.
00:20:50.638 - 00:21:24.150, Speaker A: And if the reserve price happens to split the highest bid from everybody else, then that's a win. So if we add a reserve to the Vicary auction, we'll do better sometimes, we'll do worse sometimes, and the distribution tells us how to average to figure out, do we do better overall? Turns out, in this case, with a reserve of one half, we boost this revenue a little bit from one third to 512. So the pro of having higher prices with one winner outweighs the con of sometimes not allocating the goodbye.
00:21:24.150 - 00:21:49.538, Speaker A: So far, the only point I've made is that there's multiple natural auctions you could run already with two bidders in one item, and some do better than others on expectation. But the obvious question is, who says this is the end of the line, right? Can we do better than just a simple vicary auction with a reserve of one half? Maybe some other reserve is better. Maybe some totally different auction format is better than this one.
00:21:49.538 - 00:21:50.740, Speaker A: Who's to say.
00:21:55.030 - 00:21:55.780, Speaker B: It?
00:21:57.430 - 00:22:36.930, Speaker A: So if we want to be ambitious, then the goal should be for any situation, any single parameter environment, not just single item auctions, any distributions, not just ID distributions to characterize what the optimal auction is. Figure out the auction that maximizes the expected revenue with respect to the distributions f one through FN for this entire lecture. When I say optimal auction, I mean maximizes expected revenue expectation with respect to the given distribution over the vis.
00:22:36.930 - 00:22:43.726, Speaker A: So this is what we're going to do. So I will give you such a characterization in the rest of this lecture.
00:22:43.838 - 00:22:44.820, Speaker B: That's the plan.
00:22:48.090 - 00:23:23.822, Speaker A: So, step zero and just to sort of remind you of an important simple result from last time, our concern should be it's like, man, it seems like there's a lot of different auctions you could run. It seems like a crazy big space. Who are we to think we can actually figure out what's the best point in that space for any environment and any distributions? So the first thing I want to point out is it's still going to be the case that there's lots of auctions out there in the world, but at least we can funnel in on just to these simple three step auctions we've been discussing all along.
00:23:23.822 - 00:23:32.754, Speaker A: These sealed bidder direct revelation auctions where you have an allocation rule X and a payment rule P. And truth telling is a dominant strategy. That's all we need to worry about.
00:23:32.754 - 00:23:48.674, Speaker A: The reason is the revelation principle. So remember what that says. That says you give me any auction with guaranteed dominant strategies, I will give you an equivalent auction.
00:23:48.674 - 00:23:53.702, Speaker A: In particular, the revenue will be equivalent. So that truth telling is a dominant strategy.
00:23:53.766 - 00:23:54.380, Speaker B: Okay?
00:23:56.510 - 00:24:40.454, Speaker A: So that's the first thing to realize. And again, remember generic such mechanism, we write by the allocation rule, which chooses who wins, and its payment rule, which chooses what they pay. And because we're only going to be thinking about these mechanisms, and this is why for the rest of this lecture, I will never again write bids on the board, okay? For the rest of today, I will always assume that the bids are just the valuations, as justified by the fact that all auctions under consideration are DSI.
00:24:40.454 - 00:25:18.702, Speaker A: C, of course, are unknown to the mechanism, but if they're the same as the bids, then it still makes sense to write V. Okay? All right. And just to be clear, what is the revenue of such a direct revelation mechanism? What's just the sum of the payments? Okay, so the payment rule on a given bid profile, which again, I'm just going to write the valuation profile.
00:25:18.702 - 00:25:29.250, Speaker A: I look at the money paid by each of the end bidders, and I sum up. Okay, so this is a number associated with every input, every valuation profile. This is what we want to maximize on average.
00:25:29.250 - 00:25:35.180, Speaker A: So again, with expectation with respect to the vector v. All right?
00:25:36.110 - 00:25:37.980, Speaker B: Yeah. How do we know that?
00:25:41.950 - 00:25:51.498, Speaker A: Excellent question. The question was maybe we're losing tons of money by this restriction of DSIC. So, like, maybe the first price auction kicks the second price auction's butt.
00:25:51.498 - 00:26:03.358, Speaker A: And you're right. From what I tell you today, we will not rule out that possibility. I'm giving you, in effect, a special case of the general theory for DSIC mechanisms just to sort of slowly build up your intuition and understanding.
00:26:03.358 - 00:26:22.300, Speaker A: I'm happy to report that the auctions advocated by the lecture today remain optimal even in the much bigger design space where you drop the DSIC condition. So this is one of those scenarios where DSIC is actually for free, but that won't be obvious from what I say today. Good question.
00:26:22.300 - 00:26:40.638, Speaker A: All right, so the main part, the main thing we've got to do today is I've got to give you a formula for the revenue, okay? So you should be kind of doing a double take. It's like, wait a minute, I just gave you a formula for the revenue. Okay, you're right.
00:26:40.638 - 00:27:04.870, Speaker A: But so it turns out this formula for revenue is it's very hard to figure out what auctions make this as large as possible. So I'm going to give you a second formula for revenue actually, really for expected revenue. So really what we care about is not so much this on a single input V, but rather we care about the expectation of this on average over V.
00:27:04.870 - 00:27:24.394, Speaker A: I will give you a second formula which is also equal to this one, but which is much more useful. It's basically going to be a much more operational formula that we can understand how to maximize. We can understand which mechanisms maximize it as opposed to this one.
00:27:24.394 - 00:27:36.450, Speaker A: Okay, so next, so let's say important second formula for revenue.
00:27:38.310 - 00:27:45.250, Speaker B: Of an optional.
00:27:47.190 - 00:28:04.940, Speaker A: So that's the main thing we have to do today, right? So first we'll derive this formula. Then we'll turn on to interpreting it and actually optimizing it in various cases of interest. All right, so what do I want to raise? I want to raise this.
00:28:04.940 - 00:28:33.022, Speaker A: So this second formula for the expected revenue, it's going to be yet another killer application of Myerson's lemma in particular. Basically, we're just going to start from Myerson's payment formula. Remember, Myerson's payment formula is what says that given an allocation rule x, there's a unique set of payments p that render it into a DSIC mechanism.
00:28:33.022 - 00:28:50.870, Speaker A: We applied that, for example, to get our sponsored search per click payments. So we're going to start from the Myerson's payment formula and then do some computations, and we'll end up with an extremely useful and operational expression for the expected revenue of an auction. So let me just remind you of the formula.
00:28:50.870 - 00:29:11.498, Speaker A: So last week, I only stated it for piecewise constant allocation rules. So I stated it this way. So if it's piecewise constant the allocation rule, we just looked at the various points that it jumped.
00:29:11.498 - 00:29:31.682, Speaker A: We looked at its breakpoints, and it was the sum over the breakpoints of the jump and the allocation rule times the position at which that jump happened. So this is the position, and we look at the jump of Xi at YJ. And here the YJS.
00:29:31.682 - 00:29:46.970, Speaker A: Remember, we always look to the left of the bid that we actually got. So here the YJS are the breakpoints between zero and the ith bidders bid.
00:29:48.350 - 00:29:49.100, Speaker B: Okay?
00:29:50.350 - 00:30:15.330, Speaker A: So that's just straight off the board from last week. Today I'm going to write it a little bit differently, and I'll tell you why, but I'm going to write it in a continuous formula breakpoints in this integral. I'm going to integrate over the integral.
00:30:15.330 - 00:30:29.602, Speaker A: Rather than looking at the jump of the allocation curve, I'm going to look at its quote unquote derivative. So look at x prime. And I'm integrating.
00:30:29.602 - 00:30:52.286, Speaker A: And I'm looking again, as usual, when there's an increase in the allocation rule, it gets multiplied, it gets weighted by the position at which that increase happens. Okay, so a couple of comments. So I hope it's clear that you can syntactically match components of one of these formulas to the other one.
00:30:52.286 - 00:31:04.754, Speaker A: In fact, really, these are the same formula as long as you have sort of a suitable interpretation of what a derivative means and what an integral means when you have nondifferentiable but monotone allocation rules x.
00:31:04.872 - 00:31:05.540, Speaker B: Okay?
00:31:06.950 - 00:31:24.060, Speaker A: So depending on how much of your advanced calculus you remember, either observe or believe me, that for the piecewise constant allocation rules we had been focusing on as a motivating special case last week, these formulas are really the same.
00:31:35.310 - 00:31:35.674, Speaker B: Okay?
00:31:35.712 - 00:32:04.822, Speaker A: But let me tell you why I did it. So one reason is that in this computation that will give us this very useful formula, there's a couple of sort of calculus like maneuvers I want to do, like integration by parts, and they'll just look much more natural if I'm working with this sort of calculus like formula for the payment. Secondly, is there's really nothing special about piecewise constant payment rules? And so last week, when we were young and naive, it made sense to focus on that special case.
00:32:04.822 - 00:32:30.250, Speaker A: But with our newfound maturity, maybe I want to give you a version that also extends not beyond piecewise constant rules to arbitrary monotone allocation rules x. For those of you that sort of do remember your advanced calculus and are worried about some pathologies you can get from arbitrary functions x. Let me remind you that in mechanism design, the only kinds of allocation rules we ever care about are monotone and also bounded.
00:32:30.250 - 00:32:37.570, Speaker A: And basically monotone. Bounded functions just are kind of almost as good as differentiable functions. They're differentiable except at a set of measures, zero.
00:32:37.570 - 00:32:42.254, Speaker A: So it really gives very little trouble in doing kind of whatever we want with these integrals.
00:32:42.382 - 00:32:45.378, Speaker B: Okay. All right.
00:32:45.544 - 00:33:05.740, Speaker A: So again, Myerson's payment formula we're given as input, if you like, an allocation role x. And this is what the payments have got to be, given that we've assumed DSIC mechanisms. All right, good.
00:33:05.740 - 00:33:15.146, Speaker A: So here's the plan. So I talked about how the payments directly are difficult to work with. It's not clear how to optimize them.
00:33:15.146 - 00:33:29.586, Speaker A: But we've now built up all this comfort doing our surplus maximization. And there we really got some good practice we're like, what allocation rule do we want? Well, let's look at our expression, right? The sum of the VI's times, the XIs. And let's choose xi so that this number gets really big.
00:33:29.586 - 00:33:50.550, Speaker A: So we have a lot of practice sort of designing allocation rules to maximize expressions of the allocation rules, expressions of the X's. So at least in principle, the following strategy looks like a good idea. We don't know how to optimize directly a formula that just involves the prices, the P's, but we feel much more comfortable with the X's, with the allocations.
00:33:50.550 - 00:34:10.842, Speaker A: This formula tells us that, well, if what you care about the P's, actually that's sort of a dependent variable on this independent variable of the X. So this says if you care about revenue, if you care about money, you can always rewrite it in terms of the allocation rule x. And that's what we sort of know how to optimize.
00:34:10.842 - 00:34:19.642, Speaker A: So in principle, we can take the very simple payment expression which has disappeared, and rewrite it in terms of the allocation rule.
00:34:19.706 - 00:34:19.934, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:19.972 - 00:34:28.674, Speaker A: What's not at all obvious right now is whether that's going to be a fruitful exercise or not. And there's really no way to know in advance without actually doing the computation. So that's what you're going to do next.
00:34:28.674 - 00:34:42.380, Speaker A: But that's where we're going. We're starting with this obvious but difficult to work with formula with the P's, applying this to get an expression in terms of the X's, the allocation rules, that will simplify beautifully, and we'll get an expression that we can optimize directly. Okay, so that's the plan question.
00:34:42.380 - 00:34:56.538, Speaker A: So the derivation, I've broken it into bite size steps for your viewing pleasure, six steps, but each is very simple, and actually the last three are trivial.
00:34:56.634 - 00:34:57.280, Speaker B: Okay?
00:34:59.250 - 00:35:11.506, Speaker A: All right, so we're just going to start with the payment formula. So fix a bidder. I, for now, fix the bids or the valuations of the other.
00:35:11.506 - 00:35:22.438, Speaker A: Bidders v minus I Remember those are random. Remember, every VI is drawn from a distribution, so V minus I is from some joint distribution. But for now, just sort of condition on what it is fix V minus I.
00:35:22.524 - 00:35:23.158, Speaker B: Okay?
00:35:23.324 - 00:35:43.180, Speaker A: I's valuation we haven't fixed. So I's valuation is random drawn from Fi. So by the payment formula we have.
00:35:43.180 - 00:35:56.514, Speaker A: So let's just think about how much money we're going to get from bidder I for a given auction. Okay? So we're starting from we're given a DSIC mechanism, x comma p. Okay? That's the starting point.
00:35:56.514 - 00:36:16.338, Speaker A: Now we're doing some computations with it. So in this auction we're given, how much money do we get on average, what bitter I's valuation is? Well, so now we're just going to expand the payment by bitter I in terms of Myerson's payment formula.
00:36:16.434 - 00:36:17.080, Speaker B: Okay?
00:36:18.570 - 00:36:40.590, Speaker A: So that is just equal to so we just integrate with respect to this distribution. Okay, first of all, so I'm just expanding the expectation. And now we're going to get a double integral because I'm going to further expand pi in terms of that formula.
00:36:40.590 - 00:36:52.034, Speaker A: And so that's sort of our initial expansion step. Then we're going to have two steps that simplify it back.
00:36:52.072 - 00:36:59.010, Speaker B: Download.
00:37:08.390 - 00:37:49.810, Speaker A: Some real estate, if any questions? All right, so to finish the expansion, step one just says holding V minus I fixed integrating with respect to VI. What we get is a double integral over there. So the outer one is the integral.
00:37:49.810 - 00:38:17.580, Speaker A: Just because VI's valuation is random, then we get this integration that we inherit from the payment formula. So this goes from zero up to I's instantiated valuation, z times X prime. So that's step one.
00:38:17.580 - 00:38:26.538, Speaker A: And again, this is sort of what we knew we could do in principle. We had a formula with the p's. We had a formula that would and then we had something that would give us something in the X's.
00:38:26.538 - 00:38:44.070, Speaker A: But so what it's not clear if this is useful or not. So now we're just going to apply two of those sort of rules and thumb when you're kind of doing computations and seeing if they lead anything interesting. So pretty much whenever you have a double integral or double sum and you don't know how to interpret it, check the reverse direction.
00:38:44.070 - 00:38:57.100, Speaker A: Like some of the time, it'll make it better. That should be a Pavlovian response for all of you when you see double sums and double integrals. So, step two.
00:38:57.100 - 00:39:06.058, Speaker A: So we're integrating over the joint space of z's and vis, right? This is choosing VI. This is choosing Z. Z is always at most VI.
00:39:06.058 - 00:39:19.730, Speaker A: So let's reverse the order. Let's have our outer variable be z, and then VI has to be at least z. So this is going to go from z to V max.
00:39:19.730 - 00:39:29.320, Speaker A: And now in the part where we're integrating over VI, I'm going to take the only thing which depends only on VI, which is independent of z.
00:39:33.050 - 00:39:33.800, Speaker B: Okay?
00:39:34.490 - 00:39:47.980, Speaker A: So that's our new inner integral. And then we have all the stuff that does depend sorry, it should be Z. It does depend on Z outside.
00:39:47.980 - 00:40:06.594, Speaker A: All right. And when you're doing these sort of hablovian response massagings of formulas, you look for signs from above that you're on the right track. Right? And we have a sign here suggesting maybe we're doing something smart, which is one of these integrals we can actually just kind of basically forget about.
00:40:06.594 - 00:40:27.394, Speaker A: It just becomes something that we have a much simpler expression for, which is this inner one. So what is that also known as close one minus capital of F. Remember little F, that's just the density function for the if distribution.
00:40:27.394 - 00:40:30.006, Speaker A: So we're just looking at the mass that's above Z.
00:40:30.108 - 00:40:30.482, Speaker B: Okay.
00:40:30.556 - 00:40:32.586, Speaker A: One minus f I of z.
00:40:32.768 - 00:40:33.660, Speaker B: All right.
00:40:34.270 - 00:40:37.340, Speaker A: So that's a good sign. We had two integrals. Now we have one.
00:40:37.340 - 00:40:59.314, Speaker A: All right, so that's step two. Here's our last nontrivial step. All right.
00:40:59.314 - 00:41:07.630, Speaker A: So we only have one integral, so we can't reverse a pair. So we do have something which is clearly a derivative under the integral.
00:41:07.790 - 00:41:08.500, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:09.030 - 00:41:20.280, Speaker A: So another pebbleven response would now be integration by parts. So that's what we're going to do. And with the decomposition, let's just make our life simple.
00:41:20.280 - 00:41:42.138, Speaker A: The part of which is the derivative, which the G prime, if you like, will make the X prime and then whoops F will be the rest of the stuff. So when you integrate by parts, what do you get? You out pops sort of one integral, which is the F prime G part. And then you also have to evaluate FG at the two endpoints.
00:41:42.138 - 00:41:57.218, Speaker A: So there's going to be a second term, but let's just look at the part which is F times G evaluated at the endpoints. So integrate by parts. Yeah.
00:41:57.218 - 00:42:06.440, Speaker A: So the first term. So we have the F part and then we have the G part.
00:42:10.330 - 00:42:11.080, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:12.010 - 00:42:20.106, Speaker A: V max to zero. And then there's something else that we'll work with in a second. Let's just look at this.
00:42:20.106 - 00:42:41.186, Speaker A: So what does this thing evaluate to when Z is zero? Obviously, it obviously evaluates to zero, right? Because we have a Z here as part of the product. What about when Z is V max also zero. Right.
00:42:41.186 - 00:42:46.386, Speaker A: So this is going to be one v max is as high as Z will go. So this is one. So this is zero.
00:42:46.386 - 00:43:01.320, Speaker A: All right, so this whole term disappears, which again is a sign from above. We're on the right track. All right, so what do we get now? We get the rest of the stuff.
00:43:01.320 - 00:43:13.260, Speaker A: Zero v max. Now we have our xi Z v minus i. Now we need to do a little product rule action on this thing.
00:43:13.260 - 00:43:34.114, Speaker A: So what's that going to be? That's going to be your one minus F I of Z plus minus Z times the density. Okay, this is where we are. So where do we start.
00:43:34.114 - 00:43:45.080, Speaker A: We started for how much money do we expect to get from bidder i, on average over V sub i. And we got this. Now, the final sort of idea, if you want to call it that.
00:43:45.080 - 00:44:06.170, Speaker A: So we're integrating something that looks like it should be with respect to I's valuation from zero to V max. It feels like this should be an integral over valuation space. So I'm just going to take out the density term, put that in advance so I can interpret this as an expected value of a random variable with respect to VI.
00:44:06.170 - 00:44:30.530, Speaker A: But really all I'm doing is multiplying and dividing by the density so I can rewrite this to be zero v maximus signs.
00:44:40.750 - 00:44:41.546, Speaker B: It.
00:44:41.728 - 00:45:00.090, Speaker A: Okay, so that's step three, which at least, you know, it's not looking so bad. We now have a formula that conceivably admits a nice interpretation, and it does. I'm going to explain to you the nice interpretation now.
00:45:00.090 - 00:45:10.722, Speaker A: Okay, so again, all we've done at this point, this is just sort of the grunge work we had to do. We had this idea marriage payment formula should give us a different representation of expected revenue. Maybe it's useful, it's simplified as much as possible.
00:45:10.722 - 00:45:11.534, Speaker A: Boom.
00:45:11.662 - 00:45:12.340, Speaker B: Okay.
00:45:14.790 - 00:45:41.820, Speaker A: So step four, let's just add some notation to make it look even nicer. Specifically this thing. We're going to denote this by theta sub I depends on I, because we're looking at I's distribution here of z.
00:45:41.820 - 00:45:49.230, Speaker A: Okay, so it's just notation. It has a name. You should know the name, which is a virtual valuation.
00:45:49.230 - 00:46:06.450, Speaker A: Okay, I'll talk a little bit about how to interpret this when we get to the end of the derivation. It does have some nice interpretations, but for now, virtual valuation fees of i. It's just this thing that pops up in our computation.
00:46:07.910 - 00:46:08.820, Speaker B: All right.
00:46:10.870 - 00:46:35.486, Speaker A: So that may be an example would be helpful, just so you're not too scared of these virtual evaluations. So consider. So suppose F I of Z is z on zero one I e.
00:46:35.486 - 00:46:46.740, Speaker A: We're looking at a uniform zero one random variable. So the density is just one. So let's look at what the virtual value is.
00:46:46.740 - 00:46:58.422, Speaker A: Well, just by definition, it's z minus one minus the distribution function. That's just the identity function. The density is just one.
00:46:58.422 - 00:47:12.106, Speaker A: So this is just two z minus one. Okay, so we started with the distribution function, z uniform distribution. So z is between zero and one.
00:47:12.106 - 00:47:19.766, Speaker A: Here it's a uniform zero one random variable, and we get something which is uniformly spread between minus one and one. Uniformly.
00:47:19.958 - 00:47:20.700, Speaker B: Okay.
00:47:21.230 - 00:47:36.074, Speaker A: So again, I haven't told you how to interpret it, but it's not that bad in many cases of interest. One thing I just want to point out, which is going to be useful later. So note, these virtual values can be negative.
00:47:36.074 - 00:47:51.830, Speaker A: It is possible that this second term swamps out the first. So again, here, if Z is less than a half, this is a negative number, so it can be less than zero. Let me summarize what we've proven.
00:47:51.830 - 00:48:22.042, Speaker A: So how much money do you make from bidder i? Well, you make precisely the expected value of its virtual value. So what I'm doing now is I'm interpreting Z as a valuation, remember? So this is an integral with respect to the distribution f sub i. So it's like Z is a private valuation.
00:48:22.042 - 00:48:44.440, Speaker A: It's the same integral. So how much money do you make on average from somebody? You make the average value of its virtual value times its allocation. Okay, so that's where things stand at the end of step four.
00:48:44.440 - 00:48:46.710, Speaker A: Agreed?
00:48:49.480 - 00:48:55.590, Speaker B: Yeah. What happened to the Xi minus i?
00:48:58.460 - 00:49:06.796, Speaker A: Where are we at? Oh, here? Yeah, I think I just totally omitted it. My bad.
00:49:06.898 - 00:49:07.356, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:49:07.378 - 00:49:13.470, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Excellent comment. Yes, thank you.
00:49:13.470 - 00:49:41.540, Speaker A: Did you like how it kind of went away and then it came back? This is Z. Thank you. Other questions or typos? All right, so we've done all the grunge work, so now let's just actually see why this is useful, why it has a nice interpretation.
00:49:41.660 - 00:50:20.310, Speaker B: It it.
00:50:22.840 - 00:50:39.864, Speaker A: All right, so step five. So what do we just prove? So we just proved that two things were equal, whatever VI is underneath. So remember, steps one through four were all fixing V minus i.
00:50:39.864 - 00:50:46.680, Speaker A: Or we fixed the values of the other people. They're random, but we conditioned on them. And so we said whatever V minus I is, these two averages are equal.
00:50:46.680 - 00:51:03.840, Speaker A: So now we're just going to average more over the V minus i. They're still going to be equal. So formally, we just apply we just integrate out over everybody else's valuations.
00:51:03.840 - 00:51:29.720, Speaker A: And so the expected amount of money that we get from bidder i, on average, over the inputs is exactly the amount of virtual value that I is contributing to the allocation.
00:51:30.380 - 00:51:31.130, Speaker B: Okay.
00:51:32.540 - 00:51:45.964, Speaker A: And now, finally, I just use linearity of expectations twice to say that the expected amount of money we make from everybody is the expected amount of these virtual values we get from everybody.
00:51:46.162 - 00:51:46.910, Speaker B: Okay.
00:51:55.460 - 00:52:10.390, Speaker A: So the average the expected revenue of the mechanism. So this left hand side is what we've cared about all along. So we started with an arbitrary DSIC mechanism, allocation rule X, payment rule P.
00:52:10.390 - 00:52:21.012, Speaker A: We average overall valuation, profiles the averages with respect to these distributions. We'll get the average amount of money we make. So we know this is just the sum of the PiS.
00:52:21.012 - 00:52:37.824, Speaker A: By definition, that's the revenue. So by linearity of expectation, I can take the sum out. Just look at how much money I make from a single person for each single person.
00:52:37.824 - 00:52:57.300, Speaker A: This is what we exactly characterized in terms of these virtual values. And now I'm just going to push the sum back into the expectation. So this is the second invocation.
00:52:57.300 - 00:53:13.450, Speaker A: All right. And this is where I wanted to get to.
00:53:15.760 - 00:53:16.510, Speaker B: Okay.
00:53:18.320 - 00:53:35.408, Speaker A: So this is the objective we're trying to maximize the average amount of revenue that the mechanism gets. This can evidently be expressed as a sum of the PiS. And we just did a whole bunch of work, culminating in the fact that we can express it in terms of the allocation variables, the X of I's, which we knew we could do.
00:53:35.408 - 00:53:51.110, Speaker A: But the reason we should be happy is it's sort of a fairly shockingly simple formula in terms of the XIs, which is characterizing the amount of money that we make. And again, here's what's crazy, right? So this objective function, revenue, right? What's it about? It's about payments. That's all it's about.
00:53:51.110 - 00:53:58.440, Speaker A: Somehow we just compiled the fact that we cared about payments into a new formula, which doesn't reference payments at all.
00:53:58.590 - 00:53:59.000, Speaker B: Okay?
00:53:59.070 - 00:54:15.912, Speaker A: It's only about the virtual values of the allocation. To drive this point home, squint for a second and suppose that the fi wasn't even there. Okay, so just erase the FII in your mind, what is that expression that's left? It's just the surplus.
00:54:15.912 - 00:54:27.180, Speaker A: It's a sum over I of vixi. So if we erase the fees of I, it would be the average surplus of a mechanism. And that's something we already have a good understanding of how to optimize.
00:54:27.180 - 00:54:50.616, Speaker A: So somehow payments, despite being about the entirely other part of a mechanism, the payment rule, not the allocations per se, it boils down to exactly the same thing as maximizing surplus, except instead of VI, you have some function of VI. This virtual value, which at least in some contexts, like for a uniform distribution, really isn't that bad. You just take Z and you replace it by two Z minus one.
00:54:50.798 - 00:54:51.530, Speaker B: Okay.
00:54:53.340 - 00:55:07.212, Speaker A: So it is not OPERATORI obvious. So I know of no way to easily explain why you get such a magically simple formula for payments purely in terms of the allocation rule. But now that we have it, it's extremely useful.
00:55:07.212 - 00:55:27.442, Speaker A: And so that's what I'm going to spend the rest of the lecture explaining. Question step three is integrating my parts. Sure.
00:55:27.442 - 00:55:33.762, Speaker A: I think I wrote on the board as you went along. So step one was you expand in terms of Myers and payment formula. Step two is a reversal of order of integration.
00:55:33.762 - 00:55:44.460, Speaker A: Step three is integration by parts. Step four we introduce the notation for fees of I. Step five, what was step five? It was something simple.
00:55:44.460 - 00:55:56.880, Speaker A: Oh yeah. Step five was just you forget about fixing V minus I and average over V minus I and then linearity of expectations to finish. Okay, good.
00:55:56.880 - 00:56:02.690, Speaker A: So the rest of the lecture, how to interpret this, how do we optimize it?
00:56:02.760 - 00:56:11.774, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. Excuse me. Why don't you assume that your allocation rule is differentiable?
00:56:11.822 - 00:56:36.470, Speaker A: I didn't, I talked about this. It's monotone, it's differentiable at all, but a measure zero and you can make all this work again, I'm not going to turn this into advanced calculus class, so I'm not going to give you a fully rigorous proof, but all of this can be made precise, all of this can be made rigorous. So every single step is correct with a suitable background of integration and differentiation, which I'm not going to do here, for obvious reasons.
00:56:36.470 - 00:56:37.340, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:40.690 - 00:56:43.070, Speaker B: Same distribution.
00:56:45.490 - 00:56:48.014, Speaker A: Good question. Good question. Right.
00:56:48.014 - 00:56:59.246, Speaker A: So this simplifies that's, right? So that's where we're going to go next. So this computation that we just did doesn't really simplify. If you make extra assumptions, it's still like, exactly the same length.
00:56:59.246 - 00:57:12.998, Speaker A: So this computation I did at a reasonably general level as far as interpreting what we've done, it does simplify. And so I'll now make extra assumptions so that we get particularly attractive consequences of this theorem. And that'll be a prime example.
00:57:12.998 - 00:57:14.602, Speaker A: It's a reasonable assumption, right?
00:57:14.656 - 00:57:15.740, Speaker B: Because most.
00:57:18.110 - 00:57:27.446, Speaker A: It depends. So the question is about what if all of the FIS are the same? And technically you get simplifications. In some applications it's well motivated, and in some it isn't.
00:57:27.446 - 00:57:35.630, Speaker A: Kind of depends. But yes, for sure, in some applications it is well motivated. And you're absolutely right that it gets simpler, or what I'm about to say next will get simpler.
00:57:37.410 - 00:57:38.160, Speaker B: Okay.
00:57:39.430 - 00:57:44.994, Speaker A: Other questions. Yeah, I just don't understand step five. Okay, sorry.
00:57:44.994 - 00:58:10.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I did that too fast, I'm sure. So steps one through four, we fixed V minus i, and we said the expected amount of money you make from bidder I is the same either way or both the formulas are the same. So if something's true, no matter what V minus I is, or if this equality holds no matter what V minus I is, then it's also true for any averaging over the V minus I's that you like.
00:58:10.220 - 00:58:20.734, Speaker A: And that's all we did. So, syntactically, all I wanted to do is I wanted to replace a VI in the expectation with the full vector V. So I just integrated out with respect to V minus i.
00:58:20.734 - 00:58:24.126, Speaker A: So what's the V sub I and the virtual function?
00:58:24.228 - 00:58:25.600, Speaker B: Sorry, the virtual value.
00:58:27.330 - 00:58:37.554, Speaker A: Which V sub i? Okay, good question. So step five is still for a fixed bidder i.
00:58:37.752 - 00:58:38.900, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:58:43.670 - 00:58:56.700, Speaker A: So for every I okay, so steps one through four, we fixed both the bidder and the valuations of everyone else V minus i. Step five, we're only fixing bidder I and nothing else, and we're averaging over all of V. Yeah, thanks for the question.
00:58:59.390 - 00:59:00.140, Speaker B: Okay.
00:59:02.030 - 00:59:34.150, Speaker A: So again, so in English, what did we prove? I e. So this is the right way to remember it compactly for any auction, the expected revenue that the auction produces is just the expected what's called virtual surplus. For reasons that I hope are now obvious, we agreed that if you hide the phi, this is just expected surplus.
00:59:34.150 - 00:59:47.434, Speaker A: Phi just changes evaluation to a virtual valuation. So the expected valuation of this sum is the expected virtual surplus. Therefore, maximizing the left hand side boils down to maximizing the right hand side.
00:59:47.632 - 00:59:48.380, Speaker B: Okay.
00:59:49.710 - 01:00:19.540, Speaker A: So let's call this star in there does that necessarily mean expecting one high five? These are both numbers for a given mechanism. It has an expected revenue. That's a number 127.
01:00:19.540 - 01:00:30.680, Speaker A: The expected virtual surplus is some operi conceivably different number. And I'm saying it's not, it's 127. I'm saying they're the same number for every mechanism, same number.
01:00:30.680 - 01:00:48.798, Speaker A: So the mechanism which gets the biggest number of the right hand type is the one that gets the biggest number of the left hand type, which is what we want. All right? So now let's put this hard work to use. So remember the original motivating question.
01:00:48.798 - 01:00:59.458, Speaker A: Even just for two bidders, one item, IID uniform, we proposed a couple auctions. One did better than the other. But for all we knew, there were other auctions out there that were still better.
01:00:59.458 - 01:01:48.730, Speaker A: How would we ever know if we had an optimal auction? So, as promised, let's now make some extra assumptions just to interpret what we've done. So, two assumptions single item auction and IID, say all FIS are the same. And as was suggested, if you know nothing else about the bidders, generally, you're going to assume they're IID.
01:01:48.730 - 01:02:08.034, Speaker A: If you know extra information about the bidders, you have ebay biding histories, you might assume they're coming from different distributions. But for now, let's assume they're from the same distribution. Of course, if all the FIS are the same, if you remember the formula for fee sub I that depended only on fi and little fi.
01:02:08.034 - 01:02:33.118, Speaker A: So if the distributions are the same, then these phi I's are also all the same. And remember, what we want to do is we want to choose X. So we're designing the auction, right? It's just like when you're now it's just like when we're doing surplus maximization, right? We can pick any auction we want and we have some objective function that we want to make as big as possible.
01:02:33.118 - 01:02:43.154, Speaker A: And now for the rest of this lecture, we're going to forget about payments per se. We're just going to focus on making virtual surplus as large as possible. So we get to choose X.
01:02:43.154 - 01:03:00.280, Speaker A: How should we choose it to make that as large as possible? Well, so this is some average, right? So the expectation is over the valuation profiles v. For each profile v, we get some number. We want to make this average as high as possible.
01:03:00.280 - 01:03:22.270, Speaker A: But if you think about it, we actually get to define this allocation rule X separately for every valuation profile. So for every vector v, we can choose X-I-E who wins however we want. So if you want to make the average of all these numbers as big as possible, the obvious approach is to just optimize, point wise, to make every single constituent numbers as big as possible.
01:03:22.270 - 01:04:05.610, Speaker A: That is, for every possible input, every valuation profile v make what's inside the expectation as high as possible. That's the obvious approach to how to choose X to make this number as big as possible. So, obvious idea maximize star point wise, by which I mean for each input and an input's evaluation profile.
01:04:05.610 - 01:04:26.862, Speaker A: It's our allocation rule. We get to define it however we want. So let's just define the allocation rule to maximize the virtual surplus achieved on this particular input.
01:04:26.862 - 01:04:31.060, Speaker A: Now, in the current example, this is independent of I, but let me just go ahead and write it for now.
01:04:36.070 - 01:04:37.300, Speaker B: It okay.
01:04:39.350 - 01:04:41.140, Speaker A: So the proposal is to.
01:04:42.870 - 01:04:43.686, Speaker B: The expected.
01:04:43.718 - 01:04:51.420, Speaker A: Surplus as high as possible for each input, make it as high as possible.
01:04:53.790 - 01:04:54.154, Speaker B: Good.
01:04:54.192 - 01:04:58.080, Speaker A: You're several steps ahead, but you're absolutely right. So we'll get there.
01:04:59.650 - 01:05:00.400, Speaker B: Okay.
01:05:02.370 - 01:05:14.338, Speaker A: So what I want to point out is that this rule is very easy to understand in the context of a single item auction where all the distributions are the same.
01:05:14.504 - 01:05:15.220, Speaker B: Okay.
01:05:18.230 - 01:05:58.186, Speaker A: So what does that mean? Okay, so we're a single item auction, so the constraint is just that there's one winner at most. So how do you define X to make this as big as possible? So I give you V, you know everyone's valuations, there are then virtual values, and again, as the seller, you know the distributions, so you know the fees. How should you set X to make this as big as possible? Are we still assuming that the normal.
01:05:58.218 - 01:05:59.760, Speaker B: World servicing life option?
01:06:00.130 - 01:06:11.810, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. We're talking about basically x is a zero one vector with the most eleven. So what should it be? Yeah, item with the highest bidder.
01:06:11.810 - 01:06:24.374, Speaker A: First of all, again, a couple of steps ahead, I think. So what we really want is the bidder with the highest feet, the highest virtual value. I guess let's just start with that.
01:06:24.374 - 01:06:30.114, Speaker A: So you want to give to the person with the highest virtual value. Okay, well, actually even that needs a slight modification. Actually, that needs a caveat.
01:06:30.114 - 01:06:50.266, Speaker A: Do we really always want to give it to the bidder with the highest virtual value? Why wouldn't we? Right? So don't forget, virtual values can be negative. So remember we had this two z minus one for a uniform distribution, so it went between minus one and one. Okay, so giving it to nobody is better than giving it to somebody if everybody's negative.
01:06:50.266 - 01:07:08.338, Speaker A: This may seem weird at first, but actually remember in our one bidder, one item case, we weren't always giving it to the person. The only way to make any money was to set a price that was some nontrivial amount which would result in them not always taking the item. So we actually shouldn't be shocked that sometimes no one will win given that we want to make maximized revenue.
01:07:08.338 - 01:07:13.000, Speaker A: We already have some intuition for that. Good. So I e.
01:07:13.000 - 01:07:42.750, Speaker A: So the winner is the bidder with the highest again, I'll just write phi of VI, even though right now all of the phi s are the same function or no one if all VIVIS are negative.
01:07:43.170 - 01:07:43.920, Speaker B: Okay.
01:07:47.090 - 01:08:10.946, Speaker A: Now here's what's obvious, right? So subject to feasibility, subject only having one item for every possible value v. We made this number as big as it can be by definition, okay? Therefore, we certainly made this average over all of these numbers as big as it can be. We made this expectation as big as it can be for each constituent contribution individually.
01:08:10.946 - 01:08:35.950, Speaker A: So certainly the average is as high as it can ever be. The catch, however, is, is this actually legal? Does this actually lead to a mechanism? Is this a bona fide? So what could be the problem? The problem is that there's no way to make a dominant strategy incentive compatible. And by Meyerson's dilemma, we know the necessary and sufficient condition to be DSIC is for this allocation rule to be monotone.
01:08:35.950 - 01:08:57.510, Speaker A: So the important question is this allocation rule that we just defined, which is certainly optimal if we can implement it, is it implementable or not? Is it monotone or not? So catch is this rule x monotone.
01:08:58.650 - 01:08:59.400, Speaker B: Okay?
01:09:05.310 - 01:09:33.756, Speaker A: So can you maybe think of a simple condition under which this x would be monotone, like a condition on phi? So if phi is nondecreasing, right, so what's the allocation rule? Basically, it's basically give it to the person with the highest virtual value. Montanicity means that if you win and I bring your value up, then you should still win. So as long as bringing your value up only brings your virtual value up, then you'll remain a winner.
01:09:33.948 - 01:09:34.544, Speaker B: Okay?
01:09:34.662 - 01:09:47.940, Speaker A: So fee being nondecreasing is a sufficient condition for this rule to be monotone. And if you think about it for a minute, you'll realize it's also necessary. So monotonicity of this rule boils down to phi being nondecreasing.
01:09:47.940 - 01:10:09.708, Speaker A: So the answer if and only if. So now I'll just write phi, because for the one distribution is monotone. I've only shown you one example of a phi thus far, which is for the uniform distribution, that was two V minus one.
01:10:09.874 - 01:10:10.252, Speaker B: Okay?
01:10:10.306 - 01:10:12.764, Speaker A: So that's increasing. So that's good. All right.
01:10:12.764 - 01:10:32.528, Speaker A: So at least for the uniform case, we know it is monotone. So this actually right. So I'll just say that there are distributions that are where fee is not monotone, and then this argument doesn't work, right? So some distributions lead to nondecreasing fees and some don't.
01:10:32.528 - 01:11:05.500, Speaker A: There's a standard terminology for that dichotomy. So we call a distribution f regular if it obeys the condition we want, essentially. So if the corresponding phi, which again is just this function that depends on capital F and its density, little f is nondecreasing.
01:11:09.700 - 01:11:10.450, Speaker B: Okay?
01:11:12.260 - 01:11:32.856, Speaker A: So on exercise at three, I'll give you some examples to explore. Kind of which distributions give you non decreasing, which distributions are regular and which ones are irregular. Most of the ones you'll find in the back of a statistics textbook are regular, uniform, exponential, Gaussian and so on.
01:11:32.856 - 01:11:43.396, Speaker A: There are distributions which are not. So, like bimodal distributions usually are not. And if you have super heavy tails, that will also usually be an irregular distribution.
01:11:43.588 - 01:11:44.330, Speaker B: Okay?
01:11:49.920 - 01:12:11.830, Speaker A: So in this course, because it's an introductory course where I focus on the most important points, we're only going to ever discuss regular distributions. The theory from this lecture can be extended to all distributions, including irregular distributions, but it requires more work. But I do want you to know that there is a more general theory out there.
01:12:13.560 - 01:12:14.310, Speaker B: Okay?
01:12:16.760 - 01:12:44.216, Speaker A: All right, so back to the single item auction. So let's consider the regular case. So suppose F is regular, even for the moment, assume that phi is strictly increasing, like for a uniform distribution, okay? When bidders are all the same and so they have the same function mapping values to virtual values.
01:12:44.216 - 01:13:12.242, Speaker A: When we pick the bidder as the winner with the highest virtual value, can you say anything about which bidder we're picking in terms of the values? So by definition, we're picking the bidder with the highest virtual value. Does that happen to also be the highest bidder if it's regular and if all bidders are drawn from the same distribution? Yes.
01:13:12.376 - 01:13:13.060, Speaker B: Okay.
01:13:18.970 - 01:13:38.090, Speaker A: So with fees strictly increasing, it means the ordering on virtual values is the same as the ordering on values. So the highest value is the same as the highest virtual value. So the winner, if there is one, is going to be the high bidder in this auction, in this optimal auction.
01:13:38.090 - 01:14:09.400, Speaker A: So the only difference between this optimal auction, where you pick the bidder with the high virtual value, and the vicary auction, where you pick the bidder with a high value, is that in this rule here, there will be cases where you pick nobody if all of the virtual values are negative. So that is the only difference between the revenue maximizing auction for IID regular bidders and the revenue maximizing auction. It's just that sometimes no one will win.
01:14:09.400 - 01:14:45.774, Speaker A: In fact, I claim that this can be explained just through a single reserve price. So for ID, regular bidders, same as a Vic re auction. So what would be the reserve price in terms of the right.
01:14:45.774 - 01:14:52.434, Speaker A: So you want so right, zero is a good answer. The reserve price is zero in the virtual valuation space.
01:14:52.632 - 01:14:52.994, Speaker B: Okay?
01:14:53.032 - 01:15:10.858, Speaker A: So in terms of virtual values, that's exactly right. You have to beat zero. So in terms of the actual bids, remember, the vicary auction is just the high bidder subject to the reserve, right? So to map back from the virtual values back to the actual bids, like in ebay, you need to take the inverse virtual value of zero.
01:15:10.858 - 01:15:38.638, Speaker A: So with reserve price fee minus one of zero. So the allocation we'll described here, just give it to the highest virtual value or nobody if they're all less than zero. If it's ID and regular, that's exactly the same thing as giving it to the highest value or nobody if everybody's bid is below phi minus one of zero for the uniform distribution.
01:15:38.638 - 01:15:48.614, Speaker A: Recall that phi was two V minus one. So what value. Of V makes two V minus one equal to zero, one half.
01:15:48.614 - 01:16:11.686, Speaker A: So for the uniform distribution, the inverse virtual value of zero is one half. So for IID bidders, no matter how many there are drawn from a uniform distribution, IID the optimal auction. Among all the auctions that exist in the world, the optimal auction is simply ebay a bickery auction with the suitably chosen reserve price or opening bid.
01:16:11.686 - 01:16:18.638, Speaker A: In that case, one half. So two bidders, one item in particular, the reserve of one half, which got us 512. You can't do better.
01:16:18.638 - 01:16:23.860, Speaker A: No other reserve is better. No other auction format is better. That's always the best you can do.
01:16:23.860 - 01:16:38.214, Speaker A: All right, so we have this very general formula characterizing revenue of auctions. It tells us how to derive optimal auctions, which in simple settings actually are auctions that are actually in use in practice. It's kind of amazing.
01:16:38.214 - 01:16:57.930, Speaker A: We optimized over this huge set of auctions. The best one is really just ebay if they're IID. Okay, so the exercises will ask you to do exactly this same thing when the bidders come from different distributions and you'll find that the optimal auctions can be a little weird.
01:16:57.930 - 01:17:19.262, Speaker A: Okay, so when people have different distributions, they have different fee sub eyes. So when you give to optimize revenue, you want to give it to the bidder with the highest virtual value, the highest FIA of VI that need not be the bidder with the highest value. To optimize revenue with non ID bidders, you fundamentally must move away from always awarding the good to the highest bidder.
01:17:19.406 - 01:17:20.098, Speaker B: Okay?
01:17:20.264 - 01:17:44.978, Speaker A: The payments are also a little tricky to understand. All right, so that's going to motivate the main topic of next lecture. So now that we've completely solved for the optimal auction, in this average case sense, for any single Pramber environment, we're going to say, well, there are simple settings where this is an auction we might actually use, and there are more complex settings where, in principle, the theory tells us how to maximize revenue.
01:17:44.978 - 01:18:04.880, Speaker A: But they have extra properties or details which we never see in practice. Like miss, like allocating to bidders that are not the highest. And so the question we'll talk about on Wednesday is using the lens of approximation and saying, can we get almost optimal auctions using practical auction formats? So I'll see you then.
01:18:04.880 - 01:18:05.610, Speaker A: Bye.
