00:00:02.250 - 00:00:46.394, Speaker A: So the plan for today is to talk about the case study of spectrum auctions, wireless spectrum. And, you know, I hope you find this sort of lecture, you know, self contained and interesting in its own right. You know, but just to be clear from a higher level, one of the reasons I'm doing this is to give you a flavor for how the theory that we cover in class is connected to what happens in the real world. So the theory isn't always applicable straight out of the box. You sometimes have to tweak it. You sometimes have to modify it. But as we'll see, the theory that we've been covering does indeed influence how people think about solving these very difficult but very important problems that are out there in the real world.
00:00:46.432 - 00:00:46.586, Speaker B: Okay?
00:00:46.608 - 00:01:36.922, Speaker A: So keep that in mind. All right, so let me just briefly remind you of the formalism that we introduced last time. So in a common trial auction, you have N bidders. And again, you should think of these as perhaps people like At T and Verizon and so on. You have a set, capital M of little M, different goods, not in general interchangeable. So this might be a license that gives you the right to use some frequency in some area. And each bidder has a private valuation, known opera only to itself, for each possible bundle of goods it might get.
00:01:36.922 - 00:02:24.938, Speaker A: Okay, so private valuation for all I and for all subsets of M. We'll talk a little bit about what assumptions you might make on the valuations. We always assume that your value for the empty set is zero. Why not? And generally, you assume monotonicity. So the more stuff I give you, your value can only go up more assumptions to come later. Let me remind you, we ended on Monday talking about the challenges of commercial auctions and actually implementing them in practice, as opposed to just, say, using the VCG mechanism to maximize surplus in principle. So the first challenge was not just about the VCG mechanism, but about any direct revelation mechanism, which is that if the number of goods is even medium size, because the number of private parameters is exponential in M, that's an absurd number of things to ask somebody to report.
00:02:24.938 - 00:02:31.606, Speaker A: Okay? That's just way too many bids to ask somebody to submit. That would be like a million bids already if M was something like 20.
00:02:31.728 - 00:02:32.446, Speaker B: Okay?
00:02:32.628 - 00:02:53.854, Speaker A: So that motivates indirect mechanisms, which will be the subject of today's lecture. Secondly, already in the single parameter world, we saw that surplus maximization can be computationally intractable. So that's a second challenge. Third challenge is at least the VCG mechanism can have these weird revenue properties. You can have zero revenue in competitive environments. You can have revenue non monotonicity. So that was a concern.
00:02:53.854 - 00:03:41.060, Speaker A: And then the fourth thing was that when you go to indirect mechanisms, that gives extra opportunities for people to game the system. So we talked about the concrete example of people using low order bids to sort of retaliate and collude. All right, so again, maybe the most fundamental point from all of those challenges and the real non starter, is that the entire class, we've been talking only about direct revelation mechanisms. We even had the revelation principle, which justified our restriction to focusing on, at least in principle, direct revelation mechanisms. But now we have an application where we have to just jettison that. So for the first time, we have no choice but to talk about indirect mechanisms where we learn information about the bidders on a need to know basis. That's the only option.
00:03:41.060 - 00:04:32.862, Speaker A: So the question then is, all right, so we're not going to actually do direct revelations, sealed bid, and ask everybody about their opinion about every bundle that they might get. What are we going to do? What other auction format are we going to look at? And for starters, we discussed in passing an indirect mechanism you're all familiar with one from the movies, from auction houses and so on, the ascending English auction. In that kind of setup, you could use a sealed bid, second price auction, you could use the Vickery auction. In principle, you get exactly the same outcome as if an auctioneer sat up there and kept raising the price and people raised their hands. And so there was only one hand left. Both of those auctions, if bidders follow their dominant strategy, conclude with the highest valuation, bidder being the winner, paying the second highest valuation. But so that's an example of an indirect auction.
00:04:32.862 - 00:04:38.030, Speaker A: And mostly this lecture, we're really just going to be looking at a bunch of those English auctions in parallel.
00:04:38.110 - 00:04:38.354, Speaker B: Okay?
00:04:38.392 - 00:05:10.240, Speaker A: So that's going to be the flavor of the indirect auctions that we're talking about. In particular, I want to focus mostly people have added on bells and whistles to this, but people have focused and practiced mostly on the simplest solution to get around direct revelation, which is, if you have M goods, just run m different single item auctions, sell each of the items separately in its own single item auction. There's a question.
00:05:15.030 - 00:05:24.530, Speaker B: Is it possible to have people return function that basically represents their valuation.
00:05:29.190 - 00:06:14.798, Speaker A: Conceivably? So the question is, could you ask bidders to write a computer program where the input to the computer program was a bundle s, and the computer program computes whatever the value is? So there's an exponential number of things to compute. So it's not clear how accurate a program you'd be able to write, but yes, that's something you could try. So we're going to look at selling each good separately in a single item auction. And there's various ways one could do this. You might want to think about it. So even if we're saying separate single item auctions, there's actually a number of knobs we can turn and we'll go through some bad formats and conclude on the format that's actually used let me just notice here, from a practical perspective, you definitely could imagine running this. You have m goods.
00:06:14.798 - 00:06:21.830, Speaker A: M might be in the thousands, but whatever you have how many goods you have, you're only asking people's opinion about whatever subset of the goods that they want.
00:06:21.900 - 00:06:22.134, Speaker B: Okay?
00:06:22.172 - 00:06:25.974, Speaker A: In the worst case, a linear number of bids, one for each.
00:06:26.012 - 00:06:26.214, Speaker B: Good.
00:06:26.252 - 00:06:44.822, Speaker A: So that's something you definitely could do if you wanted to. But sort of the whole point of these commercial valuations is that your value for a subset of goods might be something more subtle than merely the sum of your values for each of the constituent goods.
00:06:44.966 - 00:06:45.334, Speaker B: Okay?
00:06:45.392 - 00:07:46.340, Speaker A: So maybe if I give you a bundle of goods, it's somehow there's synergies and your value is enhanced. Or maybe these goods are redundant and your value is not as high as the sum of the individual items. So we're not really letting people express what they want. They have all of this rich information in their head, and we're only asking for a vanishingly small fraction of it. So you would be right to ask, even in a best case scenario, even in principle, could you conceivably get reasonable outcomes, say things that have nearly maximum surplus, by using this very lightweight approach? So could this ever work? It should be a question, not an answer. It so the answer depends. Let's start with the good news.
00:07:48.150 - 00:07:48.514, Speaker B: Which.
00:07:48.552 - 00:08:28.618, Speaker A: Is if the goods are more redundant than they are synergistic. So the technical term is if goods are substitutes, or really we're crossing our fingers and hoping the conclusion extends to mostly substitutes in some sense, and I'm not going to give you a formal definition of this right now. Just think about the case of two goods. So it would mean that the value that a bidder has for a bundle of two goods, a and B, is less, let's say less than or equal to its value for each good individually.
00:08:28.794 - 00:08:29.520, Speaker B: Okay?
00:08:30.770 - 00:08:54.342, Speaker A: So the perfect substitutes case would be maybe it's the case where in a given geographical area, you're selling a couple of different licenses that are identical. I mean, one is on one frequency, one is on a different frequency, but the bidder could care less which frequency it's on. It just wants a license in that area. But it has no use for two licenses. It just doesn't have that many customers. So there's license A, there's license B, it wants one. It doesn't care which.
00:08:54.342 - 00:09:19.626, Speaker A: Right? So then you'd have VA equal to VB equal to VAB. So that's an example of substitutes. The goods are redundant or partially redundant. Having one makes you want the others less. So in this case then, let's say maybe might work. There's a chance it could work in principle. There's a lot of optimistic theory.
00:09:19.626 - 00:09:48.466, Speaker A: Okay, so a couple of the problems we discussed just evaporate when goods are substitutes. Surplus maximization is no longer that hard. If you ignore incentive constraints, it's not an easy problem. But depending on exactly what definition of substitute you use, you can either solve it exactly in polynomial time, or you can get close to optimal in polynomial time. Okay, so challenge number two is not very severe when goods are substitutes. Challenge number three also goes away. So all those weird properties of VCG, they don't show up when goods are substitutes.
00:09:48.466 - 00:10:36.310, Speaker A: So this is beautiful theory. I'll cover it one of the weeks in the advanced class in the winter. But for now, we're just going to take this on faith that the problem seems easier. There's really theory explaining how the problem is easier when goods are substitutes. In this sense it so on the other hand, if goods are complements, meaning having a good A makes you want a good B even more. So this would be the case if you don't just want one license, right? So maybe you want licenses in a bunch of adjacent geographic areas, maybe you want multiple licenses in the same area, but you really want it to be a contiguous part of the spectrum. Those would be complements.
00:10:36.310 - 00:11:26.386, Speaker A: So again, let me just define it for the two good cases. So having one good. So basically synergies, okay? So having the goods in tandem is better than the sum of having each in isolation. And as we discussed, there are complements naturally occurring in wireless spectrum auctions. Then let's say no, frankly, you wouldn't expect such a simple auction format to do well if you have a problem. That's pure compliments. And actually, if you think about it, one thing I asked you to prove on problems at number one, I think this was problem five was that so that's where you had bidders and they really just were single minded.
00:11:26.386 - 00:11:50.382, Speaker A: There was this subset of goods, there were these ten goods, and that's what they wanted. If they got any subset, they had value zero. And if they got the ten goods that they had their mind on, then they'd get some private value v sub I. So if you think about it, that's sort of extreme compliments. You have zero value for a good unless you get just the entire bundle that you want. And I asked you to prove that's a hard problem. So a reduction, I think it was from independent set, which is a very hard problem.
00:11:50.382 - 00:12:06.738, Speaker A: So even just approximate surplus maximization is very hard. And again, it's hard for any polynomial time algorithm, let alone some kind of very lightweight auction format.
00:12:06.834 - 00:12:07.480, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:12.330 - 00:12:36.718, Speaker A: So this is a really important distinction. So it shows up. People use this language all the time, both in theory and in practice. They'll talk about common trail auction environments where valuations are substitutes, this partial redundancy versus ones where it's complements. So this synergies. Now in practice, a given environment is probably not likely to be purely one or purely the other. The dichotomy is useful for sort of thinking about how to approach a problem.
00:12:36.718 - 00:13:16.682, Speaker A: So in practice, because the substitutes case seems so much easier, one thing people hope is that, say in a given spectrum auction, that the valuations are hopefully mostly substitutes. So a solution designed for the substitutes case will continue to work. But theory tends to focus. The guarantees are for environments that are just pure substitutes. All right, one thing I want to point to, if you recall the example I gave you with the revenue non monotonicity of the VCG mechanism on Monday, it was a super simple example. We started with just bidder number one who wanted the bundle AB, and then there was a second bidder that just wanted the good A. And then we thought adding a third bidder that just wanted the good B.
00:13:16.682 - 00:13:20.886, Speaker A: So that first bidder who only wanted goods A and B, that was complements.
00:13:20.998 - 00:13:21.322, Speaker B: Okay?
00:13:21.376 - 00:13:30.960, Speaker A: And that's generic. So revenue non monotonicity and all of the other incentive problems, they show up in the complements case, and it turns out you can prove they don't show up in the substitutes case.
00:13:33.090 - 00:13:36.270, Speaker B: Okay, good.
00:13:36.420 - 00:14:00.006, Speaker A: So remember I asked the question, what are we going to do if we're not going to do a direct revelation auction? And so I basically started by saying, well, let's take the simplest thing we could think of and see if we can make it work, at least in some interesting domains. So the simplest thing we think of is just separate single item auctions. And we just answered the question that when goods or substitutes are mostly so there's a chance, at least in principle, it could work.
00:14:00.108 - 00:14:00.326, Speaker B: Okay?
00:14:00.348 - 00:14:10.300, Speaker A: So let's drill down on that, focus on goods that are substitutes, see if we can get something reasonable using the simplest possible format of separate single item auctions. So that's where we are.
00:14:11.070 - 00:14:11.546, Speaker B: All right?
00:14:11.568 - 00:14:30.306, Speaker A: So now, as I mentioned, just because you've decided you're going to do separate single item auctions, there's a bunch of design decisions you have to make. There's more than one way you can sell a bunch of things in single item auctions. And there's two such decisions I want to focus on because empirically, there seems to be a right answer and a wrong answer to these two questions.
00:14:30.408 - 00:14:31.060, Speaker B: Okay?
00:14:32.950 - 00:15:47.082, Speaker A: So the first question is, if you're going to sell a bunch of things, you can do them all at once at the same time, simultaneously, or you can do them once at a time sequentially. So it turns out, rookie mistake number one for these separate sealed item auctions, sealed bid auction, single item auctions is to do it sequentially. So this is not what you want to do even in the easy case of totally identical goods, and even if each bidder only wants one. Okay, so this is not a hard problem, right? I asked you to solve this problem at exercise set number one. You just use the obvious analog of the Vic re auction where you charge everyone the K plus first highest price and you can solve this problem. Okay, but suppose instead you decided to sell these identical items one at a time.
00:15:47.216 - 00:15:47.754, Speaker B: Okay?
00:15:47.872 - 00:15:58.430, Speaker A: Actually, let's just imagine that there's two items, and let's imagine that you want one and you're willing to, say, pay $100 at the most for it.
00:15:58.500 - 00:15:59.022, Speaker B: Okay?
00:15:59.156 - 00:16:31.900, Speaker A: One auction is going to be today. One auction is going to be tomorrow. And let's even say, you know, you know, you want this thing so badly, you're going to win. So if you bid in an auction, you bid truthfully, you bid $100, you're confident you will actually be the winner should you participate today or should you participate tomorrow? Okay, so good answer, but let's actually peel back the assumptions you're making when you make that answer. So let's actually assume that the same bidders will participate other than you in both auctions, unless they win the item, in which case they'll go away.
00:16:32.350 - 00:16:33.050, Speaker B: Okay?
00:16:33.200 - 00:16:55.780, Speaker A: So there's no new arrivals, in other words. And let's also assume that all the other bidders are foolish enough to just bid their true valuations. But that's good. That's totally the first step reasoning you want to do about how you should play. Okay, that's a good starting point where you're like, okay, so everyone shows up on the first auction. So I could bid, I would win, and I would pay the second highest valuation. Or I could sleep in today.
00:16:55.780 - 00:17:25.930, Speaker A: Let the person with the second highest valuation overall win. They'd go away on tomorrow. The selling price is just going to be the third highest valuation of the original set. I'll still win, I'll go home, I'll pay less. All right, but now you realize, wait a minute. I mean, why won't other people reason in the same way they're actually going to try to probably avoid the auction I'm in so that they have a chance of winning and so forth. Okay, so there's not a dominant strategy anymore for bidders about what you should do.
00:17:25.930 - 00:17:35.742, Speaker A: And therefore you again have to actually reason pretty carefully. You have to guess, in effect, about what other bidders are doing. You have to guess what's the expected selling price in each of these two options. And that's hard to do.
00:17:35.876 - 00:17:36.560, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:42.550 - 00:18:47.030, Speaker A: So problem not DSIC need to guess selling prices. And this is hard. Okay? So even if you have sophisticated bidders doing their best, it's not clear that bestes will be the people will be. That accurate. Indeed, there was in March 2000, a small auction for some spectrum licenses where they did sell three licenses sequentially. And so what were they? They were two totally identical licenses which had 28 MHz worth of frequencies. And then last, they sold a block of spectrum, which was twice as big.
00:18:47.030 - 00:19:37.874, Speaker A: Okay, so they did them one at a time using Vickory auctions, using second price auctions. So the first one sold for 121,000,000 is in Swiss francs. The second one sold for 134. So that's 10% variation, which is maybe more than you'd like, but not that bad. And then the one that was double the size, that went for 55 million. Okay, so there's no way these could be equilibrium bids for any reasonable notion of preferences. In fairness, I mean, this may have been further hindered by the fact that before the auction, some of the companies involved strategically merged so that there'd be less competition in this auction.
00:19:37.874 - 00:20:40.250, Speaker A: That really didn't help. But sequential doesn't seem like a good idea still. So that's rookie mistake number one, to do it sequentially. So instead it's done simultaneously. That's design decision number one. The second thing I want to think about is now each individual single item auction, what format do you want to use? Okay, and so the rookie mistake number two is to in each single item auction to do its sealed bid. And again, if you put yourself in the shoes of a bidder in such an auction, it quickly becomes clear why this might not be a good idea and why you might have unpredictable outcomes and not great outcomes.
00:20:40.250 - 00:21:20.440, Speaker A: Let me just mention so I briefly alluded to the disastrous New Zealand Spectrum auction on Monday. So in this auction, the goods were roughly identical. So they were selling broadcast TV rights. So you buy one of these licenses and it gives you a right to broadcast, and they're all pretty much the same, unlike the example here. A given bidder might want more than one such license. So you might want to broadcast on multiple channels, for example. So might want more than one.
00:21:20.440 - 00:22:08.386, Speaker A: And what they did, another design decision in these auctions is what's going to be your payment rule. Okay, but so they use the second price rule, which seems fine, so they use simultaneous, so that's good. Second price, that seems fine, but then sealed bid. So vicary auctions. Okay, so think about it. I mean, really, like, imagine just like we had the experiment with the first price auctions in the second lecture. Imagine you were a bidder in this auction and I'll make it easier on you, right? Let's suppose there's ten goods.
00:22:08.386 - 00:22:50.146, Speaker A: They're all the same, okay? You want one, but you only want one. They're being sold separately, simultaneously. In vicary auctions, you have to write down ten numbers on envelopes, one for each of the goods, and you want one. Okay, what should you do? That's a reasonable strategy. So the proposal was to bid really high for one target your favorite, even though they're all the same, and go for it. For example, bid your full value for.
00:22:50.168 - 00:22:50.740, Speaker B: It.
00:22:53.350 - 00:23:13.178, Speaker A: As you like. We'll get to that. We'll get to that. That's a good comment. So the comment is pick one of the tenant random and say, bid your true value for it and maybe hope that everybody's doing that. Okay, so that's a totally reasonable answer. It's not the unique reasonable answer, it's a totally reasonable answer.
00:23:13.178 - 00:23:34.794, Speaker A: Like, what else could you try doing good. So if your value is like 100 million or something, you could try biding just 5 million on all ten. Maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you'll win the lottery and you'll get one really cheap.
00:23:34.922 - 00:23:35.502, Speaker B: Okay?
00:23:35.636 - 00:24:43.126, Speaker A: Now if you only bid 5 million and you wind up winning four by accident, you'll pay 20, which is still well less than your value. But if you bid 50 million on a bunch and then you win three of them, then you'll pay 150,000,000 more than your value. So that's also totally reasonable. Those are both reasonable strategies. And as a bidder, you have to trade off the risk of winning too many with the risk of winning too few. And again, this is not an easy problem to solve. And even if they do all use a sensible strategy like pick one at random and go for it, it's not clear you're that happy about that as the seller, right? Like, imagine there's just two goods and there's three bidders, okay? And you're using second price auctions, okay? What's going to happen? So one of these licenses will have exactly one bidder, right? So what's the second highest bid on that license? Zero.
00:24:43.126 - 00:24:48.486, Speaker A: Right? So you're basically going to give away one of the licenses. I mean, you could have a reserve price, but then you're stuck with a reserve price.
00:24:48.588 - 00:24:49.240, Speaker B: Okay?
00:24:51.130 - 00:25:00.378, Speaker A: Whereas if you think about it, if you ran the normal vicary auction to sell off both goods, say nobody wanted more than one, then both winners would charge the third highest price.
00:25:00.464 - 00:25:00.666, Speaker B: Okay?
00:25:00.688 - 00:25:31.938, Speaker A: So there's no intrinsic reason why with two goods and three bidders, you should give one away for free. Okay, that's not intrinsic to the problem. It's more competitive than that. Okay, so that's the issue with sealed bid auctions. And when that was tried in New Zealand, as I think I mentioned Monday, the revenue wound up being 36 million instead of projected 250. So basically it was like something like an 8th of what they were expecting. And if you look at some of the individual licenses, there's some pretty crazy examples.
00:25:31.938 - 00:25:48.890, Speaker A: So there's one license where the high bid was 100,000. The second highest bid was six, not 6006. There was another one where the high bid was 7 million and the second highest bid was five K 5000.
00:25:49.040 - 00:25:49.740, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:50.190 - 00:26:21.266, Speaker A: For some reason, I guess they had this agreed upon previously for transparency. The high bids were made available to the public. So that was pretty embarrassing, so people could see how much money was left on the table. So the next auction they run, for some reason they were doing simultaneous. They realized they'd done something wrong. But instead of switching sealed bid to something else, they switched second price to first price. So they ran first price sealed bid auctions, which you're still going to have for exactly the same missed coordination reasons.
00:26:21.266 - 00:27:09.190, Speaker A: You're going to have efficiency problems, you're going to have revenue problems, surplus problems, but at least it's not obvious to an observer how much money is being left on the table. At least you can't see what their maximum willingness to pay actually would have been. So guided by these trial and error, these are some of the errors. So guided by that, the standard solution is simultaneous ascending. So just think again like an English auction, like you see in the movies. Simultaneous ascending auction or SAA, okay? And conceptually, you know, I'll tell you the exact format in a second, but conceptually, you can just imagine that all of these ascending auctions are happening simultaneously in the same room.
00:27:09.340 - 00:27:09.894, Speaker B: Okay?
00:27:10.012 - 00:27:39.822, Speaker A: So basically there's one audience and there's 20 auctioneers, and they all have their own price, and you get to pick which ones you want to bid in at any time. And the price is only going up in all 20, possibly at different rates. And this is really the basis of the last 20 years or so of spectrum auctions. There's been a lot of kind of bells and whistles added, and we'll talk about some of those and the reasons why, but this really is kind of the foundation on which the practical auctions are built.
00:27:39.956 - 00:27:40.640, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:42.870 - 00:28:59.740, Speaker A: All right, so the exact format so each round so it happens in synchronized rounds. So at any given time, it'll be in the round, like 52, something like this. And each bidder, these are all pre registered bidders, you get to bid on any of the items that you want, so you can bid on all of them or a subset, whatever you want. So each round and when you bid on an item, usually you go to the next increment, which is usually five to 10% more than whatever the previous bid was. So there is usually a mechanism for so called jump bids where you go up a bunch of increments in the same round, but that's just a detail. So each bidder places bids on any subset of goods at once. It generally, although people have experimented with this generally, it's transparent in the sense that in a given round, you know exactly who, like, the identity of the highest bidder is on a given item and you know what the high bid is.
00:28:59.740 - 00:30:02.826, Speaker A: So you can imagine that there's like a leaderboard for each of the items, if you like. This is not without problems. Knowing who the highest bidder is encourages the kind of retaliation and collusion that we talked about on Monday, right? So if somebody bids outbid you on something you really want and then you know who it is, that's easier for you to retaliate than if it's some anonymous person who outbids you. But this is usually what they do. And if you have a round where nobody submits a new bid on any item, then the auction stops. Correction that I should make. So I set it in a given round.
00:30:02.826 - 00:30:46.630, Speaker A: You can bid on anything you want. There is a constraint on that, which is called an activity rule. And the point of the activity rule is to prevent bidders from just kind of hanging out, watching things unfold, and then at the last minute, bidding on stuff from out of nowhere. So for those of you that did the exercise, set one, this is called Sniping in the context of ebay. So you want to avoid Sniping like behavior in these options. So the activity rule, the real rule is a little more complicated, but think of it as the number of items that you're bidding on should only drop as the auction proceeds. You can switch which ones you're bidding on, right? But if you start out by bidding on twelve different licenses, you can't suddenly later up it to 18 licenses.
00:30:46.710 - 00:30:46.954, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:46.992 - 00:31:27.190, Speaker A: That number should be decreasing over time, but again, you can maneuver. If something's getting too expensive for you, you should feel free to switch that bid over to some other item which better fits your budget. There's a question. Well, so in an English auction, there is no highest bid per se if you think about it. So the auction, I mean, you don't actually know the highest bid any given time. Or think about Ebay, if you so think of the interface as being exactly what you see on Ebay, which is not what the maximum willingness to pay is of the high bidder. It's just kind of how much the proxy bidder had to raise their bid to beat out everybody else.
00:31:27.190 - 00:31:42.286, Speaker A: So that's exactly what you see. And indeed, bidders are never actually asked for their valuation. That's not how it works. You just say do you want to up it an increment or not, and people have the option to do that or not do that if you were.
00:31:42.308 - 00:31:44.590, Speaker B: The high bidder from the previous round.
00:31:47.890 - 00:32:59.646, Speaker A: No, it does not. So I mean, you want the auction to end for the activity rule. Oh, yes it does. So, number of items on which you are bidding on or have an incumbent bid should be dropping over time. Okay, so let me talk about the main win, or let me talk about the pros and the cons of the basic simultaneous ascending auction. So the big win and also the reason for this activity rule is for what's called price discovery. And really this just means unlike a sealed bid auction, which is one shot, unlike a sealed bid auction, bidders have opportunities for mid course corrections.
00:32:59.646 - 00:33:20.266, Speaker A: Okay, you really thought this license was going to be a bargain. Turns out everybody wants it. You had no idea it's going to be really expensive, so you switch. Or you thought this would be out of your league, but it turns out competition is low. All of a sudden you get more ambitious. Maybe you want that license instead. Or maybe you have a coordination problem, right? Maybe you and someone else wants exactly the same thing and there's two copies.
00:33:20.266 - 00:33:23.662, Speaker A: Of it and you can kind of figure out who gets what along the way.
00:33:23.796 - 00:33:24.480, Speaker B: Right?
00:33:29.090 - 00:34:26.720, Speaker A: Let's just say allows mid course corrections. And also compared to the sealed bid version, the coordination problems we talked about just aren't there if you think it through. So go back to just the simple case where you have two goods and three bidders, okay? And with the simultaneous sealed bid auctions, you're going to basically wind up giving one of those away for free. And in particular, the prices on the two goods are going to be very different. One of the goods will have two bidders, so there'll be a non zero price and the other good, which again is identical. It's the same thing that will get sold for price zero that's going to piss everybody off. Think about what happens when you have two ascending auctions in parallel for these two goods with three bidders, right? Well, if you have two goods and three bidders, someone's always going to be losing, someone's always out in the cold, and if the price is below their value, they're going to jump back in.
00:34:26.720 - 00:34:43.442, Speaker A: Right? So which of the two goods are you going to bid on if you got kicked out and you want to go back in the auction? The lower price one, right? If one's sort of less expensive, you don't care which one you get, so you'll just go for the lower one. So this will keep the prices equalized throughout the trajectory of this auction.
00:34:43.586 - 00:34:43.894, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:43.932 - 00:35:14.602, Speaker A: They're going to get sold for the same thing. So fix is missed coordination problem with smaller goods, so that's the number one reason is basically the bidders. They can't talk in advance. That's illegal and you don't want them to collude, but you still want them to somehow coordinate.
00:35:14.666 - 00:35:14.990, Speaker B: Okay.
00:35:15.060 - 00:35:25.826, Speaker A: They need to figure out which are the competitive markets, which are the non competitive markets, what the prices are going to be. And this gives them a mechanism for sort of on the fly figuring out what the prices are likely to be.
00:35:25.928 - 00:35:26.580, Speaker B: Okay.
00:35:28.470 - 00:36:06.346, Speaker A: And now I hope it's more clear why you always have this activity rule, right? So why sniping would be a disaster, right? So if everybody just sort of sat there and then everybody just bid at the end, it would reduce to essentially a sealed bid auction. Okay? Similarly, you don't want anyone to just free ride on the price discovery that other people are doing and then just sort of bid at the end with good price information. Everybody should contribute to the price discovery. So everybody should be involved from the get go. That's the point of the activity rule. So something related which is also really useful is so called valuation discovery.
00:36:06.458 - 00:36:07.070, Speaker B: Okay?
00:36:07.220 - 00:36:51.614, Speaker A: So in general, in the theory, we just treat it as if people are born knowing their valuation, okay? They could just recall it from the top of their head. If you think about it, that's probably not true, right? You go to one of these companies and you're like, well, how much? You ask the CEO, how much would you be willing to pay for licenses A, B, and C? At the very least, he's going to sort of call his in house experts and get their estimate. Maybe they hire a consulting firm to do a study to figure out exactly where the technology is right now and what are the projected revenues from that technology if it works out, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So the point is, it's not costless to evaluate your valuation. So the last thing you want to do is evaluate your valuation for lots of different bundles, but as the prices evolve, you can figure out which of the bundles you're likely to care about.
00:36:51.732 - 00:36:52.314, Speaker B: Okay?
00:36:52.452 - 00:37:02.420, Speaker A: So you only have to evaluate your valuations on the ones that seem to be relevant, given the trajectory of the auction. So that's another bonus. This question.
00:37:08.570 - 00:37:10.790, Speaker B: Would not mean that it would go for another round.
00:37:14.650 - 00:37:54.434, Speaker A: You want everybody in the auction the entire time. So that's the point of the activity rule. You want everybody to be contributing to price discovery as early as possible and for the duration of the auction. Definitely, yeah, that's definitely part of the point of the ascending format so that you can make those mid course corrections. So you have to plan. So like I said, the activity rule is more complicated than what I just said. So they do take into account if some things are sort of bigger or more valuable than others.
00:37:54.434 - 00:38:02.920, Speaker A: That's part of the activity rule correction. But you also have to plan for this. So you also have to bid aggressively enough at the beginning so that you can implement your contingency plans later.
00:38:05.930 - 00:38:06.840, Speaker B: All right.
00:38:09.450 - 00:39:04.374, Speaker A: So those are simultaneously sending auctions, and it's a little bit hard to know. Okay, so they seem to do reasonably well. People been using them for 20 years and variations thereof. Okay, so that's a sign that they're getting reasonable performance. They're not without flaws, and we'll drill down on that next. So what do I mean by work? Well, so it's believed that they generally produce maybe not optimal surplus, but good surplus, much better surplus than in the bad formats that we discussed. And if you think about it, I mean, this is one of those assertions which it's not really clear how you'd ever validate it, right? Because surplus references people's private valuations.
00:39:04.374 - 00:39:23.498, Speaker A: The surplus is if you knew everyone's valuations, the biggest sum, you could make the best allocation. You don't know people's valuations. And as we've discussed, and as you'll see further, this auction is not dominant strategy and center compatible truthful biding at every round is not generally a best response.
00:39:23.594 - 00:39:24.142, Speaker B: Okay?
00:39:24.276 - 00:39:51.106, Speaker A: So you can't just take the bids and assume they're equal to the valuations because there are strategic opportunities. So it's not clear how you would after the fact, looking at the data evaluate this claim that you have near optimal surplus. So what do they do? They look at various sanity checks. They say things like, well, similar items, identical items sold for basically the same price. That's a good sign. There was little to no resale. That would be a good sign that speculators weren't involved.
00:39:51.106 - 00:40:34.280, Speaker A: If there is resale, they check that the prices are pretty close to what the price was that it was bought actually in the auction. They look at the collections of goods that bidders got so licenses, and they see if they make sensible packages, right? So if they make sense together, so they'll check if a bidder hopefully was able to piece together a bunch of licenses from geographically neighboring areas. If they were able to do that, there were synergies amongst those goods for that bidder. That's a win. It says, despite the fact that all the auctions were run in parallel, they were able to adapt their bidding strategy so that they got the package that they want. So these are the kind of things that they look for in the data sanity checks that they seem to be doing a pretty good job, at least. So those are the good things.
00:40:34.280 - 00:41:54.606, Speaker A: Let's talk about the two main problems with this sort of first cut format, so issues. And these are both sort of very real phenomena, okay? So these are not just kind of thought experiment problems. They're real problems. So the first one is called demand reduction. And this is an issue even when goods are substitutes. So even in sort of the perfect world, where the theory is as optimistic as possible and it so the idea of demand reduction is it may be that while in a surplus maximizing allocation, a bidder gets a lot. Of goods in a simultaneous ascending auction, they might only target a fewer number of goods, less than how many they really want, so that they get those goods at a low price.
00:41:54.788 - 00:41:55.422, Speaker B: Okay?
00:41:55.556 - 00:42:05.300, Speaker A: So basically, by lowering your own demand, seeking out fewer of the goods, you lower competition, which results in lower prices, and that can be a win for you. Let me give you a concrete example.
00:42:07.210 - 00:42:07.686, Speaker B: All right?
00:42:07.708 - 00:42:44.180, Speaker A: So two identical goods. Suppose we have one bidder, and if it gets one good, it knows what to do with it. It can make ten units, ten units of value of it. And if you give it a second good, it's twice as happy. On the other hand, the second bidder, it doesn't know what to do with the second good. With a second license, it has no use or capacity for it. So its value for either one good or for two goods, let's say, is equal to eight.
00:42:44.180 - 00:43:41.262, Speaker A: So what you know, so suppose if you knew these, what would be the surplus maximizing allocation? What would you do? Yeah, I mean, it's clear that you want to give them both to the first bidder, right? It has value ten for each, and the second bidder only has value eight for one. So suppose you actually ran the VCG mechanism on this instance. Do you see what revenue you would get? Well, so one way to calculate the payments is you look at the surplus loss inflicted on the other bidders. So if we deleted bidder one, then there'd only be bidder two left. So we get a surplus of eight. So that's going to be the payment that bidder one pays. But we're not running the VCG mechanism.
00:43:41.262 - 00:43:58.246, Speaker A: We're thinking about running a simultaneous ascending auction. So imagine you're bidder two, which means you want one good. You don't care which, you're willing to pay eight for it.
00:43:58.428 - 00:43:59.160, Speaker B: Okay?
00:44:00.010 - 00:44:12.970, Speaker A: So my question is at what point would you give up? Would you go home and stop bidding in this auction? What would have to happen before you're ready to give up both goods would have to be too expensive for you.
00:44:13.040 - 00:44:13.418, Speaker B: Okay?
00:44:13.504 - 00:44:52.886, Speaker A: You're willing to pay eight for either one. Okay, so if the price of one is less than eight, you got a shot at positive utility. You're going to stay there. It's only when both prices hit eight, you're going to go home. All right? So what that means if you're bidder one and you stubbornly demand to win both goods, what are you going to have to pay in the simultaneous ascending auction? 16.
00:44:52.998 - 00:44:53.706, Speaker B: Okay.
00:44:53.888 - 00:45:45.162, Speaker A: In VCG mechanism, where you could actually express your full valuation, you get sort of your rightful, quote unquote, payment of eight. But because there's no coordination explicitly between the simultaneous auctions, you have to pay 16. So its utility would still be positive, but it would only be four. So if you're bidder one, what if you just said, you know what, punt on the second good, we'll make do with one. What's going to be the outcome of the simultaneous sending auction? If bidder one up front decides that right. So basically one of the bidders will go for one good, the other bidder will go for the other good, and everyone goes home happy except for the seller. So both goods get allocated essentially for free.
00:45:45.296 - 00:45:45.980, Speaker B: Okay.
00:45:50.130 - 00:46:16.290, Speaker A: So better to target one good, in which case both get sold at price roughly zero. Okay, so the surplus is worse. It's dropped from 20 to 18 and the revenue has really dropped. It's dropped from eight in the VCG mechanism down to zero.
00:46:16.440 - 00:46:17.300, Speaker B: All right.
00:46:17.670 - 00:46:32.870, Speaker A: And again, this happens. I mean, this is a well known strategy. If you are a bidder, it's well known that this is something you should consider. You might want to lower your demand. Why? It lowers competition. Therefore selling prices are going to be lower. So the goods that you do get, you get cheaply.
00:46:32.870 - 00:47:27.180, Speaker A: Okay, so it's not always a win, but it can be a win. So that's demand reduction. Even with identical goods, you can have that happen in simultaneous ascending options. The second flaw I want to talk about, it's going to be in a setting where we already discussed that simultaneous ascending auctions were not necessarily going to work that well, namely complements. And so I want to show you concretely what goes wrong, something called the exposure problem. So any questions before I talk about the exposure problem? That's a good question. Yeah.
00:47:27.180 - 00:48:10.746, Speaker A: So the question is sort of how do you interpret value? It's a subtle question. So on the one hand, you could think of a bidder's value, its willingness to pay as including whatever it specs to be able to get resale. So somehow that's money it's going to get later. On the other hand, when we talk about maximizing surplus, that's sort of not what we mean. We don't really mean the value they get, it's just like cash money from selling it to somebody else. We really mean some notion of greater good. So with a spectrum auction, why do we want to maximize surplus? Because we want this scarce resource of the spectrum to be used by the firms who have the capacity to sort of do the best technology with it.
00:48:10.746 - 00:48:34.900, Speaker A: That's really what we want. We want it to be utilized in the best way. So that's one reason why auctions that are subject to resale, where you do see significant resale afterwards, are viewed as failures. So it is a criterion for judging these things in practice. It's not very sharply captured in the mathematical models I've been giving you.
00:48:37.110 - 00:48:37.860, Speaker B: Okay.
00:48:42.710 - 00:49:49.722, Speaker A: So exposure problem, and again, this shows up when you have complements. But because in spectrum auctions you do have complements, again, think about geographically nearby or within the spectrum nearby frequencies you do have complements. So it is an issue. So again, easy to explain with a simple example. Two goods, different goods this time. And whenever you want a nasty compliments example, just use one of these bidders who only wants a set or wants nothing. So bidder one only wants A and B doesn't want either one individually, let's say it's willing to pay 100 for both and bidder two just wants either one, doesn't care which it's agnostic, and it's willing to pay 75 for either one.
00:49:49.722 - 00:50:45.340, Speaker A: Okay, but it doesn't want more than one. So same exercise, what's the max surplus here? 100, right. You can only get 75 from the second bidder. You can get 100 from the first bidder and they're mutually exclusive. So you should give the big bidder what it wants and the VCG revenue in that case, yeah, just 75. It's basically like a second price auction in this example. Okay, but let's reason, just like we did before, if you're bidder number two, when are you going to go home? Again, just like before, only when both goods because you're happy with either one, only when both goods hit a price of 75.
00:50:45.340 - 00:51:31.740, Speaker A: Again, this is in a simultaneous ascending auction we're talking about. So in a simultaneous extending auction, number two goes home only when both prices are at least 75. So bidder one is the rightful winner from a surplus perspective. Okay, but if you're bidder one in a simultaneous setting auction, what should you do? What's your plan, your best course of action? Yeah, you should run away.
00:51:32.670 - 00:51:33.420, Speaker B: Okay.
00:51:34.270 - 00:51:49.390, Speaker A: To actually get the bundle that you have positive value for, you have to pay 150. Your value is only 100. And then the only other option is you get exactly one of the goods, which is maybe even more of a disaster because you have value zero and you have to pay something for it.
00:51:49.540 - 00:51:50.334, Speaker B: Okay.
00:51:50.532 - 00:52:07.250, Speaker A: So you should just get out of this auction as quickly as you can. That's, of course, assuming that you knew this was a 75. What makes this hard is for all you know, this is a 40 and you should go for it, or it's a 75 and going for it, you're going to be host negative utility.
00:52:07.410 - 00:52:08.120, Speaker B: Okay.
00:52:08.570 - 00:53:00.550, Speaker A: And so as you can imagine from the bidder perspective, this is scary and this leads to low bidding. So non aggressive biding, especially early in the auction before you've had much price discovery. Okay, so this is a real problem, this exposure problem. And it's just if you have compliments, it's just something you got to deal with. All right, so those are the two main issues with this simplest format. So let me just make a couple comments about sort of the bells and whistles, the sort of add ons that these two drawbacks have motivated and which are actually used in the practical sort of the FCC auctions that have been used. But I'm just going to make some brief comments because I want to talk about the auction that's probably going to be run next year.
00:53:00.550 - 00:53:57.910, Speaker A: So I want to bring you up to the cutting edge before time's up. So a question is, what should we do about demand reduction in the exposure problem? So one answer, which really was kind of the policy until about 2007, was don't fix what ain't broken too badly. Okay, so the simultaneous setting auctions, especially compared to some of these other super scary bad formats that had happened in the past, they were doing fine. The revenue almost always met the projections. The identical goods were going for the same prices. There was some weirdness, you could see demand reduction, you could see a little bit of collusion emerge over the rounds, but it didn't have any kind of deal breaker kind of flaws and any modification to the format. It's a little hard to predict what's going to happen, especially if you make the auction more complicated.
00:53:57.910 - 00:54:42.902, Speaker A: On the other end, the last five years, after people proposed some new formats, they did a lot of theoretical analysis suggesting why these formats might perform well. They did a lot of laboratory experiments, meaning just sort of computer simulations with people like undergraduate students being the bidders and this kind of thing suggesting that maybe these would do well, would do better than the straightforward essay implementation. They have been experimenting with so called package bidding. And by a package bid, I just mean a bid which is on more than one good, okay? You don't say I want good C at price ten. You say I want goods C and E and I'll pay 20 for it.
00:54:42.956 - 00:54:43.126, Speaker B: Okay?
00:54:43.148 - 00:55:38.130, Speaker A: That's all a package bid means, okay? It's a set of more than one good. And let me just briefly mention kind of the two main ways that have been experimented with of introducing package bids. So the first way is to add one final round, so called proxy round. And so what this works is you do the simultaneous sending auction just as described now, and eventually it ends. And then every bidder gets one final chance to submit any number of package bids that it wants. So the old individual item bids are still valid. So in effect, you view for each of the M items the winning bid in the first phase as a bid for that individual item at a given price, and then bidders also submit these subsets.
00:55:38.290 - 00:55:39.000, Speaker B: Okay?
00:55:40.650 - 00:56:24.466, Speaker A: Then you have to figure out, okay, what's the allocation? So what you do is you do a surplus maximizing computation with the bids being proxies as values. So that's an empty hard problem. But often these are sort of small instances that you can still solve. So you figure out the surplus maximizing valuation allocation, assuming bids are correct, and then there's a frankly fairly complicated pricing rule at the end of it. The reason the pricing rule is complicated is because, as we observed, when you have compliments, which is the whole point of these package bids, when you have compliments, the VCG payments are a disaster. They can be zero even though you have a seemingly competitive environment, they have these non monotonicity properties that encourage all this weird collusion. So they do not use the VCG payment rule.
00:56:24.466 - 00:56:48.554, Speaker A: They use something else which cannot be dominant strategy incentive compatible. Because if you use the VCG allocation rule, the only way to get DSIC is to use the VCG payment rule. So they relax DSIC. It has some other weaker incentive properties, but they're more aggressive prices to get higher revenue. So that's the gist. One final round with a kind of VCG computation on steroids to figure it out. And it's kind of complicated.
00:56:48.554 - 00:57:18.534, Speaker A: They've experimented with it there's. Nice theory, but it's really not fully understood. My sense is some people are still a little bit scared of the complexity of this format, but it has been used some so that's the first 1 second one is rather than delegate the ability to propose package bids to the bidders as the designer up front, you decide on which subsets of goods are allowed to be bid on.
00:57:18.732 - 00:57:19.238, Speaker B: Okay?
00:57:19.324 - 00:57:39.434, Speaker A: And you decide on the allowable package bids in a way that keeps the allocation rule simple. That keeps the payment rule simple. Also, you want these packages to be sensible. So what are they, concretely? So you can still bid for individual licenses, but maybe there's a cluster in the same region. It's like the mid Atlantic region. So that'll be a subset of bids. That'll be an allowable package.
00:57:39.434 - 00:58:19.610, Speaker A: Everybody knows that's an allowable package up front. Then there maybe it will be a nationwide bundle if you want to get coverage across the country. So it'll have this nice hierarchical structure which enables things like polynomial time algorithms to maximize surplus and compute suitable payments. So either you can let the bidders propose the packages themselves at the end of the auction, or up front, you can say which ones are allowable. And I think this second format seems to be the one that's been being used more recently over the past few years. It's called hierarchical package bidding HPB. So predefined allowable package bids.
00:58:19.610 - 00:59:23.826, Speaker A: So I should say even this, it's not obvious. It's a good idea because using it assumes that you, as the designer, the mechanism designer, have correctly identified in advance the packages that are going to be of interest to the bidders. And if you got it wrong, if some bidder really wants goods C, D and E, and you put C and D in one package, e in a different package, you've arguably made the problem even worse for the bidder. It's like, oh man, I really want these three goods, but maybe I have to actually buy four goods, two pairs, so I can cover the three that I want. So even here, it's not obvious whether it's a win, although the fact that the FCC seems to be using it lately suggests to me that it is at least some kind of win over the vanilla simultaneous setting auction format. So that sort of catches it up to the present. I want to conclude the lecture by talking about the future.
00:59:23.826 - 00:59:53.994, Speaker A: Any questions about that? Yes, items are always available, so you should think of it, really. I mean, the computer scientist, it makes tons of sense because it's really just like a tree. So basically you have your leaves, which are your individual items, and then you're going to have the next level of your tree, which is sort of the so this will correspond to the subset of these three items. See what I'm saying? So it's just like hierarchical. And then up at the top you have like, say, a nationwide plan.
00:59:54.112 - 00:59:55.820, Speaker B: Is there some strategy that.
01:00:00.290 - 01:00:42.102, Speaker A: Yeah, so it gets interesting. So a couple of things. So first of all, if memory serves, when you oh, no, that's for the first format. Yeah, in some sense it gets interesting. What's the right way to say this? So it's almost like you wind up having these different coalitions of bidders kind of figuring out, trying to bid high enough. So imagine that these were all the licenses and the high bids on the individual licenses say all ten of them was 100 million or something. And there are these two big companies.
01:00:42.102 - 01:01:31.800, Speaker A: One was biding on the first five, this was biding on the second five. So the allocation is going to be chosen. Well, if the bid on the first five and the bid on the second five, if that sum is bigger than 100 million, that'll get chosen. If it's less than 100 million, then all of the individuals well, I guess, okay, you could choose one of the five, but otherwise you're sort of competing to sort of beat out all of these individual bidders. So now you have this interesting problem where these two companies, in sum, they need to get higher than 100 million. And the question is which one of them is going to kind of be the one who bids high enough to be the tipping point where they get chosen instead of individual bidders? So you have like these weird almost sort of coalitions emerging as the auction proceeds because you want you and these other people to be chosen in the final round. So it starts mattering sort of how you fit with other bidders, like who you conflict with, other questions.
01:01:33.610 - 01:01:48.560, Speaker B: Yeah, having it.
01:01:52.710 - 01:01:54.500, Speaker A: Could you repeat the question?
01:01:54.950 - 01:02:09.890, Speaker B: Sorry. So, like, devices separately gets broken up by the final proxy.
01:02:13.130 - 01:02:18.882, Speaker A: Well, I mean, you can always bid in with negative utility. So you can only bid on individual items in the first phase.
01:02:18.946 - 01:02:19.560, Speaker B: Yes.
01:02:20.970 - 01:02:34.270, Speaker A: So in that one, when you bid on a package, you have to make sure you beat out the sum of the high prices for the individual items. So if you bid on a bundle, you need to actually be a higher bid than what's implied by the individual high bids.
01:02:36.930 - 01:02:43.760, Speaker B: One of the and then it sort of like that.
01:02:48.150 - 01:03:22.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not following. Maybe asking after class. All right, so I want to talk about an auction that maybe will happen next year with this shutdown. I have no idea anymore. I tried to go to the FCC website to prep for the lecture and it was down. All right, so this is going to be a double auction. All right? So one thing you might be wondering is where does this spectrum come from anyways? Does it grow on trees? The government just keeps selling it off and auction after auction after auction.
01:03:22.598 - 01:03:50.070, Speaker A: Right, well, maybe you remember like five years ago, you might remember like, analog television went away, became digital. Why did they do that? They did that to free up spectrum, to repurpose it for modern technologies. Right. So that was the whole point of doing that. They're doing something similar now. Okay, so it's going to be a double auction, meaning they're both buyers and sellers. And the new part is a reverse auction.
01:03:50.070 - 01:04:55.690, Speaker A: The only time you've seen a reverse auction is on exercise set number one. And that's when I talked about hiring a single contractor and I asked you to give an analog of the vicary auction for hiring a single contractor. So that's a reverse auction. You want stuff and you're buying it from people as opposed to selling it to people. So what would the government want to buy? Well, it wants to free up spectrum to resell who has the spectrum. So TV broadcasters think like UHF channels, like in the 40s, okay? These are the TV broadcasters that are being targeted, and the government's going to buy them out and then reuse that spectrum and sell it back to companies that can develop new technologies with it. Okay, so reverse auction to buy out TV broadcasters, free up some new spectrum, and then sort of the same old stuff in the forward auction.
01:04:55.690 - 01:05:13.170, Speaker A: So resell to telecoms, et cetera. And so far, basically in this lecture, I've given you everything you need to know to understand how two is going to happen. So two they know how to do. They have tons of experience.
01:05:13.320 - 01:05:21.730, Speaker B: This is Newton.
01:05:24.710 - 01:06:22.598, Speaker A: Another twist to the problem. There's going to be some auction to figure out which TV broadcasters to buy their station from them, okay? And it may be that in some places the person was on channel 39. Somewhere else in the neighboring geographic location, the cheapest person turned out to be channel 47 and so forth. And that doesn't really work. You really want sort of the same frequencies to be made available across the country. So in addition to buying out a subset of the TV broadcasters, they're going to repack what frequencies they broadcast on. So the way you want to think about this is sort of, you know, right now before this auction happens, I forget the exact channel range, but let's say it's something like channels 38 to 51.
01:06:22.598 - 01:06:41.850, Speaker A: All this stuff is UHF TV. And what's going to happen is some of the channels are going to be freed up and some will stay TV. So maybe 38 to 45 is still going to be TV, but then the rest of the channels are going to be freed up.
01:06:42.000 - 01:06:42.506, Speaker B: Okay?
01:06:42.608 - 01:07:24.300, Speaker A: And again, the plan is not to only buy out television broadcasters who broadcast on these channels. The plan is to sort of buy out as many TV broadcasters as possible, as cheaply as possible, and whoever's left change their channel, as it were, repack them so that they're all on the same part of the spectrum. So that's what's going to happen. I should say that's sort of the plan. This is still under discussion. Everything I talk about today is sort of about the proposal stage and it might get modified. What actually gets run, who knows? But based on the meetings that I've sat in, people discussing the various proposals, this is my best understanding of what's most likely to happen probably next year.
01:07:25.470 - 01:07:26.220, Speaker B: Okay.
01:07:28.350 - 01:08:10.680, Speaker A: So let me talk some about the reverse auction. And what's super cool is this reverse auction that's going to be used. It's. Basically a single parameter greedy allocation rule, just like the ones we've been talking about when we talked about, for example, knapsack auctions. That seems to be the leading proposal for the style of mechanism that will get used for this reverse auction. So it's likely to be a killer application of this greedy algorithmic mechanism design paradigm. So here's the model they're using.
01:08:10.680 - 01:08:56.194, Speaker A: So a bitter eye has a valuation VI. And so this is their value for a good that they currently own, okay? Not something they're trying to acquire, something they have. So that means to buy them out, you have to pay them at least Visa Buy if you like. This is a minimum willingness to accept rather than a maximum willingness to pay, okay? Need to pay at least VI to buy out. All right? So it's single parameter, okay, that's an abstraction. We're sort of assuming there's one strategic agent per TV station. In reality, people can own multiple, but this is the first cut abstraction.
01:08:56.194 - 01:09:05.706, Speaker A: Now, what are the outcomes? What are the feasible outcomes? So a set s of winning bidders, and here by winning, I mean they get bought out, okay? Those are the ones that win.
01:09:05.808 - 01:09:06.460, Speaker B: Okay?
01:09:11.230 - 01:10:06.970, Speaker A: So what's feasible? So remember what we're trying to accomplish. We're trying to buy out so many people, but who's left can be repacked in some target number of channels, say eight channels, okay? So it's feasible if the people who are left can be repacked into the target. And another thing that's cool is so this proposed format, it's very algorithmic on really two different levels. So first of all, Azure C, the allocation rule itself, as far as who gets bought out and who doesn't, that's going to be a greedy algorithm. The second thing is even this feasibility checking. So I give you a subset of 373 stations. You want to know whether or not they can nationwide be repacked into a given part of the spectrum.
01:10:06.970 - 01:10:34.662, Speaker A: That's a really difficult problem. It's empty hard for sure, and it's medium size, so you can't just solve it with brute force search. So basically one of the things they're trying to figure out is what is the best technology for actually solving this repacking subroutine in a reasonable amount of time. So as far as I know, basically the latest sat solvers and the latest integer programming solvers are sort of battling it out about which is more appropriate to solve this problem.
01:10:34.796 - 01:10:35.382, Speaker B: Okay?
01:10:35.516 - 01:10:44.514, Speaker A: So we're going to have this outer loop, which is a greedy algorithm, and then an inner loop, which is the sort of solving this non trivial, empty, hard problem. So let me tell you the allocation.
01:10:44.562 - 01:10:45.270, Speaker B: Rule.
01:11:03.190 - 01:11:52.998, Speaker A: It'S going to be familiar to you or at least the general structure. So we're used to thinking about forward auctions where you're less likely to be feasible the more winning bidders there are. But remember here a set is feasible if whose left can be repacked. So the trivial feasible set here is not the empty set like we're used to. The trivial feasible set is everybody the whole set B. If you buy out all of the TV broadcasters, well, then surely you've freed up all the spectrum that you want. Okay, so we're going to start with a trivial feasible set, and now we just delete bidders until we can't delete bidders anymore subject to feasibility.
01:11:53.114 - 01:11:53.394, Speaker B: Okay?
01:11:53.432 - 01:12:40.720, Speaker A: So feasibility is an invariant of the solution we maintain. So while there exists a remaining bidder such that we could get away with, deleting it. And don't forget, checking whether S minus I is feasible. What does that mean? That means checking whether B minus this set can be repacked. So this is this empty complete problem that has to get solved in every iteration of the Screedy allocation rule. So while there exists something we could delete, delete some such i, so that's under specified at the moment. And then when you have a set from which you can't delete anybody without breaking feasibility, you return what you've got.
01:12:40.720 - 01:13:21.982, Speaker A: So it's really just your canonical greedy algorithm. So star, like I said, is underdetermined. So the question is, how should we pick when there are multiple people eligible to be deleted, who should we pick to delete? And this is something any student of algorithms is well positioned to come up with lots of great ideas for.
01:13:22.116 - 01:13:22.800, Speaker B: Okay.
01:13:25.570 - 01:13:37.490, Speaker A: So we're basically trying to sort of minimize the cost, right? So we're trying to pay as little as possible, buying people out. Or put differently, if we're going to take away stations from people, we want to take them away from the people who value them the least.
01:13:37.640 - 01:13:37.954, Speaker B: Okay?
01:13:37.992 - 01:14:01.290, Speaker A: That's the surplus maximizing thing in this context. So when you get deleted, that corresponds to not being bought out. The winners get bought out. So if you don't win, you don't get bought out. So they should be the people with the highest values. They should be the ones left. So natural greedy rules would be highest bidder who's feasible to delete.
01:14:01.290 - 01:14:47.462, Speaker A: But there's also a lot of other things you could try. You can look at highest bid over the population size. So different TV broadcasters have licenses covering different areas, different populations. You can look at per capita. So basically, people are experimenting with all of the kind of obvious greedy rules you'd come up with to see which ones seem to work the best in the sense of getting closest to the optimal surplus. So, et cetera. The one thing that is important, whatever greedy rule that you choose to implement is it should be the case that the less that you bid, the less that you value your TV station, it should only become more likely that you get bought out, that you win.
01:14:47.462 - 01:15:52.174, Speaker A: So monotonicity goes the reverse way because we're now in a reverse auction. So monotonicity says as you lower your bid, you're more likely to win. That is, you're less likely to get chosen in this deletion step, all right? But all of the natural greedy rules have that property. So I'll put this on the next exercise set, provided the greedy rule has the natural monotonicity, so does the allocation rule. So you can use critical bids, which in this context is the smallest number than a Witter could have bid and continued to be bought out. So remember in the exercise set, number one, when we did the simple reverse auction, you give it to the lowest bidder, the minimum cost contractor, but you pay them the second minimum cost. So it's the same thing here.
01:15:52.174 - 01:16:04.130, Speaker A: The critical bid is the highest bid, at which the bidder would still win. And this gives a DIC mechanism.
01:16:07.030 - 01:16:07.346, Speaker B: I.
01:16:07.368 - 01:16:49.534, Speaker A: Suspect, know, assuming this actually gets used, and again, I think it was the leading candidate, I don't expect them to do a direct revelation version. I don't expect people to be happy with sealed bids, but it's quite straightforward to implement this instead as a descending auction. So you start with the prices being super high, everybody's willing to be bought out at a billion dollars, and then you bring the price slowly down, and then people drop out. People are no longer to be bought out, no longer willing to be bought out, as you bring the price down. And that corresponds to this deletion step. So that's where we're going with FCC spectrum auctions. And it seems that the work that's being done in computer science, I think, is really more relevant than ever.
01:16:49.534 - 01:17:07.090, Speaker A: Again, it's both in the inner loop with this kind of empty, complete algorithms being used, and in the outer loop, obviously motivated by lots of work you've seen, even as an undergrad on greedy approximation algorithms. So that's it for spectrum auctions. I'll see you on Monday. Bye.
