00:00:00.170 - 00:00:47.210, Speaker A: So I want to do one other thing in this first lecturer, which is to go to consider the, you know, most, in some ways the most general scenario where any welfare guarantees are known for any sort of non brute force procedure. And it's going to illustrate a nice trick for how you can prove price of Anarchy bounds for Bayesian Ash Equia without going through the smoothness regime. So it's going to be a more direct argument which seems necessary for a result of this generality.
00:00:47.210 - 00:01:10.770, Speaker A: So let me tell you the setting. I think we're at scenario nine, but to be honest, I've sort of lost track. So this is going to be the most general one we've seen thus far, where bidders have what are called subadtative valuations.
00:01:10.770 - 00:01:50.960, Speaker A: Which just means that if you look at two bundles, then my value for their union is at most as much as my value for each of them separately. The sum of my value for each of them separately. So you should be wondering how this relates to all of the other classes evaluations that we've seen.
00:01:50.960 - 00:02:16.290, Speaker A: And the answer is, for the stuff we've been focusing on, this is strictly more general than anything we've studied thus far. So in particular, it's not hard to prove, I'll leave this as an optional exercise, that this is strictly more general than XOS valuations. So XOS valuations, that was the sort of perhaps weird class, this maximum of additive valuations.
00:02:16.290 - 00:02:30.374, Speaker A: But the key point was XOS was strictly more general than submodular. And remember, submodular was already giving us sort know fits for multiple weeks. So the picture you want to have in mind is gross substitutes.
00:02:30.374 - 00:02:54.850, Speaker A: That's sort of the frontier of tractability, as we've discussed, of exact tractability at least. Then we went to submodular and we studied that for a long time. And now, in the context of these simple auction formats, it turned out that the important property of submodulular valuations for simultaneous second price auctions at least, was that there was special case of an XOS valuation maximum additive.
00:02:54.850 - 00:03:06.120, Speaker A: And then sub additive is out here. And all of these are strict. So, for example, showing containment is quite easy.
00:03:06.120 - 00:03:18.106, Speaker A: So suppose you have an XOS valuation. Why is it subaditive? Well, okay, suppose your evaluation was actually additive, right? And think about s and t disjoint. That's the interesting case here.
00:03:18.106 - 00:03:40.226, Speaker A: This holds with equality, right, for an additive valuation by definition. So suppose your XOS, well, just pick the additive valuation that's exact on this particular bundle, and that's going to give you some lower bound on the valuations over here. But then reoptimizing picking the new additive valuation to maximize this.
00:03:40.226 - 00:03:42.530, Speaker A: And to maximize this will give you something only higher.
00:03:42.680 - 00:03:43.234, Speaker B: Okay?
00:03:43.352 - 00:04:01.990, Speaker A: So that's kind of the two line proof of why XOS has to be subaditive. And it's not hard to find a strict separation either. So what else should you know about Sabbatic evaluations? There's no known sort of constant factor DSIC mechanisms or anything like that for Sebatic evaluations.
00:04:01.990 - 00:04:25.646, Speaker A: The good news is, if you just look at the algorithmic problem of welfare maximization, we do know how to do that well in polynomial time. Well, meaning there's a two approximation algorithm. It's an ingenious approximation algorithm, so it's not easy, and it's a little less than ten years old, so it's relatively recent, but we do know how to do it assuming demand oracles.
00:04:25.758 - 00:04:26.420, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:26.950 - 00:04:48.140, Speaker A: And the way you should sort of think about subaded evaluations, I mean, it's basically roughly the frontier at which we know how to do constant factor approximations, even if we don't care about incentives at all. So in some sense, it's the limit where we might hope to have constant factor guarantees for simple auctions. And as I'll show you, you can get that.
00:04:48.140 - 00:04:50.890, Speaker A: That'll be the point of the rest of the lecture.
00:04:52.110 - 00:04:52.860, Speaker B: Okay?
00:04:55.790 - 00:05:08.480, Speaker A: All right, so good. So you have to work hard to develop a polynomial time algorithm to get constant factor approximation. What happens if you just use some simple auction, like simultaneous first or second price auctions? That's the question.
00:05:08.480 - 00:05:40.002, Speaker A: So fact is that smoothness doesn't seem to get you a constant factor, at least to the extent that we understand the limits of smoothness. So it seems to get stuck at giving you a price of anarchy at like, one over log M, where M is the number of items and the reason that you pick up a log M going from. So remember, we do know how to get a constant factor here.
00:05:40.002 - 00:06:06.542, Speaker A: That was the point of the last couple of weeks. And the reason you pick up a log M going from XOS to subaditive is the XOS valuations had this really nice property that so remember, it was always, how do you define the B stars? How do you define the deviations? And the way we did it is we said, well, let's think about what items we rightfully are supposed to get in the optimal solution, and then we're going to go all out for them. And in our analysis, we really used two properties.
00:06:06.542 - 00:06:36.582, Speaker A: We used that. There was this added evaluation, so this bid that was exactly representing our valuation on this particular set and was only smaller on every other set, so only underestimated so didn't overbid on other subsets. And if you go back and look at the analysis, I don't expect you to remember offhand, but we really needed both of those properties in verifying the Smoonis inequalities, and those bids just don't exist for subaded evaluations to target a set and with an added evaluation.
00:06:36.582 - 00:07:00.930, Speaker A: So with bids in a simultaneous single item auction, if you want to bid exactly your value on a particular subset, you might be forced to overbid on certain subsets by a log factor. And that logarithmic factor shows up in the analysis, and it can cause you problems. So you can get a one over log price of anarchy, but it's not known how to do better using these extension theorems.
00:07:00.930 - 00:07:16.520, Speaker A: So instead what we're going to do is we're going to use a direct argument, and I'll tell you what I mean by that. And it still sort of has the flavor of smoothness, but it isn't. But the good news is the bottom line looks really good.
00:07:16.520 - 00:07:28.422, Speaker A: Okay, for simultaneous first price auctions, the Bayes Nash price of anarchy. And this has to be product distributions. Remember, we know even for unit demand valuations, the correlated price of anarchy is terrible.
00:07:28.422 - 00:07:46.606, Speaker A: But for product distributions, we get that this is bounded below by a half. And so again, this is the best we know how to do with arbitrarily sophisticated polynomial time approximation algorithms. So it's competitive with approximation algorithms, sort of apples versus oranges comparison.
00:07:46.606 - 00:08:01.714, Speaker A: But still that's something we're very happy with at this level of generality. And then for second price auctions, it degrades down to a fourth, but it's still a constant factor. Okay, so I'm going to show you this proof.
00:08:01.714 - 00:08:07.800, Speaker A: I'm going to show you this result. This is similar arguments, a few extra details. Okay, so this is going to be the plan.
00:08:07.800 - 00:08:57.174, Speaker A: All right, so what does it mean to go beyond smoothness to do a direct argument? So here's the flexibility. We're going to allow ourselves in, the proof that will allow us to get these better bounds. We're still going to be defining these hypothetical deviations b star, but in smoothness, within smoothness arguments, the key point is that they're independent of whatever bid profile b we're eventually going to invoke it in.
00:08:57.174 - 00:09:09.580, Speaker A: Okay, so the order of the quantifiers were for every valuation profile there exists b stars. So that for every b. Okay, so the difference now is we're going to allow our b stars to depend on that b.
00:09:09.580 - 00:09:31.822, Speaker A: If we go all the way back to our very initial price of energy analyses, this is sort of like saying, well, look, this game might have multiple equilibria. All I want to do is prove every single one is good. So why can't I just for each equilibria separately pick my own favorite hypothetical deviations that prove that this particular equilibrium is good? So that's enough to prove that all equilibria are near optimal.
00:09:31.822 - 00:09:48.610, Speaker A: It's just never how we've been doing it. We've always been exhibiting these deviations without first looking at what equilibrium we're talking about. So we have sort of a uniform choice in all of our previous analyses, a uniform choice of the deviations b star, that we use those for every single equilibrium.
00:09:48.610 - 00:10:00.110, Speaker A: And we're not going to do that now. We're going to look at the equilibrium and say, oh, for this equilibrium, I'm going to deviate this way to show that this one is good. For this other equilibrium, I'm going to deviate this other way to show that this one is good.
00:10:00.110 - 00:10:08.762, Speaker A: And I'll show a generic way to do that, handles every single equilibrium and that's good enough if all we care about is to prove that all equilibrium are near optimal. This is fine. It's not a smoothness proof.
00:10:08.762 - 00:10:15.460, Speaker A: There aren't going to be any extension theorems. But the proofs won't look that different than the extension theorems either. Okay, so that's what's different.
00:10:15.460 - 00:10:21.490, Speaker A: So, an equilibrium specific deviations rather than equilibrium agnostic deviations.
00:10:24.970 - 00:10:25.800, Speaker B: All right.
00:10:31.290 - 00:10:48.250, Speaker A: So let me show you the key nugget of this analysis, which is really quite cute. So key lemma. And this is also where we really use the Sabbatic assumption.
00:10:48.250 - 00:11:03.842, Speaker A: So remember, we're talking about simultaneous first price auctions. So fix a bidder I with its Sabbatic evaluation VI. And here's the important part.
00:11:03.842 - 00:11:05.330, Speaker A: Fix a distribution.
00:11:07.590 - 00:11:08.340, Speaker B: D.
00:11:12.870 - 00:11:21.014, Speaker A: On the bids by the other players. Okay, so there's n items, sorry, there's m items, there's n players. B minus I Remember what this is.
00:11:21.014 - 00:11:23.698, Speaker A: This is n minus one different m vectors.
00:11:23.794 - 00:11:24.054, Speaker B: Okay?
00:11:24.092 - 00:11:35.606, Speaker A: So these are distributions of what other players are doing. Now in the proof, in the eventual proof, this distribution is just going to be what? Other players actions at an equilibrium. So we're going to look at some Bayes national equilibrium.
00:11:35.606 - 00:11:44.430, Speaker A: Other players will be biding in some random way, and that'll induce some distribution. That's how we're going to be a client of this. But for now, just there's some distribution on other players behavior.
00:11:44.430 - 00:12:04.574, Speaker A: Fixes set S. And so now there exists a b star I. And so notice, right, I've seen this distribution.
00:12:04.574 - 00:12:17.682, Speaker A: So again, equate this distribution d with some Bayes Nash equilibrium. I've seen the distribution first and only now am I showing you the deviations b star. Okay, so that's the sense in which this is a direct argument rather than a smoothness proof.
00:12:17.682 - 00:12:29.670, Speaker A: So then there exists a b star. This is going to be a function, both of this distribution d and the set s, that you should think of s as what we're targeting. So that's going to be like a bundle and some optimal allocation.
00:12:29.670 - 00:12:44.460, Speaker A: And then, okay, so what's going to be true? What's going to be true is that we can lower bound our expected utility with respect to this distribution. Okay, so.
