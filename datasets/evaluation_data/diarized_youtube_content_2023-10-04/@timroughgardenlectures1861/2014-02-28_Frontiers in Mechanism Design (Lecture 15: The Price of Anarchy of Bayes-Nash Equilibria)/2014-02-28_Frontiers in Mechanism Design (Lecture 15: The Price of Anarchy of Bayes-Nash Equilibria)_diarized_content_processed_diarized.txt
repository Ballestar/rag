00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.874, Speaker A: It's.
00:00:00.922 - 00:00:05.374, Speaker B: So, quick announcement. The let's see, it's a week from.
00:00:05.412 - 00:00:21.598, Speaker C: Today that the project outline is due March 5. So instructions on the web page, I think I said one to two pages with some further detailed instructions. Any questions about that, about the project? Okay, good.
00:00:21.764 - 00:00:32.278, Speaker B: So look forward to receiving those. Um, all right, so let me help you page back in where we were. So we're smack in the middle of.
00:00:32.364 - 00:00:35.222, Speaker C: Part four of the course, and the.
00:00:35.276 - 00:00:39.750, Speaker B: Attitude we have in part four is that we insist that our mechanisms be simple.
00:00:39.820 - 00:00:43.154, Speaker C: Maybe not to play, but certainly to describe and execute.
00:00:43.282 - 00:00:43.970, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:44.140 - 00:00:47.910, Speaker B: And then the question then is just, if we stick only to simple auctions.
00:00:47.990 - 00:01:01.680, Speaker C: When do they do well? Under what kinds of conditions? By do well, I mean their Equilibria for some type of equilibria and conditions, perhaps on the valuations or what generality of equilibria that we're looking at.
00:01:02.450 - 00:01:09.826, Speaker B: So, last lecture, I introduced our first simple auction format, which is basically you.
00:01:09.848 - 00:01:13.218, Speaker C: Throw up a bunch of items at the same time on ebay and you.
00:01:13.224 - 00:01:17.270, Speaker B: Try to sell them. So, simultaneous second price auctions.
00:01:19.690 - 00:01:23.986, Speaker C: So S two A is the abbreviation.
00:01:24.178 - 00:01:28.934, Speaker B: I'm going to be using. And again, I want to remind you, this is sort of very different than.
00:01:28.972 - 00:01:30.486, Speaker C: All the auctions that we saw in.
00:01:30.508 - 00:01:32.266, Speaker B: The past, in the sense that these.
00:01:32.288 - 00:01:41.706, Speaker C: Are auctions where the action space. So, in other words, what a player is able to do or able to report is way smaller than its type space or its valuation space.
00:01:41.808 - 00:01:43.466, Speaker B: So, again, we're thinking of bidders as.
00:01:43.488 - 00:01:51.662, Speaker C: Having combinatorial valuations, think like submodular valuations. They have, like, two to the M private parameters if there's M goods, but I'm only going to listen to M numbers.
00:01:51.796 - 00:01:52.766, Speaker B: All I let you do in this.
00:01:52.788 - 00:02:00.210, Speaker C: Auction is submit one bid for each of the M items. Each of them is then sold with the vicary auction to the highest bidder at the second highest price.
00:02:00.360 - 00:02:04.002, Speaker B: So bidders have to somehow figure out how to communicate the most relevant information.
00:02:04.056 - 00:02:07.654, Speaker C: For the items that they want using this very small action space.
00:02:07.852 - 00:02:09.826, Speaker B: So it's very simple mechanism to execute.
00:02:09.858 - 00:02:13.750, Speaker C: Or describe, not necessarily that easy to figure out how to bid.
00:02:15.290 - 00:02:19.514, Speaker B: So we got off to a good start with our agenda of proving near.
00:02:19.552 - 00:02:22.454, Speaker C: Optimality guarantees for welfare for simple auction formats.
00:02:22.502 - 00:02:32.698, Speaker B: Here's what we proved last time. So we made the following two assumptions. So we thought about bidders with sub modular valuations.
00:02:32.794 - 00:02:34.720, Speaker C: Actually, it was a little bit more general than that.
00:02:38.450 - 00:02:40.506, Speaker B: So, in fact, it was okay for bidders.
00:02:40.538 - 00:02:42.960, Speaker C: If you want, you can just think submodular, that's fine.
00:02:43.490 - 00:02:45.906, Speaker B: But technically, we proved them for what.
00:02:45.928 - 00:02:48.878, Speaker C: Are called XOS or fractionally subaditive valuations.
00:02:48.974 - 00:02:50.754, Speaker B: That just means the valuation is the.
00:02:50.792 - 00:03:01.186, Speaker C: Maximum of a bunch of additive valuations. We proved a lemma last week saying that every submoduular valuation indeed can be represented as the maximum of additive valuations.
00:03:01.378 - 00:03:06.150, Speaker B: So we proved this for even more general than the class of submoduular valuations. That was one assumption.
00:03:07.850 - 00:03:16.842, Speaker C: So this is certainly a restriction on valuations. But don't forget how hard we were struggling with this when we were doing things like incentive compatible mechanism design. Okay, so this is already a challenging problem.
00:03:16.842 - 00:03:25.326, Speaker C: We never had a DSIC mechanism, for example, that handled bidders with arbitrary modular valuations. So to prove guarantees with some simple auction in equilibrium, that feels like a.
00:03:25.348 - 00:03:33.218, Speaker B: Victory, then what were we looking at? So last week we only discussed pure natural equilibria. Not really, because they're well motivated, just.
00:03:33.224 - 00:03:39.982, Speaker C: Because I wanted to sort of impose layers of complexity gradually throughout the lectures.
00:03:40.126 - 00:03:47.714, Speaker B: So we thought about pure equilibria. We'll move on to other equilibrium concepts today. And also remember that with second price.
00:03:47.752 - 00:03:58.050, Speaker C: Auctions, we have to make another assumption about the equilibrium. Even in the vicary auction with just one item and two bidders, you have these bluffing equilibria. You have these problems with overbidding.
00:03:58.050 - 00:04:01.126, Speaker C: So maybe my value is zero, but I bid really high.
00:04:01.228 - 00:04:02.826, Speaker B: And if you bid really low, then.
00:04:02.848 - 00:04:09.446, Speaker C: I don't actually have to pay the price for it. So you have these low welfare equilibria, even in the vicary auction caused by overbidding.
00:04:09.558 - 00:04:10.794, Speaker B: So what we did is we only.
00:04:10.832 - 00:04:23.326, Speaker C: Proved guarantees for equilibria without overbidding. And the precise, it's not very important for today, but the precise definition we.
00:04:23.348 - 00:04:24.094, Speaker B: Used is just that.
00:04:24.132 - 00:04:35.460, Speaker C: If you looked at the bundle that the items that a bidder won, then the sum of its bids for those items was at most its value for those items. That's what we proved the factor two approximation for.
00:04:36.170 - 00:04:44.262, Speaker B: And so if these are met, then we prove that the welfare of this pure natural equilibrium is at least one.
00:04:44.316 - 00:04:56.802, Speaker C: Half times the opt welfare. I also showed you example that the one half is tight. There was an example with just two items, two bidders unit demand valuations, a pure Nash equilibrium with no overbidding.
00:04:56.802 - 00:05:03.422, Speaker C: And it was off by 50% because the bidders kind of got miscord needed on the two items. Each one got the one that they didn't really want.
00:05:03.556 - 00:05:05.660, Speaker A: Okay, so.
