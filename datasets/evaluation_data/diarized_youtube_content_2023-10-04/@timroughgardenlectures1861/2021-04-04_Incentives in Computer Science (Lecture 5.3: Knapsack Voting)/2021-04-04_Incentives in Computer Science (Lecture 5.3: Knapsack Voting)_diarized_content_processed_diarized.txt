00:00:00.570 - 00:00:24.746, Speaker A: So K approval voting, where voters just vote for K public projects they want to see funded without thinking about the project costs. That's certainly simple, it's a natural thing to try, works well with paper ballots, but we saw that may not lead to desirable outcomes. Basically, voters are not forced to reckon with the project costs and as such, they tend to overrepresent expensive projects.
00:00:24.746 - 00:00:44.666, Speaker A: So expensive projects basically get unduly boosted by K approval voting. So the question is there something else we could do? And so I want to show you about kind of a cutting edge alternative that's been deployed a little bit and hopefully will be deployed more in the years to come. Something known as read more.
00:00:44.666 - 00:00:55.520, Speaker A: I'll tell you about it now, but if you want to read more about it, then there's some nice work being done at Stanford. You can go to the Pbstanford.org URL to find out more.
00:00:55.520 - 00:01:07.598, Speaker A: So, napsack voting. To be honest, it looks a lot like what we just did with K approval voting, but with one big difference. Whereas K approval voting, the constraint was that you could only give a thumbs up to up to K projects.
00:01:07.598 - 00:01:34.566, Speaker A: And again, it didn't depend on what the project's costs were. Expensive, not expensive, whatever you were allowed up to K in knapsack voting, you can have thumbs up on any number of projects you want as long as the sum of those project costs is at most the budget. So in effect, a voter is proposing a way of spending the budget, a subset of projects to spend the budget on, subject to feasibility, subject to those projects really not being more than the budget.
00:01:34.566 - 00:01:59.150, Speaker A: And if you think about it, this now forces voters to consider project costs, right? So like in our running example, a voter is going to notice that if they vote for project One, they don't get to vote for anything else, whereas if they vote for project two, then they also get to vote for project three. In addition, because the sum of those costs, you might recall, was a half a million each. So two and three together would fit under the budget of $1 million in the example on the previous slide.
00:01:59.150 - 00:02:08.230, Speaker A: So that's the idea. So you don't have to have this hard constraint of K thumbs up. It's a constraint where the thumbs up should have the total cost at most the overall budget.
00:02:08.230 - 00:02:27.594, Speaker A: So once you have everybody's votes now, you just proceed exactly as you did before with K approval voting. So you're going to sort the projects from most popular to least popular. So the projects with the largest number of votes from people, the projects with the least number, you're just going to walk down the projects one by one, funding them until the funding runs out.
00:02:27.594 - 00:02:54.350, Speaker A: And again there's going to be some project where you're only going to be funding it partially because your budget will run out in the middle of it and we're going to assume that that makes sense. For example that you're only going to renovate half of the roads of a neighborhood rather than all of the roads of a neighborhood. So returning to the example where again we had a budget of $1 million and the project costs were a million dollars for project one and a half a million for each of two and three, let's think again about as if the first project will generate value four per voter.
00:02:54.350 - 00:03:04.054, Speaker A: The second project, three per voter. The third project, two per voter. So now with one approval voting, we were sort of thinking voters might be tempted to just vote for project number one.
00:03:04.054 - 00:03:19.146, Speaker A: They only got to vote for one and so they may as well vote for the one project that gives them the most value. But if you're doing Knapsack voting so again now they sort of realize they really have two options. They can either vote for one or they can vote for projects two and three and those are mutually exclusive and those are the two natural options.
00:03:19.146 - 00:03:51.160, Speaker A: And so if a voter realizes that and they say, hey, if I vote for projects two and three I'm going to get a value of five whereas if I voted for project one I'd only get a value of four, then you would expect that voters who realize this would vote for projects number two and three. And then as long as enough voters vote in that way, then at the end of the day indeed projects two and three are going to be the ones that get funded and that's what we want to see happen. That would be the pareto optimal outcome where the budget is spent in a way that maximizes the total value for everybody.
00:03:51.160 - 00:04:34.504, Speaker A: One thing I want to point out is that Knapsack voting, unlike K approval voting, this would be challenging to implement as a paper ballot, right? Because that would force the voters to sort of keep track themselves over whether or not sort of the sum of the project costs of the projects they selected is at most the budget or not. So if someone votes for something which goes over budget, what do you do? Do you throw out their vote? Do you sort of use the first of the projects that they picked up to the budget? What do you do? So whereas if you're voting by computer then it's sort of very clear. It can just prevent you from casting the vote if you're over budget.
00:04:34.504 - 00:05:00.430, Speaker A: It can show you how much budget is remaining and allow you to sort of experiment with toggling projects on or off experiment with different possibilities. It's just much easier to imagine Napsack voting working with a computerized voting interface compared to with paper ballots. So here again is someplace where we're know technological advances are really enabling types of voting which probably would have been too complicated to contemplate in the past.
00:05:00.430 - 00:05:15.372, Speaker A: So this example is reassuring. It gives us some intuition about why Napstack voting might be superior to the simpler K approval voting. So it's more complicated but not that bad with the computer interface.
00:05:15.372 - 00:05:38.036, Speaker A: And because it sort of really forces voters to stand in the shoes of the decision makers. It forces the voters to respect the exact same budget that the eventual decision makers are going to have to respect. They're going to be internalizing the project costs in a more basic way and that should lead to better decisions, decisions that more reflect people's preferences under the constraints.
00:05:38.036 - 00:05:54.392, Speaker A: But this is just like a three project example so you shouldn't take this that seriously. It's just kind of getting us started on a certain track. So you should ask the question can we say something more convincing about Napsack voting being a good idea? And so again this is pretty cutting edge stuff.
00:05:54.392 - 00:06:02.270, Speaker A: So researchers are still in the process of understanding the properties around Knapsack voting but I want to tell you a little bit about those properties next.
