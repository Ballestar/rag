00:00:02.010 - 00:00:10.094, Speaker A: All right, so welcome everyone, to CS 364 B. It's a class called Topics and Algorithm the game Theory. It's a class which is not taught all that often.
00:00:10.094 - 00:00:19.546, Speaker A: It's probably been about five years since I've had the opportunity to do it. So this is about advanced topics on the interface of computer science and economics. So quick poll.
00:00:19.546 - 00:00:41.340, Speaker A: So who in the room has not taken 364 A last quarter at some other time? One. Any others? Two. Okay, so what's your guys background? Do you have any experience with are you from CS or for Econ or you're from Stats? You read through all the notes over the holidays? Okay.
00:00:41.340 - 00:00:49.340, Speaker A: I hope you did other things too, over the holidays. How about you? I did CS as an undergrad. I'm working with semester higher here.
00:00:49.340 - 00:01:10.114, Speaker A: Okay, so cool. The good news, I'm basically going to give the lectures more or less assuming that you did take 364 A. I realize a lot of that stuff has been a few months ago, which is a long time, given all the classes that you've taken.
00:01:10.114 - 00:01:19.462, Speaker A: I realize there's going to be rusty stuff. I'll take that into account. The good news, if you're really rusty or if you never took it all, is there's a full archive, actually, from last quarter's class.
00:01:19.462 - 00:01:39.338, Speaker A: So there's full lectures on YouTube, and I finished all the lecture notes for all 20 of the lectures. And I'll try to remind you, hopefully most, if not all of you got the email I sent out Monday. So I'm going to try to, before every lecture, just say what you might want to spend 20 minutes reviewing before class just to make it a little easier to follow what I say in real time.
00:01:39.338 - 00:01:59.582, Speaker A: Okay, so the plan for 364 B, pretty much the whole quarter, we're going to discuss aspects of mechanism design. And this is an advanced class, so the focus is really going to be to try to be on cutting edge stuff. Okay, so lots of stuff in particular, really, just from the last five years.
00:01:59.582 - 00:02:09.734, Speaker A: I mean, the whole field of argument of the Game Theory is only about 15 years old. Most of what we covered in the fall was within the last 15 years. But today or not today, but this quarter, it'll really just even be the last five years.
00:02:09.734 - 00:02:22.006, Speaker A: So what's mechanism design? So when I introduced this, I called this the science of rulemaking. You might remember the original sort of story I gave you about Olympic bad bin. And then we proceeded to talk about lots of different applications, especially auctions.
00:02:22.006 - 00:02:39.630, Speaker A: And just to remind you, the high level goal in mechanism design is you want to design systems where you have strategic participants. So they're users of your system and they're autonomous. They can do whatever they want.
00:02:39.630 - 00:02:54.462, Speaker A: And in general, their objective is different than yours. So, for example, we're going to be talking a lot about auctions, and as an auctioneer, maybe you want an efficient allocation of resources or maybe you want high revenue. That's not what the participants want, right? They want to maximize the net utility they themselves get out of the auction.
00:02:54.462 - 00:03:10.650, Speaker A: So there's a conflict there. And despite that, despite the fact you have these participants that are autonomous with different objectives than yours, you want your systems to have good performance guarantees, perhaps high welfare, perhaps high revenue. We'll talk about a couple of different examples.
00:03:10.650 - 00:03:36.250, Speaker A: So that's the high level of mechanism design. Let me jog your memory with a specific case that we already understand well, and then we'll quickly move on to things that we don't understand so well yet. So, scenario one of the three that we'll discuss today, by the way, so the lecture format.
00:03:36.250 - 00:03:49.510, Speaker A: So I'm going to give one lecture, which is roughly ballpark 75 minutes. Then we'll have a ten to 15 minutes break, and then there'll be a second lecture, which again will be ballpark 75 minutes or so. Okay, that's the plan for today and for the rest of the weeks.
00:03:49.510 - 00:04:06.780, Speaker A: So we should wrap up by about five every time, every Wednesday. Okay, so the first of the three scenarios we'll talk about today, let's assume that there's k identical goods. So maybe someone's unloading a bunch of old black iPhone, four S's, something like that.
00:04:06.780 - 00:04:18.110, Speaker A: So not worth that much these days, probably. And you can go ahead and think about k equals one. What I'll say will be interesting even when K equals one single item auction.
00:04:18.110 - 00:04:30.770, Speaker A: And each bidder wants only one of these. And it's important you know the terminology for this. This is called unit demand.
00:04:33.830 - 00:04:34.434, Speaker B: Okay?
00:04:34.552 - 00:04:45.480, Speaker A: So a bidder has unit demand preferences if they really only want one of the goods that's available for sale. And each bidder has a private valuation. Visa Buy.
00:04:45.480 - 00:05:03.710, Speaker A: Visa Buy is the maximum that bidderI would be willing to pay for one of these items. By private, I mean, that is known to this bidder, but it is unknown both to the seller and to the rest of the bidders. The other N minus one bidders.
00:05:03.710 - 00:05:35.910, Speaker A: We want to think about the interesting case where the number of bidders N is bigger than the number of goods K. Okay, so how do you solve this problem? What do we want? So if we're interested in maximizing the social surplus, which is the objective function we're going to be discussing today and for a couple of weeks, then we use a variant of the second price auction of the Vicary Auction, which I'll call the Kvikri auction. So this is something you saw last quarter.
00:05:35.910 - 00:05:55.470, Speaker A: So the Vicary auction is what's called a direct revelation mechanism, which means the very first thing you do is you're like, look, bidder, I don't know what you want, I don't know what your private valuation is. So tell me you collect this information in the form of bids. So one per bidder.
00:05:55.470 - 00:06:10.286, Speaker A: Again, bidders are autonomous. They don't have to tell you what they want, they're just going to submit some bid bi to maximize their own objective. Then in a direct revelation mechanism, there's an allocation rule and there's a payment rule.
00:06:10.286 - 00:06:27.350, Speaker A: Remember, the fundamental decisions are who wins in your auction and what do they pay. So the allocation rule says given the bids expressed by the bidders, who wins? And so here we just pick the top K bidders. So give the goods to the K highest bidders.
00:06:27.350 - 00:06:43.338, Speaker A: What should the winners pay? Well, remember, in the single item auction, k equals one, the vicary auction. For incentive reasons, we looked at the second highest bid when there's K copies of an item. Analogously, we use the K plus one th highest bid.
00:06:43.338 - 00:06:47.530, Speaker A: So if there's ten items, we use the 11th highest bid, the highest bid of a losing bidder.
00:06:47.610 - 00:06:48.240, Speaker B: Okay?
00:06:52.850 - 00:07:14.854, Speaker A: So charge all winners the K plus one highest bid. So that's what I'm going to call the Kvikri auction. Let me remind you the basic properties of the Kvikri auction and why we like it.
00:07:14.854 - 00:07:37.550, Speaker A: In fact, in the fall we deemed this an awesome auction. So why did we call it that? Well, so it has good incentive properties, it has good performance properties and it has good tractability properties. So by incentive properties, the formal term, it's a bit of a mouthful.
00:07:37.550 - 00:08:04.770, Speaker A: So dominant strategy instead of compatible or DSIC for short. And so the main condition here is that revealing your private information, that is, setting your bid bi to your private valuation visa buy is a dominant strategy, a foolproof strategy. Remember, that means it maximizes your utility.
00:08:04.770 - 00:08:20.960, Speaker A: So the value you get for the good if you win it minus the price that you pay, it maximizes your utility no matter what the other bidders do. So it frees you from having to reason about what the other bidders want and how they behave. You don't care, you know your best response no matter what.
00:08:20.960 - 00:08:53.254, Speaker A: So truthful biding a dominant strategy, meaning it's guaranteed to maximize, among other things, the quasilinear utility. So remember, this is your value for the good if you get it. This is the notation I'm using for the allocation rule x sub I of the bid vector B.
00:08:53.254 - 00:09:10.566, Speaker A: So this is one if bidder I is a winner, that is if it's in the top K bidders zero otherwise. And then we subtract out what it has to pay, which is zero if it loses, or the K plus one ties bid if it wins. So this is something, this is a property we proved last quarter, I'm not going to prove it again now.
00:09:10.566 - 00:09:26.346, Speaker A: And then the other part, which we don't mention as much because we almost always have it, is what's called individual rationality, which is that truthful biding also guarantees non negative utility.
00:09:26.538 - 00:09:27.280, Speaker B: Okay?
00:09:28.050 - 00:09:43.590, Speaker A: And the reason you're guaranteed non negative utility with a truthful bid is that the price that you charge a winner is always at most the bid of that winner, right? So you take the people with the k highest bids and you charge them all the k plus one's highest bid. So you charge them less than their own bid. So if the bid is truthful, then this quantity is non negative.
00:09:43.590 - 00:10:07.342, Speaker A: So those are the incentive guarantees of the k Vic reactions. That's number one. So what are the performance guarantees? So if what you want is an economically efficient allocation of resources, meaning you want to maximize the surplus, then even though you didn't know what people wanted in advance, even though the seller had no knowledge of these valuations, this is something you get after the fact.
00:10:07.342 - 00:10:31.480, Speaker A: Assuming bidders bid truthfully as they are incentivized to do. So the KVIC reaction maximizes the surplus. I'll also probably sometimes call the surplus the welfare, which in this context is just the sum of the bidders of their value for the good if they get it.
00:10:31.480 - 00:10:55.866, Speaker A: And this is assuming truthful bids, of course. So because you only have k copies of the item, you can only set k of the X sub I s equal to one. And if you want to make this as big as possible, of course, what you should do is give it to the ones with the biggest vis.
00:10:55.866 - 00:11:13.310, Speaker A: If the bids the bi is equal, the v's, the vis, well, then that's exactly what the KVI auction is going to do. Okay, so that's the second thing. And then the third thing is that it's a simple tractable auction.
00:11:13.310 - 00:11:24.360, Speaker A: And I'm going to be pretty vague for the first couple of weeks about what a simple auction is. For any definition of simple you can think of, this pretty much qualifies. Certainly it's polynomial time.
00:11:24.360 - 00:11:30.860, Speaker A: So polynomial time and simple.
00:11:31.390 - 00:11:32.140, Speaker B: Okay.
00:11:37.390 - 00:12:08.866, Speaker A: So looking ahead, what we're going to talk about for at least the first half of the class, maybe even a little bit more, is to what extent can we get all three of these properties more generally for more general settings that we might want to solve. And so we're going to start with a couple of weeks about the happy special cases, although still much more general than scenario number one, where we can just get all of these things, we can get all the incentive guarantees we want, all of the performance guarantees we want, and all the tractability guarantees that we want. And there are a number of interesting cases, and theory is very nice.
00:12:08.866 - 00:12:34.910, Speaker A: Then we'll move on to cases where we'll be able to prove you cannot get all three of these, or at least not this strong, a version of all three of these types of guarantees and we'll spend some time exploring the various compromises and trade offs between them. So at a high level, that's what the first roughly half of the class is going to be about. So any questions at this point? What I've said so far, I hope is review for you.
00:12:34.910 - 00:13:26.800, Speaker A: Now, I want to move on to things which are not difficult, but which he didn't talk about explicitly, only alluded to in the fall. Okay, so what I want to talk about next and what's going to be our obsession today and next week are ascending implementations. And so rather than try to give you a formal definition, let me just show you what I mean by an ascending implementation for this particular problem, for scenario number one, then we'll take a step back with that concrete example and say, why might we care about this? And then we'll ask, what would a theory of ascending implementations look like? Those are the next few things we're going to do.
00:13:26.800 - 00:13:49.538, Speaker A: All right, so for this special case of scenario one, where you just have identical goods, again, think of cake or one if you want, and unit demand bidders, the ascending implementation is just going to be the familiar what's called the English auction. This is what you would have seen in the movies. Or I got to see an art auction at Christie's last year when I was on sabbatical in New York, and that's what they still use at those auction houses.
00:13:49.538 - 00:14:09.846, Speaker A: And so here you don't have people writing down bids and envelopes and submitting sealed envelopes, sealed bids. Rather, you have an auctioneer and there's some item being sold, and the price starts very low, and lots of people want it at this low bargain price, but then they keep raising the price, and at some point there's only one person left. At that point, this ascending auction concludes, and that's the winner.
00:14:09.846 - 00:14:29.794, Speaker A: And the price is just the number at which the second to last bidder dropped out. Let me write down that a little bit more formally. So initialize the selling price to be zero, and we're going to have an initial set of active bidders, and initially s zero.
00:14:29.794 - 00:14:52.540, Speaker A: The active bidders is just everybody. And what we want to do is we want to increase the price until supply equals demand. So supply by definition is just k copies of the good, and we want to get the price just right in the sweet spot so that there's exactly k people interested in buying the good at a particular price.
00:14:52.540 - 00:15:38.310, Speaker A: So we run in rounds as many as we need, and in each round we identify the new set of active bidders. And this will be a subset of the bidders that were active last round. So for everybody who was active last round, we just say, well, would you still be interested in purchasing one of these goods at a price which was epsilon higher? So we define the s sub t, the active bidders at time t to be the active bidders at time t minus one, who, when we now ask them explicitly, say, yes, sir, I would continue to like a good at the price p plus epsilon.
00:15:38.310 - 00:16:02.520, Speaker A: So here epsilon is just some increment that we fixed at the beginning of the auction. So it's some small percentage of the value that you're expecting to sell your good at a penny a dollar, $100, depending on the good.
00:16:03.610 - 00:16:04.166, Speaker B: Okay?
00:16:04.268 - 00:16:09.802, Speaker A: And so, again, when I say claim to want, I really mean we explicitly ask all the bidders of S sub T minus one.
00:16:09.856 - 00:16:10.074, Speaker B: Okay?
00:16:10.112 - 00:16:18.480, Speaker A: And we ask each of them a yes no question. We say, do you want at this price or not? And they give us the answers. St is the bidders who said yes, they still want it.
00:16:18.480 - 00:16:53.014, Speaker A: Now, an invariant of this auction is we're going to maintain the fact that the demand exceeds the supply, and the first time that the demand does not exceed the supply, we stop. So if this is the first such iteration, that is, if the number of bidders who now say they're interested at price P plus epsilon drops to the supplier below K at most, then we halt the auction. So we need to choose the winners and we need to choose the selling price.
00:16:53.014 - 00:17:17.726, Speaker A: So certainly everybody in S sub T wins. So we sell goods to everybody in S sub T, we sell it at price P, not at price P plus epsilon, in the spirit of a second price auction. Now, it's possible a bunch of people dropped out in the last round, even when K equal one.
00:17:17.726 - 00:17:24.354, Speaker A: It's possible that you had two active bidders. You asked them both if they were interested in P plus epsilon, and they both said no, and they both dropped out.
00:17:24.472 - 00:17:24.994, Speaker B: Okay?
00:17:25.112 - 00:18:06.606, Speaker A: So in that case, we're just going to give the residual goods. So the K minus cardinality of S of T goods to people who dropped out last, who were there still their last round in St minus one arbitrarily, either at random or according to some operatori fixed rule, it's not going to matter. Okay, so and leftover goods of which there are K minus the number of active bidders at the end to arbitrary subset of the bidders who just dropped out thank you.
00:18:06.606 - 00:18:07.342, Speaker A: At the same price.
00:18:07.396 - 00:18:11.726, Speaker B: P okay.
00:18:11.908 - 00:18:21.646, Speaker A: And last iteration, when we asked them if they would be happy to have it at price P, they said yes. That's why they made it into St minus one. They were not willing to accept it at price P plus epsilon.
00:18:21.646 - 00:18:26.102, Speaker A: That's why they're not in S of T, but they did say they were happy to have it at price P, and that's what we give it to them at.
00:18:26.156 - 00:18:28.678, Speaker B: Thank you. Okay.
00:18:28.764 - 00:18:36.860, Speaker A: And then if that's not the case, if the demand is still too high, then of course we increase the price and start over.
00:18:38.350 - 00:18:39.100, Speaker B: Okay?
00:18:42.510 - 00:18:59.358, Speaker A: So there's many, many sort of variants of this ascending auction. And when you're doing this very simple scenario, one, the variants don't differ that much. So, for example, one thing that I defined is that if you ever drop out of this auction, I never allow you back.
00:18:59.358 - 00:19:06.260, Speaker A: Right. So that's because I define S sub T to be a subset of St minus one. So if you ever say no, you can't say yes later.
00:19:06.260 - 00:19:18.200, Speaker A: The auctions at, for example, Christie's, are not like that. You can leave the room, walk around the block, come back, and if the auction is still going, you can reenter, no problem. But again, for this simple scenario, these variations don't make a big deal.
00:19:18.200 - 00:19:29.180, Speaker A: For other more complex settings that we'll study later, they can matter. Okay, so this is what I mean by an ascending implementation. Here's an example.
00:19:29.180 - 00:19:42.906, Speaker A: Now, let me give you some motivation. I took a problem, simple but real problem, selling off K goods when you have more than N people. Understood.
00:19:42.906 - 00:19:51.758, Speaker A: I gave you what seemed like a perfect solution, the KVIC reaction. People write down these bids, top K bidders, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. We get all these great properties.
00:19:51.758 - 00:20:11.426, Speaker A: Now, for some reason, I'm giving you another solution to the same problem. Why am I doing that? Given that we have the KVIC re auction, why should we bother thinking about an ascending implementation? What possible benefit might there be? There are considerations we don't have in the model. So, for example, bidders might have privacy concerns.
00:20:11.426 - 00:20:12.406, Speaker A: They don't want you to know their.
00:20:12.428 - 00:20:15.066, Speaker C: True valuation or how much surplus they're getting.
00:20:15.248 - 00:20:20.106, Speaker A: And they reveal less information in the ascending implementation. Good that's definitely one reason.
00:20:20.208 - 00:20:20.860, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:22.990 - 00:20:24.378, Speaker A: Do we want to look at a.
00:20:24.384 - 00:20:28.620, Speaker C: More general kind of problem rather than identical goods? Because.
00:20:34.600 - 00:20:35.830, Speaker A: Also a good point.
00:20:36.920 - 00:20:37.392, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:37.466 - 00:20:45.976, Speaker C: It's also no worse. The same thing, essentially, which I guess will show. But if we're any worse, then those considerations may not be valid.
00:20:46.168 - 00:20:47.150, Speaker A: Good point.
00:20:48.880 - 00:21:02.530, Speaker C: Might be easier to get the bids in as opposed to having to get in all these pieces of paper or hear all the different bids. Here. It's just like you just wait until there's just one person left.
00:21:02.530 - 00:21:06.540, Speaker C: So if there was a ton of bidders I'm just thinking of, like, the Combinatorial.
00:21:06.620 - 00:21:09.488, Speaker A: Simpler logistics. Oh, you're saying the communication.
00:21:09.664 - 00:21:10.004, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:10.042 - 00:21:16.820, Speaker C: Like I remember you said in the Combinatorial, just getting the bids itself, since there were so many different packages, was problematic.
00:21:20.540 - 00:21:23.450, Speaker A: More dramatic. Good I agree.
00:21:25.020 - 00:21:34.536, Speaker C: Even though we're assuming people are very irrational, it might be worth considering things like someone coming back after walking around the block and just getting more money for you out of the auction. They join again.
00:21:34.638 - 00:21:36.980, Speaker B: Good the greatest can't be sure the.
00:21:36.990 - 00:21:45.420, Speaker C: Exact valuation which they have, so it might vary a little bit. So this page, they might still pay the auction, even if it's costing the valuation.
00:21:45.920 - 00:21:53.650, Speaker A: Good it's older, so people thought of it first. That's true. They've been doing these a lot longer.
00:21:53.650 - 00:21:58.630, Speaker A: They've had ample time to switch. But you're right, inertia could be part of it. That's true.
00:21:59.400 - 00:21:59.908, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:59.994 - 00:22:04.260, Speaker C: It's a more transparent process. Like, you don't have to trust anyone to collect all the bids.
00:22:05.080 - 00:22:05.830, Speaker A: Great.
00:22:07.320 - 00:22:11.672, Speaker C: It allows people to update their valuation if that sort of depends on what other people are doing.
00:22:11.726 - 00:22:13.064, Speaker B: Good point. Good point.
00:22:13.262 - 00:22:25.470, Speaker A: All right, great. Those all sound like excellent reasons. Let me maybe summarize a few of them or sort of group summarize a few of them.
00:22:25.470 - 00:22:36.876, Speaker A: We also break the problem into two parts. The first would be if really all you cared about was scenario one. Is there any reason to do this? And then some of the comments were more of the form.
00:22:36.876 - 00:22:44.332, Speaker A: Some comments were the form, yes. And some comments over the form. Looking forward, we can really imagine why ascending implementations might be especially useful.
00:22:44.332 - 00:23:09.508, Speaker A: I think both sets of comments are good ones. So let's just start with what about just with scenario one itself? So one reason was easier for bidders. Um, and so notice that this auction is not a direct revelation mechanism.
00:23:09.508 - 00:23:17.896, Speaker A: A direct revelation mechanism. By definition, what you do is you ask people for their private information. At no point does this auction ask you what is your valuation.
00:23:17.896 - 00:23:33.730, Speaker A: It asks you only a sequence of yes no questions. Do you want a good at a certain price or not? Now, of course, this reveals people's valuations if you look at when they drop out, but at no point does a bidder actually have to do that cognitive task. So some of the comments were of that type.
00:23:33.730 - 00:24:03.304, Speaker A: Other comments were of the form, sort of had to do with trust privacy issues. So let's just say better on trust privacy axes. So what do we mean by privacy? I'm not going to define it formally, but at the very least, you realize that if you win in an English auction, in the ascending implementation, nobody, including the auctioneer, learns what your valuation was.
00:24:03.304 - 00:24:18.524, Speaker A: They learn a lower bound on it in the form of the second highest bid. But that's all okay in a sealed bid auction, possibly none of the other bidders learn the valuation of the highest bidder, but the very least the auctioneer does. And then the other thing mentioned was transparency.
00:24:18.524 - 00:24:36.580, Speaker A: So somehow if you see these prices going up and you see the biding process and you wind up winning the good at a high price, it's sort of much more transparent to you why that happened. Perhaps good. And then another one, potentially more revenue.
00:24:36.580 - 00:25:19.620, Speaker A: So the comment about being more dramatic, I kind of put in this category, if you think about bidding wars, but for in many different contexts, arguably you could imagine that that might get you more revenue in an incending implementation, and it wouldn't happen in a sealed bid format. So there's empirical work on this, and there's actually some supporting theory about why this would be true as well, although I doubt I'll have time to talk about it this quarter. And then let's say price discovery, et cetera, with nonidentical goods.
00:25:19.620 - 00:25:45.516, Speaker A: So this is something we had a long discussion about in the context of commercial auctions for spectrum licenses last quarter, which is if you have, say, a lot of licenses up for sale, different geographic regions, different frequencies, you have your guess going to the auction about what your competitors want, but it's based on imperfect information. And so it's very common. You'll find out you thought there'd be a bargain to be had here and it turns out to be highly competitive and vice versa somewhere else.
00:25:45.516 - 00:26:10.160, Speaker A: So with ascending auctions, there's this opportunity for mid course corrections. There's an opportunity for the different bidders to sort of coordinate and realize some people to get out of each other's way if it turns out they're competing for something when something else would be just as good. Let's just say price discovery and flexibility, et cetera, once you pass two nonidentical goods and then someone else mentioned it's no worse, which was an interesting comment.
00:26:10.160 - 00:26:25.560, Speaker A: In fact, the next thing we're going to do is formalize the sense in which this may or may not be no worse than the direct revelation auction. That's an interesting thing to think a little bit about. Okay, so that think summarizes the spirit of all of the excellent comments.
00:26:26.220 - 00:26:26.776, Speaker B: Cool.
00:26:26.878 - 00:26:52.812, Speaker A: I think I just got more participation in the first 30 minutes of this class than in the entire quarter last quarter, which is awesome, don't get me wrong. Good. So certainly all of these reasons and the fact that these are deployed widely in practice suggests that it would be really it's very well motivated to try to develop a theory of good ascending auctions, ascending implementations.
00:26:52.812 - 00:26:59.350, Speaker A: And that's going to be the goal of this week and of next week. That's pretty much the first major topic of the class.
00:27:01.800 - 00:27:02.550, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:05.320 - 00:27:12.120, Speaker A: Questions? Can everyone see this board?
00:27:12.190 - 00:27:12.810, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:17.020 - 00:27:41.680, Speaker A: All right, so what I want to do next, I want to stay just in the simple scenario number one for a little bit and I want to make precise the assertion that the English auction is no worse than the Kvikri auction for scenario one. So what does that really mean? So let's start. The most interesting thing to think about is the incentive guarantee.
00:27:41.680 - 00:28:02.316, Speaker A: So what's the incentive guarantee for the KVIC reaction or for a direct revelation mechanism? Dominant strategy, incentive compatible truthful biding is what people do. That's essentially what this says. So let's think about what the analog of truthful biding is in the English auction because again, this is not direct revelation.
00:28:02.316 - 00:28:08.084, Speaker A: We never actually ask people for a bid per se. We don't ask people for the private information. So it's intuitive.
00:28:08.084 - 00:28:22.104, Speaker A: But let me just give it a formal definition. So I'm going to call it sincere bidding. It's basically the same as truthful, but I'm going to try to reserve truthful for direct revelation mechanisms and use sincere for these Iterative mechanisms.
00:28:22.104 - 00:28:56.810, Speaker A: So sincere bidding just means that all queries by auctioneer are answered honestly. And so this will make sense in kind of all of the auctions that we study, but in particular in the current auction, this just means that when you're asked, do you want a good at a price of P plus epsilon, you answer yes, if and only if your valuation is at least P plus epsilon. That's what sincere bidding means over here.
00:28:56.810 - 00:29:01.870, Speaker A: All right, so.
00:29:06.320 - 00:29:06.908, Speaker B: I'm going to leave.
00:29:06.914 - 00:29:34.100, Speaker A: This as an exercise because the proof is pretty much the same as the proof of truthfulness of the Vicary Auction. By the way, I'll talk about exercise sets at the end of this first lecture, but there is an exercise set posted more on that later. So in this English Auction, sincere bidding is a dominant strategy, well, almost up to epsilon.
00:29:34.100 - 00:29:59.560, Speaker A: So the formal statements on the exercise set, but it's what you'd think it would be. No matter what the other N minus one players do, you cannot improve over sincere bidding with any strategy at all, any action at all, by more than an epsilon. The epsilon comes in because there is a discretization error in this auction.
00:29:59.560 - 00:30:18.384, Speaker A: So you might be able to get lucky and lie and stick in the auction one extra iteration. You don't actually want it at P plus epsilon, but you say you'll take it if the auction happens to halt, you'll actually get the good at a price of P. So if your valuation is between P and P plus epsilon, you might want to stay in one extra round.
00:30:18.384 - 00:30:29.024, Speaker A: But the claim is that's all you can do. All you can do is gain that epsilon. So the idea of the proof is the same as in the Vicary Auction.
00:30:29.024 - 00:30:38.116, Speaker A: So how can you deviate in this English auction? What else could you do other than since you're bidding? Well, you're asked these yes no questions and you could answer yes when it's no, or vice versa.
00:30:38.228 - 00:30:38.504, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:38.542 - 00:30:54.460, Speaker A: So if you answer no when the right answer is yes, that's dropping out early. That's like underbidding in a Vicary auction doesn't help. Or you can answer yes when it's no, which means you stick in longer, which is basically like up to epsilon, like overbidding in a Vicary Auction, which we also know can't help you.
00:30:54.530 - 00:30:54.764, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:54.802 - 00:31:06.610, Speaker A: So that's the idea of the proof as we'll see this sounds trivial, I'm sure. Right now we'll appreciate this dominant strategy property, the English auction, quite a bit more very soon, actually.
00:31:08.100 - 00:31:08.850, Speaker B: Okay.
00:31:09.300 - 00:31:44.860, Speaker A: And so in particular, as epsilon goes to zero. So if you imagine some kind of continuous ascending process in the English auction, then this really becomes a dominant strategy as the epsilon goes to zero. All right? And the one thing I do want to point out, which again, you'll appreciate more and more as we go through this lecture, a difference between direct mechanisms and indirect mechanisms is that the action space for a bidder in an indirect mechanism is generally much, much richer than in a direct revelation mechanism.
00:31:44.860 - 00:31:57.460, Speaker A: So in a. Direct revelation mechanism. Your action set, the stuff you can do, all you can do is report a bid once you have one chance to interact with this auction, and it's right up front, iterative auctions.
00:31:57.460 - 00:32:22.512, Speaker A: You can in particular examine the history of what's happened in the auction so far. So I can look at what happened in the first ten iterations and if I want to, as a function of what's happened, make my decision in iteration number eleven. Now, it's still the case that even though you have a richer action set, it's still the case in the English auction that sincere biding is a dominant strategy, but that's why it's not a totally nontrivial statement.
00:32:22.512 - 00:32:50.464, Speaker A: So again, we'll develop this as we go along. But just note, warning, action set in indirect auctions, much richer than indirect, let me just say, than direct to avoid parsing problems. And the main reason is you can have history dependence, okay? So I want to plant that seed.
00:32:50.512 - 00:32:57.030, Speaker B: Right now, all right?
00:32:58.200 - 00:33:13.550, Speaker A: And as we'll see, this does matter very soon, all right? So what we're doing is we're trying to say that the English auction is just as good as the Kvicry auction. And we've said that for the incentive guarantee, okay, honest behavior is dominant strategy either way, so that's great. Just as good.
00:33:13.550 - 00:33:28.220, Speaker A: It's also true that the performance guarantee is just as good up to the discretization error. So again, this is straightforward, so I'll leave it as an exercise. So over here for the vicary auction, we say assuming truthful biding, you get maximum surplus.
00:33:28.220 - 00:34:03.700, Speaker A: So over here we say assuming sincere bidding, we get maximum surplus as epsilon goes to zero. So formally assuming sincere bidding, english auction maximizes surplus up to K times epsilon error. So again, because of discretization, you might wind up giving goods with value that have epsilon less than other bidders that should have gotten it instead.
00:34:03.700 - 00:34:21.520, Speaker A: That can only help you by hurt you by epsilon times the number of goods K. As far as simplicity, it's also clear it's a simple auction and it's clear it'll terminate because the price goes up by epsilon every time. Once that hits the maximum valuation, obviously nobody else is under sincere bidding, no one's going to stick around in the auction.
00:34:21.520 - 00:34:46.970, Speaker A: So someone made the astute comment that the English auction is just as good as the Vikri auction, and this is the formal sense in which that's true. All right, so that's what I wanted to say about scenario one, and now I want to slowly ramp up the complexity of the scenarios and see how our goals are going to change. So any questions before we move on to scenario two?
00:34:50.770 - 00:34:51.520, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:58.390 - 00:35:20.570, Speaker A: So scenario two will be incomparable scenario one, it'll also be very simple. So we definitely want to, as people have alluded to, we definitely want to start thinking about nonidentical items. So identical items are also interesting.
00:35:20.570 - 00:35:40.250, Speaker A: So all of our sponsored search discussion last quarter, for example, involved identical items, but nonidentical items have lots of motivations. The original motivation for Commodore auctions was auctioning off takeoff and landing slots at airports. And so obviously those are goods that vary depending on the airport, depending on the time of day, and depending on whether it's takeoff or landing.
00:35:40.250 - 00:35:56.686, Speaker A: We had an entire lecture last quarter about spectrum auctions where the different licenses are, while sometimes similar, are not identical goods. They vary in geography, they vary in the frequency band and so on. Another thing about commercial auctions is sometimes people need to buy distribution route.
00:35:56.686 - 00:36:09.882, Speaker A: So you have some product and you want to distribute it all over the country. And so you need to contract with trucking companies and boat companies and so on. Travel agents need to put together airfare and hotels and tours and so on.
00:36:09.882 - 00:36:14.890, Speaker A: So all of these are reasons why there's been a lot of theory thinking about nonidentical items.
00:36:15.630 - 00:36:16.330, Speaker B: Okay?
00:36:16.480 - 00:36:31.790, Speaker A: So this is going to be a set U of M items, generally distinct. So that's obviously more complicated than scenario number one. But here's going to be something very simple about scenario number two.
00:36:31.790 - 00:37:08.070, Speaker A: So in our first baby step with nonidentical items, we're going to look at what are called additive valuations. Okay? And what that means is that each bidder I has a private value, willingness to pay for each good J. So if I just give you J, your value is vij.
00:37:08.070 - 00:37:28.850, Speaker A: If I give you a bunch of items, your value for the bundle is just the sum of these Vijs for the goods J in the bundle. So the value of a subset of goods is just defined as the sum over the goods and the subset of the constituent values for those goods.
00:37:29.190 - 00:37:29.940, Speaker B: Okay?
00:37:35.030 - 00:37:51.622, Speaker A: So in contrast to the unit demand case where bidders only wanted one good, here bidders are happy to have all of the goods. Even you keep getting more and more value the more goods that you get. So with nonidentical goods, this is often an overly simplistic model.
00:37:51.622 - 00:37:59.094, Speaker A: This assumes that there's no substitutes. This assumes that basically your value for getting a good is independent of what else you get. So this is false.
00:37:59.094 - 00:38:11.002, Speaker A: If there are substitutes, if there are goods that are redundant, that would mean having one reduces your value for having another. It assumes there's no synergies, no complements. The case where one good all of a sudden makes another good much more valuable.
00:38:11.002 - 00:38:26.738, Speaker A: So again, substitutes would be like two interchangeable licenses, same location, different frequencies, and you don't care which one, and you only want one of them. That would be substitutes. Complements would be if you're trying to piece together regional plans into something that covers a wide range, then really you want a whole set of nearby licenses.
00:38:26.738 - 00:38:42.010, Speaker A: So having some of them make the others more valuable, that's what we're excluding with added evaluations. So it's occasionally relevant. But more right now, my main motivation here is pedagogical to increase the complexity gradually.
00:38:42.010 - 00:39:14.370, Speaker A: Okay, so let's ask about the usual direct revelation DSIQ implementations, and then let's ask about ascending implementations, just like we did for scenario number one. So the Dsik direct revelation solution is quite clear. Does anyone want to suggest what it is? So suppose you wanted these three properties for scenario number two.
00:39:14.370 - 00:39:16.260, Speaker A: All of you actually know how to do that.
00:39:16.970 - 00:39:19.538, Speaker C: It seems like you just do M single item auction.
00:39:19.634 - 00:39:35.254, Speaker A: Right? So additive valuations means I do not care. It means the outcome of other auctions have no influence about my preferences on a particular item. So my value for getting this good J is independent of what happens in the other goods.
00:39:35.254 - 00:39:42.006, Speaker A: My values are additive. The prices paid are additive. So the whole mechanism design problem just separates the items decouple.
00:39:42.006 - 00:39:48.110, Speaker A: So really, you can just solve each single item auction separately. And we know how to do that. We do that with the vicary auction.
00:39:48.110 - 00:39:49.866, Speaker A: Is there a question or a comment?
00:39:49.898 - 00:39:51.920, Speaker C: Yeah, we don't have budgets. Right?
00:39:52.790 - 00:39:57.780, Speaker A: That's right. So no budgets. No budgets at the moment.
00:39:58.470 - 00:40:01.058, Speaker B: Right. Okay.
00:40:01.224 - 00:40:19.270, Speaker A: So the DSIC direct revelation solution is very simple. Just run M simultaneous Vic reactions.
00:40:25.150 - 00:40:25.466, Speaker B: And.
00:40:25.488 - 00:40:49.730, Speaker A: We get properties one, DSIC, two, assuming truthful bid surplus maximization, and three, it's an polynomial time auction. And it's simple by kind of any definition you might think about. Any questions about that? I'm not giving a formal proof, but it's just the values separate, the prices separate, so the problems just completely separate.
00:40:50.070 - 00:40:52.260, Speaker C: Why does simultaneous matter here?
00:40:54.070 - 00:40:55.560, Speaker A: What else do you have in mind?
00:40:56.330 - 00:40:57.990, Speaker C: You run these sequentially.
00:40:58.890 - 00:41:01.270, Speaker A: Yes. You could run them sequentially.
00:41:03.210 - 00:41:03.960, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:07.390 - 00:41:23.140, Speaker A: Good point. So maybe I should just say run M separate M unrelated Vic reactions. Other questions.
00:41:24.710 - 00:41:28.930, Speaker C: Doing them simultaneously would have advantages. People could learn to collude.
00:41:29.830 - 00:41:42.758, Speaker A: Right? So collusion is a can of worms, which I'm not going to address too much in the class. So that's a good point there's. Again, outside the model reasons, you might prefer either simultaneous or sequential.
00:41:42.758 - 00:41:52.320, Speaker A: You could tell stories about why sequential might be better too, if you had uncertainty about people's valuations and so forth. But again, that's kind of not the model. The model is just this.
00:41:52.320 - 00:42:02.500, Speaker A: I mean, even with collusion, it's a little hard to see how you'd make a clear case that one dominates the other, I think, but yeah.
00:42:03.030 - 00:42:03.730, Speaker B: Okay.
00:42:03.880 - 00:42:05.380, Speaker A: Other comments? Questions?
00:42:08.070 - 00:42:08.820, Speaker B: Okay.
00:42:10.950 - 00:42:23.830, Speaker A: All right. So what about ascending implementation? What's sort of the obvious thing to do here's?
00:42:27.870 - 00:42:30.042, Speaker B: Run m separate ascending options.
00:42:30.176 - 00:42:47.310, Speaker A: I agree. Completely agree. So here I want to make them simultaneous, even though, just for an example I'm about to do, I want to think of them as simultaneous for concreteness.
00:42:47.310 - 00:43:03.220, Speaker A: And so what does that actually mean? So we're going to go ahead and just start all the prices? It zero.
