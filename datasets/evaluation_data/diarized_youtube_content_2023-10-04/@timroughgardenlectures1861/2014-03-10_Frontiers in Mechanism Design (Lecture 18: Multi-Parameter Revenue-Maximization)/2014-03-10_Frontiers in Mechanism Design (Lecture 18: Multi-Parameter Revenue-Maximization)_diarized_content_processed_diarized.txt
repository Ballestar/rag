00:00:00.570 - 00:01:01.534, Speaker A: All right, so let's move on to the fifth and final part of the course, which is going to have a fairly different flavor than the first four. But one thing in common with the last several parts is that there's been very exciting progress just in the last couple of years. So again, really emphasis on sort of recent breakthroughs and so can change is I'm going to switch from welfare maximization to revenue maximization, okay? So sum over the payments rather than the sum over the values. So literally, for 17 straight lectures, we've been talking just about welfare maximization. So we have three lectures where we talk about revenue maximization instead. So if you like, you can think about this. We're switching from the perspective of something like a government trying to allocate resources like spectrum licenses in efficient way to more of a monopolist who just wants to make a lot of money.
00:01:01.534 - 00:01:47.946, Speaker A: Or if you want to think about it, can be switching from a competitive market where you can't really get away with monopoly pricing to a less competitive market where you can. And I want to open the lecture just by reminding you of some stuff from last quarter about the challenges of revenue maximization that don't come up when you're doing welfare maximization. So one reason we talk a lot about welfare is just because it's a fundamental objective, it's well motivated in many settings. Many real world commentatorial auction designs are really motivated by welfare concerns. But the second reason is that it's pedagogical. So welfare is just sort of much easier to study. So if you don't care about computation, you have the VCG mechanism which says you get incentives for free for welfare maximization.
00:01:47.946 - 00:02:40.394, Speaker A: There's a mechanism which maximizes welfare, even X post as well as if you knew the valuations up front. So there's literally like zero loss from not knowing valuations upfront if you want to do welfare maximization, if you don't care about computational issues, and the story is very different with revenue, it's actually much more sort of exasperating to study because there's no analog of the VCG mechanism at all. So which mechanism makes the most revenue? Just depends on the input and general. Mechanism A will be better on some inputs than mechanism B. Even if there's just sort of one buyer and you're just trying to figure out what take it or leave an offer to make them, or how to set a reserve price on ebay. Should I set it to $10 or $20? Well, it depends. So basically you're hoping there's going to be valuations just a tiny bit above your reserve price, but if it's just a tiny bit below your reserve price, you're out of luck.
00:02:40.394 - 00:03:13.290, Speaker A: Okay, it was a bad reserve price. So as a result, let me remind you that even just to start reasoning and talking about optimal revenue maximizing mechanisms, the most common way to even start the discussion is to assume a prior and then when you have a prior, you can compare the performance of two different mechanisms just through their expected revenue.
00:03:14.030 - 00:03:14.780, Speaker B: Okay?
00:03:20.990 - 00:03:51.810, Speaker A: And this was the reason that we did talk about prior distributions last quarter in 364 A. Now we're sort of used to them because we've been talking about Bayes Nash Equilibria and simple auctions. We talked a little bit about Bayesian incentive compatible mechanisms. So we've talked a lot about Bayes Nash Equilibria last quarter. We never talked about Bayes Nash equilibria basically not once. But we did have a prior for a couple lectures. And the reason was just because even though we were still just doing dominance strategy incentive compatible mechanism design, we just did it to compare the expected revenue of different auctions.
00:03:51.810 - 00:04:28.290, Speaker A: So when we did Myerson's theory, when we did the Buickle Klemper theorem, this is why we had a prior. Now for these few lectures, we are going to be studying not just DSig mechanisms, we'll be studying Bayesian and Cynic battle mechanisms. So we'll use the prior in two senses, one to measure performance, but also two to reason about how bidders behave. So last quarter it actually wasn't important that bidders even knew the prior. They had dominant strategies here for Bayesnat Equilibria, it is of course going to be important that everybody knows the prior. So people do know that they're doing a best response on average over the actions of the other players.
00:04:29.510 - 00:04:30.260, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:32.470 - 00:05:11.230, Speaker A: So really simple example. So we talked about one buyer. So again, I want to say a couple quick refresher on the single parameter setting, really very brief, just like five minutes. So when you just have one buyer, so if you have one buyer, I should say also dominance strategy incentive compatibility and Bayesian incentive compatibility coincide with one buyer. There's no one else to average over. So it's the best to do direct revelation. And for one buyer, there's not much you can do as a mechanism designer.
00:05:11.230 - 00:05:25.560, Speaker A: You can make a take it or leave it offer if you want. You can randomize, you could have a distribution over take it or leave it over. Take it or Leave it offers distributions over. So also called posted prices is.
00:05:28.170 - 00:05:28.534, Speaker B: And.
00:05:28.572 - 00:05:53.982, Speaker A: Given a prior distribution capital F on the buyer's valuation, just assume there's sort of one good single parameter, then of course it's kind of obvious what you should do. You just say, well, if I set a price of capital R, I'll make R dollars whenever there's a sale. And then the probability of a sale is just the probability that the bidder's valuation is at least the offer that I make it. So one minus the prior capital F at the price that I offer and I just want to pick the best.
00:05:54.036 - 00:05:54.640, Speaker B: One.
00:06:01.730 - 00:07:37.114, Speaker A: And that's it. So there's nothing hard for one buyer and one good. And let me just remind you the punchline of Myerson's optimal auction theory. So if you have multiple buyers and let's say one good for now. So the optimal single item auction, when you have valuations VI drawn from known prior distributions, fi and these should be independent, not necessarily identical, then the optimal thing to do is you give the item to the bidder with the highest what? Who remembers from last quarter? Anybody? Excellent gives item if I was feeling mean, I would say, what's the formula for that again? But yes, there will be a z gives item to the bidder with the highest virtual value, which is z minus one minus the CDF at z over the density at z. So for example, if it's the uniform distribution, then this is just two z minus one. So it would be minus one at zero and one at one for the uniform distribution.
00:07:37.114 - 00:08:05.960, Speaker A: So remember, virtual values can be negative. They can be negative or positive. Anyways, there's some formula for it, actually, a couple of caveats. Let me just tell you the fine print. So what I just said assumes that the phi eyes are increasing. That's the only case we dealt with last quarter and encompasses many of the distributions you'd ever care about. So Myerson called this the regular case.
00:08:05.960 - 00:08:41.902, Speaker A: The theory extends equally well beyond regular distributions. There's just extra technical details that we're not going to focus on. We didn't focus on last quarter, and we're not going to this quarter either. So it assumes that. And then there's also the possibility, given that one virtual value could be negative, like this two z minus one function, it might be that all of the bidders have negative virtual values and in that case, you don't award it at all. And remember, this is a fundamental difference between welfare maximization and revenue maximization. Revenue maximization it can definitely pay off to just leave stuff on the table.
00:08:42.046 - 00:08:42.740, Speaker B: Okay?
00:08:46.650 - 00:09:33.294, Speaker A: So if all VIVIS negative, no sale, okay? And in the case of where all of the valuations are IID, so what I just said here is true as long as the distributions are independent, but they can be arbitrarily different distributions. If they happen to be identical distributions, then this becomes very simple. Then if everybody has the same distribution, everybody has the same virtual valuation function. So if that distribution is regular, meaning fee is strictly increasing, then the bidder with the highest virtual value is exactly the same as the bidder with the highest value or the highest bid.
00:09:33.422 - 00:09:34.050, Speaker B: Okay?
00:09:34.200 - 00:09:53.690, Speaker A: So if all the fees are the same and we're in the regular case, then what this is telling you to do is to award it to the highest bidder. Well, except in the case where they're all negative virtual values, in which case you award it to nobody. So that just corresponds to awarding it to the highest bidder and supplementing it with a reserve price, where the reserve price corresponds to the inverse virtual value of zero.
00:09:53.840 - 00:09:54.634, Speaker B: Okay?
00:09:54.832 - 00:11:07.074, Speaker A: So summarizing for the ID regular case, the optimal auction is nothing more than a second price auction with a reserve or if you like, an ebay auction with a suitable opening bid. So that's some nice stuff you get in the single parameter case and in general, so that was specializing this, but now sort of actually generalizing this. And this was the version that we proved last quarter. So in general, even if it's not a single item auction, even if you have some more complicated set of feasibility constraints, what Meiersen's theorem tells you is that maximizing expected revenue boils down I e is exactly the same problem as maximizing the expected virtual welfare. So that's how you solve it very generally in single parameter settings. So maximizing expected revenue reduces to maximizing expected virtual welfare, meaning the sum of the fi of vis over the bidders that win.
00:11:07.272 - 00:11:12.898, Speaker B: Okay? All right.
00:11:12.904 - 00:12:05.330, Speaker A: So any questions? I hope this sort of jogs stuff that is vaguely you vaguely remember. So we're actually not going to really need to know the details of any of this. This is more just to set the context, the plan for this lecture. So, like I said, there's been some very recent progress, but the plan for this lecture is more just to kind of do the setup and understand the issues better. Okay, so no worries if you don't understand the exact details of what we talked about last quarter. So why is this interesting, the fact that maximizing expected revenue reduces to maximizing virtual welfare? Well, the first reason it's interesting is just conceptual, there's a zillion mechanisms you could run and this gives us some kind of understanding about which one is optimal. So this is a reasonably crisp characterization of what optimal auctions look like, and we get some immediate interesting corollaries that are kind of unexpected from this statement.
00:12:05.330 - 00:12:39.098, Speaker A: So in Myerson's theorem, the feasible region is actually super rich. So say it's even just a single item auction for concreteness, bidders have these different distributions. Maybe there's lots of bidders, you can do whatever you want. So you've got to be incentive compatible, but actually not even DSIC. All I insist is that you're bayesian incentive compatible and you can be randomized if you want. Okay, well, Myerson's theorem tells you well, what you should do is maximize expected virtual welfare.
00:12:39.274 - 00:12:40.000, Speaker B: Okay?
00:12:40.610 - 00:13:00.086, Speaker A: And that's dominant strategy incentive compatible. This is, again, assuming all of this is I'm going to assume regularity. So it's dominant strategy incentive compatible because the allocation rule is monotone. You proved this on an exercise set last quarter. Welfare maximization gives you monotone allocation rule. So it gives you a DSIC mechanism and it's also deterministic. The values show up.
00:13:00.086 - 00:13:27.210, Speaker A: You just compute the vis and you just pick the best one. No randomization needed. So I allow you to be BIC instead of DSIC. I allow you to be randomized instead of deterministic you're like, yeah, no need. Optimal mechanism is neither. So the optimal BIC mechanism, it is DSIC. And assuming regularity deterministic.
