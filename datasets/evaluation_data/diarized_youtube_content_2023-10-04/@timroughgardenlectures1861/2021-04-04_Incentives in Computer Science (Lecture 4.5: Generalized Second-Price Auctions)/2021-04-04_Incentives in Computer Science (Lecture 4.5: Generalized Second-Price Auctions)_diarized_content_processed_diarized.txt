00:00:00.650 - 00:00:14.062, Speaker A: We're now looking at this more general setting of sponsored search auctions, more general than single item auctions. We no longer have just one item for sale. We have some number K items for sale, the slots available for sponsored links on a search results page.
00:00:14.062 - 00:00:39.106, Speaker A: And so the question we're now asking is, well, can we generalize the vickery auction and its nice properties, specifically its truthfulness property? Can we generalize that to the sponsored search problem? And then separately, I also to just tell you how these things actually work in practice, like a vicary auction, we're going to be looking for a sealed bid implementation. These are all auctions that are happening super quickly in real time. There's not going to be some auctioneer and some ascending auction.
00:00:39.106 - 00:00:52.522, Speaker A: You really want a one shot sealed bid auction where advertisers submit their bid through some interface to the search engine and then you can instantaneously run an auction whenever you want. So the step one of a sealed bid auction is just you collect the bids. So nothing to see here.
00:00:52.522 - 00:01:15.150, Speaker A: Same thing as in the Vikri auction. The question then is what do you do with the bids? And you have to really make two different decisions when you're designing an auction. So first of all, who gets what, who are the winners? And secondly, who pays what? What do those winners pay for the items that they receive? Let's talk first about just deciding who wins who gets what as a result of the auction.
00:01:15.150 - 00:01:24.786, Speaker A: So back in single item auctions, all of the auction formats we looked at, they awarded the one item for sale to the highest bidder. That was true for the second price auction. It was true for the first price auction.
00:01:24.786 - 00:02:01.602, Speaker A: So the question is, what is the analog here now that we have k items for sale? Well, the K items, they're not identical, but we can order them in a way that everybody agrees on. All the bidders agree that the best slot is the top slot, all the bidders agree that the second best slot is the second to top slot and so on. So who's worthy of getting the top slot? Kind of feels like that's what the highest bidder should get, right? Similarly, okay, so the highest bidder is taken care of, has the best slot, who should get the second best slot, kind of feels like it should be the second highest bidder, right? And that's correct.
00:02:01.602 - 00:02:27.322, Speaker A: So that's exactly what we're going to be doing, and that's exactly what's done in practice in what's known as a generalized second price or GSP auction. So in general, we're going to be considering auctions where the jth highest bidder gets assigned to the jth best slot, the slot with the jth highest click through rate alpha sub j. Now in general, there may be more advertisers than there are slots, in which case, if you're not among the top K bidders, you get nothing.
00:02:27.322 - 00:02:44.542, Speaker A: You don't get displayed at all. So the step two, deciding who wins, that felt pretty obvious back in the single item auction, just give it to the highest bidder. It feels pretty obvious here in the sponsored search auction, you know, just go through the bidders from high to low bids and give them the best slots to the least slots to the worst slots, in that order.
00:02:44.542 - 00:03:10.194, Speaker A: And indeed that's a good idea and that is what is done. So, you know, in a single item auction, sort of all the complications were in what should the pricing rule be? And so what we want, we want an analog of a vicary auction. So we'd like a truthful auction and notice that just having step one and step two, we cannot at this point comment on whether we have a truthful auction or not because we haven't specified what are the payments in a single item auction.
00:03:10.194 - 00:03:26.302, Speaker A: If all I told you was that the highest bidder wins and I asked you, is it a truthful auction? You'd say, it depends. I mean, if you're charging the second highest bid, then yes, it's a truthful auction, but if you're charging the winner, their bid, the highest bid, then it's not a truthful auction. So same thing here.
00:03:26.302 - 00:04:10.422, Speaker A: To talk about whether this auction is going to be truthful or not, we need to say, what are we charging the winners? So now the question is this clever idea in the vicory auction of charging the winner, the second highest bid, the highest bid by somebody else, what would be the analog of that in this more general sponsored search setting where we have these K slots? So let's go back to the intuition for the truthfulness of the vicary auction. We said that really what was driving that truthfulness result was that somehow the auctioneer, you delegated bidding and effects to the auctioneer who bid optimally on your behalf, right? The auctioneer gets to see what all the bids are. And so if you're going to be the winner, the auctioneer says in the case that you win, I promise you I'll basically shade your bid down to the minimum amount necessary to continue to win the auction.
00:04:10.422 - 00:04:41.318, Speaker A: And that's sort of why it was a truthful auction, because you're very happy to sort of delegate your bid to this altruistic and all knowing third party, the auctioneer, to set up to bid on your behalf. So what will be the analog in the sponsored search context? Well, so again, if you have the top slot, if you have the best slot and you bid 17 and then the second highest bid is 15, you can imagine the auctioneer saying, well, to keep the top slot, you could have gotten away with a bid as low as $15.01, so that's all that I'll pay you.
00:04:41.318 - 00:04:55.482, Speaker A: Similarly, think about the advertiser who had the second highest bid and wound up in the second slot. Maybe they bid 15 and then the third highest bidder, bid 13. So you can imagine again, the auctioneer saying is like, well, you could have bid as low as $13.01
00:04:55.482 - 00:05:04.830, Speaker A: and still been granted this second slot. So that's all I'm going to charge you. I'm just going to charge you $13 for the second slot, not your bid, which was $15.
00:05:04.830 - 00:05:33.750, Speaker A: So if you continue that idea all the way down, you result in what is known as a generalized second price or GSP auction for Sponsored Search, where as discussed, the Jth highest bidder is given the Jeth best slot. And what do they pay? They pay the minimum bid at which they would continue to receive the Jth highest slot, that is, they are paid, that is they have to pay the next highest bid. So the J plus first highest bid overall.
00:05:33.750 - 00:05:58.234, Speaker A: So these generalized second price or GSP auctions, they certainly do generalize the Vicary auction in the sense that if k was equal to one, if actually you only had one slot, this would literally be the Vicary auction where the highest bidder wins. And what do they pay? They pay the highest bid by somebody else, the second highest overall. So the k equals one special case of a GSP auction is indeed the Vicary auction.
00:05:58.234 - 00:06:17.394, Speaker A: And then this is the definition of a generalized second price auction for an arbitrary number of slots k. And so these GSP auctions, these really are the dominant paradigm in real world sponsored search auctions. So you really do now know to first order how Google makes the lion's share of its revenue through auctions of exactly this form.
00:06:17.394 - 00:06:47.530, Speaker A: These generalized second price auctions, the original format adopted by Google almost 20 years ago, which was then quickly adopted by Yahoo and Microsoft Bing and other sort of search engines at that time. Obviously lots of bells and whistles have been added over the years and some more complicated auctions are out there as well. But still this really is the dominant paradigm in thinking about search options, generalized second price options, that's all great, but there is kind of a loophole in the story I've told you on this slide.
00:06:47.530 - 00:07:16.214, Speaker A: We wanted to generalize the Vicory option and we see that GSB auctions do generalize the Vicory option in the sense that when k equals one, sam is the Vicary option. And we sort of define the payment rule, trying to mimic this intuition about why the second price rule gives you a truthful option for single item options in the Vicary auction. But we actually haven't commented on whether or not generalized second price auctions are truthful, whether in that sense we succeeded in generalizing the Vicary auction to sponsored search.
00:07:16.214 - 00:07:18.770, Speaker A: So that's the question we'll take up on the next slide.
