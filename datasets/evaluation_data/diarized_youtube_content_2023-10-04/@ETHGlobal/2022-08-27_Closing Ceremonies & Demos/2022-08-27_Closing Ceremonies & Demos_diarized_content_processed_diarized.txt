00:00:00.730 - 00:00:12.560, Speaker A: Welcome to the East Mexico finale. Everybody. How's everybody doing? All right, well, we're going to kick it off with a nice summary of how the last 36 hours were.
00:00:12.560 - 00:01:21.558, Speaker A: All right, well, welcome everybody. I'm Karthik, one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I am super excited to put this event at a close. For the next 2 hours, we're going to have an amazing time.
00:01:21.558 - 00:01:30.294, Speaker A: So all of you have been working on amazing projects for the last two and a half days. And I know a lot of you are super tired. We're going to make sure everything is as quick as possible.
00:01:30.294 - 00:01:47.454, Speaker A: But for those of you who are joining us for the first time, especially on the live stream, to summarize, this has been an incredible event. We have 580 people from 27 different countries coming here, and they are half of them are new to Web Three. They made some incredible projects, impressed our judges so much that we had to change up how we format the rest of the event.
00:01:47.454 - 00:02:02.718, Speaker A: And we're going to talk about that in a second. On top of that, 65% of them from Latin America, this has been our most local event ever, and we have 92 projects that came out of it. This blew our minds and exceeded all expectations.
00:02:02.718 - 00:02:17.954, Speaker A: And with these 92 projects, we spent the last 4 hours going through all of them and judged and saw what they did. And I want to thank all of our amazing judges for putting in all the hard work and giving the feedback. So please give a big round of applause to all of our judges.
00:02:17.954 - 00:02:35.658, Speaker A: Paris Tani Skyler chris Baron, shannon Evan aya Sean chris Evan and Chewie. They talked to all of these projects, gave amazing feedback, and on top of that, you also presented to some of our incredible partners for all the prizes that you're giving. So I want to also give a big shout out to all of these partners.
00:02:35.658 - 00:03:00.214, Speaker A: Avi Grantstow dYdX IPFS Filecoin Lens Protocol Polygon Wide Connect WorldCoin Mina Superflow at the Graph Abacus chainlink Gnosis Chain coinspec Espasio Crypto and rabbit hole we're going to talk about all of these winners soon, but let's get back to the projects. As we started at the beginning on Friday, this is not a conference. We care about building cool things.
00:03:00.214 - 00:03:14.694, Speaker A: The focus is to show and not tell. And from these 92 submissions, we got twelve incredible finalists and they're all going to be coming on here and showcasing what they built. So I want to give a big round of applause to Data Morpho.
00:03:14.694 - 00:03:22.902, Speaker A: Kipi. Kiwi. Sellout emergence stacked block community eatpoint spiritus ethereum on sets or United and Rouge they are all twelve incredible teams.
00:03:22.902 - 00:03:29.326, Speaker A: We're going to bring them on one by one. You're going to see twelve incredible demos live of what they built. And we're going to have Vitalik do his talk.
00:03:29.326 - 00:03:43.682, Speaker A: And then we're going to talk about all the prizes that everybody's won. So stay patient for the next 2 hours. And before we go into the first demo, I want to take a quick second to thank all of these 80 amazing projects that took all this time to make something really cool.
00:03:43.682 - 00:03:50.546, Speaker A: That's what they were really proud of. You did an amazing job. So many of you were new, so many of you learned about so many new technologies.
00:03:50.546 - 00:03:59.880, Speaker A: The fact that you presented, the fact that you submitted is awesome. And you should be proud of that and really hope that you continue working on them tomorrow onwards. Take some time off today.
00:03:59.880 - 00:04:11.450, Speaker A: And for those of you who want to look at all these projects, you can head over to Ethcopal.com showcase and see the list of all 92 of these projects. From the demo videos to screenshots to descriptions, to the live websites.
00:04:11.450 - 00:04:25.054, Speaker A: All of this thing is here. And with that, let's go into our very first demo. Who is excited? All right, well, let's bring on Data Morpho for our very first team.
00:04:25.054 - 00:04:33.070, Speaker A: They'll get set up here, and on deck will be KP. And we'll get them set up in a few minutes. So please give a big round of applause to Data Morpho.
00:04:33.070 - 00:04:58.552, Speaker A: Um, look up there's. Okay. Hello, everybody.
00:04:58.552 - 00:05:16.300, Speaker A: We're really proud to be here and being able to kick this off. So we are metamorpho, conformed by Herman Benson Ben and I'm Eduardo. And what is Data morpho? Just imagine millions of years of Data Morphosis files that can survive generations.
00:05:16.300 - 00:05:22.128, Speaker A: We're tired of these NFT collections fixing rarity to their convenience. Yes.
00:05:22.214 - 00:05:38.804, Speaker B: I mean, everybody here minted one time and have a pre revealed period. Well, you know what is going to happen with my NFT? And then at the end, you know that sometimes someone came and give the golden penguin to their friends. And then you got the shitty NFT that worth nothing.
00:05:38.804 - 00:05:40.944, Speaker B: So this can happen anymore.
00:05:41.072 - 00:05:47.080, Speaker A: We want to make Mints reliable. Okay, so Data Morpho is a new file standard? Yes.
00:05:47.150 - 00:06:03.580, Speaker B: Now, we have standard files that are static files, or maybe some file that is injected with code or algorithm that gives a different output. But we don't have files that can change the content by itself. So what we are going to do here is no more or.
00:06:03.580 - 00:06:09.520, Speaker B: This is your NFT, an example for a use case. And close your eyes. And now you have this paper.
00:06:09.520 - 00:06:14.192, Speaker B: Congratulations. This is technology. No Blockchain is about a lot of technology.
00:06:14.192 - 00:06:21.216, Speaker B: Many very smart people making syntact are incredible. So this kind of behavior on the programming is an insult.
00:06:21.328 - 00:06:25.812, Speaker A: No more file substitution and impossible to pick. Finger your railroad. How?
00:06:25.866 - 00:06:28.980, Speaker B: With logical programmer data morphosis files.
00:06:29.560 - 00:06:34.504, Speaker A: Okay, let's get technical. Meet the metamorpho ecosystem. How does this work?
00:06:34.542 - 00:06:42.084, Speaker B: Let's be quick. This is a file on IPFS for verification and validation. This is what we usually find in a file.
00:06:42.084 - 00:07:05.584, Speaker B: But now we have some encrypted and obfuscated data here we have an isolated security key storage that through some triggers that can be dates on Oracle saying the weather or some match results gives the keyer put in any web three data storage service that is full access only by anyone. So here our little muffer is enjoying the content.
00:07:05.702 - 00:07:09.648, Speaker A: Okay, this sounds interesting, can you take me a little bit deeper on this? How does it work?
00:07:09.734 - 00:07:37.980, Speaker B: Okay, this is the structure of GPA. In example we have the first x bytes, the content, then we have the comment area and then the file after here we have some obfuscated content and the GPS encrypted there we have there some very crucial information to get the decryption. We have the triggers that are going to be published and we have in the file the strictly necessary data to access to the right content on the storage service.
00:07:38.130 - 00:07:43.576, Speaker A: Okay, so is this a new file extension? No. Is this a new file format?
00:07:43.688 - 00:08:18.836, Speaker B: No, this is fully compatible with any of the files that we currently use because after the end of files almost all of the viewers are not going to looking for something. So we are going to use but when there is the implementation now we are going to find that the content area that is going to be triggered many times in example, in Christmas dia de Mortos or when somebody has a mustache, we will have a different thing over there. So one use case I want to mention in example Madonna is going to release a song and you get the NFT.
00:08:18.836 - 00:08:32.270, Speaker B: You get a song that is Madonna saying I'm going to sing, I'm going to sing. But then on the day that corresponds this MF three file data morphosis and now you have the song and you are the first listening to it.
00:08:33.440 - 00:08:36.732, Speaker A: Okay, so what can we expect from this? Trust.
00:08:36.866 - 00:08:48.900, Speaker B: How we love IPFS. Trust, data morpher reveal, post reveal in the same file that you own from the very first time. Trust and a future thing that is already done here in example, license and content.
00:08:48.900 - 00:08:50.070, Speaker B: So is trust.
00:08:50.760 - 00:09:06.356, Speaker A: Okay? So in terms of adoption, we need NFT collections to start using this technology so that they build trust and liability on their project. So we got started with NFTs. We have a fully functional proof of concept.
00:09:06.356 - 00:09:15.096, Speaker A: It's minimal, but I will demonstrate it to you. We started minting an NFT. This is our NFT and it's displayed in OpenSea.
00:09:15.096 - 00:09:43.440, Speaker A: The baseline is the fully metadata standards of OpenSea but we added something so you might rec. It's not very visible, but we added secret encrypted information that we stack in the NFT. If you try to open it, you get something like this, which is not very useful, but we created a new interface.
00:09:43.440 - 00:10:05.800, Speaker A: This is extremely minimal, but pretend it's a new openc it's full functional. Full functional. So here is our NFD, the same as in OpenSea, but there is more behind this new protocol adds Dynamism to the NFTs.
00:10:05.800 - 00:10:14.060, Speaker A: So let's add a decryption key and boom, we got our upgraded NFT, if you don't mind.
00:10:14.130 - 00:10:16.056, Speaker B: Make an applause for the first metamorphic.
00:10:16.088 - 00:10:17.310, Speaker A: NFT in the world.
00:10:20.720 - 00:10:28.160, Speaker B: It's a national Otto, if you don't know. This is an animal that makes a metamorphosis when it wants to grow or get stressed.
00:10:29.480 - 00:10:48.440, Speaker A: So an NFT from now on can be packed with lots of encrypted secret information that can be unlocked if you feed it the right key. And this unlocks lots of exciting potential. Yes, we think there's great applicability for this sort of system with encryption in the financial industry.
00:10:48.440 - 00:11:06.370, Speaker A: Think about creating futures contracts that you could have on the blockchain that's totally not mev. Like minor extracted value, possible possibilities. Also maybe even an order book.
00:11:06.370 - 00:11:33.610, Speaker A: And be great for financial institutions that want to have financial transactions, data on the blockchain where maybe you can keep it hidden from competitors. So we think this is going to be if we build it out and we get support, hopefully from Avi and others, we can really build this out and change the world for the better.
00:11:36.860 - 00:11:51.950, Speaker B: Well, the last invitation this is an open source project, will be released, will be online for anyone that wants to join and make their own versions, branches or whatever of this to use in whatever you can imagine. You're welcome.
00:11:55.440 - 00:12:03.996, Speaker A: Thank you so much. You want to take a laptop? Never mind. This is my mistake.
00:12:03.996 - 00:12:07.440, Speaker A: Next up, we have Kipi. Please welcome Kipi on stage.
00:12:19.240 - 00:12:30.280, Speaker C: Do you want to know? Pero la compatadra. Hi. So we're very excited to be here.
00:12:30.280 - 00:12:58.450, Speaker C: We're keepi I'm sure that everyone knows that one of our biggest fears for those in crypto and even those that are not in crypto, is losing your private keys and losing access to all of your tokens. There's enough things going on in the market, and we don't want people to have to worry about that. And to this end, we created Kipi, which is a serial knowledge private key recovery platform.
00:12:58.450 - 00:13:20.536, Speaker C: So we're going to show you. This is a very hyper technical project, but we don't want to bore you. So we're going to be kind of fast in the encryption part because it's kind of hard because the idea is like, how can you manage your keys, right? But you're not going to give me your keys if you don't know me, right? So I have to show you that we can actually save them in a very good way.
00:13:20.536 - 00:13:24.044, Speaker C: So this is Felipe, and he's going to talk more about it.
00:13:24.242 - 00:13:38.044, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. I'm Felipe. Well, you can see from this diagram it is a little bit complex, but we'll see the main feature is that we'll use one ID that can prove the personhood of every user.
00:13:38.044 - 00:14:03.480, Speaker A: Once we know the personhood, we can use it to encrypt the data, the private key, in this case, in such a manner that it is unique to every user. So even if one key is in one segment, a little vulnerable, that's just one case, and that's just one layer because we have several layers of security here. After that we will have a splitting of the key.
00:14:03.480 - 00:14:09.770, Speaker A: That is, we have a protector key. It is encrypted and then we split it. Right.
00:14:09.770 - 00:14:42.164, Speaker A: Well, more diagram, but we can see that we split the key and store it in the IPFS. It is a public place, but it is secure still because every piece is uncorrelated when we do the retrieval process. The retrieval process use zero knowledge proof such that the key isn't necessary to be retrieved at all.
00:14:42.164 - 00:14:50.020, Speaker A: It's just necessary to be proven that it can be retrieven. Right. So no information is really unsafe.
00:14:54.540 - 00:15:08.190, Speaker C: Cool. So now we're going to show you how our initial MVP works. So the idea was to make a product that was very user, very intuitive, and you're able to connect with any of MetaMask wallet connect.
00:15:08.190 - 00:15:20.080, Speaker C: And then you can copy paste your wallet and your email, and then you validate with WorldCoin at this point in time. Yeah, if you can show us the demo. So we verify if you're actually a person.
00:15:20.080 - 00:15:26.610, Speaker C: And this is what gets everything started. There you go. Don't worry about it.
00:15:26.610 - 00:15:33.300, Speaker C: So what gets everything started? And then Atai is going to explain you what happens here in the backend.
00:15:33.800 - 00:15:49.028, Speaker A: Thank you, Doris. So what we did, Felipe was talking to you guys about how we encrypt the key and then we split it in parts. So the parts that the key is split into can be a random number and a random length.
00:15:49.028 - 00:16:08.536, Speaker A: And then we form an encrypted array, which is eventually uploaded to IPFS. And IPFS gives us back an address that represents each of the shards of the already encrypted key. So it's a very safe way to store the shards.
00:16:08.536 - 00:16:26.852, Speaker A: So how is the user going to use this? So let's say you don't remember your key and you want to retrieve it. So what you do is that you prove that you are you, let's say, a world coin. And then that sends the key over to the back end.
00:16:26.852 - 00:17:00.320, Speaker A: And in the back end, that key allows for the back end to retrieve all the addresses for the shards that are stored in IPFS. And then those shards are sent to the smart contract running on the mina blockchain in the back end, and finally you can retrieve your key. So like Doris said, it's a really technical problem, but it's a highly technical solution that makes it really easy and really safe for you guys to store your keys.
00:17:01.060 - 00:17:06.290, Speaker C: Can we see a demo? Yeah, we're going to show you how it works. I think it's pretty cool.
00:17:07.960 - 00:17:36.300, Speaker A: So you see here there's a private key and there's a string, which is the let's call it the secret. And so when we hit process keys so it's going to go here and then it's going to start doing all the encryption. And so you see that there's already the shards, and then what you're looking at is the shards returning address.
00:17:36.300 - 00:17:44.908, Speaker A: And then what we build out of that is an array of addresses that can't be linked to the user. Okay. At least not in the front end.
00:17:44.908 - 00:18:05.268, Speaker A: And since we're running the smart contract from the Mina blockchain on the back end that lives safely in there and can permanently keep your keys safeguarded and then this is what we store. It would be really hard for anybody to try and know what it is, but we're talking technical details here.
00:18:05.434 - 00:18:12.410, Speaker C: Yeah. So I know that felipe, you were telling me about how this could be hyper secure at some point.
00:18:12.860 - 00:18:18.756, Speaker A: Yeah. So you can see that this is your private key. Now it is distributed all over the blockchain.
00:18:18.756 - 00:18:42.290, Speaker A: Right. We can take that calculation and use something like, for example, the Mina protocol that you can use zero knowledge proof, and then from these ten charts just get one certificate of proof that can be considered like a new private key, a new representation of your ownership, but it is obfuscated. Right.
00:18:42.290 - 00:19:05.764, Speaker A: And then we can do it all over again. We can split it, we can do all this process again and get another chart. So it is like distributing all the information of the ownership of all of us in the blockchain in such a way that it is not necessary to be concentrated centralized in just one asset.
00:19:05.764 - 00:19:11.050, Speaker A: That is the private key group. Right. So that's one future work, right.
00:19:11.050 - 00:19:15.710, Speaker A: In all the umbrella of application that this project can have.
00:19:16.160 - 00:19:20.910, Speaker C: Anyways, thank you very much, guys. Keeping. Thank you.
00:19:25.120 - 00:19:35.500, Speaker A: Congratulations. All right, next up we have Kiwik on that side and up next is Sellout to get ready here on my left, please welcome Kiwik on stage.
00:19:59.020 - 00:20:11.884, Speaker C: Only last year, there were 3 billion gamers playing online. And we know this will continue to grow more and more because of Metaverse, AR and VR developments. This will become a 1 trillion industry in only eight years.
00:20:11.884 - 00:20:23.036, Speaker C: And we know that Web Three has very exciting use cases for metaverse and for gaming. But builders are having real issues. They have a lack of quality and affordable three D assets.
00:20:23.036 - 00:20:40.100, Speaker C: They have to look around in different platforms that they are not interoperable between them. So if you buy something in unity, you cannot use it on unreal engine and that's a real pain for the builders. And there's also like very expensive fees that they need to pay and this slows down the development of games currently on the market.
00:20:40.100 - 00:20:55.588, Speaker C: There are different players tackling parts of this problem. There are decentralized marketplaces where you can monetize your assets, others where you can display your work, but there's none of them that can come together and bring a solution for this community. So this is why we created keyweek.
00:20:55.588 - 00:21:14.828, Speaker C: Keyweek means marketplace in maya. And this is the NFT marketplace for metaverse builders and game developers. Our goal is to empower creators to create high quality content to accelerate the game development and also to give some financial tools for the game dev and for the metabol builders.
00:21:14.828 - 00:21:29.344, Speaker C: And of course, build more and better games for the 3 billion people that they're playing around. One of the best features that we have that make us real different is the part of the ownership of the NFTs that they will have. They will have also engine agnostics.
00:21:29.344 - 00:21:42.956, Speaker C: So no matter if you're developing Unreal or Unity or another engines, you can upload them on our website. There's a buy now, pay later feature that you can acquire the assets with a credit for you. There are insights to develop smarter content.
00:21:42.956 - 00:21:57.730, Speaker C: We have a social component and some rewards to keep the quality top of the platform. Hello. I did not plan this ahead.
00:21:57.730 - 00:22:09.200, Speaker C: Okay, hello. Here is the amazing live demo that hopefully works on the first try. So here we have the home page of our marketplace keyweek.
00:22:09.200 - 00:22:31.560, Speaker C: And you can see that once you are launched into the home page, you have a featured asset and you can preview 3D models which are uploaded on IPFS and minted on Polygon. So you can rotate around the 3D models and zoom in and out to preview them. Then if you scroll down, you'll see some trending assets, the most popular assets.
00:22:31.560 - 00:22:49.856, Speaker C: Also, if you go to the Explore page, you'll have more detailed assets, more assets that you can scroll through. As you can see, we have a lot of them here. There will also be a search and filter page, which later on we will show we couldn't implement it in the two days, but we will show how that looks.
00:22:49.856 - 00:23:00.736, Speaker C: And so let's see if we click View Details. For example, you'll see we have our model here, which we can rotate. It's a little finicky.
00:23:00.736 - 00:23:07.844, Speaker C: That's okay. Life is finicky sometimes. Well, you're supposed to be okay, there we go.
00:23:07.844 - 00:23:23.304, Speaker C: You're supposed to be able to rotate it. And then you can see all the details of this model, the triangles, the vertices, very important information for game developers, metaverse builders. And basically, what's cool about this is that this is linked to your social profile.
00:23:23.304 - 00:23:51.008, Speaker C: So, for example, if we click Shannon, which Shannon is the amazing UIUX designer of our team, you'll see that we have this creator profile. And so now we assign a face to the person making the assets, and you can follow them and be notified on all of their upcoming assets. And this is using the lens protocol.
00:23:51.008 - 00:24:11.140, Speaker C: So you have your own Lens account, and it also uses WorldCoin to authenticate that you're an actual person so that we don't get scammers uploading a ton of bad assets to our marketplace because we want to ensure we have high quality assets. Right, but back to this character. Let's say you like it and you want to buy the NFT.
00:24:11.140 - 00:24:22.252, Speaker C: So this is an NFT that you buy one cool feature. We have several ways to pay. One cool feature is buy now, pay later, which exists in web two, but not really in web three.
00:24:22.252 - 00:24:40.610, Speaker C: And the way it works is that if you don't have enough funds to pay for it now, or you just want to try it and not pay the full price, you can pay it in installments. And this uses the Superfluid API. And once you mint the NFT, it starts that transaction with Superfluid and also mints it on.
00:24:40.610 - 00:24:55.130, Speaker C: So this is just the creator profile that you can create your profile, and it's verified by WorldCoin. And yes, I believe that's the end of my part. Text person.
00:24:55.130 - 00:25:14.664, Speaker C: Hello? Hello. I don't know why this looks blurry, but this is supposed to be our UI. So as you could see in the implementation, there was some bugs.
00:25:14.664 - 00:25:24.192, Speaker C: So I just wanted to show off kind of what it could be when we continue the project. So here's the home page. This is kind of like the profile view.
00:25:24.192 - 00:25:27.680, Speaker C: My boy Anakin here. I hate sand. 14.
00:25:27.680 - 00:25:45.690, Speaker C: Yeah. So if I wanted to follow him, I can go along and see other creators that might be similar, see what kind of assets that he's creating. I can also search so I can go by filters and find results curated to exactly what I need in my project.
00:25:45.690 - 00:25:52.660, Speaker C: Another important aspect is the community. So you can search for all kinds of people. It's not just anakin.
00:25:52.660 - 00:26:00.670, Speaker C: Everyone has a profile on here. You can follow them. You can follow along in their journey as they're creating assets and contributing to the community.
00:26:00.670 - 00:26:12.864, Speaker C: If you want to check out more of our figma assets, you can add this QR code. Hello. We're not done.
00:26:12.864 - 00:26:26.160, Speaker C: We're not done. So we created our Tokens on polygno with a supply of 100 million. And every time an asset has four or five stars, it's rewarded with Tokens.
00:26:26.160 - 00:26:42.800, Speaker C: This is why we encourage people to contribute to the community and to have high quality assets. So thank you so much to all of these amazing sponsors. In conclusion, Key Week will revolutionize the game development industry by empowering the builders.
00:26:42.800 - 00:26:59.970, Speaker C: And we'll do this, and we're doing this through Tokenization community, and engine agnostic assets. So thank you all so much.
00:27:05.860 - 00:27:10.500, Speaker A: All right, next up, we have Sellout and on deck emergence. So please welcome Jack from Sellout.
00:27:21.130 - 00:27:24.870, Speaker D: Hey, everybody. My name is Jack. I created Sellout.
00:27:24.870 - 00:27:49.714, Speaker D: Sellout is a react component library for bringing web two checkout experiences to web three. So essentially, all a developer has to do is to wrap their app or marketplace in the Sellout provider, and you have access to this great checkout experience from start to finish. So let's dive into a quick demo here.
00:27:49.714 - 00:27:55.246, Speaker D: We've got a marketplace. Let's go ahead and buy one of these T shirts. So immediately.
00:27:55.246 - 00:28:21.530, Speaker D: When you click Buy, you're greeted with a great modal that everybody is used to from the Web Two checkout experience. I took a lot of inspiration from Rainbow Kit, which is a recent UX developer kit for connecting wallets to Ethereum. So this modal contains all of the order information that you need, as well as promo codes, or if you need to collect an address from the user to send them a physical item.
00:28:21.530 - 00:28:48.274, Speaker D: And all of this information, once you click Confirm, payment is uploaded onto IPFS. So let's go ahead and submit this transaction. You can see it's for the correct amount, and once we confirm the payment, all of the order data is packaged up, and we can view a receipt of the transaction on a new page on this hosted demo site.
00:28:48.274 - 00:29:19.034, Speaker D: But in the URL is the IPFS hash. So if you're a vendor, you can have an IPFS hash in your order book for additional verifiability, so you can send the buyer the exact information on the order details, all from IPFS. The checkout experience also works with NFTs, so I deployed a custom polygon contract on Mumbai to mint this awesome ETH Mexico hacker badge.
00:29:19.034 - 00:29:41.030, Speaker D: So again, the similar checkout experience is here. All of the theming is customizable within the modal, so you can change different color schemes. Got any dark mode fans in the room? And let's go ahead and mint this NFT.
00:29:41.030 - 00:30:16.630, Speaker D: And again, all of those customizations are available via props to a single react component that you can place anywhere in your app. So the developer's experience for taking an app from just a proof of concept marketplace to having actual marketplace functionality is this much code. You have product data, you have a checkout modal that you can place anywhere, and then you have a Sellout provider that you wrap your app in, and you've got Checkout on Web Three, and it's a great experience.
00:30:16.630 - 00:30:26.022, Speaker D: So we've got a great README as well. So feel free to check that out. And that is sellout.
00:30:26.022 - 00:30:27.180, Speaker D: Thank you, guys.
00:30:31.810 - 00:30:36.346, Speaker A: Congratulations. Congratulations. Next up emergence.
00:30:36.346 - 00:30:38.990, Speaker A: And on deck stacks, please welcome Emergence.
00:30:45.910 - 00:30:51.190, Speaker E: Yes. Okay.
00:30:51.960 - 00:30:52.484, Speaker A: All right.
00:30:52.522 - 00:31:07.796, Speaker F: What's up y'all? We are emergence. So at Emergence, we believe that the best way to onboard new users into Dows is through face to face interactions. So the problems that we identified are DAOs have a problem onboarding.
00:31:07.796 - 00:31:31.360, Speaker F: It's mostly through discord, through asynchronous conversation. It's hard to get metrics on DAOs and as well as documentation. And so basically our approach is we incentivize Dow members to interact with potential new Dow members through token streaming in basically a Web Three version of Zoom.
00:31:31.360 - 00:31:42.348, Speaker F: And then we get more people to join Dows and the cycle continues. And so we'll get right into the demo here. So this is our home page.
00:31:42.348 - 00:32:05.240, Speaker F: We call this the dowry. So each Dow is going to have their own smart contract, which has a combination of superfluid and semaphore logic, and each dow can hold their own treasury to give to the Dow members. And so we just went into the ETH Global Dow.
00:32:05.240 - 00:32:30.310, Speaker F: So this Dao has nine rooms and we're going to join a room here in a second and start streaming with a user. So basically we're going to have Danilo over there is going to be the Dao member and then we're going to have a new user and simulate that experience. So right now you can type in your name and then you go into the channel and I'll let Daniela take it from here.
00:32:31.160 - 00:33:09.484, Speaker E: So the idea of the so the main purpose of our platform is to allow people to meet more online and especially in the decentralized communities. We believe that if you create more spaces where people can connect, more things can emerge that we couldn't even imagine. So our DAP is a way to incentivize Verified Down members to receive Superfluid tokens as they are participating in online meetings.
00:33:09.484 - 00:33:36.888, Speaker E: And we are using Semaphore as identity layer and also a way to keep privacy from the user so that people don't know who are they meeting, when they're meeting, and they can keep their privacy and just allow people to know when they want. So how the depth work is first you need to open a room. So this room opens a session on a smart contract and you can only start to claim tokens when this room is open.
00:33:36.888 - 00:34:00.960, Speaker E: And there is a way to verify people who are in the chat and also who is claiming for this room session. So as soon as the transaction goes through, we will see that the room ID will pop up here. In the meantime, we are showing our handsome teammates that maybe the Internet is a little bit laggy.
00:34:00.960 - 00:34:20.280, Speaker E: So we're waiting a little bit for the transaction to go through. And our main motive here is to I think he left the room, left me alone. We're still waiting for the transaction.
00:34:20.280 - 00:34:46.284, Speaker E: While we wait, we want to also show another part of the DAP. Right after the room gets the transaction goes through, we will generate a proof and then start the transaction. But on the meanwhile, we want to show another page, that is the admin page for the DAOs admin where they can see all the rooms and all the meetings that are happening without showing any data from the user.
00:34:46.284 - 00:35:20.244, Speaker E: So for example, here there is room one that has this purpose and this is a voting that every member can vote on the meeting without revealing who they are. So this is an average vote of how the meeting was, amount of token that was distributed on the meeting and some of the information. And another cool feature that we have implemented is that for every meeting, in the end, we will use an artificial intelligence to generate a transcription of the meeting.
00:35:20.244 - 00:35:46.440, Speaker E: And this is the transcription of our demo that we created and the. Idea to generate a text transcription is that we can generate data from meetings, also keeping the users a little bit more private compared to videos and audios. The idea also is that later this transcription will be encrypted so only specific members or only through vote, it could be accessed.
00:35:46.440 - 00:36:15.668, Speaker E: And besides the transcription, my spelling is a little bit bad. It should be dow, not doe. And besides the transcription, this artificial intelligence also generates a sentiment of how the meeting was and also some possible topics that will help the Dao to have some more data of what is happening on the ecosystem while keeping privacy of the users who are participating.
00:36:15.668 - 00:36:33.024, Speaker E: So it seems the room wasn't created, maybe. Yeah, the transaction is still pending. Me? Yeah, I will just explain what would happen here.
00:36:33.024 - 00:37:01.740, Speaker E: We can show on the smart contract basically what would happen here. This smart contract is outdated, but when you create a room, we are just basically creating a session and saying that this is true. And basically then we are generating a proof and sending the transaction to request funds with the proof that was generated by the Semaphore protocol that I am member of a specific group.
00:37:01.740 - 00:37:25.760, Speaker E: And here we are using the external nullifier to match the room ID so that each proof can only request fund once from each session. Even though it's anonymous, we can have this locking measure where a member can only request fund once from each room. So yeah, it is still pending.
00:37:25.760 - 00:37:41.450, Speaker E: And the idea is that here it would generate the proof and then when you exit the meeting, it will close the session and at the same time it would close the streams from all the transactions. So yeah. Thank you.
00:37:48.300 - 00:37:58.440, Speaker A: Thank you. I know it won't be a hackathon with that Murphy's lock kicking in, so I think you still got to see what this project was able to do. And with that, let's welcome our next team, Stacks.
00:37:58.440 - 00:38:20.804, Speaker A: Hello. My name is Ian and I'm part of Stacks. What we built was a new social media platform.
00:38:20.804 - 00:38:51.788, Speaker A: We really wanted to tackle social media. Oftentimes when we scroll Instagram, we're bothered because every time we scroll we see reels and from influencers that we don't even know, we see a lot of sponsored content and the algorithm is bombarding us with content that we don't really know where it's coming from. And so what we really wanted to build was a new social media where we kind of wanted to focus on micro interactions with our friends, our family and people that we really care about.
00:38:51.788 - 00:39:05.516, Speaker A: And we wanted to create something that doesn't rely on an algorithm built on artificial intelligence. And so we built stacks. It's built on top of Lens protocol, we use Wallet Connect and it's all on polygon.
00:39:05.516 - 00:39:13.844, Speaker A: So here's our app. I think the Internet is pretty slow, so I'll just switch tabs. This is what the homepage will look like.
00:39:13.844 - 00:39:22.884, Speaker A: So stacks are basically collections of content on Lens. And so right here you can see a stack. It's called chrome.
00:39:22.884 - 00:39:35.688, Speaker A: So you can create your own topic called Chrome, Solar Power, anything you wanted to create. And you can start adding content to those stacks. And the idea is that you can subscribe to stacks, and then you'll get updates when people add to those stacks.
00:39:35.688 - 00:39:59.780, Speaker A: So instead of machine learning algorithm curating your feed for you, you actually follow feeds that are curated by real people and people that you care about. So if we click in here, you can see something like different images that people have added to the stack called Chrome. And then if you wanted to, you could add this to your own stack that you're part of.
00:39:59.780 - 00:40:19.720, Speaker A: And if we go back, you can scroll through your home feed I think I mentioned this already, but you can see stacks that people are creating and things that people you follow are contributing to. And so you can also view profiles. So this person has created Chrome and architecture stacks.
00:40:19.720 - 00:40:31.832, Speaker A: And here's our new stack page. So if you want to make a new stack, you could call it something like Lens Create Stack. And this creates a new post on Lens.
00:40:31.832 - 00:40:44.880, Speaker A: So if you're not familiar with Lens, it's a social media protocol. And so this is a different implementation of Lens. Someone else built a UI and you can see that this is a post.
00:40:44.880 - 00:40:55.060, Speaker A: And we've just displayed the post differently on our UI. So we want to create a new, unique experience on the front end. Yeah, that was something we really focused on, the UI.
00:40:55.060 - 00:40:57.028, Speaker A: You want to talk about that more?
00:40:57.114 - 00:40:59.808, Speaker C: Yes. So hi everyone. I'm Julia.
00:40:59.808 - 00:41:17.400, Speaker C: I was the designer for this project, and I'm going to just thank you. So, yeah, we weren't able to build the full flow of the app, so I just wanted to take us through what the full experience would look like. So this is kind of like what the fully built out feed like we envision.
00:41:17.400 - 00:41:38.800, Speaker C: So with friends and Influences, you would be able to see individual posts that your friends reacted to. Influences is more for people you're inspired by, designers you look up to, et cetera, and you would also be able to see their activity whenever they create a new stacks or respond to an image. And then there's also like a general feed.
00:41:38.800 - 00:42:04.548, Speaker C: So when you click on a stack like this board, this is kind of like what it would expand out to look like. The idea was that you can create a public board that anyone can add to, or you can kind of limit it to, so only a certain number of people, like close friends can collaborate with it. Yeah, and then we kind of really wanted to focus on minimal UI that showcased the actual work of the creator.
00:42:04.548 - 00:42:38.708, Speaker C: So this is kind of what when you kind of upload a picture to a stack it would look like. So you can either choose to upload if you're like a creator, you can choose to upload a picture of your own creation as a collection on Lens or you can upload someone thing that's not your own as a curation. And we also wanted to hopefully expand to use referral fees on Lens and introduce a wave where you can cap it so it can focus on kind of like curating the best quality content to the top and yeah, kind of continuing on to the end.
00:42:38.708 - 00:43:00.380, Speaker C: So once you kind of upload it, this is what it would look like and this is what the profile feed looks like. So you can kind of see all of the stacks that a user has curated as well as their influences. And yeah, this is just a quick preview of what the uploading process would look like as you're in the process of creating one.
00:43:00.380 - 00:43:09.292, Speaker C: So, yeah, now I'm going to hand it over to Sheena and Mia to talk about some use cases. Yeah, one of the things oh, hi, my name is Sheena. I am from Florida.
00:43:09.292 - 00:43:28.448, Speaker C: I'm one of the developers on the team. One of the use cases that we really wanted to showcase was fashion. Because a lot of the things now for fashion designers is to really showcase their designs and for someone else to not steal that design and for them to actually showcase that they were the first person to actually have that mockup.
00:43:28.448 - 00:43:41.848, Speaker C: So for designers and creatives, we wanted to create a platform that allows for them to monetize in the way that they see their art to be displayed. Right. And with that, there's many complaints out there.
00:43:41.848 - 00:43:51.644, Speaker C: Sorry. Hi, I'm Mia from La. With everything that they have said so far, there have been many complaints all across Instagram to make Instagram instagram again.
00:43:51.644 - 00:44:10.064, Speaker C: There's actually this one influencer that has over 300,000 followers that made a post viral to just want to see cute photos of their friends. And it doesn't necessarily have to be influencers with a large following. It could be for people that have from zero to 100 or 200 influencers.
00:44:10.064 - 00:44:27.850, Speaker C: But with this, we just wanted to create a social platform that is what people want. And this is also Shannon, another designer in our team. Like Mia said, I'm Shannon, I'm from Miami and I'm the visual designer for this project.
00:44:27.850 - 00:45:08.340, Speaker C: As a content creator, you really get bogged down by different companies not recognizing you for your work. And we wanted to create an interface that didn't look so much like Instagram or Pinterest in their own unique ways so that new people, new creators integrated into Web three could feasibly use this product. And the interface was made so that hopefully well, people usually look at something and three or 4 seconds later their eyes glaze over and they don't want to look at it again.
00:45:08.340 - 00:45:19.736, Speaker C: So we were trying to create an interface where people wanted to stay on it and look at the content a little bit more and keep on the creative side. Thank you so much. Thank you, guys.
00:45:19.838 - 00:45:28.396, Speaker A: Stax congratulations. Stats. Next up, Block Community.
00:45:28.396 - 00:45:38.288, Speaker A: Please welcome Block Community. On stage and on deck will be Eatpoint. Hi, everyone.
00:45:38.288 - 00:46:10.470, Speaker A: It's an honor to be here with so many awesome projects. We don't have the most technology solution, but we think that it's a solution for a real problem that we have every day. So in a minute it's going to be sorry, I'll start to talk about the project.
00:46:10.470 - 00:46:48.780, Speaker A: We have a problem principle in Mexico and I think in very countries in Latin America, maybe in Europe or something, that we live in gated communities. When the other administration of the community that administrators one person or a little person and he had to receive the pace, the monthly pace of all the neighborhoods and it's a difficult way to do, we think that they put that in the blockchain. That was transparency.
00:46:48.780 - 00:47:21.740, Speaker A: And we can view the traceability of the money and where it starts, where the neighbor paid to the board of the management and where should go the money. So there is no ways to one neighbor pays his bills and there is a ticket from the pay that he do. I'm sorry about this.
00:47:21.740 - 00:47:36.990, Speaker A: It okay. We're we're almost ready to go. You really have a very good intro.
00:47:36.990 - 00:47:54.346, Speaker A: Not with a very good English, but I do my best. I'm sorry. No, I think it's over.
00:47:54.346 - 00:47:57.020, Speaker A: There you go. That's right. Okay.
00:47:57.020 - 00:48:09.960, Speaker A: Hi everyone, I'm Diego. Let's talk a little bit about Black community. This is our team.
00:48:09.960 - 00:48:30.384, Speaker A: He is my brother, a full stack dev, Paco Trejo and I'm a project manager. Okay, so just giving a little recap about Paco mentioned right now. In Mexico, there are a lot of problems with closed gated communities in which properties inside of them are owned by different people.
00:48:30.384 - 00:49:42.070, Speaker A: And these people not always share the same way of thinking, right? So even though each person has their own property inside these gated communities, the management of specific areas could be difficult and must be taken care of by someone, right? Like keeping security, the maintenance, the water and garbage collection, et cetera. But who is responsible for all this? How does a community decide who is the most appropriate person to take care of these activities and who will handle the management fees paid by each property owner? So, like, the model that we're trying to offer via webtree and crypto is that community members who are the property owners can pay in a transparent way via wallet and with crypto their management fees. So a community administration will receive all this money paid by the property owners and they will be able to make expenses also in a transparency way, in a transparent way.
00:49:42.070 - 00:50:06.028, Speaker A: All these resources will be in a treasury wallet and that's why it will be all traceable. Right? So basically what we built these days, it's adapt for payments and traceability oriented to physical gated communities. I'll try to show what we built.
00:50:06.028 - 00:50:27.930, Speaker A: Let's see if the connection. Let me. So it's a very basic DAP in which you can sign in and register your own property.
00:50:27.930 - 00:51:00.560, Speaker A: This is the interface block community. You can save your new property with your wallet address and to consult your property fee that you will be paying month by month. There you can also consult what is your monthly fee and the ability to pay.
00:51:00.560 - 00:51:12.820, Speaker A: See if it's working already. There you go. So I'll try like if I was registered, we are open to any designer can help us with that.
00:51:12.820 - 00:51:31.960, Speaker A: We are developers, not designers. So here I will be able to register my property and also the fee that I'll be paying. In that way, I already registered my property.
00:51:31.960 - 00:51:51.760, Speaker A: I will only be able to do this if before someone let me. Right? Because no one could register a property if they're not part of the community. Also here I will check my monthly fee associated to my wallet address and I'll be able to pay directly in this platform.
00:51:51.760 - 00:52:13.534, Speaker A: Also, an NFT will be minted month by month and every year to show that I've already paid and giving a little bit more about how it works. Only property owners will be able to make payments in the DAP. The funds will be received in a treasury wallet.
00:52:13.534 - 00:52:27.154, Speaker A: Every payment will have an NFT that work as a proof of payment. Any expense funds leaving the treasury wallet will be easily verifiable in the blockchain and traceable. If you pay early, you receive a management token.
00:52:27.154 - 00:52:50.910, Speaker A: And also if you pay late, you will have to buy that token directly from other token holders, those who paid early to pay for the interest generated by your late payment. Here we want to create like tokenomics that will work to keep a circular economic inside the communities. And someone will have a benefit if they're paying early or they're being a good neighbor.
00:52:50.910 - 00:53:13.222, Speaker A: And also who pay late will have to pay more using those tokens. And what are future plans? Create the tokenomics for the project utility Token, improve UI and find a wallet partner to make it accessible to anyone, any community all around the world. And that's it.
00:53:13.222 - 00:53:20.426, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. Thanks a lot. Congratulations and thank you.
00:53:20.426 - 00:53:31.818, Speaker A: All right, next up is Eatpoint and Ondex Vardes. Please welcome eatpoint on stage. Hello, everyone.
00:53:31.818 - 00:53:36.110, Speaker A: We are at point. And we are Victor right there. Alex.
00:53:36.110 - 00:53:52.180, Speaker A: And I'm Luis eduardo. And we are the mobile first and point of sale application for ethereum and polygon ecosystem that brings together traditional finance with web three through Wallet Connect. So let's see if this works.
00:53:52.180 - 00:54:31.162, Speaker A: Okay? A very wise man once said so total crypto coin market cap of just half a trillion. That was 2017. What have we earned it? And then he said how many unbanked people have we banked? And actually, if we take a look at the market cap that we had last year, have you noticed any kind of improvements about them banked and about people pricing and getting financial inclusion? Well, in our Latin American ecosystem, not so much.
00:54:31.162 - 00:54:46.120, Speaker A: The region has very poor credit inclusion and digital banking numbers, these are abysmal. 45% of adults do not have any bank account. That means no digital lending thing to do anything.
00:54:46.120 - 00:55:07.034, Speaker A: 79% had no borrowed any type of credit from financial institutions. And just 12% aren't saving any kind of money in any kind of account. But we are in the region of magical realism, and somehow we have great infrastructure on the cell phone and telecommunication side.
00:55:07.034 - 00:55:23.678, Speaker A: 73%. I mean, you go to the small pueblos everywhere and you find people even in the lowest poverty rates with a cell phone, and that's 7.1% of GDP in the region.
00:55:23.678 - 00:55:29.294, Speaker A: And these numbers will keep on growing. Well, Ms. Ajamig.
00:55:29.294 - 00:56:05.278, Speaker A: Jagucci also the EA Foundation is actually looking at those numbers directly. And well, this slide is quite important because we have what is ecom revenue and point of sale revenue, which is cash and credit cards, right? And that is well, the difference between billions 525,000,000,000 till just a couple of billions that we have there is quite remarkable. And that's a great opportunity because digital wallets are projected to overtake great cars and cash by 2024.
00:56:05.278 - 00:56:35.510, Speaker A: With some help. There is a huge opportunity for an integration of traditional finance with Web Three via mobile phones and point of sale systems. So we came up with a solution that integrates wallet Connect and polygon with POS using USDC, USDT and some other stable coins and wallet Connect, which join us to this point of sale system to do any kind of transactions and sales.
00:56:35.510 - 00:56:50.876, Speaker A: So let's try this live. Staff can you switch to the other laptop? Hello. Yeah.
00:56:50.876 - 00:57:01.300, Speaker A: Switch, please. All right. There, Victor is a store clerk, right? And he's going to sell his Poncho.
00:57:01.300 - 00:57:20.690, Speaker A: So now Alex wants to buy it, but he has no cash. So what does he do? He gets his phone app that has a digital wallet. And now what you see there is here.
00:57:20.690 - 00:57:47.002, Speaker A: So you just fill everything. It may take a while. So and he gets paid.
00:57:47.002 - 00:58:11.846, Speaker A: And that's just a scan with rainbow wallet, for example. And by the way, this is on Matic Mainet with real money and everything. So so he goes ahead.
00:58:11.846 - 00:58:29.254, Speaker A: He already had the confirmation and Victor is waiting for his and there it is. And he's gonna just give him his ticket. Not yet.
00:58:29.372 - 00:58:30.230, Speaker C: Staff.
00:58:45.920 - 00:58:58.600, Speaker A: And then he's going to corroborate the transaction on Mainet. So that's Mainet. That is.
