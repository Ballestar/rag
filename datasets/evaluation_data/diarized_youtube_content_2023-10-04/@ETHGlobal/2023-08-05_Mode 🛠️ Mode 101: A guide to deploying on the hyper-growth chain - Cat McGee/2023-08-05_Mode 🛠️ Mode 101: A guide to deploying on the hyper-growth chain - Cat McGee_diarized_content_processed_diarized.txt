00:00:22.380 - 00:00:22.930, Speaker A: You.
00:00:24.900 - 00:00:37.010, Speaker B: Hello everyone and welcome to the SuperHack Mode Workshop, mode 101, a guide to deploying on the hypergrowth chain. Joining us today is Kat and McGee who will be taking us through this session. And with that, I'll pass it over to Kat to get the session started.
00:00:38.420 - 00:00:44.368, Speaker A: Hey everybody. Very excited to be here. This is actually super special.
00:00:44.368 - 00:00:59.800, Speaker A: So I'm Kat, I'm a develop Relations Engineer, and today I'm going to be talking to you and introducing for the very first time mode. I say first time because we're kind of still in stealth mode right now. We're like in half stealth.
00:00:59.800 - 00:01:12.328, Speaker A: So this is our first introduction to the world. I love East Global. I've been a hacker at East Global for a very long time and it just made sense for us to jump on the super hack and talk with all these amazing sponsors and partners.
00:01:12.328 - 00:01:34.160, Speaker A: We are an Lt on Op Stack, so it just makes hell a lot of sense for us and it's very exciting. So a little bit about what the hyper growth chain actually means. We have noticed through all of our years in blockchain that there's kind of one big issue with it and that there's a ton of developers like building and there's a ton of projects.
00:01:34.160 - 00:01:46.104, Speaker A: But actually growing those projects is the pain. It's difficult to do. And turning really good code and really good tech into businesses is something that we haven't quite nailed in Blockchain yet.
00:01:46.104 - 00:02:07.632, Speaker A: So the point of this L two is kind of stems from two different things. We've got technology based right into the protocol level that's going to really incentivize and have growth mechanics and have KPIs and have everything that you need to just develop like a working application that's going to get users. You guys focus on the code and then this kind of does all the business stuff for you.
00:02:07.632 - 00:02:25.396, Speaker A: And then also on the other side, we're really focused on just growing an ecosystem and a community. This is built by people who've been actually building hundreds of blockchain projects for like seven years or something. So we want to support developers as they're doing this and we have that side as well.
00:02:25.396 - 00:02:47.528, Speaker A: So it's both kind of the technology and then this ecosystem of really good people. So why mode? So we're kind of trying to build this whole big incentivized system that isn't just the idea of blockchain, but actually is like on the protocol layer, an ecosystem and a community. So the way that we're doing that is through loads of different features.
00:02:47.528 - 00:03:02.972, Speaker A: But these are just some examples that we are working on from me, and that at the moment we have contract secured revenue. So any developer who publishes a smart contract is going to actually get some fees from the transactions that go through to the smart contract. And this is something that we really, really feel this is going to incentivize.
00:03:02.972 - 00:03:14.244, Speaker A: Like, you don't have to think about how you're going to make money. Your contract is going to make money for you immediately without any sort of extra stuff added to it. You just have to grow that and then just incentivize that to happen.
00:03:14.244 - 00:03:27.384, Speaker A: Then there's like referral revenues. This is the whole point of the ecosystem, the community working together. So anyone who refers new developers, new users, new protocols is going to get a share of the transaction fee revenue onto that as well.
00:03:27.384 - 00:03:35.736, Speaker A: So that's just like this growth ecosystem that's going to incentivize people. Very exciting. And then there's also this dashboard and tooling.
00:03:35.736 - 00:04:05.552, Speaker A: And this is honestly what I think is the most exciting part about mode in that developers can just we can forget about all the marketing stuff and all the boring growth stuff and KPIs and all of there's what kind of stuff you have to give to VCs to get money. It's all going to be on the dashboard. It's going to be tools and stuff is there and you can just focus on building what you're building and it's going to grow and become a business for you, which is I think probably the most exciting thing about mode.
00:04:05.552 - 00:04:20.984, Speaker A: So today I kind of just want to go through like a deployment guide. It's just an EVM chain, so it's very easy to do just like any other EVM chain. I think Optimism just had a workshop there and he explained how this is going to work and it's basically the same.
00:04:20.984 - 00:04:30.332, Speaker A: There's just some extra steps because we are like a brand new chain still in half sales mode. So first thing you got to do is add mode to MetaMask. Obviously super simple.
00:04:30.332 - 00:04:36.616, Speaker A: We're on chain list. We are chain ID nine one nine. So just head on to Chainlist and go to Mode.
00:04:36.616 - 00:04:57.316, Speaker A: You can also just type in node instead of doing this link and then you get to add that to MetaMask if you want to do it manually. If you don't trust Chainlist, for whatever reason, you can find all the information you need for adding it to MetaMask inner docs docs mode network. There's some other resources and stuff there too for deployment guides and how mode works and the point of it and everything there too.
00:04:57.316 - 00:05:08.904, Speaker A: If you want to learn some more information after that you're going to need to get to Polia East. We don't have a faucet yet on mode so you only have a bridge. So if you just get to Polio, we also have some.
00:05:08.904 - 00:05:16.190, Speaker A: We can send it to you. Just message us on the discord or you can use this faucet. This is a good faucet by Alchemy Sepholiafosst.com.
00:05:16.190 - 00:05:26.140, Speaker A: After that you bridge Sepholia to mode. So just bridge mode network, super easy to use. Plug in how much you want to bridge over.
00:05:26.140 - 00:05:48.276, Speaker A: Make sure you are connected with your sepholia ethereum MetaMask and then we can also send you some as well if you don't want to go through this process, just send us a message on partner mode on Discord and we'll DM you and figure that all out and get you some mode east. So for deploying, it's just the same as anything else. All you have to do is put us into your config file.
00:05:48.276 - 00:06:04.104, Speaker A: So remix obviously super simple. As long as you're connected to mode on MetaMask, you just deploy using MetaMask and you can get your contract of mode. Hard hat add modes to hard hat config truffle add mode to truffle config.
00:06:04.104 - 00:06:09.564, Speaker A: Same as anything. We also have a guide online for Third web. We're working pretty closely with them.
00:06:09.564 - 00:06:32.500, Speaker A: We think they are just super awesome for getting stuff up and running. So if you want to use third web or any sort of other tool, just go onto our docs and you'll be able to see like a really easy guide for that. And yeah, you just have to generate an API key for them with mode network plugged in and then you're sorted.
00:06:32.500 - 00:06:50.232, Speaker A: So this is a pretty short presentation. I just kind of wanted to introduce mode to the world, which is like super exciting, but we are offering 10,000 USD after hackathon to some really cool Wacky projects. We just want you to build like cool stuff.
00:06:50.232 - 00:06:57.852, Speaker A: So we've got three k. Give us best overall that can be in any theme, anything. Like we just going to blow people away.
00:06:57.852 - 00:07:06.372, Speaker A: So that's three k for that two k. Best developer tool. Super important because we want to be building up an amazing developer ecosystem and user ecosystem.
00:07:06.372 - 00:07:13.968, Speaker A: Two k for best use of AI. AI I think is going to be a pretty huge theme of this hackathon. Seeing some of the other prizes as well.
00:07:13.968 - 00:07:24.612, Speaker A: So this can be as well like anything your heart desires for AI. Just want to see it integrated pretty well. And then we have two K for the most weird idea, which I'm excited for this too.
00:07:24.612 - 00:07:32.650, Speaker A: So anything that you can dream of that probably shouldn't be built, just build it. We just want to see like weird stuff. Crazy stuff.
00:07:32.650 - 00:07:41.144, Speaker A: Stuff that you maybe shouldn't exist but we want to make it exist so we have something for that too. Just be crazy. Make memes like do whatever you want.
00:07:41.144 - 00:07:44.556, Speaker A: Something that you've maybe thought of. That's a stupid idea. Just build it.
00:07:44.556 - 00:07:53.384, Speaker A: We want to see that. And then once you have the prize pool, you can see how to qualify for that online. Basically any project doesn't win any of the other prizes.
00:07:53.384 - 00:08:04.370, Speaker A: If you deploy on those, you're going to be eligible for the prize pool. Some ideas. Since we are a nuchin, we're pretty much interested in anything we have.
00:08:04.370 - 00:08:12.772, Speaker A: Not much so far deployed onto those. So we're looking for anything. Anything you want to build is going to be super awesome.
00:08:12.772 - 00:08:30.596, Speaker A: But these are some of the ideas that us as a team are just super into. So obviously integration of other projects we want to get cross chain, get some Oracles in there, get some Queries graph maybe and other sponsoring just make some interesting things there. Just on other chains we don't have it yet on mode.
00:08:30.596 - 00:08:43.244, Speaker A: So that would be so so awesome. Just to build this ecosystem identity system as well. Is going to be really important for mode main net as well because we're doing this reputation system and referral system.
00:08:43.244 - 00:09:00.852, Speaker A: How are we going to actually have civil resistance and identity on that chain. So something for that will be super interesting and something that we need data visualization. So obviously we are working on a dashboard so we do have some sort of high level data visualization but just more more and is obviously good.
00:09:00.852 - 00:09:07.984, Speaker A: So any sort of blockchain visualization tools. It looks awesome. We want it to just be attract users and stuff.
00:09:07.984 - 00:09:15.768, Speaker A: Love that kind of stuff. Decentralized exchanges, user focus kind of stuff like that. Innovative DeFi as well.
00:09:15.768 - 00:09:22.590, Speaker A: Stuff is also crazy. Like there's so much you could do in DeFi. Be crazy, be weird, be wacky with it.
00:09:22.590 - 00:09:28.636, Speaker A: Get some weird DeFi projects. I think that'd be really cool. You can also maybe integrate AI to that.
00:09:28.636 - 00:09:34.496, Speaker A: Get some user friendly DeFi. Could be interesting. Contraction anything of course.
00:09:34.496 - 00:09:47.812, Speaker A: Maybe like an AA wallet for mode. Something that's like themed after mode could be really cool. That's also probably a pretty huge theme of this hackathon then.
00:09:47.812 - 00:10:02.890, Speaker A: Just like we love games as well. I know the team has built a ton of blockchain based games and stuff and that's something that we're super into. So something that actually utilizes blockchain in a game pretty well and is just like weird and crazy.
00:10:02.890 - 00:10:13.468, Speaker A: You just thought of a game that no one would ever play that you think it's funny, give it a go. Or there's like Instagram ads that you always see that are just like weird games. They're funny, let's build that.
00:10:13.468 - 00:10:21.272, Speaker A: Build whatever you want. But we love games. Some other ideas for the AI prize combining AI and Dynamic NFTs.
00:10:21.272 - 00:10:36.224, Speaker A: We've seen AI integrated really well into previous ETH global hacks and people are doing some crazy stuff with it. You could just talk to a bunch in or you could use AI to do swaps and stuff. We've seen projects like that.
00:10:36.224 - 00:10:42.532, Speaker A: They're awesome. I haven't seen anything that actually combines AI with Dynamic NFTs. I think that's a really cool use case.
00:10:42.532 - 00:11:00.152, Speaker A: So something that does that creatively would be really cool. AI for gas prediction as well. You could maybe combine this with a kind abstraction and do like if you submit transaction to the chin it looks the chin, it's like okay well it's going to be cheapest if we do this in 20 minutes instead of nine.
00:11:00.152 - 00:11:08.008, Speaker A: So maybe you can just load it and then it kind of shacks in and then it gets onto the chin or something. It's cool. So tons of ideas.
00:11:08.008 - 00:11:42.688, Speaker A: We're also interested in ZK, didn't want to put it here because I don't think there's any ZK protocols actually sponsoring super hack, but having anything to do with privacy or knowledge groups on mode would be insane. Something I want to stress as well is that because we're all about trying to build developers, being entrepreneurs, and really build this ecosystem up, and because we are still very early stages of mode, we want to keep working with you. We want to turn you into entrepreneurs, we want to make your project successful.
00:11:42.688 - 00:11:51.320, Speaker A: And because of that, we're going to be offering grants to awesome projects that are built here. You guys are going to be the first people to go through our grant system. That's really exciting.
00:11:51.320 - 00:12:11.104, Speaker A: So if you're interested in that, when you're submitting a project into ETH Global, you'll be able to tick a box that says, we're interested in grants. So just make sure you tick that if you're interested in us reaching out to you, because we really want to get some awesome developers building awesome stuff on mode. That is it.
00:12:11.104 - 00:12:19.264, Speaker A: So a lot of time here. Most important thing is just to enjoy the hackathon. We are at partner mode on Discord.
00:12:19.264 - 00:12:26.310, Speaker A: In these global discord, come and say hi. We're always there, even if you're not like hackathon mode, just say hi. We want to support you anyway.
00:12:26.310 - 00:12:38.010, Speaker A: So, yeah, if anyone's got any questions, the Zoom chat is open. Feel free to send some stuff into there. Otherwise, I think this was pretty short.
00:12:40.940 - 00:12:42.236, Speaker B: Awesome. Cheers. Thank you.
00:12:42.236 - 00:13:12.680, Speaker B: Yeah, if anybody has any questions, feel free to type them in the chat or take yourself off mute and ask away. And if there are no questions, then, yeah, as Kat said, definitely reach out to the team on the Discord Channel. They will be there and happy to assist as you all progress through the hackathon over the next couple of days.
00:13:12.680 - 00:13:16.534, Speaker B: But yeah, I think that's it. So. Yeah.
00:13:16.534 - 00:13:27.390, Speaker B: Thanks, Kat. Thanks for the great workshop and presentation and yeah, thank you all, everybody else, for attending. Have a great rest of your Friday and have a great weekend and happy hacking.
00:13:28.850 - 00:13:31.550, Speaker A: Thanks, guys. Good luck.
00:13:31.970 - 00:13:32.814, Speaker B: Cheers. Thank you.
00:13:32.852 - 00:13:34.810, Speaker A: See you all in the discord. Bye.
