Because once you get here, you need to pretty much have an idea and a team, or else it's very easy to get discombobulated trying to find an idea, trying to find something everyone agrees on. So really the strategy starts before you even get here, and that's around finding a developer community that you can join. And that way you can find people where you can say, hey, who else is going to this hackathon? Let's start thinking about what we want to build so that when you get here, you already have this really succinct strategy, a really good idea, and you can kind of skip all the discombobulation that comes with trying to figure it all out here in the moment.
