00:03:52.892 - 00:03:54.166, Speaker A: That everything that we're going to be.
00:03:54.188 - 00:03:59.858, Speaker B: Doing over the next two days is going to be on Discord. So please make sure if you are.
00:03:59.884 - 00:04:01.386, Speaker A: A hacker, that you have gone to.
00:04:01.408 - 00:04:04.822, Speaker B: Your dashboard on Ethglobal.com and connected Discord.
00:04:04.886 - 00:04:06.922, Speaker A: Connecting Discord will give you access to.
00:04:06.976 - 00:04:09.398, Speaker B: All the Fevin private channels.
00:04:09.494 - 00:04:12.886, Speaker A: These channels are only available to people that are participating at the hackathon.
00:04:12.918 - 00:04:21.150, Speaker B: So if you are a hacker, you will have access to these. If you are a mentor, you will be able to see this as well. And you get to ask questions here.
00:04:21.220 - 00:04:24.510, Speaker A: And see everything that's happening on Discord.
00:04:25.410 - 00:04:26.858, Speaker B: If you want to just confirm if.
00:04:26.884 - 00:04:28.274, Speaker A: Everything is right, you should see that.
00:04:28.312 - 00:04:33.762, Speaker B: Hack Fev category on your left sidebar. So just quickly check if you can see this.
00:04:33.816 - 00:04:39.926, Speaker A: And this is where everything will be happening. We'll be making all the announcements, covering everything around, judging and all of the.
00:04:39.948 - 00:04:42.918, Speaker B: Prize info and mentorship is right here.
00:04:43.084 - 00:04:45.382, Speaker A: There's also a dedicated channel for getting.
00:04:45.436 - 00:04:47.160, Speaker B: Help, so you can just click on.

00:05:00.246 - 00:05:05.706, Speaker A: A lot of calendar invites for some important talks and workshops and things like judging and submission deadlines.
00:05:05.738 - 00:05:08.126, Speaker B: So don't worry, even if you are.
00:05:08.148 - 00:05:14.314, Speaker A: Currently sleeping, which you want to get to hear this, you'll know exactly when things are happening and they'll be normalized for your own time zone.
00:05:14.442 - 00:05:20.818, Speaker B: And the website is our source of truth, which means everything that's happening here this weekend is listed on the website.
00:05:20.904 - 00:05:22.466, Speaker A: Down to the minute and whatever the.
00:05:22.488 - 00:05:26.226, Speaker B: Website says is what's happening. So if things are running behind or.
00:05:26.248 - 00:05:29.654, Speaker A: Something changes, which it won't, you can.
00:05:29.692 - 00:05:31.206, Speaker B: Check out all of that directly by.
00:05:31.228 - 00:05:36.454, Speaker A: Heading over to the website. We really want this thing to be asynchronous and asynchronous possible.
00:05:36.492 - 00:05:38.546, Speaker B: We have 70 countries and 19 different time zones.
00:05:38.578 - 00:05:39.494, Speaker A: So we're going to try to make.
00:05:39.532 - 00:05:45.494, Speaker B: Sure that you are at your best set up to take advantage of this entire weekend.
00:05:45.622 - 00:05:47.306, Speaker A: And the only synchronous part here will.
00:05:47.328 - 00:05:49.258, Speaker B: Be Sunday judging, which I'll talk about.
00:05:49.344 - 00:05:50.730, Speaker A: To make sure that we can all.
00:05:50.800 - 00:05:58.922, Speaker B: See and enjoy what everybody built. And as a reminder, the website is Fevm Ethglobal.com or FBM.
00:05:58.922 - 00:06:05.026, Speaker B: Ethglobal.com also works. All right, so how does the hackathon work? So this is a unique event for.
00:06:05.048 - 00:06:07.922, Speaker C: Us because this event is a large.
00:06:07.976 - 00:06:13.938, Speaker B: Introduction to hundreds of you to really explore what this virtual machine can do.
00:06:14.104 - 00:06:15.474, Speaker A: And as part of that, the most.
00:06:15.512 - 00:06:18.466, Speaker C: Common question I got was what can.
00:06:18.488 - 00:06:20.374, Speaker A: I do here and how is this.
00:06:20.412 - 00:06:23.206, Speaker B: Different than all the other events we've done? So I'm going to cover all of.
00:06:23.228 - 00:06:24.840, Speaker C: That in a second.
00:06:25.530 - 00:06:27.734, Speaker B: So officially the hackathon has kicked off.
00:06:27.772 - 00:06:28.966, Speaker A: Which means you can start working on.
00:06:28.988 - 00:06:33.466, Speaker B: Your projects now and you have 48 hours to build anything that you are.
00:06:33.488 - 00:06:35.418, Speaker A: Interested in and get to demo and.
00:06:35.424 - 00:06:40.682, Speaker B: Present that to our judges on Sunday. You can work on a project with a team.
00:06:40.736 - 00:06:41.946, Speaker A: If you are working with somebody on.
00:06:41.968 - 00:06:47.086, Speaker B: A team, your team can have up to five members and it is also totally okay to work on your own.
00:06:47.108 - 00:06:48.910, Speaker A: You don't necessarily have to have a team.
00:06:48.980 - 00:06:53.860, Speaker B: You can have one person on a team, or two, three, four or five.
00:06:54.310 - 00:06:58.686, Speaker C: The submission deadline is 12:00 p.m. Eastern.
00:06:58.878 - 00:07:11.474, Speaker B: Sunday, November the 20th. In relative time, that is 47 hours and 40 minutes from me saying this sentence. So we'll be giving ample reminders just to make sure nobody has any confusion.
00:07:11.522 - 00:07:12.930, Speaker A: Around the time zone normalization.
00:07:13.010 - 00:07:15.686, Speaker B: But you have 48 hours before everything.
00:07:15.788 - 00:07:18.470, Speaker C: Is due from a submission standpoint.
00:07:18.890 - 00:07:31.722, Speaker B: Now, let's get to the question that we've been asked the most. What can I build this event is to highlight that. The most important thing piece here is that for this event Fem is EVM compatible.
00:07:31.786 - 00:07:33.754, Speaker A: You get to use everything from tooling.
00:07:33.802 - 00:07:39.950, Speaker B: To libraries to your dev tools to existing code all out of the box.
00:07:40.100 - 00:07:42.666, Speaker A: And really deploy things that take advantage.
00:07:42.698 - 00:07:44.818, Speaker B: Of storage as a primitive now with.
00:07:44.904 - 00:07:48.882, Speaker C: Solidity and smart contracts and that gives.
00:07:48.936 - 00:07:50.754, Speaker A: You access to a lot more new.
00:07:50.792 - 00:07:53.170, Speaker B: Things that were previously not possible before.
00:07:53.320 - 00:07:55.518, Speaker A: You have a lot of new, unique, interesting applications.
00:07:55.534 - 00:07:57.138, Speaker B: On decentralized compute you can do a.
00:07:57.144 - 00:08:01.238, Speaker A: Lot more interesting integrations. With Ethereum you have a lot of.
00:08:01.244 - 00:08:02.246, Speaker B: Stuff that you can do that is.
00:08:02.268 - 00:08:20.922, Speaker A: Specifically native to filecoin on retrieval markets and storage derivatives or replication workers and data availability, or just renewing contracts based on conditional logic. You can automatically now make cross chain applications possible that take advantage of the filecoin virtual machine and different chains. And there's a lot of stuff around.
00:08:20.976 - 00:08:27.310, Speaker B: Data dows and integrating with content and data to be now programmable. There's a lot of room here for.
00:08:27.380 - 00:08:32.666, Speaker A: Really creative and impressive and interesting ideas, especially that now that you have EVM.
00:08:32.698 - 00:08:43.394, Speaker B: Compatibility and you get to use a lot of things that you already know to how to do on Solidity and on Ethereum. And the big most important thing to.
00:08:43.432 - 00:08:45.474, Speaker A: Remember is that experimentation is okay.
00:08:45.512 - 00:08:49.206, Speaker B: This is a 48 hours event. We know that you can't do too.
00:08:49.228 - 00:08:50.966, Speaker A: Much in this short time, and that.
00:08:50.988 - 00:08:53.042, Speaker B: Is totally expected and known.
00:08:53.186 - 00:08:54.886, Speaker A: And we really want to encourage all.
00:08:54.908 - 00:09:03.306, Speaker B: Of you to start small. This is okay for you to have a large idea and only get halfway through implementing some of those pieces that.
00:09:03.328 - 00:09:05.926, Speaker A: You wanted to do on Sunday or by Sunday.
00:09:06.038 - 00:09:07.978, Speaker B: So don't try to finish too much.
00:09:08.064 - 00:09:14.358, Speaker A: And compromise on anything from sleep to rest to just making sure that you are well suited to really function and.
00:09:14.384 - 00:09:15.934, Speaker B: Do things that you're excited about.
00:09:16.052 - 00:09:19.134, Speaker A: And because you're also going to be trying this thing for the first time.
00:09:19.252 - 00:09:34.546, Speaker B: The goal is to really explore the possibilities of ideas and really make sure that you can see what can be possible and use now after Sunday to really continue building those projects. So starting small is also okay. If you have a grand idea, you.
00:09:34.568 - 00:09:35.974, Speaker A: Can just aim to finish a few.
00:09:36.012 - 00:09:38.840, Speaker B: Features for it over the next 48 hours.
00:09:40.650 - 00:09:44.006, Speaker C: And one other important thing here is.
00:09:44.028 - 00:09:45.414, Speaker B: That we really want to make sure.
00:09:45.452 - 00:09:48.326, Speaker C: That FVM gets better.
00:09:48.428 - 00:09:51.366, Speaker A: And Fathom is an exciting runtime for.
00:09:51.388 - 00:09:56.826, Speaker B: People to build cool integrations, leveraging storage. So one of the other highlights that.
00:09:56.848 - 00:09:59.446, Speaker A: We want to bring up here and make sure that we get to prioritize.
00:09:59.478 - 00:10:05.482, Speaker B: Is that if you think something could be better, you get to actually actively improve the protocol and the runtime.
00:10:05.546 - 00:10:07.038, Speaker A: And the feedback that we're going to.
00:10:07.044 - 00:10:12.666, Speaker B: Get here helps everything get really even better for the next set of builders.
00:10:12.858 - 00:10:14.734, Speaker A: And if you are interested in doing.
00:10:14.772 - 00:10:19.330, Speaker B: Something more than just playing with this over the weekend, there's also an early builders program.
00:10:19.480 - 00:10:23.170, Speaker A: You can see that on the Fem FalcoIn IO website.
00:10:23.320 - 00:10:31.974, Speaker B: So if you're interested in taking a project further, there's direct support and a next batch of builders program cohort that you get to be part of to.
00:10:32.012 - 00:10:36.342, Speaker A: Get direct feedback, advice and integrations and.
00:10:36.396 - 00:10:49.866, Speaker B: Just work with amazing people that are building similar things on the same platform. All right, so let's go into some of the key other pieces. Rules and Criteria so this event is going to be slightly different as part.
00:10:49.888 - 00:10:50.874, Speaker A: Of being an equal event.
00:10:50.912 - 00:10:55.006, Speaker B: The rules and criteria are fairly straightforward for all of our events, which is.
00:10:55.028 - 00:10:56.158, Speaker A: Everything that we're going to be doing.
00:10:56.244 - 00:11:01.214, Speaker B: Must be done from scratch. And you cannot build on a preexisting personal project.
00:11:01.412 - 00:11:02.686, Speaker A: We want to make sure things are.
00:11:02.708 - 00:11:10.914, Speaker B: Fair to everybody that's participating from across the world. So adding things to something you've been doing for months or weeks or even.
00:11:10.952 - 00:11:13.522, Speaker A: Days in your own free time on a personal project.
00:11:13.656 - 00:11:15.842, Speaker B: Makes things kind of hard to really.
00:11:15.896 - 00:11:18.978, Speaker A: Assess and keeps things a bit unfair.
00:11:19.074 - 00:11:36.294, Speaker B: However, we are going to be making one exception here for this hackathon, and that exception is that if you are trying to port one of your existing solidity projects to be compatible and run on Fem or Fevim, you get to do that and that is allowed.
00:11:36.342 - 00:11:37.642, Speaker A: And that means we get to really.
00:11:37.696 - 00:11:40.394, Speaker C: See how compatibility works here.
00:11:40.432 - 00:11:41.806, Speaker B: We get to explore how we can.
00:11:41.828 - 00:11:48.346, Speaker A: Do interesting integrations between two blockchains or two or more blockchains, and that piece is allowed.
00:11:48.378 - 00:11:49.946, Speaker B: So if you are interested in porting.
00:11:49.978 - 00:11:53.690, Speaker C: Something that you've done before to entirely.
00:11:53.770 - 00:11:56.874, Speaker B: This new runtime, that will be allowed.
00:11:56.922 - 00:11:59.026, Speaker A: And there may be some education and nuances here.
00:11:59.048 - 00:12:00.670, Speaker B: So if you are in this category.
00:12:00.830 - 00:12:01.858, Speaker A: Just send us a ping and we'll.
00:12:01.864 - 00:12:03.778, Speaker B: Be able to clarify this for you.
00:12:03.944 - 00:12:05.154, Speaker A: The other piece I want to be.
00:12:05.192 - 00:12:20.354, Speaker B: Really cognizant of is that only RSVP attendees can win prizes, which means that if you are working on a team, please make sure that your team members are listed under your team's section on your dashboard.
00:12:20.402 - 00:12:21.526, Speaker A: If they do not show up and.
00:12:21.548 - 00:12:23.698, Speaker B: If you win a prize, then we.
00:12:23.724 - 00:12:25.450, Speaker A: Will not be giving prizes to anybody.
00:12:25.520 - 00:12:34.358, Speaker B: Who is not listed as a team member. So you have today to just really make sure that all that is ironed out and that all of your team members show up on your dashboard.
00:12:34.534 - 00:12:35.950, Speaker A: And if you have any other questions.
00:12:36.020 - 00:12:37.326, Speaker B: That we haven't addressed, you can ask.
00:12:37.348 - 00:12:40.606, Speaker A: Them directly here on Apclobal TV Chat. And I'll be able to look at.
00:12:40.628 - 00:12:50.062, Speaker B: This right now or ask us this on Discord or email or any other way you can contact us. We'll be monitoring all those channels. All right, let's talk about judging.
00:12:50.062 - 00:12:55.206, Speaker B: How is all of this going to be set up? So the most important thing here is.
00:12:55.228 - 00:13:00.098, Speaker C: That submissions are due on Sunday, 12:00 p.m. Eastern.
00:13:00.194 - 00:13:05.080, Speaker B: That is in relative time, 47 hours and 30 minutes from now.
00:13:07.450 - 00:13:12.514, Speaker C: This will all be done through your hacker dashboard.
00:13:12.562 - 00:13:15.258, Speaker A: So if you just go to Eigthgoba.com, you'll be logged in and you'll be.
00:13:15.264 - 00:13:22.494, Speaker B: Able to see where to submit. You'll see all the information that you need to do. And once a submission is done from.
00:13:22.532 - 00:13:25.406, Speaker C: Your side, you will have to go.
00:13:25.428 - 00:13:32.926, Speaker B: Through the main judging process. The main judging kicks off immediately after submissions are due, which means that as.
00:13:32.948 - 00:13:34.910, Speaker A: You are submitting, you will be told.
00:13:34.980 - 00:13:36.242, Speaker B: What the next steps are.
00:13:36.296 - 00:13:37.826, Speaker A: And we'll do a first come, first.
00:13:37.848 - 00:13:45.074, Speaker B: Serve basis for assigning a judging room to all of the teams. You will get to present what you.
00:13:45.112 - 00:13:47.694, Speaker A: Built to an amazing set of judges.
00:13:47.822 - 00:13:54.680, Speaker B: And then in parallel, all the prizes will be judged asynchronously from the protocol labs and the IPFS team.
00:13:55.130 - 00:13:58.006, Speaker A: And if they have any questions, they'll be able to ping you directly on.
00:13:58.028 - 00:14:01.062, Speaker B: Discord, but project judging for any prizes.
00:14:01.126 - 00:14:03.178, Speaker A: Is going to be asynchronous and in.
00:14:03.184 - 00:14:17.566, Speaker B: The background while the main judging is going on. Now, here is how the judging works. After you submit your project, you'll be told to get to a Zoom room, where you will be assigned a room for our judges, who you will be presenting to.
00:14:17.566 - 00:14:20.494, Speaker B: You will get seven minutes in total.
00:14:20.692 - 00:14:22.538, Speaker A: To present to one of our judges.
00:14:22.634 - 00:14:26.980, Speaker B: And that is broken down into three minutes for questions and four minutes for a demo.
00:14:27.750 - 00:14:31.106, Speaker A: You are allowed to make a live demo happen, which means you get to.
00:14:31.128 - 00:14:36.530, Speaker B: Share your screen directly on Zoom and demo what you built. You will still get four minutes.
00:14:36.600 - 00:14:38.114, Speaker A: We'll cut everybody off on the four.
00:14:38.152 - 00:14:40.038, Speaker B: Minute mark because there's a lot of.
00:14:40.044 - 00:14:41.046, Speaker A: Projects that we have to do in.
00:14:41.068 - 00:15:02.186, Speaker B: A really short amount of time, and then the next remaining time will be moved over for Q A. We really recommend that you record a video of your demo instead of trying to do everything live. If you get the time, try to just quickly record a screen share of your demo up to four minutes and submit that as part of your submission process.
00:15:02.186 - 00:15:05.246, Speaker B: Because if something goes wrong or something takes time, or if you're trying to.
00:15:05.268 - 00:15:06.558, Speaker A: Do some main net transactions on a.
00:15:06.564 - 00:15:08.880, Speaker B: Blockchain that's going to take a little bit longer.
00:15:09.490 - 00:15:11.246, Speaker A: You want to be cognizant of the.
00:15:11.268 - 00:15:13.502, Speaker B: Fact that you still have four minutes in total.
00:15:13.636 - 00:15:15.422, Speaker A: And if something goes wrong, at least.
00:15:15.476 - 00:15:24.014, Speaker B: This backup works really well for everybody else to also see what you did and spent all this weekend working on. So really don't do this last minute.
00:15:24.062 - 00:15:26.606, Speaker A: If you're listening here, I really encourage.
00:15:26.638 - 00:15:29.334, Speaker C: You to at least take 1 hour.
00:15:29.372 - 00:15:30.854, Speaker A: In total to make sure you have.
00:15:30.892 - 00:15:37.618, Speaker B: All the stuff for submission in the form worked out as well as a demo recorded as a backup.
00:15:37.714 - 00:15:40.262, Speaker C: In case the live demo doesn't work.
00:15:40.316 - 00:15:43.578, Speaker B: Last minute, all these details are going to be on your dashboard, so you.
00:15:43.584 - 00:15:45.722, Speaker A: Don'T have to worry too much about remembering any of this.
00:15:45.776 - 00:15:50.998, Speaker B: We'll be prompting with a lot of this thing, from calendar invites to discord messages to just your dashboard, really telling.
00:15:51.014 - 00:15:52.460, Speaker C: You what the next step is.
00:15:53.150 - 00:15:57.374, Speaker B: The other important piece is that there's a lot of prizes that we're giving.
00:15:57.412 - 00:15:58.398, Speaker A: And I'm going to cover a lot.
00:15:58.404 - 00:16:18.142, Speaker B: Of them in a couple of minutes. And when you are trying to win any of these prizes, make sure you select that you are trying to win those prizes as well, and in that submission form, and only if you select that is when the IPFS and filecoin team will know that we have to evaluate your prizes.
00:16:18.286 - 00:16:20.518, Speaker C: So if you forget that, there's no.
00:16:20.524 - 00:16:21.718, Speaker A: Other way for somebody to know that.
00:16:21.724 - 00:16:28.662, Speaker B: You wanted to be eligible for a particular category of prize. So make sure that you do forget. Don't forget to check that box.
00:16:28.662 - 00:16:33.238, Speaker B: And do remember to check it. All right. And of course, there's a lot of.

00:16:47.882 - 00:17:01.698, Speaker B: For everybody with any skill set. This has an intentional goal around onboarding a lot of existing developers into Web Three and we have amazing content and plans for how do we onboard a.
00:17:01.704 - 00:17:03.714, Speaker A: Lot of beginners and also make this.
00:17:03.752 - 00:17:06.754, Speaker B: Equally interesting for anybody who's been in this space for a long time.
00:17:06.872 - 00:17:08.594, Speaker A: That means there's a lot of talks and workshops.

00:19:34.344 - 00:19:35.602, Speaker A: This is a double opt in.
00:19:35.656 - 00:19:38.340, Speaker B: So if you are looking to be.
00:19:38.710 - 00:19:42.614, Speaker A: Found on this database, you have to go onto your hacker dashboard and check.
