00:00:07.530 - 00:00:19.150, Speaker A: Hi, good afternoon everyone. I'm waka itagake from Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of the Japanese government. I'm a deputy director at the WEBC Policy Office.
00:00:19.150 - 00:00:50.172, Speaker A: I'm honored to be here and then today I'm glad to see a lot of engineer overseas coming to Japan to build something late in web sleeve. And then today I want to make a presentation about Japanese government's efforts towards web Three and then how startups or engineers overseas can collaborate with Japan. So Japanese government as a whole is already committed to the promotion of Webster.
00:00:50.172 - 00:01:24.504, Speaker A: Applying, Minister Kishida made a speech in London to promote the Web Three. Also a lot of Japanese official documents already mentioned web sleeve as a key driver for innovation and we are already committed to create a better business innovation environment to promote this kind of great new technology. This kind of efforts has started from the request from politicians.
00:01:24.504 - 00:01:54.884, Speaker A: Actually LDP, Japan's ruling party set up a project team focused on Web Three and then they published White paper that listed up all the policy issues we need to tackle to promote the web Three. And then that is why web Three has taken off in Japan. We METI established a policy office focused on web Three.
00:01:54.884 - 00:02:52.520, Speaker A: Like inside the government, like there is regulatory authority, like financial subs like digital agency but Mandy is a kind of pusher of web Three inside the government and then from the standpoint of the business or industry we are now talking with regulatory authority and tax authority as well. As you may already know, there is increasing interest in Web Three from large corporations of Japan. Kdang is the biggest industry group which consists of Japanese large corporations has published a paper that make proposal to the government that like hey, we are already interested in the web Three but like hey Japanese government, let's try to make a better environment.
00:02:52.520 - 00:03:44.600, Speaker A: Also Docomo has announced that they will invest 5 billion USD over the next five years. Also there are a lot of It companies, IP holders, financial institutions they are already started the discussion to what they can do in this space. So why web Three is barely hot in Japan? One of the reasons is that web Three is barely compatible to Japan's strengths and then it's expected to generate significant economic value in cultural and economic domains like the content, sports, games and arts.
00:03:44.600 - 00:04:23.190, Speaker A: And as you already know, Japan has rich culture and a lot of IPS. So a lot of companies are interested in how NFTs or Tokens can be utilized when they push their businesses. So how is the Japanese government trying to promote web sleep? Japanese government as a whole has a responsibility to create a better business environment but like in a more responsible way.
00:04:23.190 - 00:05:31.100, Speaker A: Financial service agency need to do a kind of consumer protection and then some relevant agency need to protect existing IPS. But as a whole we will tackle a lot of policy issues including tax system, legal issues, regulations, accounting issues and others. METI especially is focused on financial regulation, tax system reform and accounting issues human resource Development this year, together with the Financial Service Agency, we created new regulations guidelines which clarify the scope of digital assets which enable the utilization of NFTs and also we have achieved the new tax reform that made token insurance more easier.
00:05:31.100 - 00:05:56.660, Speaker A: In addition to Japan's rich cultures, japanese government's efforts there is a reason why Japan is a good place to do crypto business. As you already know, United States or other countries is now trying to tightening regulation. But Japan has already set up a high level of regulation.
00:05:56.660 - 00:06:36.240, Speaker A: That's why Japan's FTX custom assets was separately managed and then there was no damage because of FTX or other incidents. So now Japanese government is trying to create a better business environment where the regulation is already in place. So we can create more like safe secure clip environment? I think so how startups or engineers overseas can collaborate with Japan? Maybe one way is to work with Japanese large corporations.
00:06:36.240 - 00:07:19.310, Speaker A: I think a lot of Japanese corporations are already interested in web Three but they don't know what to do and they don't have any skills network and also they actually are kind of serious. So they want to see some proposal which beyond speculation, the business proposal which will create some values to the society and also some sustainable business income cash flow. Also moving to Japan to start a business can be an option as well.
00:07:19.310 - 00:07:53.988, Speaker A: We have Startup Visa and then if you go to municipalities like Shibuya, Guokas and Ikyoto, they will support you to start the business. Also, East Global is already a very good international conference but we are expecting to have more upcoming international conferences this year. Japan Blockchain Week it's going to be happening like June, July and also webex it's going to be happening in July 20 526.
00:07:53.988 - 00:08:05.244, Speaker A: So if you can come to this place, there will be a lot of Japanese people like Japanese large corporations. So maybe you can start the conversation as well. Yeah.
00:08:05.244 - 00:08:17.884, Speaker A: For more information, we published a paper which summarized the government's point of view towards Web Three. Yeah. Please feel free to contact us.
00:08:17.884 - 00:08:18.990, Speaker A: Thank you.
