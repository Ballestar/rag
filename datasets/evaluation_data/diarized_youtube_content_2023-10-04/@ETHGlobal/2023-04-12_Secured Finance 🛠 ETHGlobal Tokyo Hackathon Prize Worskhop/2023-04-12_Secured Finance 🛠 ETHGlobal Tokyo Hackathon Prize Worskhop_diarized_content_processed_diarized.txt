00:00:06.170 - 00:00:40.860, Speaker A: Hello Ruben, Ness Media. Yeah, today we're gonna do the workshop for the Is Global Togo hackathon to explain the price, what kind of price we're gonna issue and before go to the price, let's share my screen and introduce what secure Finance. Yeah guys, nice meeting you everyone. My name is Timo Lee, community lead at Secure Finance. And today we have friends. Ruben, could you introduce yourself?
00:00:41.230 - 00:00:56.238, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Thank you Timur. Hello everyone. So I'm Ruben Abulcair. I'm Director of Engineering at Secured Finance. I'm basically leading the development team for Secured Finance. Great.
00:00:56.324 - 00:01:44.830, Speaker A: Yeah, secure Finance actually born from East Global hackathon, it was back to 2020. The first hack FS, our founder and the CEO Masa joined the hack FS as a hacker in 2020. That was the first file coin and Is global hackathon. And we won the best price of DeFi from protocols Ethereum Foundation. So after two years or two or three years we come back to the hackathon. We sponsored hackathon the hecfs hack money that was online. And this is first time we are sponsoring East Global Tokyo hackathon in Japan.
00:01:44.830 - 00:02:56.500, Speaker A: So quick introduce to Secure Finance platform and our solutions. We are building the audiobook based lending market. It means we are building yield curve based lending market. By having yield curve we can build the FX forward market and we can provide hedging solutions for traders, for users and the ultimate goal is to build derivatives market in the cryptocurrency space. This is decentralized derivatives market what we don't see in the cryptocurrency space yet. Yeah, so you see my screen and this is Secure Finance lending platform UI. So currently we are at testnet stage and we have been implemented decentralized lending and borrowing solution for major forecurrencies bitcoin Ether filecoin and stablecoin USDC.
00:02:56.500 - 00:03:12.024, Speaker A: So the current platform is audible based lending solution and we provide zero coupon loan market. We also provide the feature of a smart contract clearing contraband and auto redemption.
00:03:12.072 - 00:03:12.456, Speaker B: Rolling.
00:03:12.488 - 00:03:17.336, Speaker A: So Ruben, would you like to explain more about these four features?
00:03:17.528 - 00:04:20.428, Speaker B: Yes, of course. So those four features are really what differentiators from other DeFi protocol. The order book based lending means that we use an order book system for price discovery contrary to something a pool system like Ave for instance, we let user place order at the rate they want or the price they want. And when we have someone who want to accept this order, we have a match and the order is taken. This is basically what is used in the traditional finance world. It's what is happening when you buy stock online. For instance, the zero coupon loan market indicates that our products are simple fixed term loan.
00:04:20.428 - 00:05:20.384, Speaker B: So for instance, you see here June 2023 in our screenshot of our UI. It means that at this date this is the maturity of the product. So if you borrow at this date, we need to pay back what you borrowed at exactly at this date. The smart contract clearing counterparty is what make a DeFi protocol. A DeFi protocol. We creating this security where the users need to deposit collateral before borrowing and our smart contract is checking that this collateral is still enough and if it's not, it's going to clear the user position. And finally the auto redemption rolling means that when your term is finished, it's automatically rolled into a new term.
00:05:20.384 - 00:05:26.390, Speaker B: So you can basically lend or borrow and forget and it will accrue your interest.
00:05:27.340 - 00:06:15.376, Speaker A: Great, yeah, thank you. Let's go to the next page. Yeah, I think for hackers and developers or programmers who is joining is Global toko hackathon and we provide some userful links like landing page. On the landing page you can check out the take, your finance vision and the mission and a short intro to the team members and links to many trading platform or blogs. And most important the testnet. It's a staging environment, we deploy it on the Goily network. So yeah, you should check out staging network and Filset.
00:06:15.376 - 00:07:10.708, Speaker A: So yeah, we provide lending solution for four major currencies bitcoin ether filecoin and stablecoin USDC. You can mint the test coin, test token on the file set network and the GitHub. So check out the GitHub. You can see the intro to the secret finance protocol and smart contract, some documentations and abi SDKs. If you want to read more articles about secret finance, go to the medium. If you want to receive the latest updates, please follow the secure finance Twitter. Yeah, we issued three prize top DeFi, best UI and the UX and Excellent finance awards.
00:07:10.708 - 00:08:43.030, Speaker A: So three prizes, the first two top DeFi and UX UI is the engineering topic. So it means you should submit code, you should implement some features by programming and third one, it could be non engineering submission so you can submit some research, analysis and documentations. Yeah, let's deep dive into the survey price and potential topics. Top DeFi awards we issue 2000 US dollar price so you can build on top of secret finance protocol and yeah, we provide SDK protocol APIs and through these APIs you can interact with the secure finance protocol and you also can propose filecoin east breezing solution. So I see community is building, the filecoin is breaching solutions. But of course if you have better idea of bridging the cross chains, you can propose some solutions about that and liquidation bot using existing smart contract. So Ruben, would you like to explain more about the first price?
00:08:44.600 - 00:08:54.004, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So basically this first price is to build on top of our existing protocol. As you said, we provide those API.
00:08:54.052 - 00:08:55.450, Speaker A: Spy so.
00:08:57.820 - 00:09:22.850, Speaker B: You can interact with the smart contract. I think a good example here is the liquidation bot. We have all the functions on the smart contract to check if users are over the limit and to do the liquidation itself. But we need something around this.
00:09:25.140 - 00:09:25.456, Speaker A: To.
00:09:25.478 - 00:09:33.788, Speaker B: Be able to trigger this liquidation that would be really a good example. Yeah, this is the top DeFi.
00:09:33.964 - 00:10:24.388, Speaker A: Sounds good. For the second part, the best UI and the UX awards, we issue 1500. The goal of this price is to improve the trading experience on our platform. So what we are missing is the historical yield curve. So as hacker, you can propose and implement historical yard curve and I think third one, product composition interface. So if you are available, if you have understanding of order book based trading platform and you can propose a carrier trade strategy. So, Ruben, would you like to explain more about the second price?
00:10:24.474 - 00:11:16.016, Speaker B: Yeah, so as we said, this one is really to improve the trading experience. So we will show you you already saw a screenshot, but we will show you the staging environment we have with our current interface. What we are interested here is something a bit more complicated than what we offer. For instance, the project proposition interface is how can you make it easy and user friendly to do two trades at the same time. So borrowing six months and lending three months, for instance, it's called an interest rate carry trade. It's not easy to make it user friendly. And we provide those bricks the borrow of six months and the lead of three months in the smart contract, obviously.
00:11:16.016 - 00:11:31.580, Speaker B: But yeah, that's what would be interesting. Same with the yield curve. Right now we provide on the website, on the application only the current yield curve, but we would be very interested to see an historical yield curve.
00:11:32.080 - 00:12:26.830, Speaker A: Sounds good. Yeah. The third one, as we mentioned before, could be non engineering submission. So you can propose any kind of financial new ideas like financial data analysis and if you are familiar with trading or like quant trading, you can propose trading system modeling or new strategy is welcome and some market data research. So please provide your insight, your expertise and professional knowledge about the trading system especially. So please submit some financial innovations to our platform.
00:12:27.200 - 00:12:55.910, Speaker B: Yeah, since we are order book based system, you can basically apply things which are already done in the traditional finance into the crypto world. So maybe you have ideas of trading strategy, of possible arbitrage. All of this can be very helpful. So yeah, please submit your ideas. Great.
00:12:56.520 - 00:13:24.268, Speaker A: Yeah. Please keep in your mind these three topics. And now let's go to the UI. I think Ruben prepared live demo on the staging environment. So Ruben, please share your screen. And the next I think we can explain a little bit about documentation and protocol SDK. We call it blockchain abi.
00:13:24.268 - 00:13:26.610, Speaker A: Ruben, share your screen please.
00:13:29.060 - 00:14:01.420, Speaker B: Yes. All right. So this is our staging environment. You have the address on the slide. It's STG secure finance and this is how it looks. We recently deployed this changing environment for our users and we are very excited for you to try it and to see it. So, first of all, when you arrive, you need to connect your wallet.
00:14:01.420 - 00:14:45.756, Speaker B: You connect your wallet? It is on go early desk network. So you really need to be on goali or it won't work. It is deployed there and you arrive on this page. This is what we call our simple lending and borrowing experience. You are able here to place a borrow order or lending order, a market order, meaning that you will accept any rates and you will be able to fill your order like this. So for instance, here, let's say I want to borrow ten. Final call here, panic here I click on ten.
00:14:45.756 - 00:15:26.008, Speaker B: Here I'll borrow, I confirm my order. My MetaMask is popping, I hope you can see it. The gas fees are quite expensive today, but I'm accepting and the order should be placed once the transaction is validated. Just bear with me a few seconds here to have the order validated here success. Click on OK. And I actually borrowed ten falcon. You could see.
00:15:26.008 - 00:15:52.944, Speaker B: Yeah, but I'd add a lot of falcon so you can't really see. I had ten more, but I did borrow. So, as I say borrow on land. Here you have our advanced experience. This experience showed the order book. We talked about it a lot, the order book, and it allows you to place a limit order. So in limit order, it's an order when you choose the price you want.
00:15:52.944 - 00:16:37.410, Speaker B: So here, let's say we want 92. I will be in this order. I will leave my order in this order book with the price of 92. And if someone wants to borrowing to lend at 92, the order will be done asynchronously. So I'm not going to go through all the different features here. I just wanted to show you a quick look. You can find on our Medium articles, several article explaining or user guide explaining how to use the application and we're happy for you to read those.
00:16:37.410 - 00:17:10.212, Speaker B: However, I want to mention one point is the Faucet. So here you have the Faucet. We also gave you the link before. This Faucet allows you to mint our test token. So we have a test file, coin test, USDC and a test by Bitcoin. When you mint them, you're going to add them automatically to your wallet and you will be able to lend and borrow. I say that because our protocol right now in this environment is using only those tokens.
00:17:10.212 - 00:17:25.456, Speaker B: So if you need to interact with those tokens, if you need to interact with our smart contracts for your desk, when you do some development, you need those tokens. So you will need to come and get those tokens. Yeah.
00:17:25.638 - 00:17:51.130, Speaker A: Ruben, quick question here relates to the second price UIUX, right? Like historical yield curve or like product composition interface. So for hackers, what do you think they can propose to the current platform or improve the current platform user experience.
00:17:53.180 - 00:18:32.870, Speaker B: So what we need right now is a way to do this. So we're not opening our code of our interface right now. We're not ready for that. Not live yet. But you can see our interface and what we are able to see. So for instance, here you have the current yield curve by different currency, the rates, but those are the current rates. So if some hacker have an idea how we could display historical rates or historical yield curve, that would be great.
00:18:32.870 - 00:19:04.480, Speaker B: Same with the advanced mode here. CEO, I borrow only to borrow for one product. But what if I want to lend December 23 and borrow September 23? There must be very good ways and user experience to do that. And this is the kind of contribution we're looking for, some kind of user experience to do these kind of things.
00:19:04.630 - 00:19:11.280, Speaker A: Yeah, makes sense. Great. Ruben, let's jump to the GitHub.
00:19:11.780 - 00:20:01.040, Speaker B: Yes. Okay, so right now, as I said, we open source our APIs in the smart contract. So we have here when you arrive to the secured finance GitHub page, which is already also in the slide, you can see our SF smart contract. In this file you have the deployments files, which are the APIs, which gives you all the information to interact with the smart contract. So those are also the abis of our staging environment. So this contract here you were interacting are the same one here. So you have the deployment files added.
00:20:01.040 - 00:20:28.696, Speaker B: We also added our documentation. So this documentation gives you insight of all the methods we have in the smart contract. For instance, I will go to the lending market controller. You have a short description and you have the functions and the arguments and what they do. So this can be very useful for you to understand our smart contract and.
00:20:28.718 - 00:20:30.084, Speaker A: To be able to call the right.
00:20:30.142 - 00:20:53.840, Speaker B: Function of what you need to do. Yeah, and that's it. This is here in the SF smart contract. As I said, this is right now the only open source repository we have. We are not yet in a place when we can open source the rest. But it should arrive soon, but after the architect.
00:20:54.360 - 00:21:08.368, Speaker A: Yes. So by showing the staging environment, platform and GitHub, I think we explain the first and the second price possibilities.
00:21:08.464 - 00:21:09.012, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:09.146 - 00:22:02.440, Speaker A: Top DeFi and the best UIUX, especially for third one, like excellent finance award. I think hackers can go to the Medium article or landing page to discover more about what we are building. So there is more useful documentations. Please check out the Medium blog and the landing page and propose your financial data analysis or some trading strategy. So yeah, of course you can do modeling using Python program language. Or it could be non engineering, non programming submission. So we hope everyone can enjoy the time in Tokyo hackathon.
00:22:02.440 - 00:22:26.640, Speaker A: And lastly, I would like to say to hackers, please come to the workshop space in the venue. There's going to be a workshop space and we will be there. We want to talk to you, interact with you, and also learn from you guys. So let's meet in Tokyo.
00:22:27.460 - 00:22:35.484, Speaker B: Yeah. And if you have any questions, there technical and help. We will be here also to help and guide you.
00:22:35.622 - 00:22:58.950, Speaker A: Yeah. As you can see, the GitHub open source ratio is a little bit low because we deployed the testnet last month. So we are doing our best. So if you want to learn more about protocol, please come to us in the workshop space.
00:23:01.280 - 00:23:02.684, Speaker B: Thank you. Great.
00:23:02.802 - 00:23:03.772, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:23:03.906 - 00:23:05.640, Speaker B: Thank you. Bye, Timo.
