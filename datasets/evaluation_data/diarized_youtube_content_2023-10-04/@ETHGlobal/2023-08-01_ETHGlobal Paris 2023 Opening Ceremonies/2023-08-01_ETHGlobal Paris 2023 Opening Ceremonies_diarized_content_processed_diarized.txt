00:00:08.010 - 00:00:11.038, Speaker A: Good afternoon, everybody. Wait. Good evening, everybody.
00:00:11.124 - 00:00:12.682, Speaker B: My name is Kartik.
00:00:12.826 - 00:00:17.070, Speaker A: I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global. And welcome to ETH global Paris.
00:00:18.610 - 00:00:29.266, Speaker B: This is not a conference. If you've been to horror events before, you may know that ETHGlobal is known for one thing. Our goal is to get thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem.
00:00:29.266 - 00:00:48.678, Speaker B: And we do this by running hackathons and summit, which makes this whole weekend a hackathon. What differentiates this from a conference? Well, our focus is on builders. And not only that, this is a place for you to learn, get help, and just grow as amazing designers, product people, and engineers.
00:00:48.678 - 00:01:02.350, Speaker B: And we strongly believe that showing is way more important than telling, which is why, come Sunday, you're not allowed to just talk about what you did. You have to show us what you actually built. And we've been doing this since 2017.
00:01:02.350 - 00:01:16.100, Speaker B: We started all in ETH, Waterloo in Canada. It's almost six years ago. And we've gone across the world to all different continents and done this to get over 70,000 people into this space.
00:01:16.100 - 00:01:33.238, Speaker B: And not only that, the best thing about all of this is that we're finally excited to be back after all these years in Paris. Four years later, we're back doing our hackathon with 1400 of you in this building. That's incredible.
00:01:33.238 - 00:01:46.240, Speaker B: Give yourself a massive round of applause. Out of these, 14 are hackers from 67 different countries, and 22% of them are new to Web Three. This is the lowest we've ever had.
00:01:47.090 - 00:01:48.574, Speaker A: There's a lot of people here in.
00:01:48.612 - 00:02:01.570, Speaker B: Paris that are in this space, and we are excited to do one event where we have so many people who've been part of this ecosystem for so many years. So this is a massive reunion for all of us. And for the other 88%.
00:02:01.570 - 00:02:12.246, Speaker B: This is where you're from, 78%. All of you are from different parts of the world. But, of course, it shouldn't be surprising to us that Europe has a very special presence here.
00:02:12.246 - 00:02:23.526, Speaker B: So many people from so many countries and cities. So we're excited to meet all of you and reunite with some of you we haven't seen in years. And on top of all those hackers, we have 200 and 670 ecosystem builders.
00:02:23.526 - 00:02:36.474, Speaker B: These are all of our amazing partners. The engineers, the managers, the product people, the designers, the founders. All of them are here in this building willing to talk to you about everything that they're excited about, everything you're excited about, and 40 dedicated technical mentors.
00:02:36.474 - 00:02:47.426, Speaker B: Which means if you're stuck, you can find somebody to help you with anything, with your code or your thought process or your architecture or anything in between, whether at 02:00 P.m. Or at 02:00 A.m. Or at 04:00 A.m.
00:02:47.426 - 00:02:58.274, Speaker B: Or anytime from today till Sunday morning. And because this is not a hackathon conference, I am tired today. I'll reset.
00:02:58.274 - 00:03:03.490, Speaker B: Give me a SEC. Because this is not a conference.
00:03:03.570 - 00:03:06.882, Speaker A: 34 workshops and no talks.
00:03:06.946 - 00:03:12.246, Speaker B: All these workshops has already happened all throughout today. And you can see the best part.
00:03:12.268 - 00:03:13.514, Speaker A: Of this, which is half a million.
00:03:13.552 - 00:03:16.262, Speaker B: Dollars in prizes are going to be given away this entire weekend.
00:03:16.326 - 00:03:18.010, Speaker A: So hope all of you are excited.
00:03:18.430 - 00:03:20.266, Speaker B: We have 41 incredible partners that are.
00:03:20.288 - 00:03:23.046, Speaker A: Giving away all these prizes. I'm going to have you continue clapping.
00:03:23.078 - 00:03:24.554, Speaker B: And the faster you clap, the faster.
00:03:24.602 - 00:03:57.506, Speaker A: I'll say all of their amazing names. So let's start with LaPlace fintech one inch gnosis chain followcoin maker MetaMask mina polygon wallet connect World coin airstack gitcoin Biconomy cartesi stello chainlink es ethereum foundation hyperlane mantle mass near neon EVM save sysmo StarkNet the Graph guma unlimit xmtp ZK sync ZK bob Zader chain aragon axelr DFNS splashbots late protocol nounstow push protocol and quicknode all these amazing companies are going to be giving amazing prizes.
00:03:57.538 - 00:04:09.766, Speaker B: And you can hear about all of this very soon. But let's talk about this weekend. The goal here is I want to spend the next ten minutes covering all the important things that you need to know for how to structure your time and how everything's going to work until Sunday.
00:04:09.766 - 00:04:25.118, Speaker B: And that means we're going to cover everything about this venue, how you can get help, all the prizes, all the tops and workshops, team formation stuff. A lot of you are still looking for form teams and of course, how judging works. Most important note before we get started, do not use WiFi hotspots.
00:04:25.118 - 00:04:38.614, Speaker B: This happens every time. So I have to now include this in all of our slides. If you turn on your hotspot because the internet is not performing in that corner, turning on that hotspot interferes with the internet itself.
00:04:38.614 - 00:04:54.538, Speaker B: So you make it worse for everybody around you in that area. We have dedicated technicians here that are monitoring and actually tracking what the WiFi access looks like in every given spot. So if you see something is not working or it's a dead spot or it's just too slow, message us in.
00:04:54.538 - 00:05:04.602, Speaker B: Discord where you are so we can just send somebody to immediately correct this. We've already spotted a few places and we've added more access points in the last few hours. We just need to know what other spots are uncovered.
00:05:04.602 - 00:05:18.334, Speaker B: So just turn off your hotspots and just let us know where things are and we'll get to fixing all of these things immediately. Now we're done with that, let's talk about security. All attendees must wear their wristbands and their event badges.
00:05:18.334 - 00:05:28.260, Speaker B: This is a private event, which means that we have security at the doors, especially as we lead into the night. We will be closing down ways for you to enter. So without a wristband, you cannot come into the building.
00:05:28.260 - 00:05:38.486, Speaker B: Policy is very simple no wristbands equals no entry. If you forgot something and you didn't have your wristband on and you were trying to get back in, this would be applicable to you too. At 10:00 P.m.,
00:05:38.486 - 00:05:56.730, Speaker B: we're going to close the registration desk, which means without the wristband you cannot come in or check in until tomorrow morning. And if you lose the wristband, we will not be reissuing it for you. So make sure that you do not take that off or you do not lose it and do not leave your belongings unattended.
00:05:56.730 - 00:06:14.660, Speaker B: We're not responsible for anything lost or stolen items, so please keep your valuables with you. We'll do our best to make sure that people who are not allowed to be in the building are not in the building. But do not go home with your laptop on the table and keep everything that you value in check and with you at all times.
00:06:14.660 - 00:06:19.978, Speaker B: Let's talk about the venue and activities. So we're here on the basement floor. This is the auditorium.
00:06:19.978 - 00:06:32.182, Speaker B: This is where we are today. This is also where going to be back on Sunday for the final closing ceremonies. There's a lot of hackers here that you can, there's a lot of hacking areas here so you can have a couple of hundred of you also sit down.
00:06:32.182 - 00:06:41.290, Speaker B: There's also food being served on this floor if you were hacking from this side. And then we'll go up to the next floor, which is a ground floor where you came in through the registration. That's the biggest hacker area.
00:06:41.290 - 00:06:56.730, Speaker B: That's also where all of our partners are. That's also where food and catering is for all of you. And if you want to present to all of your partners on Sunday for the demos, this is where you're going to be on Sunday lining up and talking to all of our partners.
00:06:56.730 - 00:07:05.182, Speaker B: And then on top we have a third upper floor. That is where a lot of the workshops were today. And also there's a lot of hacking spots there and a couple of lounges.
00:07:05.182 - 00:07:33.630, Speaker B: You can check out the nounstow lounge or the cartesi recharge station, get a massage, hang out with a lot of things happening with a lot of people there and just see and just take some time to relax. Then we also have some amazing late night stacks so we're going to be doing crepes and Macarons tonight at midnight and also tomorrow and today will be crepes. So come back here in the catering area and you can have some really cool, sweet stuff.
00:07:33.630 - 00:07:46.670, Speaker B: There's also a selfie booth up on the top floor. It also prints the photos in front of you so it's not just digital so take advantage of that. Get a photo with your team and get a memorabilia for you being part of this hackathon.
00:07:46.670 - 00:07:59.282, Speaker B: And most important, part one swag item that we left outside intentionally. This is everybody's personal coffee press. You will be able to get this and pick this up on the registration tomorrow.
00:07:59.282 - 00:08:09.190, Speaker B: Just come with your badge and we'll scan your ticket again. And anybody who has not picked this up will be able to collect this. So you get to add this to your swagback collection.
00:08:09.610 - 00:08:11.300, Speaker A: This is the thing that gets to clap. Amazing.
