00:00:07.690 - 00:00:35.222, Speaker A: I'm Kil, one of the core developers at the Pop and Ziggybop project ecosystem and we are building a next generation stablecoin with optional privacy. So he's going to we're going to talk about that. So we believe at Zikibob that financial privacy is first of all of course very important for everyone use cases not only in crypto but in web two world.
00:00:35.222 - 00:01:10.290, Speaker A: And as in web two world is really a norm for people to think that their financial privacy is somehow preserved within banks and other institutions. In crypto it usually becomes a big problem since the crypto blockchains and are basically public ledgers and all information about public transactions are freely available for everyone on chain to see and when it comes to sensitive financial information. So there is no really a simple mechanism for achieving privacy in these financial activities within everyday usage of stablecoins.
00:01:10.290 - 00:01:36.230, Speaker A: So at Ziggybop we are trying to fix this problem by introducing this optional privacy for a stablecoin. So we are basically right now building three important projects within our Zikibob ecosystem. So Bob itself is a multi chain multi collateral stable token with optional privacy implemented via the Zikibob protocol which is powered by zkSNARKs which allows this private micropayments between users.
00:01:36.230 - 00:02:13.126, Speaker A: And one of the recent projects we also started working with is called Bob CDP which is basically a protocol which will allow users to not only generate Bob by locking their stable collateral but also use some of their volatile on chain assets to mint this BOP using the CDP model. So just a few words about the Bob stablecoin. So the first typical question that is asked about the stablecoin which you probably didn't heard about is related to how does the stablecoin preserve its price and keeps it back.
00:02:13.126 - 00:02:34.730, Speaker A: So here we decided to follow the simplest possible approach. First of all with just starting by baking each Bob with similar amount of USDC. So for now Bob each freely available and circulating Bob is backed one to one with USDC and all circulating supply is 100% backed with on chain stable coins.
00:02:34.730 - 00:03:03.538, Speaker A: Yeah, and to further harden the peg we are also using this concept of very tight concentrated ranges of liquidity on uniswap with three and similar liquidity protocols. Yeah for hardening the peg and keeping this one to one ratio between other stable coins. We also introduced this headless AMM called Bob Swap which is currently integrated to one inch aggregator and pathfinder.
00:03:03.538 - 00:03:27.562, Speaker A: And we're also looking into integrating it into other AMM aggregator frameworks in the nearest future. And basically Bob swap allows you to swap between other whitelisted stablecoins into Bob and from Bob with fixed rate which is in zero slippage and almost zero fees. And one of the also other cool features it supports is called idle asset compounding.
00:03:27.562 - 00:04:03.414, Speaker A: So whenever somebody locks some USDC or USDT in the Bobswap contract, this can be automatically autocomputed to some of the blue chips lending markets like compound or average to earn some additional and notable yield for the protocol revenue, which is also a cool feature to have. And just to conclude about the Bob part, just to throw some numbers. So the current market cap of Bob is about 50 million USD, with achieving about eight to $10 million of trading volume daily.
00:04:03.414 - 00:04:23.054, Speaker A: We have more than 4600 active holders of Bob token and the overall collateralized circulating supply available freely on the market is around 7 million. And the Bob itself is deployed on multiple chains. We are looking forward to deployment on other chains as well.
00:04:23.054 - 00:04:40.610, Speaker A: But right now we are present on Polygon optimism and arbitram. Rollups ethereum, Mainet and BNB Chain. So yes, as I said before, we also started working recently on this module for collateralized depth positions, which is soon going to be available on one of the Bob present networks.
00:04:40.610 - 00:05:04.214, Speaker A: And this way users will be able to generate new Bob on the market using their uniswap V three or Quickswap V three LP positions with Pop or other token pairs as collateral. And this way it's going to increase the capital efficiency and allow for more collaborations for us in the future. So now jumping into the coolest part, the Zikibob.
00:05:04.214 - 00:05:40.306, Speaker A: So the Ziki Bob is a privacy optional privacy layer for Bob token. The way it works is by using the zero knowledge proofs, people using Zikibob are able to confirm the particular validity of the particular operation and transaction without actually revealing the concrete details, sensitive details of their deposit, private transfer or withdrawal, such as the amount of their operation, the destination addresses. And so they confirm this validity of this operation by using and calculating the zero knowledge proof snark proof within their application UI.
00:05:40.306 - 00:06:11.166, Speaker A: In this way, only the actual sender and the receiver of each particular operation has the ability to actually access and to crypt the operation metadata and to actually know what happens inside of this operation. Then to limit further privacy leakages and to simplify the use case the way how this protocol is used by the users all transactions are sent through the elected relayer so that users don't actually need to pay for gas. In gas tokens.
00:06:11.166 - 00:06:33.094, Speaker A: And instead they can use the same token for payment of fees to the relayer as the ascending, which is the bob stablecoin. So here's a small snippet from the UI. So basically, as I said, the UI allows you to make a deposit inside your privacy application from your public wallet on Polygon or other available networks.
00:06:33.094 - 00:06:51.594, Speaker A: Then you are able to perform transfers to other participants within the Zikibob pool. And finally, once you for example receive the salary, you are able to withdraw them back to your public wallet to continue your DeFi journey. So right now we are looking for collaboration in multiple major use cases.
00:06:51.594 - 00:07:25.222, Speaker A: So the biggest one we are currently focusing on is related to everything somehow connected to payroll activities invoicing payments processing. So basically a lot of organizations and crypto and beyond a lot of Dows are already paying their salaries in stablecoins, which is a convenient choice of currency for payment of salaries and paying them and keeping them on chain is a very beneficial use case. But usually this all happens publicly on publicly available blockchains which makes it very inconvenient for everyone involved.
00:07:25.222 - 00:07:54.050, Speaker A: So for DAOs makes inconvenient to disclose everyone's salary to everyone. For people receiving this salary they can be scary for receive salary on publicly available address so that everyone on the blockchain can see how much they receive, how much they spend and how they spend it. So it makes a perfect fit for the privacy application connected to Stablecoins to kind of try to integrate with all those who are paying salaries in Stablecoins.
00:07:54.050 - 00:08:31.978, Speaker A: And we are also focusing on other use cases as well, which might include something related to vendor purchases, anonymous donation, fundraising granting programs and the connection to the threatfire world and its use cases like on and off boarding between stablecoins and traditional banking, processing of bank deposit, remittances and so. And as I said, with the example of salaries, for example, how it all works. So we have our employer, Carl, let's say, who wants to pay for his people and employee privately.
00:08:31.978 - 00:08:51.922, Speaker A: So he has USDC. Let's say he's able to go to Uniswap or one inch UI to swap his USDC to Bob at nearly one to one rate, then deposit this whole amount to the Zikibok application. And then when the day of the salary came, he's able to within one transaction to pay for all of his employees using their ZK addresses.
00:08:51.922 - 00:09:18.942, Speaker A: And then, once the employees receive their salary, they are able to freely withdraw their Bob back to the public wallet. And so nobody really knows how much each employee receives and what he does further with his money. So right now the Zikibob application is available only on polygon and optimism, but the Bob token is present on multiple chains as well and as well as people are using other chains as well.
00:09:18.942 - 00:09:54.646, Speaker A: So for further kind of simplify the UX for our users, we also made this cool integration with LiFi. So you have access to the widget of LiFi within our application which actually allows you to perform quick, efficient and fast swaps cross chain between your available assets and Bob so that you can use it for deposits or when you have withdrawn Bob, you can swap it back to other assets on any other available chain quickly within our UI. So now a few words about compliance and our approach to this topic.
00:09:54.646 - 00:10:33.602, Speaker A: So first of all, we believe that compliance topic is becoming more and more important every day for every crypto project and especially it's true when it comes when we are talking about privacy related applications. We have seen a lot of events in the past years which were related to the privacy solutions and the lack of sufficient compliance solutions. So we also believe that no, actually a single compliance solution exists that can fit and close all the use cases and eliminate all the questions from all of the regulators.
00:10:33.602 - 00:11:46.398, Speaker A: So we believe that the best approach we can choose here is to combine multiple compliance approaches which every on its own make life of malicious actors a bit harder while still preserving the decent amount of simplicity and robustness of the user experience within our application. So what we are doing on the compliance side within our application we are passively screening the deposit and withdrawal addresses so that no malicious actors related to known exploits, hacks or other types of illicit on chain activities are able to perform operations within our privacy protocol. We also will soon start to allow our users to generate a cryptographically verified statement of their account, which includes a history of their transactions for last month, last three months or so, so that they're able to generate a report and to prove to the requesting party, which could be a centralized exchange, the banking institutions or government authorities what they actually did in the pool, where did they receive their money from and how they did it.
00:11:46.398 - 00:12:09.578, Speaker A: They spent it. And so this way they're able to prove the source of funds, the way, how they spend it, without disclosing it publicly to the whole blockchain, but instead to just disclose them to a particular requesting party. We're also imposing different limits on the amount of activity certain actors can perform within the pool.
00:12:09.578 - 00:12:39.550, Speaker A: So we have a strict limit on the amount of daily activities you can make. On the deposit and withdrawal side we have the limit on the total pool size. All of this makes life really harder for the hackers and exploiters who are able, who want to deposit and operate on large amount of money but at the same time it doesn't really makes life harder for typical users of our application who just receives the salary or perform day to day transactions.
00:12:39.550 - 00:13:23.418, Speaker A: We also did a cool integration with Binance and now you'll get KYC provider which basically allows you to mint to your address to pass the KYC on Binance, then to connect it to the KYC enabled Solbound NFT token issue that on your wallet. And this our application will check the existence of this Solbound NFT on your account and if at present it will can lift or significantly increase the available usage limits for the application. Yeah, one of the latest feature we have added to the Zkbop and the one we are asking our hackers to use throughout this hackathon is called Direct Deposits.
00:13:23.418 - 00:14:09.820, Speaker A: So basically it's a solution for simple and fast private payment integration within different partnering products. So its main goal is to minimize the kind of the required effort and quadrant when it comes to integrating privacy features to open source wallets, third party, centralized application, different protocols, DeFi based applications and so on. And so the coolest part of that is that even though all of the previous Vicky BOP operations such as deposits, transfers and withdrawals, they require users to actively participate in the generation of the Snark Proof within their UI, which makes it nearly impossible to integrate such workflow within partner products.
00:14:09.820 - 00:14:30.734, Speaker A: In case of direct deposits, no actual Ezk snark Proofs generation is required for the user and instead another third party is responsible for generation of those Snark Proofs. So the way it works is pretty simple. So we have this potential, just a few ideas who can integrate direct deposits.
00:14:30.734 - 00:14:57.850, Speaker A: So it could be tax protocols, donation, fundraising platforms, different crosschain breaches and protocols, maybe open source wallets. We want to simplify the life of the users, maybe something some tooling related to payroll and invoice processing which is located on chain. And so all of these protocols implemented in some form of smart contracts can easily interact with the Escrow smart contract for our direct deposit processing logic.
00:14:57.850 - 00:15:28.802, Speaker A: Basically, by specifying the destination Ziki address of the users they want to send their money to specifying the desired amount. Then after some time normally it takes ten to 15 minutes. The relayer, which is relayer hosted by us, will be able to process those presubmitted direct deposits in bytes generate the necessary star proofs for them in a trustless manner so that no one is really able manipulate the data in the direct deposits after it has been submitted.
00:15:28.802 - 00:16:03.034, Speaker A: And once this transaction from the relayer is eventually submitted to the pool contract and confirmed users of the Zikibob are the receivers of those direct deposits, are able to access the funds right away in the same way as they do by the simple interaction within our Zikibob UI. So users can continue to transfer them inside the pool to other participants or withdraw them back to the public zero X address. So now a few words about our hackathon bounty.
00:16:03.034 - 00:16:37.094, Speaker A: What we are asking you to do is to help us to bring the financial privacy and to find the important everyday use cases which lacks this financial privacy for stablecoin transfers and to connect Zikibob with any existing on chain activities where it might matter. And so we are asking you to do so by integrating the Zikibob direct deposit feature with any existing or your Customly built protocol project or any other application of your choice. So just again a few ideas.
00:16:37.094 - 00:17:05.774, Speaker A: Where can we start? We can build an integration with the open source wallet for making deposits into privacy pool easier and more available for public usage. You can integrate it as an endpoint at the different protocols related to bridges, swaps and the aggregators. You can do something with the processing of fundraising and donation from multiple users, or you can build something around the payroll tooling.
00:17:05.774 - 00:17:32.698, Speaker A: And of course this list is not limited by only our ideas. You can suggest and discuss any idea you have in mind right now or later at our booth as well. So we have a total bounty of 10,000 bob for this hackathon, for the five K for the first place, two K for the second price, and the remaining three K will be evenly distributed among all successful notable submissions.
00:17:32.698 - 00:18:09.130, Speaker A: So basically, all projects which successfully will be able to integrate the Kpop tariq deposits in their projects will qualify and receive guaranteed bounty from this price pool of 3000. Yeah. And during the judging process, we'll definitely take a look about creativity, novelty and the implementation quality of your solution, how the Zikibob integration is actually crucial and integral to the overall application, and how your solution aligns with Pop and Zikibob ecosystem values of on chain compliant privacy.
00:18:09.130 - 00:18:23.790, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think we have a few minutes for a short live demonstration of how interact deposit works. So I'm going to log in into the Zkbop UI right now.
00:18:23.790 - 00:18:37.758, Speaker A: So I have created previously, a couple of days ago, test ZK account. So we're going to wait until everything is loaded. So what we see here is that I have a ZK account.
00:18:37.758 - 00:18:46.574, Speaker A: I have connected a public MetaMask address to it on which I have right now 5.9 bob tokens. I have a ZK account with the total balance of 14 bob.
00:18:46.574 - 00:19:07.980, Speaker A: If I go to the history, yeah, I will see that this balance of 14 is obtained usually. So a couple of days ago, I made a deposit of eight bob. Then someone transferred two more bob to my receiving address, to my receiving ZK address, and finally, I made a direct deposit to this address, to this account as well.
00:19:07.980 - 00:19:24.750, Speaker A: So in order to just do one more direct deposit to our account, we're going to need to send two transactions. So just for the positives of this demo, the simplest way we're going to do it is through polygon scan UI. So this concrete deployment is on polygon.
00:19:24.750 - 00:19:42.070, Speaker A: So the first transaction is we need to actually approve the tokens, the Bob tokens for usage into the direct deposit contract. So that's quite typical flow for any Web Three application. So we're going to send an approval transaction.
00:19:42.070 - 00:20:05.062, Speaker A: So it's good. And then in order to send the direct deposit from the polygon scan UI without generating any Snark proof, we're going to create a new receiving CK address in our account tab. We're going to go to the second direct deposit smart contract here.
00:20:05.062 - 00:20:15.370, Speaker A: We're going to find the direct deposit function for making such deposit. So we're going to pass the address we want to make our deposit into. Then we're going to choose the amount.
00:20:15.370 - 00:20:24.830, Speaker A: Let's say we want to deposit free bob tokens. So the bob has 18 decimals. So we're going to also type 18 zeros.
00:20:24.830 - 00:20:34.030, Speaker A: And the fee for depositing is 0.1 bob. So we're going to add that here as well so that the receiver will actually receive free bob.
00:20:34.030 - 00:21:03.594, Speaker A: And then we also have a third parameter of fallback user which is basically alternative receiver for this particular deposit in case it cannot be made through due to some compliance issue with the sender similar problems. So since we are sending the deposit to ourselves we're going to just copy the same address we use in our MetaMask here going to send this transaction. So we're going to see that from our account 3.1
00:21:03.594 - 00:21:43.058, Speaker A: bob will be eventually deducted during this transaction and once the transaction let's wait till it's displayed. So yeah, we have successfully submitted a direct deposit from our address to the Ckbob direct deposit smart contract. So now we're going to have to wait for ten to 15 minutes for relayer to pick up this transaction, to put that in a batch, generate an SSR snack proof and submit it to the main Zkbop pool.
00:21:43.058 - 00:22:00.060, Speaker A: And after that, we're going to see the one more income transfer of free bob with this direct deposit label on our account. And the total balance of our account will be increased to 17 bob. So yeah, that's pretty much how it works.
00:22:00.060 - 00:22:39.360, Speaker A: Feel free to access to subscribe to our Twitter, read the docs about Zkbop on our website. We have a cool page specifically for this hackathon regarding direct deposits. Come to our booth for any questions for any other corporations for grabbing our cool swag, ask questions in the sponsor Zikibob Hackathon discord channel at eveglobal and yeah, thank you very much for attention.
00:22:39.360 - 00:22:50.710, Speaker A: I think we have five minutes for questions here. If you have any, if you have any questions so please raise your hands. I can bring the mic.
00:22:50.710 - 00:22:54.884, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:54.922 - 00:23:07.076, Speaker B: So how volume dependent is the privacy protection? So if there's not that many people doing deposits and withdrawals, is it easy to track linked together the transactions?
00:23:07.188 - 00:23:56.600, Speaker A: Yeah so of course there is a well known concept of anonymity pool so it works differently in different protocols since in our protocols there are not only deposits and withdrawals on some fixed amounts but you can also after you make the deposits split it in multiple withdrawals or make transfers within the pool. So actually the funds become really dispersed over time pretty fast and so even within hundreds of users it really becomes nearly impossible to tell what really happens and how they connect it. So yeah, basically I think even existing anonymity set for the Ziggy BOP is already quite enough for the majority of people.
00:23:56.600 - 00:24:42.948, Speaker A: So if you're going to go into the contract, open the token transfers, you will see that a lot of stuff going on here and there is actually no any way to tell how these depositors and withdrawals are connected with each other, how they kind of exchange the money within the pool. So it kind of becomes quite untrivial to the reverse engineer. What is the best way to is there a way to withdraw fund on chain? Yeah, so basically once you have this balance within the ZK account and you want to withdraw to your public address, you're going to just select a withdraw tab.
00:24:42.948 - 00:25:15.052, Speaker A: I mean, without the UI, is there a way to call that on solidity? Yeah, so it's not possible to call it directly on Solidity since in order to withdraw the user must generate the Snark proof so the solidity on its own cannot generate the Snark proof. So right now the only option is to use the UI for generating these proofs. So we have more low level for this WASM library which is responsible for all this proof generation necessary SDK.
00:25:15.052 - 00:25:54.548, Speaker A: So maybe we're going to build some widgets which going to help to integrate this into some other external UIs in some time in the future. But anyway, so there is this low level library which is responsible for proof generation and this probably going to be the only way the person is able to initiate and submit their withdrawal. Is the Bob swap deployed on any test now? Any test on like Gory or separate? I think no, unfortunately.
00:25:54.548 - 00:26:10.690, Speaker A: But probably we can deploy it, no problem. So yeah, it's deployed on polygon optimism, all other networks integrated with one inch. But if you want it to happen on Guerley or Sipoli yeah, we can definitely do that, no problem.
00:26:10.690 - 00:26:18.770, Speaker A: Not right now, but yeah, maybe within this hackathon. I'll try my best.
00:26:24.210 - 00:26:31.010, Speaker B: How strict is the deposit screening? Like, would a wallet freshly funded from tornado be sanctioned?
00:26:31.830 - 00:26:42.194, Speaker A: Well, I think you can try. I'm not sure it will be immediately flagged. So we are using the TRM for now as our screening provider.
00:26:42.194 - 00:27:10.206, Speaker A: So we kind of do not screen ourselves. So we're not 100% sure what are the policies within theorem, how this score factoring depends on the different sources, on the amounts, on how you can the different timings, but I think it obviously marks very obvious use cases when someone launders hundreds of millions of dollars. Yeah, definitely going to mark those.
00:27:10.206 - 00:27:37.106, Speaker A: Definitely not going to mark casual wallets of simple users who are like transferring value of below 1000. But what happens in the middle? It's really hard to tell usually. And it all depends on how this CRM provider behaves and they do not actively disclose what are their politics and how they calculate these score factors.
00:27:37.298 - 00:27:43.494, Speaker B: What was the name of the people in charge of the sanctioning again?
00:27:43.692 - 00:28:00.668, Speaker A: TRM Labs. TRM. TRM, yeah.
00:28:00.668 - 00:28:05.480, Speaker A: Thanks for stopping by. Thanks a lot. Bye.
