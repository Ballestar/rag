00:00:04.490 - 00:00:05.610, Speaker A: GM, East San Francisco.
00:00:05.690 - 00:00:07.226, Speaker B: What's up? East San Francisco.
00:00:07.338 - 00:00:08.590, Speaker C: What's up? SF?
00:00:13.010 - 00:00:18.394, Speaker D: The feeling in San Francisco this year is one of recovery and growth. I would say after the pandemic.
00:00:18.442 - 00:00:21.966, Speaker E: So many people who have come from so many places, lots of people are.
00:00:21.988 - 00:00:27.240, Speaker B: Here from lots of different parts of the world. I guess this one's a lot bigger than that one, which is really cool to see.
00:00:30.090 - 00:00:51.194, Speaker F: One of the things that I love about Ecoball is like it really brings a lot of new commerce, fresh minds in the ecosystem that come with different questions, but oftentimes actually bring new perspectives. This is a hackathon, and a big part of the hackathon is actually to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. It doesn't matter if it's not a real startup idea that's going to make millions or billions of dollars, it has to be a fun thing.
00:00:51.392 - 00:01:07.778, Speaker G: My favorite part of the East Global Community is that I could join a hackathon every month if I wanted to. For somebody who was afraid to participate in these kind of events, it's really awesome that I really just go in my emails and I could jump on any hackathon anytime I want.
00:01:07.864 - 00:01:20.454, Speaker A: Don't be shy. On day one when you make most of your friends in university, it's your first week of school. So when you come into the hackathon, just start shouting. Who needs a designer? You will find your way.
00:01:20.652 - 00:01:42.570, Speaker B: At first I was in hack solo, but I got a team, so we ended up doing like a cool project. The Web Three community in general is like something really important. Just have a support system, build that friendship. Yeah, with everyone. I think the whole purpose of Web Three and like the tenets of it are that it's open and permissionless and inclusive.
00:01:45.790 - 00:02:01.140, Speaker C: What I love about the ETH Global Community is how connected everybody is and how open everybody is. It's a really warm community and one that wants to really nurture new persons in the space. What we need as part of Ethereum is for more people to build.
00:02:05.990 - 00:02:17.906, Speaker B: You kind of find in different areas that as a woman, you don't always get as received as well as the men do. But the East Global Community is not like that at all by any means. They're always very welcoming, very helpful, and the mentorship is top notch.
00:02:18.098 - 00:02:28.170, Speaker H: There are so many resources available that exist purely to help you get acclimated, to get comfortable, a lot of safe spaces to ask questions.
00:02:28.320 - 00:02:58.978, Speaker A: Some of the best talks I've seen have actually been at the ETH Global panels themselves. It's where I go to get some of the alpha. Sometimes you meet with your team, you get to start building things together. Hear from experts on how to build things better, work with really awesome mentors, and then present in some of the best VCs in the space and get real feedback and then be hopefully some of the top winning class of the ETH Global finalists. We have seen projects come out of ETH Global that we have been integrated with immediately. And so it's the wide spectrum of it and just kind of shows all that's happening in the ethereum community, the different levels of skill and how you can kind of have all of that.
00:02:58.984 - 00:03:14.380, Speaker I: Here at East Global, people just seem like those sleep deprived, incredibly happy to be here, right, and happy to be able to showcase what they built. And even if maybe they weren't able to get it all the way to being deployed, it's still a very proud moment for them to be able to show what they built.
00:03:15.710 - 00:03:35.938, Speaker E: It's an incredible community, like it happened five years ago and it's reached so many developers, it started so many companies. I myself actually got into Crypto because of the very first ETH Global hackathon, and now I have a company that's well funded by great people and so I would not have gone into the space without this community. And so it's been really great.
00:03:36.024 - 00:03:50.120, Speaker B: It's so much fun. I feel very lucky to have been going to ETH Global hackathon since you all started now five years ago, which is crazy. It really is a space where if you learn a lot and you put in a lot of hard work, you can just build amazing things.
00:03:51.690 - 00:04:02.838, Speaker H: I can't think of anything more optimistic and invigorating than thousands of people getting together for a weekend because they want to learn, they want to meet new people and they want to build something new.
00:04:02.924 - 00:04:14.810, Speaker C: If you're a developer and you've never been to a Web Three hackathon before, you're in for a treat. Not only because East Global is amazing using, but also because the theory of a community is absolutely incredible.
