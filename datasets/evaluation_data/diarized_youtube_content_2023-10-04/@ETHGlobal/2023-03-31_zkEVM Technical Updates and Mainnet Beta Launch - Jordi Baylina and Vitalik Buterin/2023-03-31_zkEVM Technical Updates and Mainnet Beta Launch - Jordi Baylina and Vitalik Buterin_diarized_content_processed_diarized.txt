00:00:06.490 - 00:00:26.678, Speaker A: It's really great that we delivered this Dkvm. We're incredibly proud and excited about this. But along the way, I think we just also got much, much more interconnected, stronger as the team, more convinced about our mission and the fact that we actually can contribute a lot this industry and hopefully to the world.
00:00:26.678 - 00:00:40.940, Speaker A: And yeah, with this, I would just actually hand it over to the actual hero and the person who made his mission to deliver the Zkvm, which is my good friend and co founder, Jordy Balina. And thanks everyone, again.
00:00:43.550 - 00:00:52.880, Speaker B: Thank you, Mihailo, for those words. Yeah, I'm not the hero. It's like I'm just an engineer just trying to scale the new.
00:00:52.880 - 00:01:22.470, Speaker B: So, to start the talk, I would like to start a little bit from the origins when we finish from Polygon Hermes. When we finished the first version of the payment, solemn Polygon Hermes. I was with Zook at that point, a very good friend, Barry WhiteHat, come to my home and he challenged me about Zkvm.
00:01:22.470 - 00:01:42.442, Speaker B: We believe actually the first time he told me about that, I told him this is impossible and this is impossible to do. But he just insisted thinking in the different pieces. Well, we were just trying to see, okay, let's do the exercise, how we can do that.
00:01:42.442 - 00:02:04.514, Speaker B: And we were going to the different challenges, to the different critical points. And we're solving most of them in a very complex way a lot of times. But we had the intuition at that point that things were possible and we start to dig on that.
00:02:04.514 - 00:02:28.154, Speaker B: And there was a moment where most of the big challenges that we had is, okay, they are solved at that point, so this could be possible. And it was at this point that I start first convincing my partners at that point, David and Tony, and well, first also Barney helped me a lot to convince them that this is a feature. I think we can do that on that.
00:02:28.154 - 00:02:48.434, Speaker B: And then I did a presentation in Paris, just explaining the community how I believe this could be possible. And here started the real project. It started not a lot, but with a small team from the hardware team.
00:02:48.434 - 00:03:06.870, Speaker B: And there was here a crucial moment that was the merge with Polygon. This actually was fundamental because this really allows to put all the resources that we needed to build all this. With this, we just built a team.
00:03:06.870 - 00:03:26.334, Speaker B: I just got the best professionals, the best people that I knew that could deliver on that. I convinced them to join this team and together with the people that already was in their best, we built what I believe is the best team in the world. The team that can really build up.
00:03:26.334 - 00:03:39.486, Speaker B: We started to work hard for a year and in Paris, one year later, we presented could be a prototype. If you want to be the first version. That was a full prover.
00:03:39.486 - 00:03:43.246, Speaker B: It was a prover that really worked. Terminate. Post terminated.
00:03:43.246 - 00:03:51.794, Speaker B: Okay, this was work. This was last in July. And since there of course we continue just improving this proverb.
00:03:51.794 - 00:04:00.022, Speaker B: A lot of optimizations. In October last year, we launched the public testnet. That was another huge milestone.
00:04:00.022 - 00:04:26.720, Speaker B: And since there mainly we have been working really hard, mainly focused on security. Security auditing, checking, double checking, doing internal audits, dealing with external audits, rebuilding parts of the code, cleaning the code until we feel comfortable with the code that we have right now. And here is where we are.
00:04:26.720 - 00:04:44.994, Speaker B: We are today at the day, the day that we have been cheating. Pretty much a day that seems like impossible three years ago. And there is this magic phase where an engineer just put the things in production.
00:04:44.994 - 00:05:05.178, Speaker B: It's like really when the things start getting useful for the people. So, this is the important time of the important point of the launch. Another thing that I want to announce now, and I think that's also very important is that today we are not only launch, we're not only launching, we're also open sourcing.
00:05:05.178 - 00:05:16.686, Speaker B: All the code. And what I mean open sourcing is not making available, has been available for the last six months. But we are also putting GPL license to all the repos of the approval.
00:05:16.686 - 00:05:31.010, Speaker B: I think this is an important gift for the committee and very proud pronouncer. And before finishing, I wanted to share 3 seconds. 3 seconds.
00:05:31.010 - 00:05:49.580, Speaker B: Why we were able to build these things so fast. The first is experience that we got in the first roll up in the Hermes one. This was really I mean, all the learnings that we got from there.
00:05:49.580 - 00:06:05.070, Speaker B: They are applied some way to this roll up to the Zacabm. The second part is architecture. I think that here we did very good decisions in the inside the architecture.
00:06:05.070 - 00:06:17.298, Speaker B: We divide the architecture in layers. We have a low layer, which is the cryptography layer that talks about polynomial commitments. Stark flungs and all this recursion about flungs.
00:06:17.298 - 00:06:30.230, Speaker B: And this has been an important layer. Another layer is the argumentation just with this sometimes it's equivalent. We have this sibling of the hardware layer.
00:06:30.230 - 00:06:38.454, Speaker B: It has nothing to do with hardware, but we call it the hardware layer because it's this whole layer. It's a repetition. We build the language for working in this layer.
00:06:38.454 - 00:06:49.834, Speaker B: We call this language PU. And we build the processor on top of this layer. Kind of PM specific processor to Jiku things as normal processor.
00:06:49.834 - 00:07:01.054, Speaker B: And on top of that is the software layer. Or we call the Rom layer, which is actually the program that's running on top of this processor. To build this program, we had to build an assembly for this processor.
00:07:01.054 - 00:07:17.714, Speaker B: And then the program that's actually the program that actually emulates the ABM and actually runs the ABM altogether. And all this stack layers allows us to have different teams working in parallel. Each one in one of these layers.
00:07:17.714 - 00:07:37.840, Speaker B: And not only that, for example, for auditing, having also different audits running in parallel with different specialized teams working together in there. This is what allows us to build the things so fast. And the last circuit that I want to share, there are many more, but the last circuit that I want to share is the team here.
00:07:37.840 - 00:08:07.010, Speaker B: This amazing team really mentioned before, but this amazing team that has been absolutely committed working day, night and weekends for the last two years because they believe in this project and learning together. Because it's like you create a language and then you need to learn about that language and then you need to go back and forth. And has been a huge effort, but at the same time has been also a pleasure.
00:08:07.010 - 00:08:33.940, Speaker B: We enjoy it. We had so fun also build that these both things together. This has worked, this professionalism of the team and this enjoy the work that has been done is what allows us to build this product, this polygon Ctvm so fast.
00:08:33.940 - 00:09:03.846, Speaker B: So in order to launch, in order to do the real do, we decided that the good way to do would be that to invite Vitalik to do the symbolic first transaction of KVM. So I would like to invite Vitalik just to do this transaction. Hello Vitalik.
00:09:03.846 - 00:09:11.660, Speaker B: And thank you very much for accepting this transaction. Let's see if everything works. This is a little bit.
00:09:13.950 - 00:09:17.214, Speaker C: No, no. Hi Jordan. It's good to be here.
00:09:17.214 - 00:09:32.546, Speaker C: Good to see all of you guys. Okay, I shall, I guess, click present and then I click on here and then okay, great. You see my MetaMask 0.1
00:09:32.546 - 00:09:35.460, Speaker C: e if I'm connected to the polygon Zkvm, right?
00:09:37.850 - 00:09:39.480, Speaker B: You did the bridge before.
00:09:40.810 - 00:10:08.398, Speaker C: Indeed, I did the bridge before. Okay, so then I have to send what address should I send to? Okay, let's go on Polygod Zkvm, we'll check this most recent transaction and Hemo will take whoever sent it. So I'm going to send to them and then send to them 0.5
00:10:08.398 - 00:10:19.460, Speaker C: e. Set the gas a little bit with 600:42, have some more meme value and then click next. Yes.
00:10:20.070 - 00:10:22.162, Speaker B: Maybe you want to put a message there or something.
00:10:22.216 - 00:10:32.840, Speaker C: Okay, how do I put a message again? I was looking this up and GBT told me to click on advanced options, but I don't see advanced options.
00:10:33.770 - 00:10:34.738, Speaker B: Oh, it's not the bind.
00:10:34.754 - 00:10:35.286, Speaker C: So sure. Okay.
00:10:35.308 - 00:10:41.100, Speaker B: But just do the normal transaction. That should be fine. You can share with us the message.
00:10:41.790 - 00:10:48.220, Speaker C: Sure. Okay. Do you know how to add call data, by the way?
00:10:52.190 - 00:10:55.706, Speaker B: And you say the advanced options. I show the data somewhere.
00:10:55.898 - 00:11:00.320, Speaker C: Right, but I just like I don't see the advanced options field. That's the thing, right?
00:11:01.410 - 00:11:05.954, Speaker B: I cannot see very good, the screen, but that's right here.
00:11:06.152 - 00:11:07.540, Speaker C: Oh, there we go. Okay.
00:11:10.150 - 00:11:21.426, Speaker B: Just to show the belt I need the previous one is the configuration of MetaMask. The configuration just go to the configuration of MetaMask.
00:11:21.618 - 00:11:27.670, Speaker C: Oh, I see. Okay, hold on. Click on polygon.
00:11:27.670 - 00:11:32.458, Speaker C: Hold on.
00:11:32.624 - 00:11:41.966, Speaker B: Where do I go for just maybe you need to maybe cancel this and just go to the okay, just go to the configuration oh, then there we go.
00:11:41.988 - 00:11:49.200, Speaker C: Okay, perfect. So I go to Add network, and then I just go back to networks and then Polygrenze KVM, and then that's okay.
00:11:50.210 - 00:11:57.534, Speaker B: Which is in general, maybe advanced in advanced, second advanced.
00:11:57.662 - 00:12:01.140, Speaker C: I see. Okay. Advanced gas control.
00:12:01.140 - 00:12:05.154, Speaker C: Show that. Just up. Show that.
00:12:05.272 - 00:12:06.142, Speaker B: This one?
00:12:06.296 - 00:12:06.566, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:06.588 - 00:12:07.480, Speaker B: There we go.
00:12:11.690 - 00:12:20.460, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, let's actually okay, let's see how this works. We're going to click send to this address.
00:12:20.460 - 00:12:30.700, Speaker C: Send to oh, there we go. 0.5. Okay, set this to a meme number and then over here.
00:12:30.700 - 00:12:33.534, Speaker C: Okay, great. I have to create some hex data.
00:12:33.572 - 00:12:33.998, Speaker B: Okay, hold on.
00:12:34.004 - 00:12:39.770, Speaker C: Let me just wait for hex data first. Let's see. I need something corny.
00:12:39.770 - 00:12:57.574, Speaker C: I'll deliver corny. Okay. Is that corny enough for you?
00:12:57.692 - 00:12:58.760, Speaker B: That's perfect.
00:12:59.290 - 00:13:11.960, Speaker C: Okay, amazing. Okay, going back here, I will send to the zero X seven, whoever this is. 0.5
00:13:11.960 - 00:13:24.160, Speaker C: Gatsolver has to go to a meme number and then X data, zero X, whatever this is. No meme number. Okay, next.
00:13:24.160 - 00:13:32.014, Speaker C: And then confirm. Okay, send pending. Amazing.
00:13:32.212 - 00:13:36.142, Speaker B: It should now go forward. Okay.
00:13:36.196 - 00:13:37.600, Speaker C: Edit says success.
00:13:39.090 - 00:13:43.474, Speaker B: Good. Okay. Maybe yeah, you can see the data there.
00:13:43.474 - 00:13:48.680, Speaker B: We already shown that. Just show it. Just select show.
00:13:48.680 - 00:13:51.000, Speaker B: There we go.
00:13:53.050 - 00:13:53.800, Speaker C: Okay.
00:13:54.170 - 00:13:55.320, Speaker B: We made it.
00:13:55.770 - 00:13:56.520, Speaker C: Okay.
00:13:57.450 - 00:14:06.554, Speaker B: I was not asleep before. That. Grace we can continue.
00:14:06.554 - 00:14:08.602, Speaker B: We have the first attraction there.
00:14:08.736 - 00:14:09.274, Speaker D: Definitely.
00:14:09.392 - 00:14:10.170, Speaker C: Jay.
00:14:12.530 - 00:14:19.680, Speaker D: Well, now we have officially launched Sikuvm maynight Beta. And we love hernique. We love it.
00:14:19.680 - 00:14:46.678, Speaker D: Now there's a big welcome to our community, to our developers, to our builder, and we just want to say that we're going to share everything that you need to know about Maynight Beta at 630 Central European time, four at 430 GMT time. So with that and with this excitement, we will continue with a Fireside chat. And we will invite now, Vitalek and Jordi to stay in.
00:14:46.678 - 00:14:51.730, Speaker D: And no better person to take this Fire chat on than Mihailo.
00:14:51.810 - 00:14:52.886, Speaker C: Take it on.
