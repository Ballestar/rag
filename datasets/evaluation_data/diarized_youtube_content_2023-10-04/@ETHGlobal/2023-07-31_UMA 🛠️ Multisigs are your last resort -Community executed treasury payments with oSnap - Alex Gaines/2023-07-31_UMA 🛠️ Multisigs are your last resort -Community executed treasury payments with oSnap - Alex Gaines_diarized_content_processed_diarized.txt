00:00:07.210 - 00:00:09.018, Speaker A: All right. Hey, everyone. My name is Alex.
00:00:09.018 - 00:00:36.070, Speaker A: I am an integrations engineer at Boomart. For the past few years, I've had the privilege of working with a bunch of integrations prediction markets, insurance protocols, and recently with Dows, helping them with optimistic governance. Really the focus today, I'm going to talk about using OSNAP to decentralize your dao, but I really just want to make sure that everyone understands kind of how Uma works and how you can use it in your projects this weekend.
00:00:36.070 - 00:00:56.334, Speaker A: So what does Uma actually do? Uma is an optimistic oracle that records truths about the world onto blockchains. So what does that mean? You can pretty much make any statement. You can use which team one out of Team A or Team B.
00:00:56.334 - 00:01:21.270, Speaker A: You can say, is this a valid snapshot proposal? And then essentially, you can propose a transaction and attach a bond to that transaction that essentially enters into a challenge window. And during that challenge window, if anyone disputes, it's escalated to the token holders to resolve. And if nobody disputes at the end of that challenge period, it is deemed as valid and can be used in your smart contracts.
00:01:21.270 - 00:01:48.618, Speaker A: So, like I said, if the statements are false while Uma's oracle assumes a statement is true but allows anyone to dispute if it's incorrect, during that challenge window, disputes are really rare. We've seen maybe one dispute out of every few hundred markets, and that's because disputes are financially incentivized. So when you're making an assertion, you have to post a bond.
00:01:48.618 - 00:02:07.278, Speaker A: And if you're wrong, when someone challenges that, you lose your bond. So it's very costly to make inaccurate or bad data in your assertion. And that's because Uma's resolution process is essentially the token holders vote when there are disputes.
00:02:07.278 - 00:02:18.998, Speaker A: It's a two phase process. That first phase is the commit process. And during that commit phase, no token holders can actually see other people's votes, and they vote based on their belief.
00:02:18.998 - 00:02:43.566, Speaker A: And then in the second phase, each are 24 hours, people reveal their votes. And at the end, the majority of the votes are essentially used to resolve and essentially resolve that market. So now I just kind of want to talk through briefly some of the current integrations that we have, and it might help to kind of click on what kind of assertions we're seeing every day.
00:02:43.566 - 00:03:01.638, Speaker A: This is one that I just pulled from Polymarket. It's a prediction market, and it's basically asking if Oppenheimer grossed over $50 million domestically on its opening weekend. And I think that this is a good example because Polymarket could have stopped there, and that's all they asked, and they probably would have gotten the right answer.
00:03:01.638 - 00:03:34.530, Speaker A: But when you're making statements to Uma, I think it's really important to include a data source and really think it through any edge cases. So if you go to this box office mojo and there are estimates and that could cause some confusion when people go to resolve this or make an assertion that this is resolved. And in doing that so Polymarket predicts, they actually specify use the final not estimates even though it seems obvious it can cause confusion and cause disputes.
00:03:34.530 - 00:04:15.370, Speaker A: And another example is we have Cozy and Sherlock, they're both prediction markets and this is just basically was there a hack bug, user error malfusance and again it's basically just asking if 50% of user funds in Curve was hacked before or after a specific block number on Ethereum. And again, I think these details that they're providing a specific block and a specific value of 50% or more. So there's not going to be any confusion in terms of like if there's a small bug in the UI or something like that that causes a couple of $1,000 that's not disputable or that's not something that you can actually claim as a hack.
00:04:15.370 - 00:04:28.770, Speaker A: It has to be 50% of those user funds. So I think that's an important distinction when you're kind of thinking about what you should be asserting to the Oracle. And here are some other examples of our integrations.
00:04:28.770 - 00:05:04.990, Speaker A: Across is our cross chain bridge and basically how it works is it would be really capital and efficient to make a proposal every single time someone went from one chain to the next. So all of the transactions are bundled in basically a few hour period and that's what's proposed to the chain. Another example is decentralist and essentially asks do all I mean it's essentially verifying addresses on a list so like it could verify blacklisted wallets or wallets involved in a hack.
00:05:04.990 - 00:05:21.198, Speaker A: I think one of their first lists asking like what Uma addresses voted correctly 80% of the time. So you can kind of think of how you can use this to use Uma to verify these address lists. And then the last one is Polymarket.
00:05:21.198 - 00:05:40.758, Speaker A: It's just asking TVL at a certain date. But I think it's kind of cool to see these three different use cases. I mean one is a very bot driven cross chain bridge, one is a manually proposing addresses to a list and then this pull together one for TVL is just using Deepi Llama's API.
00:05:40.758 - 00:06:30.710, Speaker A: So it really shows just how flexible all this can be when you're using data with Uma. And I guess how does all these apply to governance? Yeah, this is the typical governance flow and there's on chain there's forking compounds governance contract but this is what we're kind of seeing on a typical governance flow. You first have forum discussion and that's basically a period where anyone can propose an idea and typically dao stewards or the community come in and make comments and make sure that the proposal is aligned with the actual Dow, like what the dow actually wants to do.
00:06:30.710 - 00:06:46.910, Speaker A: And then when everyone kind of gives it the green light it usually goes to a snapshot vote and snapshot is actually really good in a lot of ways. Even though it is off chain it gives a lot of control such as the quorum, the voting period. You have a lot of flexibility with your voting strategies.
00:06:46.910 - 00:07:00.782, Speaker A: If there's LP tokens, giving them voting power on chain would be really difficult. But with snapshot, yeah, it's no problem. You can just add it as an ERC 20 balance strategy.
00:07:00.782 - 00:07:12.482, Speaker A: So there are some advantages of using snapshot. The problem is the multi SIG implementation. You're essentially just signaling on snapshot and the votes aren't really binding.
00:07:12.482 - 00:07:38.960, Speaker A: So what we really wanted to create with OSNAP is a way to enforce the votes of snapshot. And yeah, that's what we're really pushing is reducing the reliance on the multisigs because Dow coordination efforts just don't mean anything if it's just signaling support and it has no actual execution on chain. I'm sure you've seen a lot of these multi SIG problems.
00:07:38.960 - 00:08:04.790, Speaker A: I think the first one multisig signers can act against the will of their community for the most part the Dow and the community and the multisig is usually aligned. However, if you're asking the multi SIG to remove themselves as a signer or pay themselves less, that could be delayed or not executed at all. The other issue is just the regulation.
00:08:04.790 - 00:08:34.094, Speaker A: Dows are not resilient at all if you're essentially relying on a few individuals that you can go into a discord and find these people, they oftentimes have ENS names attached to their wallets or their KYC. It's like how decentralized and resilient is a Dow if all you have to do is go after the multi SIG signers as regulators. So they really are a target.
00:08:34.094 - 00:09:02.182, Speaker A: And the last thing is just the burden of signing multisig transactions. It's not fun. I always ask kind of what's the process of multisig signers? How they review transactions and they kind of laugh at me because I don't think the review process there's a lot of trust involved and they typically just trust whoever is asking them to sign that transaction.
00:09:02.182 - 00:09:17.018, Speaker A: And the problem with that is the community depends on these signers to always be accurate. I mean, it only takes one transaction signed wrong with the multi SIG for essentially the Dao to go down. So that's really why we created OSNAP.
00:09:17.018 - 00:09:45.330, Speaker A: It allows the Dow to be the multi SIG. So now anybody can initiate a transaction and that can be proposed so by the community, it can be proposed by the multisig holders or it can be proposed by anyone that's not even involved in the Dao. And that's powerful because you're essentially not only allowing anyone to initiate a transaction, you're also allowing anyone to dispute.
00:09:45.330 - 00:10:08.506, Speaker A: And this works the same way as Polymarket did with the prediction market or Cozy did with the insurance. And the truth is economically incentivized because you're posting a bond when you initiate these transactions. And the challenge windows can be two or three days and so if you have to post ten WETH and someone comes in and disputes you, you're essentially losing that ten WETH.
00:10:08.506 - 00:10:25.138, Speaker A: So it's very costly, and people are very careful when they're proposing these transactions. And I think the most underrated feature of this is transactions are transparent when voting, so they're actually included in the Snapshot proposal. And I think that's a huge step forward.
00:10:25.138 - 00:10:48.182, Speaker A: You can actually look at the transactions when you're voting on Snapshot, and it's just so much more transparent. So if something is wrong with the transaction payloads, you're noticing it while you're voting, and you're not waiting essentially for that multisig signers to then execute those transactions. So this is just a quick overview of the flow.
00:10:48.182 - 00:11:07.854, Speaker A: You have your safe deployed, the OSNAP module. You can then set some custom parameters or keep the default. And then the rest of the flow is pretty much the same all the way through creating a Snapshot proposal, except you have a transaction builder at the last step where you're able to input transaction payloads.
00:11:07.854 - 00:11:41.066, Speaker A: And if the Snapshot proposal passes, you can then propose and execute those transactions. And if someone does dispute, it goes to the token holders to vote on. I think an important distinction, though, is that the resolution value that the token holders are resolving is not actually executed by the safe, so they have no control of the transaction payloads that are being so if there's a dispute, that actual proposal is deleted, and then it needs to be re proposed.
00:11:41.066 - 00:12:32.510, Speaker A: So, uma, token holders actually have no control over what's being executed or so I kind of looked at the rules of the assertion of prediction markets and insurance, and this is kind of what's proposed for OSNAP, where you're really validating if the proposal was approved on Snapshot. The Snapshot space, you're looking at the quorum and the voting period, which are actually these are just example values, but these are what are usually set by the team in Snapshot and to basically confirm that Snapshot voting system is now being exploited or otherwise unavailable. So it's a very straightforward validation process, and you can kind of see what these transactions look like in Snapshot.
00:12:32.510 - 00:13:11.740, Speaker A: And I created a proposal before this, and it's basically asking, yeah, is this transaction proposed during the ETH Global demo? So this voting period has already been completed, so I can just go in here and actually just request this. And when I'm requesting, it alerts me. What is the required bond to post? I made it zero, because this is on testnet and the challenge period is two minutes, and in production, this is two or three days with a bond of typically $5,000.
00:13:11.740 - 00:13:36.130, Speaker A: So, yeah, I signed that. And you can kind of see it'll alert you when these transactions are able to be executed. We won't wait the two minutes, but after this period is over, you will then be able to go through the same process to actually execute the transactions which will send this ETH to this address.
00:13:36.130 - 00:13:55.858, Speaker A: So we have some bounties. We'd love for everyone to build as much as they can on Uma, using pretty much any use case that makes sense to you. Our first place is $5,000.
00:13:55.858 - 00:14:18.474, Speaker A: Our second place is 2000. And then we have a pool price pool prize for anyone that uses Uma for $3,000. And also, we're always hiring, so if you are someone that's interested in working with us or know anyone that is interested, come to our booth or feel free to go to this link or just come find us.
00:14:18.474 - 00:14:33.926, Speaker A: You're not going to remember this link. All right, thank you. And any questions? That was the snapshot space.
00:14:33.926 - 00:14:55.450, Speaker A: So essentially, you would deploy the safe sorry, you would deploy the OSNAP module with that safe, and then you could go into the Snapshot settings and add the OSNAP module into that space. And in the rules of the OSNAP space, you'd want to include that space that you're governing.
