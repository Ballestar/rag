00:00:16.810 - 00:00:24.886, Speaker A: India is an amazing, massive country. One of the largest economies. It is one of the most builder oriented countries, developer oriented countries in the world has.
00:00:24.886 - 00:00:39.580, Speaker A: It's like second in most startups in the world. And so because of that, India has an enormous role to play in developing and building Web Three, both in building systems and networks and products for people in India and for people in the rest of the world.
00:00:47.710 - 00:01:04.810, Speaker B: It's so big and it's heartwarming because with Dev Folio and Polygon, like we have done it together for the multiple years. Even when COVID was there doing all these monthly hackathons, I think all of those worked. And now there's an in person hackathon and I think how many registrations were there?
00:01:04.900 - 00:01:06.690, Speaker C: We got 20,000 applications.
00:01:07.430 - 00:01:21.106, Speaker B: I think that is actually that like I keep saying that the number of developers in India, the population of developers in India, number of developers is bigger than the population of many European countries. Actually. So many developers.
00:01:21.106 - 00:01:22.486, Speaker B: And I think India is waking up.
00:01:22.508 - 00:01:48.138, Speaker D: To Web 3D is much more coming grants program. I'm super excited because the ecosystem is growing and developers have finally something to look forward to really build their focus. The ETH global community I find to be very open, very collaborative, very passionate.
00:01:48.138 - 00:01:58.650, Speaker D: I feel here is like people are very enthusiastic and also they have a great drive. People really come in here and want to do great stuff and want to hack. They're very motivated.
00:01:58.650 - 00:02:01.280, Speaker D: So that's great. I think it's a very positive energy.
00:02:05.450 - 00:02:16.866, Speaker E: Saran.
00:02:16.898 - 00:02:32.022, Speaker F: They are so enthusiastic to make these new solutions out there, getting to learn new things and it's crazy out there. I haven't expected this thing in spite of the beer market that you are saying right now. So quite excited.
00:02:32.022 - 00:02:34.678, Speaker F: I think the builders, this is like non impacted.
00:02:34.774 - 00:02:41.662, Speaker G: I think the energy is really great here. Even I heard that around like 23,000 developers have applied for ETH India. That's a huge number.
00:02:41.662 - 00:02:43.550, Speaker G: I've never seen this in any hackathon.
00:02:47.750 - 00:03:01.110, Speaker C: Then I got introduced to Dev Polio where I checked out that, hey, there's this hackathon and there's this new technology called Matic where if you build on it, you get some super good prizes. And yeah, that was my entry to Web three and haven't looked back since.
00:03:01.180 - 00:03:21.658, Speaker H: Yeah, my favorite part of the Ethlo community is that they don't do conferences, that they do hackathons because that's part of Ethereum culture. It's part of what we do to bring Ethereum to the world. The reason I believe that Ethereum has done well is because builders, developers, everyone who comes to these hacks bonds starts building and just pushes out really cool stuff.
00:03:21.744 - 00:03:36.770, Speaker I: The people that I've met here, they've all been very friendly, very welcoming. One thing that I've noticed about the traditional tech space and Web Three is people are not judgmental. We can just ask any dumb question, be it basic, complex, don't worry about it.
00:03:36.770 - 00:03:42.258, Speaker I: So be open. Put yourself out there. Yeah, you'll be fine.
00:03:42.344 - 00:03:57.718, Speaker E: Experiment a lot. Like, don't be afraid to go up to all of the booths that are here. Meet with partners, go to networking and mix a side event to make sure that you know who's here and what kind of bounties they have.
00:03:57.718 - 00:04:06.200, Speaker E: And I think it's super important to have a good team. So that's another advice. Don't be closed off.
00:04:06.200 - 00:04:11.086, Speaker E: Have fun. Find a good team, and then start. I love the energy.
00:04:11.086 - 00:04:13.498, Speaker E: Like, I love talking to hackers.
00:04:13.674 - 00:04:14.062, Speaker C: Again.
00:04:14.116 - 00:04:23.918, Speaker E: As I said, we started from here, so this just feels like home. Besides, we love meeting people who we met. Protocols make new friends and meet old ones.
00:04:23.918 - 00:04:24.880, Speaker E: So, yeah.
00:04:29.250 - 00:04:30.410, Speaker C: Eat India rocks.
