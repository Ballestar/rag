00:05:28.190 - 00:05:37.140, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I am super excited to welcome all of you to ETH Online.
00:05:37.140 - 00:05:58.906, Speaker A: You're all here watching me on ETHGlobal TV, and this is the website and the platform we'll be using for the rest of this month. This is where all the summits and talks are going to be, including the closing ceremonies with the final demos and of course, all of today. The way this works is that you can sign in on the chat and say hello and talk to us.
00:05:58.906 - 00:06:13.870, Speaker A: This is a live stream, so I can read what you're all saying. And we also have an amazing summit right after this, logistics for the hackathon. So if you have any questions for our speakers, you get to ask all of them directly in the chat and we'll be relaying them to all of our speakers.
00:06:13.870 - 00:06:30.354, Speaker A: All right, so those of you who are joining us for the first time, this event is organized by ETHGlobal. And for those of you who don't know what ETH Global is, it's an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web three ecosystem.
00:06:30.354 - 00:06:38.374, Speaker A: And we do this primarily by doing two things. We run hackathons and summits. And this month is no different.
00:06:38.374 - 00:06:52.570, Speaker A: Talking about summits, these are short four to five hour days with amazing jam pack content on relevant topics that let you understand what's happening and the latest that's happening in any given category. And this month is full of that. We're going to be running five in total.
00:06:52.570 - 00:07:07.726, Speaker A: There's going to be one almost every Friday starting today. We're going to talk about DevTools, how collaborations and dows and eats two, and the ecosystem and everything else is evolving. So check out the website for a lot of those details in the agenda.
00:07:07.726 - 00:07:23.974, Speaker A: And for the next 45 minutes or so, our focus is going to be this hackathon. So let's talk about the hackathon. This is not only our biggest event of the year, but our biggest event ever in our history.
00:07:23.974 - 00:07:42.706, Speaker A: We were absolutely mind blown with this. The amazing crowd that we have, 1600 people are hacking for the next few weeks from 96 different countries spanning 19 different time zones. We also put everybody on a map to see where everybody's joining us from, not only on the live stream, but throughout Discord, email, and all these platforms.
00:07:42.706 - 00:08:04.126, Speaker A: And it's astonishing and astounding how much diversity and the span of who's joining from where. We're kind of being welcomed from six continents being represented. And I am just so happy to see this and I can't wait to meet all of you and talk to you all on Discord, and not just the hackers.
00:08:04.126 - 00:08:40.862, Speaker A: We also have 35 ecosystem partners and 110 ecosystem mentors that are going to be here with us for the next few weeks, helping you make sure that your projects are successful and you are unblocked on them. And to top it all off, we have $350,000 in prizes that are going to be given away and we'll talk about what these prizes are, how you can win them, and all the details about receiving them. But before we get into all those details, I want to thank some of our amazing partners who, without their help, we'd not be able to make this hackathon this big and amazing.
00:08:40.862 - 00:09:43.362, Speaker A: So I want to quickly thank optimism superfluid Ave grant style scale labs polygon IPFS and Filecoin WorldCoin ENS uma aurora EPNS the Graph kronos live peer apewine AP wine abacus unstoppable domains connect lens spruce covalent tablend QuickNote NFT port vallast debris Teller streamer sysmo oasis OT ceramic unlock and Xmtp Labs So we're going to bring some of them on to talk about why they're excited to be part of the sackcon too. But before we get into all of that, let's quickly cover a lot of the logistics for this month. The goal here is for me to talk about how all these things work, team formation, how you can get help, all the prizes you can win, all the talks and workshops that are happening altogether, how judging and submissions are going to go.
00:09:43.362 - 00:10:04.746, Speaker A: We're going to also cover summits and just what's going to be the agenda. And after this logistics ends, we're going to roll directly into our first summit of this month, which is all about DevTools and how you can learn about the latest advancements in building on Web Three. So, first things first, communication is kind of the most important thing.
00:10:04.746 - 00:10:29.054, Speaker A: We're going to cover everything about this hackathon and this month will be on our Discord. This Discord is only visible and available for attendees who are confirmed and have RSVP to hack and all of our partners. The way you can check this is going according to expectations is you will see an ETH Online 2022 header on your Discord sidebar.
00:10:29.054 - 00:11:00.246, Speaker A: If you do not see that with all these channels, please go back to your Hacker dashboard and see if Discord is connected properly and that will be your tell. If you are running into any issues connecting Discord, please message anybody on the ETH Global team on any other Discord channel that you see or by sending us an email and we'll be able to debug why that connection is or isn't working or just isn't working. And these are also private channels, so they're only visible to participants, which means that anybody in those channels is also an attendee for this hackathon.
00:11:00.246 - 00:11:22.610, Speaker A: So you can also learn where people are from, talk to them and see what they're excited to build. As well as there are channels for getting help, for any protocol that we have on board that's helping us throughout this event, and for any of our partners who are giving away prizes. And also a generic help that you can ask in the mentorship help channel.
00:11:22.610 - 00:12:03.390, Speaker A: So if you are stuck with anything, whether it's about learning how some documentation works or how some protocol is set up, or just an error that you can't make sense of, just post those questions directly on those channels and somebody who's actually an expert in those things will be able to answer them to unblock you almost ASAP. On top of that, we're also going to be sending a calendar invites for a lot of the important talks and workshops, and especially for key events like submission, deadlines, judging the finale and everything in between, including some feedback. Sessions that we're going to be regularly running so you can actually understand and get some direct live feedback from some of our partners and mentors.
00:12:03.390 - 00:12:20.926, Speaker A: All of this is also going to be reflected on the website, which is the source of truth. Anything that the website says is what we'll be doing and we really want this thing to be asynchronous. There's about 100 countries that are going to be participating at this event, so we want to make sure that time zones are not a direct barrier.
00:12:20.926 - 00:12:44.030, Speaker A: So with the exception of a couple of sessions that are specific to people being on the same call, like team formation, everything will be asynchronous and you can catch up and keep up with it at your own pace and whenever you like. And for those of you who don't know where the website's at, it's online ethglobal.com. You can head over there to see all the latest details about the hackathon.
00:12:44.030 - 00:13:08.898, Speaker A: All right, let's jump into the hackathon itself. So officially the hackathon has started, which means, as of this sentence, you can start working on your projects and you can work on your projects with up to five members on your team. You can also work individually if you'd like, and you can have anywhere from one to five people on a project.
00:13:08.898 - 00:13:18.114, Speaker A: So the max is five. You cannot exceed that limit and you are good to start. You have three weeks to hack, or 23 days to be precise.
00:13:18.114 - 00:13:43.210, Speaker A: And submissions for your hackathons are due at 03:00 P.m. Eastern on Sunday, September the 25th. That gives you 23 days until the deadline and the next few weeks are going to be covering stuff around, check ins, stuff around, getting feedback, a lot more workshops and talks that you can catch up onto and going through a lot of the internals about different protocols.
00:13:43.210 - 00:14:20.934, Speaker A: If you are looking to work on some internal or some really specific protocols that you need more help and time understanding, on top of all of that, we have now a new feature where you can find potential team members who are still looking to join a project on your hacker dashboard. If you go to your team section, you'll see that you get to opt in to find a team member feature and anybody who is opt in who is officially looking to either pair up or have somebody join their team can set in their preferences and find other people who are also in that position. There are 1600 of you, over 1600 of you joining this hackathon.
00:14:20.934 - 00:14:40.994, Speaker A: So there's definitely a lot of you who are still in this position who are looking to find other members to join their team with complementary skill sets. And you can now also use this service in addition to all the calls we're going to be doing and have done to find potential team members. So check this out on your dashboard and it'll show you everybody who's interested as well.
00:14:40.994 - 00:15:04.906, Speaker A: And if it's a match, you get to contact each other directly on discord. Now let's talk about the rules and the criteria for the hackathon. One of the key things that must be adhered to is that everything that you're going to submit must be done from scratch, which means that you cannot work on a project or a side project that you have been working on already.
00:15:04.906 - 00:15:37.540, Speaker A: That also includes adding features to something that you have done that may be entirely new to just this event but are still being committed to a code repo that was from before this hackathon started. We really want to make sure this is fair and consistent with everybody else's experience, so you cannot build from a preexisting personal projects. If we find out that this has been the case, that team will be disqualified from this event and no prizes will be given to the team.
00:15:37.540 - 00:16:05.978, Speaker A: And a really important note is that only RSVP hackers are eligible to win prizes. That means if you are working with a team and each of those team members has not RSVP'd and confirmed as a hacker and they do not show up on the team section on your project and your dashboard itself if you win any prizes. We will not be giving prizes to anybody that was not listed on the team.
00:16:05.978 - 00:16:26.180, Speaker A: So it's your final kind of calls to make sure that you ping everybody who was on your team to verify, confirm and have them show up as a team member on your dashboard. And if you have any questions about these things, let us know. You can ping anybody on the team on Discord or over email and we'll be happy to answer those questions for you.
00:16:26.180 - 00:16:50.560, Speaker A: Let's talk about judging. So submissions are due on Sunday 25th at 03:00 P.m.. And the way judging is set up is that there are two parallel tracks.
00:16:50.560 - 00:17:05.384, Speaker A: There's going to be a main judging that is about going to be a synchronous session. This is one of the only key times where everybody must be on an actual call independent of the time zone, and that's going to be from 12:00 P.m. To 02:30 P.m.
00:17:05.384 - 00:17:36.032, Speaker A: Eastern on Monday the 26th. And then for anybody going for partner prizes, there's going to be an Asynchronous track where all of you who are trying to go for a price. Those projects will be sent to each of our partners and they'll be reviewing everything on their own asynchronously and if they have any questions for those teams, they will be pinging you directly on discord or email, clarifying anything that they'd like to know before they decide who is going to be the ultimate winner for each of those prizes.
00:17:36.032 - 00:17:50.004, Speaker A: But I want to focus a little bit more on the main judging. The main judging is going to be a synchronous call, which means that everybody as a team comes on and demos what they built. Each team will get four minutes to do a demo of what they prepared.
00:17:50.004 - 00:18:13.152, Speaker A: So make sure you are concise in really communicating what you are doing and what you have done over the past three weeks. And this will be a video submission only. Which means for your demo and your submissions on the Sunday, the day before judging starts, you are required to upload a four minute video or max four minute video, talking about what you built with a demo team.
00:18:13.152 - 00:18:41.556, Speaker A: Any other additional information? And that's what you are going to be showing to our judges. And we see this all the time, but we really recommend that you do not do this last minute because this will take a lot of time in making sure it's concise and it fits in the format limit. All these details are going to be available and visible to you on your dashboard as we get closer to the submission deadline and we'll be sharing a lot more of these specifics.
00:18:41.556 - 00:19:19.350, Speaker A: But you can also get a quick peek at what this process looks like by heading over to your ETH online info center and that will talk about the judging and submission process altogether. And you can also see some sample previous submissions about really projects that we like for the submission formats and you can use that as a reference and really prepare an amazing demo for the judging. So all this is on the dashboard, we're just giving you a heads up here and all these things will become more and more common and communicated really well in more specific details over the next two weeks.
00:19:19.350 - 00:19:43.224, Speaker A: And of course, we recognize that there's a lot of you who are trying to get into web Three and are trying to explore what's possible. So don't worry. This event is designed to be beginner friendly and that is why we have so much focus on amazing talks and workshops and these summits and all these things are insured to really satisfy every type of skill sets, whether you're a beginner or an expert.
00:19:43.224 - 00:20:19.576, Speaker A: And this is also the reason why if you are feeling like you are too overwhelmed that you're not able to understand everything that's happening or you want to catch up more, you can just tune into the summits as an outsider too. Everything is going to be live streamed and public and open and summits are happening every Friday. And for the hacker specifically, all the details around, from submissions to any rules and edge cases to logistics around the entire month of September will be listed on your info center, including any frequently asked questions.
00:20:19.576 - 00:20:42.930, Speaker A: And the most common question we get and want to address is, yes, everything is going to be recorded. So if you're not seeing this live right now on ETHGlobal TV, the same video will be available on our YouTube immediately after this live stream ends. And you can just head over to slash ETHGlobal or just go directly to the website online ethglobal.com,
00:20:42.930 - 00:21:01.876, Speaker A: to click on the schedule item itself and see the video recording of that event. We'll make sure it's really accessible to everybody and these things will be there for all of you to catch up at your own pace. So no need to prioritize something else over this.
00:21:01.876 - 00:21:31.612, Speaker A: If you have other obligations, focus on making sure you are able to catch up when you'd like. All right, now let's get into some of the fun stuff, which is some of our partners who want to talk about why they're excited to be part of this event and all the prizes. And after that, we will get into talking about all the summit details and kick off with our Devtool summit.
00:21:31.612 - 00:21:39.250, Speaker A: So, first up, I'd like to invite Kelvin from Optimism to share why he's excited to be part of it online.
00:21:42.200 - 00:22:00.760, Speaker B: And now our feature presentation. It's me, the very serious person named Kelvin. And today I'm talking to you about the only serious blockchain called optimism.
00:22:01.420 - 00:22:06.730, Speaker A: This is a very serious situation and they need to take certain steps to protect themselves.
00:22:07.120 - 00:22:17.260, Speaker B: If you're building on optimism, you better only build serious applications. You know how serious I am. Look at this optimist.
00:22:17.260 - 00:22:58.076, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that's right. So why should you build on optimism? Because we are solving the public goods funding problem. Because it turns out the whole point of everything that we've been doing for years has been to make actual widespread societal impact with the work that we've been doing.
00:22:58.076 - 00:23:30.896, Speaker B: It's not just to take the yam and to put the yam in the cup, and then somehow, because you put the yam in the cup with the east, it turns into two yams. And then you take the second yam and you put it and you leverage it and you turn it into SGE somehow, and you put it in the bean pot, and the bean pot gives you more yams. People are doing this with the yams and the bean pots.
00:23:30.896 - 00:23:32.656, Speaker B: It doesn't make any sense. There's no pepe.
00:23:32.688 - 00:23:33.716, Speaker C: Sylvia, you got to be kidding me.
00:23:33.738 - 00:23:48.408, Speaker B: I got boxes full of pepe. But you know what we could be doing instead is having a real societal impact. So, optimism, we made a blockchain, right? Because we realized you got to scale this stuff.
00:23:48.574 - 00:23:49.192, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:23:49.326 - 00:24:05.920, Speaker B: You got to scale this stuff. And then we were like, wait a minute. Actually, what we're trying to achieve is to use this software that we have constructed in these societal, these crypto economic frameworks that we've constructed to achieve something.
00:24:05.920 - 00:24:22.580, Speaker B: In this case, we believe that we can create a better funding model for public goods. And we start by focusing on open source software because that's what we know. So I'm just saying, build on optimism.
00:24:22.580 - 00:24:46.590, Speaker B: Breaking. You think they like that, dexter this guy.
00:24:57.780 - 00:25:10.180, Speaker A: That was the amazing Kelvin talking about optimism. As a note, I had not seen that video before this thing because I was told that I need to react to this live. And it is incredible.
00:25:10.180 - 00:25:30.590, Speaker A: So you also get to see what optimism is doing for prizes, but hopefully you get a better glimpse into what optimism is from those last two minutes. A very serious blockchain. All right, up next is Fran from Superfluid and he's going to talk about streaming money.
00:25:31.440 - 00:25:43.224, Speaker E: I'm Fran, one of the founders of Superfluid, and I'm super excited to welcome you all to ETH online this year. This, I think, is the second time we sponsor ETH online. And at Superfluid, we love hackathons.
00:25:43.224 - 00:26:04.596, Speaker E: We've seen some amazing projects come out from last year, and we're very excited to see what you get up to and what you hack over this month. What we do at Superfluid is digitally native programmable cash flows. Using Superfluid, you can send streams of money without needing to lock up the capital upfront and with full programmability, which means you can let your mind loose and build some crazy stuff.
00:26:04.596 - 00:26:13.636, Speaker E: So what does money streaming mean? So these are basically open ended transfer of funds. You set up a stream and it goes every second. It keeps moving money, it's fully liquid.
00:26:13.636 - 00:26:21.272, Speaker E: The recipient can spend the money as they get it, and you can collateralize your stream as you go. By doing this, the recipient gets paid every second. There's no delays.
00:26:21.272 - 00:26:25.384, Speaker E: They never risk not getting paid because they're getting paid every second and there are no intermediaries.
00:26:25.432 - 00:26:25.596, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:25.618 - 00:26:39.132, Speaker E: It's web free. It's completely on chain, fully permissionless, and anybody can use it. So basically you can imagine with Superfluid we're switching up a bit the way you pay, right? Instead of paying at the end of a period, you basically get paid throughout the period.
00:26:39.132 - 00:26:55.264, Speaker E: Right. So the way we like talking about it is that we're moving from recurring payments to ongoing streams, right? This is the web free native way. So what can you do with it? You can do subscriptions, you can do salaries, you can do social tokens, right? Maybe you're paying your community or reward for joining your discord.
00:26:55.264 - 00:27:13.976, Speaker E: You can build some interesting DPI products and of course, a lot of games, right? Imagine a game that sends you their own in game currency as long as you're playing them. So how do you get started? Well, the first thing, you can go to our dashboard that's app Superfluid finance. And here you can start experiencing what money streams are like as a developer.
00:27:13.976 - 00:27:27.340, Speaker E: We also have an amazing tool called the Console, which will allow you to visualize what other people are doing. You can see your contract address and you can start exploring the subgraph as well. Building with Superfluid, you'll find a lot of interesting and useful tools.
00:27:27.340 - 00:27:52.228, Speaker E: We've got SDKs and JavaScript and TypeScript, subgraph, solidity libraries, example applications, and a list of interesting hack ideas for you to get started getting your brainstorming session going. But if not, we have also a Discord channel where we have a lot of ideas going all the time. If your experience at the hackathon is great, after the hackathon, we would love you to join the Superfluid reactor.
00:27:52.228 - 00:28:15.216, Speaker E: This is basically an acceleration program where we will take you from your prototype to getting ready to raise funds or go live in production. It's a completely free program that we run only with the best teams out of hackathons. So when you're building out a hackathon, don't think about it as a prototype, think about it as your first step into web free and into building an amazing project.
00:28:15.216 - 00:28:18.816, Speaker E: So yeah. Welcome everyone. It's a month long and please come.
00:28:18.838 - 00:28:29.350, Speaker A: And hack on Superfluid. Awesome. That was Fran on Superfluid, and we'll talk about all the Superfluid prizes very soon.
00:28:29.350 - 00:28:35.958, Speaker A: And next up, we have Jess from Ave Grant style. Hi everyone.
00:28:36.044 - 00:28:44.950, Speaker F: My name is Jess. I'm the Developer Relations Engineer at Aave. If you haven't heard of Aave, it's a decentralized liquidity protocol where you can supply and borrow different cryptographic assets.
00:28:44.950 - 00:28:57.614, Speaker F: Ave is one of the largest and most exciting DFI protocols, and it's deployed across a number of different chains. We're so excited to be participating in ETH. Online and RB Grants are offering $20,000 worth of prizes for you to integrate with and build.
00:28:57.614 - 00:29:10.062, Speaker F: On top of the RBI protocol, you must build a project relating to one or more of the prize categories. And for each category, you could win $3,000 for first place and $1,000 for second place. We have five prize categories.
00:29:10.062 - 00:29:24.674, Speaker F: For the first category, we're looking for projects and integrations that can bring more stablecoin liquidity into Arbe. The second category uses the Lens protocol to assess the reputation of profiles for credit delegation. And the third category looks at accessibility.
00:29:24.674 - 00:29:41.690, Speaker F: Think about what new ways could help users to access the Aave protocol. The fourth category is an Aave Forex tool. Can you help users to access Forex liquidity using features like Flash loans or DeFi integrations? And finally, the fifth category is to create new ways to compose or visualize RV transactions.
00:29:41.690 - 00:29:52.260, Speaker F: We, the team, are here to support you as well as the RV Grant staff. So please do reach out to us on Discord and let us know what you're building on Twitter and Lens. Thank you so much and we can't wait to see what you build.
00:29:58.680 - 00:30:10.250, Speaker A: Thank you, Jess. And next up, we have Connor from Scale. Hello.
00:30:10.400 - 00:30:12.542, Speaker D: Welcome to ETH. Online. 2022.
00:30:12.542 - 00:30:27.890, Speaker D: My name is Connor Murphy and I run business development at Scale Labs. Scale Labs is the core team bootstrapping and shepherding the Scale network. Now, Scale network was purposely built to bring Ethereum to billions of users by providing them zero gas fees.
00:30:27.890 - 00:30:53.530, Speaker D: And Scale is able to achieve this through its transformative multi chain approach. Through this approach and leveraging Ethereum's base layer of security, developers finally have a high performant blockchain with instant finality and once again zero gas fees. Now, what is this exactly solving? Well, currently across the industry, many blockchains are monolithic or just single databases.
00:30:53.530 - 00:31:16.660, Speaker D: And as demand increases, we see a squeeze on supply. And as many of us saw over the last couple of years, users have to deal with this squeeze either through increased gas fees, slow blockchains, or even worse, the blockchain crashing monolithic blockchains just can't solve this supply demand equation. And this is where Scale steps in.
00:31:16.660 - 00:31:35.430, Speaker D: These monolithic blockchains are realizing that they can't solve it by being a single database and they need to pivot to being MultiChain. Well, Scale has been MultiChain since inception. And as demand increases, more nodes enter the network and Scale is able to limitlessly add more supply.
00:31:35.430 - 00:31:48.938, Speaker D: This allows for a ton of gas fee savings. And Scale is building for a future of mass adoption. One where we use blockchains every day through gaming, DFI, Web Three and more.
00:31:48.938 - 00:32:07.294, Speaker D: And unfortunately, with the gas fees that we saw over the past year, this just isn't possible. We would never be able to hit the scale we want to hit with users paying these gas fees. And this is why we built Scale scales v Two launched this past July and we've already seen massive growth.
00:32:07.294 - 00:32:21.510, Speaker D: We're working with new DApps every day and working to save end users millions upon millions of dollars. We'd love to have you join the Scaleverse. Please find our documentation here or reach out to any of the core team members on Discord or Twitter.
00:32:26.350 - 00:32:30.010, Speaker A: Awesome. Next up, we have polygon.
00:32:37.730 - 00:32:52.270, Speaker C: Hello everyone. This is Sandeepan from the Polygon Deverel team and we are very excited to partner up with ETH Global for the flagship online hackathon, ETH Online, to give you a little bit about context about Polygon. Polygon is a good solution of Ethereum scalability.
00:32:52.270 - 00:33:08.650, Speaker C: It's blazing fast, it's secure, it's decentralized. The problem statement that Polygon solves is that no size fits. It's all like different use cases are being built out at Polygon with ZK and other types of optimistic rollups coming up in the future.
00:33:08.650 - 00:33:29.514, Speaker C: And there is also no formalized framework that's when the Polygon solution comes in with a Swiss Army knife for Ethereum scalability with ZK rollups, optimistic rollups, enterprise related chains, security chains, and definitely the beloved plasma chains. So building on polygon. Developers love building on Polygon and hope you have an excellent time this time in this hackathon.
00:33:29.514 - 00:33:37.842, Speaker C: Also, the backward compatibility. Polygon. Is Ethereum EVM compatible? You can use all the tools and infrastructure you already love.
00:33:37.842 - 00:33:51.318, Speaker C: You don't need to learn anything new. For this hackathon we are giving out 20K in prizes and there are main three tracks. The general track is like first price will go $5,000, 2nd price 3003rd, price 2000.
00:33:51.318 - 00:34:04.618, Speaker C: There's also a best innovative DAP built on Polygon. So we always see a generic kind of DApps built on. But what can be a unique use case if you can think about in that case and there's a $3,000 price for that track.
00:34:04.618 - 00:34:19.470, Speaker C: And then definitely some of the unique projects being built on Polygon will be awarded with the pool prize and seven winners will be selected, $1,000 each. Thanks a lot everyone. I hope you guys have a great time building in the hackathon.
00:34:24.130 - 00:34:33.518, Speaker A: Amazing. That was Sandeepan from Polygon and our last one is going to be Nikki from IPFS and Filecoin. And Nikki will be joining us live.
00:34:33.518 - 00:34:39.670, Speaker A: So please welcome Nikki to share about whether excited to partner with Ethanline.
00:34:43.470 - 00:34:56.320, Speaker G: Hi everyone. My name is Nikki and I work on developer onboarding initiatives at Filecoin. I'm very excited to be here to wish you all good luck for ETH Online 2022.
00:34:56.320 - 00:35:37.130, Speaker G: Hackathons are a great place to experiment and get your hands dirty and build projects and who knows, someday some of them might also turn into million dollar fundraising companies. I represent IPFS and Filecoin and as most of you know, we are on a mission to decentralize the internet and by extension decentralized storage. While our challenge statement is the best use of NFT storage or web three storage to use IPFS for content addressing and Filecoin for persistent decentralized storage, it is kind of broad to encourage any and all ideas that might come out of this hackathon.
00:35:37.130 - 00:36:04.830, Speaker G: However, here's a tip. We would love to see some devtooling solutions that can help other developers easily use IPFS or Filecoin or projects that are web three versions of web two apps that are an essential part of our lives today. The question we are really looking to answer is how do we solve problems that come in the way to really scale and help apps and users move to decentralized storage? I hope that inspires you.
00:36:04.830 - 00:36:30.880, Speaker G: We have $20,000 in total in Bounties to give away for you to use IPFS and Filecoin in your projects. We do have a pool prize as well for up to 25 teams in addition to top three prizes. We'll share all of these details on Discord and our dev advocates will be there to answer any questions you have or help with difficulties you run into.
00:36:30.880 - 00:36:44.990, Speaker G: We'll be here to encourage you even after the hackathon. So please think of this as a first step with our grants and accelerator program and so don't be discouraged if you don't win in this one. Good luck and happy hacking.
00:36:44.990 - 00:36:47.010, Speaker G: Thanks Karthik. Thanks Jacob.
00:36:49.670 - 00:36:51.778, Speaker A: Thanks Nikki. That was awesome. And you.
00:36:51.778 - 00:37:09.574, Speaker A: Can also check out all these things on your hacker dashboard now. All right, so before we go into all the other prizes and all the specifics of a prize, I want to give a quick reminder about how check ins work. And you may have seen this on your dashboard and on the info center, but it's a very simple thing.
00:37:09.574 - 00:37:21.050, Speaker A: We're going to do check ins every week. This is a way for us to kind of quickly see how things are going and make sure that you are not stuck. And if you are stuck, you're getting any help getting unblocked, whether it's on the code side or anything else.
00:37:21.050 - 00:37:40.398, Speaker A: And it really kind of helps us make sure that you are able to really accomplish your goals and continue to get to the end product of what you are excited to build. And your stakes are also tied to this thing. So checking also helps you get to the path of making sure you are satisfying participating at the hackathon.
00:37:40.398 - 00:37:56.434, Speaker A: All this thing happens over your dashboard. So the way these things are set up is that every check in will start appearing on your dashboard early every week and you'll also be notified of these things. So don't worry if you don't see anything now because they are not going to be visible.
00:37:56.434 - 00:38:29.700, Speaker A: They will start showing up early next week as a simple form that just says how things are going and if you need any help. So keep in mind that those things are going on and they also help you really prep for any of the feedback sessions we'll be hosting. So you can come on to those feedback sessions and ask any of our mentors or our partners for advice, help, direct support, kind of like office hours, and really see what everybody else is building as well and all that is tied all together as part of the next three weeks.
00:38:29.700 - 00:38:43.510, Speaker A: All right, let's go into all of the prizes. You kind of did get a sneak preview of some of these things, but I'll still go into a lot more detail about every partner that is giving out a prize. We're going to start off with the Ave grant style.
00:38:43.510 - 00:39:03.998, Speaker A: Lots of prizes being given away. That is about $20,000 of prizes from the Ave grants team and they are separated by different categories. So if you are building any project that covers the stablecoin and growth category, you will be able to receive 3000 for the first place and 1000 for the second runner up place.
00:39:03.998 - 00:39:32.358, Speaker A: Any Ave related hack that tackles credit delegation will be receiving 3000 for the first place and 1000 for runner up. Any project on the Ave protocol that addresses accessibility will be receiving 3000 for the first place and 1000 for second. Any Ave integration that covers forex and applications around that category will be receiving 3000 for the first place and 2000 for the second.
00:39:32.358 - 00:39:49.162, Speaker A: And any Ave transaction builder related hack will be receiving 3000 for the first place and 1000 for runner up. Then we have the IPFS and FalcoIn prizes. So a lot of prizes being given away as well from the IPFS teams.
00:39:49.162 - 00:40:19.382, Speaker A: They're going to categorize them as Storage Wizard prizes. So the best integrations on IPFS filecoin network related projects will be receiving best three integrations will be receiving $3,000 each denominated in filecoin tokens. And there's also a pool price category which means that up to 25 teams will be splitting $11,000 amongst themselves delivered in filecoin tokens as well.
00:40:19.382 - 00:40:31.450, Speaker A: So that means a lot of people can potentially qualify. And there's up to 28 teams that can win prizes from the IPFS filecoin team. Then you have polygon.
00:40:31.450 - 00:41:00.410, Speaker A: Polygon is giving prizes in a lot of different categories. So to scale your applications on Polygon as the qualifier you will be receiving $5,000 for the first place, $2,000 for $3,000 for the second place and $2,000 for the third place. And the most innovative DAP and DApps built on Polygon will be receiving $3,000 for kind of being the best app from all the submissions.
00:41:00.410 - 00:41:18.980, Speaker A: And then there's going to be seven runner up prizes where the top seven teams that are leveraging the Polygon ecosystem and deploying on Polygon will be receiving $1,000 each. Next up we have Superfluid. So Superfluid is also giving.
