00:00:02.890 - 00:00:24.430, Speaker A: This is not a conference. If you've been to an Ecobol event, you'll know that this is a hackathon. This is our first event in Portugal.
00:00:25.370 - 00:00:26.120, Speaker B: It.
00:00:28.970 - 00:00:34.822, Speaker A: Yeah. Love the passion of the hackers here. It's been great to see people diving in, hacking on things, asking really good questions.
00:00:34.822 - 00:00:38.630, Speaker A: Many people think this is a really competitive thing, and it's not. And I like that.
00:00:38.700 - 00:00:42.902, Speaker C: When you finally achieve what you were trying to do, that's, like the best.
00:00:42.956 - 00:01:00.170, Speaker B: Momentum. It's.
