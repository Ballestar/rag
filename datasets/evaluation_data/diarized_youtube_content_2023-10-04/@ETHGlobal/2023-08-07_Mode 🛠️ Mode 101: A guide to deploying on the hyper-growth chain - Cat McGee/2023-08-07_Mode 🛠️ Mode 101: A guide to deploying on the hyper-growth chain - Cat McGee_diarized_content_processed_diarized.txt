00:00:07.290 - 00:00:19.120, Speaker A: Hello everyone and welcome to the SuperHack Mode Workshop mode 101, a guide to deploying on the hypergrowth chain. Joining us today is Kat McGee who will be taking us through this session. And with that, I'll pass it over to Kat to get the session started.
00:00:20.610 - 00:00:41.930, Speaker B: Hey everybody. Very excited to be here. This is actually super special. So I'm a developer relations engineer. Today I'm going to be soft with you and introducing for the very first time mode. I say first time, but I am still in stealth mode right now. We're like in stealth.
00:00:41.930 - 00:01:45.162, Speaker B: So listen, black first like introductions to the world global for a very long time and it just made sense for us to jump on the super hack and talk with all these amazing operators partners. We are an Lt on Op stack, so it just makes hell of a sense for us and it's very exciting. So a little bit about what the hypergrowth chain actually means. We have noticed through all of our years and lock in that there's kind of one big issue with it and there's a ton of developers like building and projects, but actually growing those projects it's difficult to do. And turning really good code or really good tech into businesses is something that we haven't quite built in blockchain yet. So the point of this L two is kind of standards for two different things. We've got technology based right into the protocol level that's going to really incentivize have growth mechanics that have KPIs and have everything that you need to just develop like a working application that's going to get users.
00:01:45.162 - 00:02:29.718, Speaker B: You guys focus on the code and then this kind of does all the business stuff for you. And then also on the other side, we're really focused on just growing an ecosystem, running a community. This was built by people who've been actually building hundreds of blockchain projects for like seven years or something. So we want to support developers that are doing this and we have that side as well. So it's both kind of the technology and an ecosystem of really good people. So why both? So we're kind of trying to build this whole big incentivized system that isn't just the idea of blockchain, but actually is on the protocol layer, an ecosystem and a community. So the way that we're doing that is through loads of different features.
00:02:29.718 - 00:03:09.634, Speaker B: But these are just some examples that we are working on from me and that at the moment we have contract secured revenue. So any developer who publishes a smart contract is going to actually get some fees from the transactions that go through to the smart contract. And this is something that we really feel it's just going to incentivize. Like you don't have to think about how you're going to make money, your contract is going to make money for you immediately without any sort of extra stuff added to it. You just have to grow that and then just add to hop routes. Then there's like referral revenues, the whole point of the ecosystem and the community working together. So anyone who refers developers, new users, new protocols is going to get a share of the transaction fee revenue onto that as well.
00:03:09.634 - 00:03:57.122, Speaker B: That's just like this growth ecosystem going to incentivize people. Very exciting. And then there's also this dashboard and tooling. And this is honestly what I think is the most exciting part about Moot in that developers can just like we can forget about all the marketing stuff and all the boring and growth stuff and KPIs, what kind of stuff do you have to give to PC is to get money? It's all going to be on these apps and reach tools and stuff in there and you can just focus on building what you're building and it's grow and become a better for you. Which is I say probably the most exciting thing about both. So today I kind of want to go through like a deployment guide. It's just an EVF gene so it's very easy to do just like any other EVM gene.
00:03:57.122 - 00:04:25.194, Speaker B: I think Optimism just had a workshop there. He explained how this is going to work and it's basically the same but just for extra steps because we are like a brand new Tin still in sales mode. So first thing you got to do is mode to 911. Obviously super simple. We're on TN list, we are Tnid nine one nine. So just head on to Gnlist and go to mode. So just type in Node instead of doing what's like and then you get to add that to MetaMask if you want to do it manually.
00:04:25.194 - 00:05:02.394, Speaker B: If you don't trust chainlit for whatever reason, you can find all the information you need for adding it to MetaMask inner docs docs mode network. There's some other resources and stuff there too like deployment guides and Python works and the point of it and everything there too. If you want to learn some more information after that you need to get the Polio e. We don't have a faucet yet on road so we only have a bridge. So if you just get the polio we also have some. We can send it to you to our discord or you can use this by alchemy Sepoliafossit.com. After that you bridge Sepolia to mode.
00:05:02.394 - 00:05:47.242, Speaker B: So just bridge mode network, super easy to use, plug in how much you want to bridge over, make sure you are connected with your sepulia ethereum MetaMask and then we can also send you some as well. If you don't want to go through this process, just send us a message on partner mode on Discord and we'll DM you and figure that out and get you some mode east. So for deploying it's just the same as anything else. All you have to do is set us into your config file. So remix obviously super simple as long as you're connected to mode onto MetaMask. You just deploy using MetaMask and you can get your contact from mode. Hard hat add modes, hard hat config truffle add mode to truffle config same as anything.
00:05:47.242 - 00:06:30.514, Speaker B: We also have a guide online for third web. We're working with Kitty quoting with them and we think they are just super awesome for getting stuff up and running. So if you want to use third one or any sort of other tool, just go onto your docs and you'll be able to see like a really easy guide for that. And yet you just have to gyrate an API key for them with that was reading the message. Yeah, click them, mode network logged in and then you're sorted. So this is a pretty short presentation because I just kind of wanted to introduce both to the world which is like super exciting. We are offering ten fiver in USD at this hackathon to some really cool Wacky projects.
00:06:30.514 - 00:06:48.522, Speaker B: We just want you to build like cool stuff. So we're about three K. Give her the best overall that can be in any theme, anything. This is going to blow people away. So that's three K for that two K. Best developer tool. Super important because we want to be building up amazing developer ecosystem and user ecosystem.
00:06:48.522 - 00:07:11.622, Speaker B: Two k for best use of AI. I think is going to be a pretty huge theme of this hackathon. Seeing some of the other prizes involved. So this can be as well like anything your heart desires for AI. Just want to see it integrated pretty well. And then we have two kids with the most weird idea which I'm excited for this too. So anything that you in your dream on that probably shouldn't be built, just build it.
00:07:11.622 - 00:07:26.746, Speaker B: We just want to see like weird stuff. Crazy stuff. Stuff that you maybe shouldn't exist but we want to make it exist so we have something for that too. Just be crazy. Make memes like do whatever you want. Something that you've maybe thought of. Build it.
00:07:26.746 - 00:07:52.978, Speaker B: We want to see that. And then once it's in price pool you can see how to qualify for that on basically any project. Doesn't win any of the other practices you deploy under. You're going to be eligible for the price pool. Some ideas. Since we are in Nujin, we're pretty much impressed in anything we have. Not much so far like deployed onto vote so we're looking for anything.
00:07:52.978 - 00:08:29.450, Speaker B: Anything you want to build like is going to be super awesome. But these are some of the ideas that us and the team are just like super into. So obviously integration of other projects and we want to get crossed in, get some oracles in there, get some queries graph maybe and other sponsoring just some interesting things. There other chains we don't have it yet on both so that would be so, so awesome. Just to build the seeker system, identity system as well. Is going to be really important for mode main net as well because we're doing this reputation system and referral system. How are we going to actually have several resistance and identity on that chain.
00:08:29.450 - 00:08:56.182, Speaker B: So something for that would be super interesting. It's something that we need data visualization. So obviously we are working on dashboard so we do have some sort of high level visualization but just more and more is obviously good. So any sort of blockchain visualization tools. It looks awesome. We want it to just be attract users and stuff, love that kind of stuff. Decentralized exchanges, user focus kind of stuff like that.
00:08:56.182 - 00:09:12.662, Speaker B: Integrated DeFi as well. So stuff is also crazy. Like there's so much you could do in DeFi. Be creative, be weird and be wacky with it. Get some weird DeFi project. I think that'd be really cool. You also maybe integrate AI, get some user friendly DeFi.
00:09:12.662 - 00:09:45.174, Speaker B: Could be interesting. Power destruction, anything for maybe like an AA wallet for modes. Something that's like themed after road could be really cool. That's also probably a pretty huge theme of attackathon then. Just like we love games as well. I know the team has built a ton of blockchain based games and stuff, but that's something I know we're super into. So something that actually utilizes blockchain in a game pretty well and it's just like weird and crazy.
00:09:45.174 - 00:10:17.214, Speaker B: You just thought of a game that no one were going to play that you think it's funny, give it a go. Or there's like Instagram ads that you always see that are just like weird games. They're funny, let's build that. Build whatever you want. But we love games. Ideas for the AI pride providing AI into NFTs we've seen AI integrated really well into various global hacks and people are doing some pretty stuff with it. Like you could just talk very much in or you could use AI to do swaps and stuff.
00:10:17.214 - 00:10:42.330, Speaker B: We've seen projects like that. They're awesome. I haven't seen anything that actually combines AI with game applications. I think that's a really cool use case. So something that does that creatively would be really cool. AI for gas prediction as well. You could maybe combine this with a kind of extraction and if you submit transaction with the chin, it looks the chin, it's like, okay, well it's going to be cheapest if we do this in 20 minutes instead of nine.
00:10:42.330 - 00:11:33.530, Speaker B: So maybe you can just load it and then it kind of shots in and then it gets over to the chin or something. It's cool. So tons of ideas we're also interested in ZK didn't want to put it here because I don't think there's any ZK protocols actually sponsoring Super Hawk but having anything to do with privacy or damage groups on that would be insane. Something I want to stress as well is that because we're all about build developers, being entrepreneurs and really build this ecosystem up and because we are still very early stages of mode. We want to keep working with you, we want to turn you into entrepreneurs, we want to make your project successful in the sense of that we're going to be offering grouts to awesome products that we built here. You guys are going to be the first people to go through our grout systems. That's really exciting.
00:11:33.530 - 00:12:03.842, Speaker B: So if you're interested in that, when you're submitting a project into ETH Global, you'll be able to click tick a box that says, we're interested in grants. So just make sure you tick that if you're interested in because we really want to get some awesome developers building awesome stuff on mode. That is it. So, a lot of time here. The most important thing is just to enjoy the hackathon. We are partner mode on Discord. In the global discord, come and say hi.
00:12:03.842 - 00:12:20.220, Speaker B: We're always there, even if you're not like hackathon mode, just say hi, we'll look for you. Anyway. So, yeah, if anyone's got any questions and soon chat is open, feel free to send some stuff into there. Otherwise I think this one's pretty short.
00:12:23.070 - 00:12:58.494, Speaker A: Awesome. Cheers, thank you. Yeah, if anybody has any questions, feel free to type them in the chat or take yourself off mute and ask away. And if there are no questions, then, yeah, as Kat said, definitely reach out to the team on the Discord Channel. They will be there and happy to assist as you all progress through the hackathon over the next couple of days. But, yeah, I think that's it. So.
00:12:58.494 - 00:13:09.590, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks, Kat. Thanks for the great workshop and presentation and yeah, thank you all, everybody else, for attending. Have a great rest of your Friday and have a great weekend and happy hacking.
00:13:11.050 - 00:13:13.750, Speaker B: Thanks, Darren. Good luck.
00:13:14.170 - 00:13:14.982, Speaker A: Cheers. Thank you.
00:13:15.036 - 00:13:17.300, Speaker B: See you all in the discord. Bye, everyone.
