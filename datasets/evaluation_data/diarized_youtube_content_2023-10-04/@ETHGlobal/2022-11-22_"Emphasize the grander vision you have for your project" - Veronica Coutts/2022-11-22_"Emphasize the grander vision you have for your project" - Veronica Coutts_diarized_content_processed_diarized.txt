00:00:00.570 - 00:00:06.954, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Veronica Kus. I've been in crypto since 2017. I work for optimal for first time hackers.
00:00:06.954 - 00:00:19.482, Speaker A: I would give the advice of actually plan out what you're going to build before you build it. Don't just rush into building it does not go like well, like that. And also leave time at the end to actually pull together your project into a real presentation.
00:00:19.482 - 00:00:33.410, Speaker A: Really try demo the product that you've built, but also really emphasize where you're trying to take what is the grander vision that you want to build. After the hackathon, judges love to see that you're actually thinking about building a real product and not just a one call hackathon.
