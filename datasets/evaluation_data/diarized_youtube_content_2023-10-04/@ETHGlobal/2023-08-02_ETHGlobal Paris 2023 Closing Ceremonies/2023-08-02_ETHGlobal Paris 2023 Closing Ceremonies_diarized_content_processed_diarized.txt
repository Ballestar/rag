00:00:16.490 - 00:00:18.830, Speaker A: This summer is about on chain activity.
00:00:21.490 - 00:00:34.566, Speaker B: You are able to showcase your passion to many people. This one of my favorite moments. Good evening everybody.
00:00:34.566 - 00:00:49.240, Speaker B: My name is Kartik, I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global. And welcome to ETH global Paris. All this ecosystem with the access we have here are working hard to make Paris the spot of global innovation, especially for web Three.
00:00:49.240 - 00:01:12.654, Speaker B: Good afternoon everybody. Are you all excited? Yeah. My name is Kartek, one of the co founders of Eve Global.
00:01:12.654 - 00:01:24.886, Speaker B: And let's get the show going. This is already our biggest event in Europe. Yeah, I am tired too, but we're going to have to clap a lot today.
00:01:24.886 - 00:01:40.758, Speaker B: 1400 attendees were here this entire weekend. 965 hackers from 67 different countries and 22% of them were brand new to web Three. So many people came from all across the world and of course, so many cities from Europe.
00:01:40.758 - 00:01:56.062, Speaker B: And as you all know, this is a hackathon, which means the next hour and a half is about focusing on all of our builders and showcasing everything that came out of this weekend. Let's get started. This hackathon blew my mind.
00:01:56.062 - 00:02:11.074, Speaker B: 965 hackers submitted 321 different projects. This is the most we've ever seen in a long time and we spent all of morning going through all these amazing projects. I want to thank first of all, all of our judges who took the time to talk to so many of these teams.
00:02:11.074 - 00:02:37.534, Speaker B: So please join me in thanking frankie SB, shin Patrick, Ari, Scott, Pranit, ben Summrit, Liam, Alex Yee, Katak Rahul, maria Hadrian, david Tebow, linda Ahmed's yours Simau, yuri Yoni, Fran, john and Guillaume And on top of that, we have 41 of our amazing partners are going to be talking about all the prizes that they're giving out. So stay tuned until we get to all of those prizes. So with that, I want to thank all of our amazing partners too.
00:02:37.534 - 00:03:13.426, Speaker B: And you know the drill, the faster you collapse, the faster I'll talk.

All right, let's get to these 321 projects.
00:03:13.426 - 00:03:19.462, Speaker B: We spent all of the last 5 hours going through so many of these. Actually, all of them. That's our partners, that's our judges.
00:03:19.462 - 00:03:29.674, Speaker B: All of you, you were running up and down. And from all of that, this is what happened. We picked 13 teams that are going to come on here as our finalists.
00:03:29.674 - 00:03:54.294, Speaker B: We're going to bring these teams on, they're going to demo live what they built and after that, we're going to get to all the prizes. So without further ado, actually, let's join me in welcoming our 13 finalist teams. We have Bubble Zeke and Microphone GL Swap Twitter Campaign Typhoon Cash X Kinetics Harpo State Garden Cypr Deposit BOP the solver voice sends community bound and on chain messaging aggregator all these teams are going to come on one by one.
00:03:54.294 - 00:04:10.662, Speaker B: We're going to do 13 quick demos and then we'll talk about all the prizes. But before we go into our first demo, when I just take a few seconds to talk about a couple of things. First of all, there are so many incredible projects I'm going to move out of The View so you can take a good photo.
00:04:10.662 - 00:04:19.962, Speaker B: 300 of eight of these projects. Just because you were not one of those 13 finalists does not mean you were not good enough. There are so many amazing things that were built all throughout this hackathon.
00:04:19.962 - 00:04:41.042, Speaker B: And I want to congratulate all of you for spending the weekend building something that you were excited about and shipping it and showing it to everybody else so they can also share that enjoyment. Please give yourselves a massive round of applause for building this and shipping everything in the last two days. And for anybody watching online on the live stream or all of you.
00:04:41.042 - 00:04:47.286, Speaker B: You can check out everything else that came out of this by heading over to Ethglobal.com showcase. All 300 plus projects are listed there.
00:04:47.286 - 00:05:01.574, Speaker B: You can see all the details, the demos, including all of our finalists and you can catch up on all that directly online. But before we get to the first demo, a really important note from me. This is a task on all of your dashboards.
00:05:01.574 - 00:05:19.086, Speaker B: Please take two minutes, whether it's on your phone right now when you go home tomorrow morning, but hopefully soon. So you actually remember a lot of stuff and just answer some of the basic questions we have about just rate how the food was, how the WiFi was, how the projects were, everything else. I know some of you have really valuable things that you brought us already on Discord.
00:05:19.086 - 00:05:32.790, Speaker B: We've kind of collected that, but it just helps us really make the next one even better. So just take two minutes and just answer those six or seven questions. They're simple questions too, and make our lives better so we can make the next one even better for the next thousand people.
00:05:32.790 - 00:05:39.846, Speaker B: And also, we're going to be giving out a hoodie. Five of these for anybody who fills out. No, not anybody.
00:05:39.846 - 00:05:49.018, Speaker B: A raffle from everybody who fills out. There's five randomly selected teams. People will get this hoodie, so that's another incentive for us to put on.
00:05:49.018 - 00:05:59.546, Speaker B: But even without that, I would really appreciate if you can just tell us how your experience was this weekend. Enough talking from me. Let's welcome our very first demo for today and that is Team Bubbles.
00:05:59.546 - 00:06:01.310, Speaker B: Give them a big round of applause.
00:06:08.870 - 00:06:11.358, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Hey, guys. I am Greg.
00:06:11.454 - 00:06:12.398, Speaker B: And I'm limone.
00:06:12.494 - 00:06:34.822, Speaker A: And this weekend we built Bubbles Voice chats for your favorite on chain communities and importantly that's on chain without the dash. So I'm going to go ahead and sign in with Ethereum, sign a message proving that I am who I am and right away I'm going to press Explore Live bubbles. So here you can see live right now all of the bubbles and I guess just some context.
00:06:34.822 - 00:06:47.134, Speaker A: This is basically think a clubhouse or a Twitter spaces but all based on Ethereum available from any device. So no longer do you need an iOS app to join a Twitter space and have decent audio. Cool.
00:06:47.134 - 00:06:58.338, Speaker A: So the first thing I'm going to do is join a space that is token gated to something I don't have access to and that is these lemons. Unfortunately I don't have any little lemon friends but yeah, I have plenty of.
00:06:58.344 - 00:06:59.140, Speaker B: Them again.
00:07:00.870 - 00:07:12.882, Speaker A: And cool. So you can see that these are all token gated by ERC 20s, any type of NFT and also a Sismo group which we'll get into later. But first I'm going to create a new bubble.
00:07:12.882 - 00:07:25.418, Speaker A: So this is going to be called Launch and you can see the gating options. Here are a bunch of them. So you can do it open, you can require a Farcaster account, you can require different types of NFTs and so on.
00:07:25.418 - 00:07:49.406, Speaker A: For example, if I were to choose an ERC 20, I can type a contract address and the amount of tokens that you'd need to listen to this bubble and participate. But for now, just for demo sake, I'm going to go open. Here I have a place to enter a Farcaster cast and Farcaster is a decentralized social protocol and you can see in a second how it's going to aggregate all the posts from there into my bubble.
00:07:49.406 - 00:07:57.410, Speaker A: So I'm going to press Create and go live. And here we go. I have a new bubble called Launch with the creator being Gregscrull ETH, my on chain identity.
00:07:57.410 - 00:08:20.854, Speaker A: And on the right you see that I have these replies on Farcaster. I'm going to join this space and you can see that now I'm basically speaking and Lamone is going to try and join as well and say something. But in the meantime, if I go and reply on Firecaster we're presenting right now, then in a second it should show up here and I'm going to turn up my volume.
00:08:20.982 - 00:08:24.860, Speaker B: Hey Greg, do you hear me? We're in a bubble man. Oh my God.
00:08:31.410 - 00:08:45.074, Speaker A: There we go. So yeah, you can see, I can mute, I can unmute, I'm not going to do that to cause a bunch of echo right now. But if I leave the space and I go back here, then I have an open bubble that anybody could join and chat away.
00:08:45.074 - 00:08:58.662, Speaker A: But one other thing I'm going to show that I think is a little bit cooler than some of the other token gating stuff is sismo. So token gating, we use airstack to check all the tokens that you might have. And we use Sismo if you want to do that in a privacy preserving way.
00:08:58.662 - 00:09:17.518, Speaker A: So if I go to ENS owners and I want to prove that I have an ENS name but don't reveal which one it is or who I am, I can sign in with Sysmo to do exactly that. So I'm going to generate a proof saying that I own an ENS domain. This should send me back to the website and in a second give me access to this space.
00:09:17.518 - 00:09:39.326, Speaker A: There we go. So there's nobody in it, but you can see I can join and similar to before, anybody else who does this proof would be able to join and chat with all the same functionality as before. And just to show you that the Farcaster thing hopefully worked, I'm going to go back to launch and you can see my other post right here, representing live right now at ETHGlobal TV.
00:09:39.326 - 00:09:43.338, Speaker A: So we had a great time this weekend. Bubbles is live. The bubbles.
00:09:43.338 - 00:09:51.370, Speaker A: XYZ Feel free to use it. We have some things that we want to improve, obviously, but please give us feedback. We had a great time and excited for the next ETH Global.
00:09:52.110 - 00:09:59.482, Speaker B: Thank you. Awesome. Thank you.
00:09:59.482 - 00:10:06.590, Speaker B: That was our first ever demo for ETH Global Paris 2023. Next up is ZK Microphone. Please welcome them on stage.
00:10:12.690 - 00:10:17.914, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. We have a hardware hack for you. This is ZK microphone.
00:10:17.914 - 00:10:25.330, Speaker C: But before we tell you about that, I'm going to invite our wonderful host back on stage to say a few words. Karthik, if you could come in and try out our microphone.
00:10:25.670 - 00:10:26.430, Speaker B: Sure.
00:10:26.600 - 00:10:29.778, Speaker C: What did you think about the event today, Karthik?
00:10:29.954 - 00:10:33.720, Speaker B: What do I think about the event? The event was fucking amazing.
00:10:40.250 - 00:10:46.838, Speaker D: So let me formally introduce ourselves. We are ZK microphone. We are fighting deepfakes with hyperoptimized ZK.
00:10:46.838 - 00:11:14.910, Speaker D: We're a team from homedow. Deepfakes are a state level threat to society which can threaten sort of the fabrics of society and perhaps bring end to democracy through misinformation campaigns and mass manipulation. The naive solution to deepfakes is a hardware signature that can cryptographically sign the audio to ensure hardware verification using a secret key stored in the secure enclave.
00:11:14.910 - 00:11:27.670, Speaker D: However, this is a very naive solution because it is extremely rigid and you cannot remove any background noise which could identify the audio. You can't beep out any confidential information, nor can you compress the audio.
00:11:28.490 - 00:11:32.914, Speaker E: Yes. So that brings us to our solution. So here you can see the two sides of our approach.
00:11:32.914 - 00:11:54.586, Speaker E: On the left we have our hardware, and on the right we have the software. On the left we have essentially a proof of non deepfake, which is essentially a secure enclave that signs the content of our audio. And then on the right we have our Snark, which will actually attest and verify that we are doing a transformation is what we call it, on the audio to essentially in our case, do a bleeping of the audio.
00:11:54.586 - 00:12:10.114, Speaker E: We store the result of the transformation on IPFS, which allows it to be decentralized. Anyone can access it and actually get the content of these messages. And even further, these are also available on our smart contracts, which then allow us to provide for composable solutions.
00:12:10.114 - 00:12:14.440, Speaker E: And here we have a little bit more on our IPFS solution as well. And now we'll go into a demo.
00:12:17.210 - 00:12:51.780, Speaker F: Okay, so the audio file that we just recorded at the start, we're going to take that from Telegram, which Manuj has just sent over, and I'm going to copy it over to our project and go back to our UI where we're going to select the file. Just make sure it's the right one. Nine one a Open that and let's give it a play.
00:12:53.270 - 00:12:57.160, Speaker B: What do I think about the event? The one was fucking amazing.
00:12:58.890 - 00:12:59.640, Speaker A: Okay.
00:13:00.730 - 00:13:02.040, Speaker G: Could have been better.
00:13:03.850 - 00:13:10.806, Speaker F: So I'm going to have to guess a bit where to bleep here. I think it was around is.
00:13:10.828 - 00:13:14.682, Speaker B: The last one even was fucking amazing. Yeah.
00:13:14.816 - 00:13:32.298, Speaker F: So let's try and bleep this out. So we've covered where we want to bleep, let's click bleep. And what this is doing is it's actually transforming the audio file through a set of verified transformations as part of our zero large circuit.
00:13:32.298 - 00:13:55.410, Speaker F: And that's complete. So now we can upload the edited audio file to IPFS and we can verify the proof on chain through our smart contract, which will update the mapping in the smart contract. So we can see here that it submitted a transaction, can view it on the Explorer.
00:13:55.410 - 00:14:16.480, Speaker F: It's pending right now, be confirmed pretty soon. And you can also see here, like the list of all the files in IPFS. So, yeah, like onto I think onto ATO now.
00:14:20.210 - 00:14:22.110, Speaker G: Yeah, we can show the Bleeped audio.
00:14:22.450 - 00:14:26.240, Speaker F: Yeah, let's show you the Bleeped audio to make sure that it worked.
00:14:31.000 - 00:14:31.364, Speaker C: Today.
00:14:31.402 - 00:14:34.250, Speaker B: Hot karthik, what do I think about the event?
00:14:37.580 - 00:14:42.990, Speaker F: There you go. So it's not quite a bleep, but it silences out the audio at that point.
00:14:47.680 - 00:15:03.296, Speaker G: It and yeah, I guess now I can take over. From a technical point of view, one of the main issues is that we want to verify a lot of transformations. And if you just want to do it naively, the circuit for like a ten second video would take like 15 minutes.
00:15:03.296 - 00:15:22.868, Speaker G: While here you might have noticed that it just took like a few seconds. So the logs weren't that great, but you might have seen that we actually proved the whole thing. So the way we did it is we give away a bit from the hash function, then we decide to just use a polynomial hash because this enables you to do all the verification in hash space.
00:15:22.868 - 00:15:39.160, Speaker G: So essentially you can do videos which are like, I would say a few minutes in around 5 seconds. So that's pretty nice. And one of the nice things that we did was that essentially we just operate on byte.
