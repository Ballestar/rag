00:00:06.090 - 00:00:24.366, Speaker A: Well, joining us again for our second talk this year, and I'm excited for this topic too, because we're going to get a history lesson in how things have maybe gotten better asterisks. So we'll take over from here. And welcome.
00:00:24.548 - 00:00:57.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I didn't intentionally scale the talk from that was my interpretation, but I think it'll go in that direction. I hope we'll see. I'm in a hotel, so lighting is not excellent, but we'll work with what we have. So I'll screen, share some slides, and then we can dive in from there. Okay, great. So I'm going to talk about a history of Dow coordination from science fiction origins to today. I'm Will, I'm a co founder of Syndicate.
00:00:57.034 - 00:01:41.360, Speaker B: We help set up investment Dows. We have over 25,000 investment Dows created on our platform, and I've personally been in the crypto space since 2013. I got into Ethereum in 2014. I took the $10 I got for free from Coinbase and put it into the Ethereum presale. I invested in the Dow in 2016. And I want to share some of the insights of seeing all this crypto history and how it's changed Dows today. And this is going to start with the fact that Dows were science fiction actually relatively recently, and go to where we are right now as a crypto community.
00:01:41.360 - 00:02:34.078, Speaker B: So pre 2016 was before there were before Dows. Again, people will debate what a Dow is. I personally demarcate it as 2016, and we actually have the starting point for the idea of Dows. It came from a book called Damon by Daniel Flores that's referenced in the Ethereum white paper. So Damon was written in 2006, before Bitcoin was created. And Damon focused very heavily on how this kind of autonomous system could run. So there was this computer code that essentially would replicate itself and run itself and coordinate people.
00:02:34.078 - 00:03:31.626, Speaker B: And Damon being written part of Bitcoin focused very heavily on how this code stayed online, how this code operated. Because in 2006, the science fiction interpretation was that keeping code online in a decentralized way was an extremely difficult task, one that was nearly impossible. And the book talks about how essentially difficult it was for this kind of decentralized network to remain online in Damon. Interestingly, it's a very heavily autonomous, automated definition of DAOs, where DAOs and daemon were essentially coordinated by this one central entity using automatic computer code. And everything was pre programmed into branches. So there was not any governance, there was not any voting, there was not a concept of subdos in a significant way. People had very little autonomy in these systems.
00:03:31.626 - 00:04:32.580, Speaker B: And it's a very pessimistic vision of DAOs, which is interesting. It didn't use the word DAOs, used the word Damon to refer to them, but it directly inspired Dows in the Ethereum white paper. The second book was Freedom, which was written in 2010. And Freedom is very interesting because you can see in real time 2006, the ideas described in Damon were science fiction. 2008 2009 bitcoin started to emerge, and the ideas started to become reality. And then 2010, Freedom, the things that were impossible in 2006 were suddenly not only possible but easy in 2010. So Freedom is a much more optimistic vision of Dows, and it focuses heavily on these semiautonomous groups, essentially having really broad goals set by the daemon, the computer program that coordinates everything.
00:04:32.580 - 00:05:22.660, Speaker B: But all of these groups operate pretty independently. There is some lightweight version of governance, but it's not heavily focused on it's much more these highly autonomous, sub Dows that have their own internal economies and can coordinate or operate independently. So one thing that's really fascinating is that in Damon and Freedom, governance was not a main focus of DAOs. It becomes a main focus later on. But the science fiction that inspired DAOs does not cover governance a lot. It covers it a bit, but the core feature was the autonomous nature of these computer programs that define Dows, not the ability to vote. So that was essentially where we were in 2010.
00:05:22.660 - 00:06:08.366, Speaker B: We have some kind of sketch of Dows. They look kind of viable, still science fiction, but starting to look more and more possible. 2013 was when Dows were defined in the Ethereum White Paper and Dows. This is where the definition was laid out formally for the first time. So Dows, as many of you likely know here, stand for decentralized autonomous organizations. Decentralized being. There's no central party, there's no central actor autonomous being that it can run without needing human intervention and organizations pretty straightforward people coordinating around some shared goal.
00:06:08.366 - 00:07:11.394, Speaker B: The Ethereum white paper specified what a Dao could do. It said that a Dao can vote, a Dow can spend funds, and a Dao can modify its own code, often via governance. This is very interesting because when you take this interpretation, you realize that a lot of things that we call Dows might not be Dows under a strict definition of the Ethereum white paper, but definitions evolve over time, and that's perfectly fine. And some of the things that we don't view as DAOs actually meet the textbook definition of DAOs. So one example is uniswap as a protocol. Not talking about uniswap Dao and the uni token, but uniswap the protocol which can execute automatic swaps as an automated market maker. That looks like the vision that the Ethereum White paper laid out of a decentralized autonomous corporation, essentially a structure where one token equals one vote.
00:07:11.394 - 00:08:09.318, Speaker B: And it's an entity that is not necessarily profit seeking but structured similar, more similar to a corporation that might otherwise seek profits. And the very interesting part about this definition of a decentralized autonomous corporation that the Ethereum White paper had is that the uniswap protocol itself, by this definition, is a Dao. It is something that can operate autonomously. The uniswap protocol can modify its own code by choosing to flip a fee switch or not. It can choose to spend funds if it does decide to flip that fee switch and it can vote, users can vote to turn that fee switch on or off. So that's one very interesting example where a lot of protocols meet this 2013 definition of Dows. And most people today would not refer to them as Dows.
00:08:09.318 - 00:08:33.390, Speaker B: Likewise, a lot of groups today their Dows can't necessarily, for example, modify their own code. Or maybe they don't have voting. Maybe they don't even necessarily spend funds. Maybe there's no treasury. And some of those things are called Dows today. So I highlight this because definitions evolve. And if someone says there's a real Dow, there's a fake Dow, there's a true Dow, there's a false Dow.
00:08:33.390 - 00:09:24.030, Speaker B: A lot of the things that people don't view as Dows are Dows under the White paper definition. A lot of the things that people view as Dows are not Dows under the White paper definition. So definitions evolve over time. That's great. If anyone tries to draw a really hard line in the definition, remember that most protocols fall under this definition, yet we don't call them Das today. The Ethereum White Paper, in addition to laying out decentralized autonomous corporations where one share equals one vote and they look kind of like businesses, they can possibly make profits, there's also decentralized Autonomous Communities, which is laid out in the Ethereum White Paper where one member equals one vote. And this is very interesting because the Ethereum White paper didn't really cover how these decentralized Autonomous Communities can be formed because of the risk of civil attacks.
00:09:24.030 - 00:10:11.966, Speaker B: Civil attack is when you essentially create a lot of fake identities. And then if it's one member equals one vote, you can overwhelm anything with your fake identity. And that's very easy to do in the crypto space if an identity is a wallet address because you can generate millions upon millions upon millions of wallet addresses. It's harder to do with things like with various systems that become identity, systems that try to prove your humanity in various ways or try to create verifiable track records, verifiable credentials. The very interesting thing is that the Ethereum White Paper essentially said decentralized Autonomous Communities are one member, equals one vote. And you can enforce membership somehow via ensuring that everyone is human. And it kind of left the implementation details out for that.
00:10:11.966 - 00:10:52.494, Speaker B: And that's still an unsolved problem today, nearly a decade later. But there is something that's really fascinating about this definition of decentralized Autonomous Communities, which is that the decentralized Autonomous Communities one member equals one vote, looks kind of like NFT projects. Today. NFT projects are not one member equals one vote because we have not solved the problem of civil resistance and fake identities. But instead, it's often one NFT equals one vote. So this is another really fascinating example where some NFT projects don't have treasuries that are accountable to communities. Some do.
00:10:52.494 - 00:11:27.960, Speaker B: And those NFT projects that are accountable to communities or those treasuries can be voted on by the members of it. Those also look kind of like a pretty traditional white Paper definition of Dows. Not exactly. We haven't solved silver resistance. Maybe in another decade we will. But this was just all to highlight that this history is very interesting because all of these concepts evolve over time. What we view as Dows in 2015 is different than what we view as Dows today.
00:11:27.960 - 00:12:03.730, Speaker B: What we view as Dows today will also be different a decade later. So a lot of people have different definitions of Dows. That's okay, those definitions change over time. And I think this is a really fascinating dive into this part of the history because the definitions don't align with what we call Dows today, even though it is the truest definition we have. I don't believe that there are true or false definitions, but some people do. And these definitions are what's dated in the white paper. So 2016 was the Dow.
00:12:03.730 - 00:12:54.450, Speaker B: It was the first Dow on top of Ethereum, depending on how you define a Dow, one of the earliest ones. And the Dow is super interesting because it was an investment Dow on top of the Ethereum Network and it essentially was structured to fund projects in the Ethereum Ecosystem. Every time a project would come up for a vote, you could say yes if you wanted to, allocate your funds to it, you could say no if you didn't, and projects would be funded via this community. And it was super exciting. At the time, it attracted 14% of all Ether in existence. 150,000,000 in 2016 prices. It was 32 billion in pre crash dollars.
00:12:54.450 - 00:13:51.462, Speaker B: Pulled these stats a little while ago, so they might be a little outdated, but it was like 32 billion in pre crash ETH prices. So that was an absolutely fascinating time. And the thing that was very interesting about the Dow was that it was really seen as this incredible bottom up initiative where it just captured everyone's imagination of wow, we can all fund things together, we can all make these decisions together, we can all create this ecosystem together. And that's part of the reason why it attracted 14% of all Ethereum existence. Another reason that's under discussed but relevant for the time is that the Dow also was one of the only things you could really do on the Ethereum Network back in 2016. There really wasn't much that you could do. And the dow was cool.
00:13:51.462 - 00:14:24.386, Speaker B: You just sent Ether to the address, you got some Dow tokens back and there wasn't much to do. So a lot of people were like, oh, an opportunity to use my Ether with smart contracts. That's cool. So I think that's also an under discussed aspect of the Dow history. Did it attract 14% of all Ethereum existence? Because people were incredibly excited by the idea of funding the Ethereum Ecosystem together in such an early stage? Yes. Did it also attract 14% of all Ethereum existence? Because nothing else was really going on. Yes, that's also true.
00:14:24.386 - 00:15:38.380, Speaker B: So if we replicated the Dow today, and I very much see what we do at Syndicate as a spiritual successor to the Dow in many ways probably wouldn't attract 14% of all eternal existence, but hopefully quite a bit. And the Dow is very interesting because the Dow was the first time the Ethereum community as a whole was faced with a massive coordination problem. So some of you may know this, the Dow was hacked, the 14% of Ether was drained by some black hat hackers who were stealing the money, some white hat hackers who were saving the money for other people. And the Dow was hacked before it even got off the ground. It was hacked due to a bug that is now well known today, known as a Reentrancy attack. But security best practices were not as developed at the time. So Reentry bugs were, well, something that existed back then, not something that was in as common knowledge as today.
00:15:38.380 - 00:16:50.266, Speaker B: And the Ethereum community had a choice. They had to coordinate and decide, do we want to essentially undo this hack and give back the Ether to the people who originally put it in, or do we want to keep the hack in place? And 14% of all Ether is now in the hands of mostly hackers and that could drastically affect the network down the road. But maybe it is what it is. The code had a bug and the bug was exploited and code is law, so that bug should stand. And this was the center of a very significant ideological debate in the Ethereum community at the time, which is that there was a code as law debate. So essentially some of the community thought that anything that was in a smart contract was essentially what people should be bound to. If the smart contract is written correctly, then everything operates correctly.
00:16:50.266 - 00:17:31.910, Speaker B: The smart contract has a bug. That's still what people chose to put money into. That's still what people agreed to, so they agreed to the bug as well. Code is law and therefore it shouldn't be changed. The other part of the community thought that the intention of the creators mattered and that a bug is not an intended functionality, a bug is an accident and the bug should be essentially undone because it wasn't what we meant to happen. So that was a very significant split. The people who thought that code is law did not agree to fork the chain.
00:17:31.910 - 00:18:27.070, Speaker B: They chose to stay on the old version of the chain, now known as Ethereum Classic, which still exists today. And the people who thought that the bug should be undone thought that agreed with the new version of the fork and undid the hack. And that's Ethereum, that's what we use today. So there are two versions of Ethereum in existence. One where they believe in this code as law principle one, the one that pretty much all of us use today where we do not and we believe that bugs are accidents and not what people are signing up for, so to speak. And this is very timely to discuss because there's another debate in the Ethereum community right now about a chain fork between ethereum proof of stake and ethereum proof of work. And that will also lead to a fork in the chain.
00:18:27.070 - 00:19:45.000, Speaker B: And it could play out like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic where Ethereum ends up gaining all the usage and all the value and Ethereum Classic is mostly not used very much. Or it could play out where there is some significant group of people who agree to adopt Ethereum proof of work. I personally think it looks more like an ethereum and ethereum Classic situation where most people will move to ethereum proof of stake and that will be the version of ethereum we all use and that ethereum proof of work won't be likely to be significant. But that's just my own personal opinion and we'll know in a week how it plays out. And this is interesting because there's both the high level like what the fork did for the ethereum community which was helped people settle the debate over coda's law. That is a very important piece. But then there's also a personal and practical aspect which is a lot of the people who put money in were also people who had significant adoption of the network as miners, for example.
00:19:45.000 - 00:21:00.960, Speaker B: And some of the people who put money in lost money and wanted to get that money back. So when people talk about 2016 solved the code is law debate because we all use ethereum and not Ethereum Classic today. Is that true? Yes, it is also true that a bunch of people chose to use ethereum instead of Ethereum Classic because they got their hacked money back in full on ethereum and they got only a portion of their hacked money back. The amount of money that was returned by white hats on Ethereum Classic. So just like how the Dow getting 14% of all ether in existence was partially a function of the excitement and partially a function of the fact that there just wasn't much to do back in the days, us using ethereum over ethereum class today is partially a function of this belief in that code is not law and that bugs are not part of agreements, but also it was people who lost money and won their back. So there's always this like in the moment is very different than how people look back retrospectively in the moment. There's usually a lot more motivations at play than just one high level principle and that's very important to keep in mind when thinking about the history of crypto because it's not all a smooth journey and there's lots of personal factors that can influence people at various points in time.
00:21:00.960 - 00:21:52.910, Speaker B: 2017 to 2020 was like the next phase of essentially Dow coordination. So just like how we went from science fiction, where Dows started out as these subdow looking kind of entities without much governance, to the White Paper, which focused heavily on voting, to the Dow fork where there wasn't even any voting, you just decided whether to fork or not fork. The next stage of Dow coordination is generalizable Dow tools started to merge. 2017 to 2020 is how I demarcate the era. Aragon was started in 2016. So it's not a perfect definition, but it's when these generalizable Dow tools started to come to prominence. Many of you likely use Gnosis.
00:21:52.910 - 00:22:43.322, Speaker B: It's a multi signature wallet, and it's typically used for off chain governance. So you have a small number of signers who are essentially the ones who can execute transactions to move funds or upgrade the Dow's code, and a large number of people who can vote about how those funds should be spent. Some people will tell you that Gnosis safes are not real DAOs, that they're fake Dows. One thing that's interesting is, like a Gnosis safe does meet the definition of a Dow in the Ethereum white paper. It can vote, it can spend funds, it can modify its own code. The votes are being done by the multi six signers not being done by all of the token holders. So under some definitions of Dows no safe and a multisig is a Dow.
00:22:43.322 - 00:23:48.040, Speaker B: Under some definitions of Dows, if you view it as it must be on chain token voting, it's not viewed as a Dow. So these definitions are always a bit tricky, and that's something that you'll definitely see recur throughout the history of Dow coordination that these definitions and ideas change over time. In my opinion, Nosa safes are DAOs, can be considered DAOs and that on chain governance is not a critical feature of DAOs. But other people disagree. Molok and Aragon are two solutions of this era for on chain governance. Molok, the Molok framework, was set up to fund public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem and to help solve coordination problems. Moloch comes from the idea of Moloch, the god of coordination failure, and everyone tries to get together to slay Moloch to essentially solve coordination problems.
00:23:48.040 - 00:24:42.390, Speaker B: And Moloch DAOs are used today in MetaCartel and similar groups, and they rely on on chain governance and voting via token holders. Aragon also is a tool more focused on Dao communities and Dao discussions, and it also uses on chain governance. In addition, not exactly in addition to this is also compound based governance compound governor Alpha and Bravo, which is a voting framework as well. And that tends to be used alongside other systems, for example, like tally for on chain voting. So these were very generalizable Dow tools. They didn't try to take an opinion on any one use case. They tried to be very broad.
00:24:42.390 - 00:25:33.298, Speaker B: And for Gnosis, on chain governance was not a critical feature, and it was broader than just a dow tool. A multi signature wallet can be used for all sorts of things more than just DAOs. It can be used to also secure your own funds, secure your friends funds, and there's a lot of things that you can do with nosis that are beyond DAOs. And then Molok and Aragon specifically were focused on dows in particular. And this era ran through 2020, pretty much through the end of DFI. Summer 2021 saw the rise of vertical specific dow tools. So instead of one generalizable framework, there started to be tools for specific types of dows.
00:25:33.298 - 00:26:28.238, Speaker B: So Syndicate for example, for investment dows juicebox and mirror for crowdfunds party down coupe for group buying NFTs Coin Shift and Parcel treasury Management utopia Payroll llama Accounting and Guild token Gating Lobby Knowledge Management this list could easily be double, triple, quadruple the size. 2021 saw this huge explosion of tools. And it was because people viewed people realized that specific dow use cases were best served by specific tools built for them and people began to migrate to those tools. For example, at Syndicate, we focus a lot on flexibility for investment dows. Some investment dows want to have a fixed price for their investments. Some of them want to be able to change the price. Some of them want to have membership based entirely on deposits.
00:26:28.238 - 00:27:43.922, Speaker B: Some of them want to be able to select their members in advance and allow in members they think are really helpful and kick out members who are problematic and maybe unhelpful or disruptive. The investment dao frameworks that we're building at Syndicate are built with a particular use case in mind. Likewise, Juicebox for example, is built for essentially, like they call it, transparent treasuries, where you can put money into a juice box fundraise. You can also get refunds back from that fundraise if the Dow has more capital than it needs. Dows can also make excess funds redeemable for end users at any point with this refund functionality as well. Party Dao operates on top of the protocol formerly known as Fractional, and it directly fractionalizes the NFTs on a protocol layer so that they're held by a specific smart contract that can handle auctions for those NFTs. So these vertical specific dow tools started to rise up in 2021, and that is where we are today.
00:27:43.922 - 00:27:52.850, Speaker B: So that is the history of Dow coordination from science fiction to today. Probably have time for one or two questions, if there are any in the chat.
00:27:54.070 - 00:28:18.870, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe this is a question for me and I'm going to apologize for being for putting you on the spot, but did you notice any kind of trends as you were looking at this evolution in terms of why some of these things didn't take off? Like is there something common here or is it just that we change the goalpost and we had to then adapt to how the tools would get us to accomplishing a different goal.
00:28:19.030 - 00:29:01.740, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that as the Ethereum network gains more users, what those users look for and what they care about and care less about starts to change pretty dramatically. So, for example, in 2016, gas fees were very low on chain governance, cost barely anything. There was no reason not to use it. Everything was on chain, and there weren't browser based wallets. So you had to use desktop wallets with direct smart contract interactions. So having everything on chain made sense because you couldn't have off chain interfaces easily. It just didn't exist at the time.
00:29:01.740 - 00:30:19.314, Speaker B: And then 2017 to 2020, those were really where there were very few Dows before then. Maker was the most prominent pre 2017 Dow. And 2017 2020 was an era of essentially trying to define what Dows are, what they look like, and using the concepts that we know from before and very much trying to be unapinionated because who knows what Dows will look like? 2021? These tools can start to be more opinionated because we know what Dows look like more clearly. They have now gone from pure science fiction to a few experimental examples to lots and lots of examples. And that setup allows us to start to build tools that meet those specific needs that we know about. So I think it's as knowledge increases in the space and as users change in the space, and as gas fees change and prices change, these Dow tools naturally adapt because the Ethereum network is not static either. The people use it, the cost to use it, how you use it, whether that's from browsers or direct smart contract interactions all change over this time period as well.
00:30:19.432 - 00:30:42.890, Speaker A: No, that's totally fair. Another question. We'll just make this the last one, obviously, as you can. The last slide talked about all the tools that are available right now for Dows to kind of operate. And we're kind of seeing specialization here as well. Do you believe that these things remain unbundled? Or do you kind of believe that eventually this will be bundled together and sort of how do you compare and contrast that to things going on at Syndicate?
00:30:43.230 - 00:31:09.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, of course, I have my own bias. My bias is that I believe these will remain unbundled. And that's what we're building towards. We're building towards investment Dows specifically. Broadly speaking, my belief is that Dows are a structure as transformative as corporations. But likewise, the idea of a generic corporation is really hard to serve. Like, the industry it's in matters a lot.
00:31:09.250 - 00:31:56.660, Speaker B: The types of people who run it matter a lot. The goals that they have matter a lot. Likewise, just like how the needs of a small business, of a single person consulting business to a small business in a local area, to a Fortune 500 company, like, they're all corporations, but they all look very different, have very different needs, and would not be served by the same tools. I think Dows are the same way. Investment Dows of a few members look very different than investment Dows of dozens of members. And those look very different than investment Dows of thousands of members. Those, in addition, look very different than community Dows, which might not be trying to make a profit but might instead be trying to seek out a specific goal and bring about some kind of thing they want to create.
00:31:56.660 - 00:32:18.966, Speaker B: Is it possible that there's some kind of Dow super app that handles all these use cases 1020 years from now? I don't view it as likely because there's no corporation super app either. The needs vary so widely between companies that I think that would be the.
00:32:18.988 - 00:32:45.460, Speaker A: Same way, I guess, for tooling to help operate. Do you kind of believe that's more likely? I mean, this would be your analogy of kind of HR services and accounting and largely the corporate account management as an industry exists for generalized organizations. But do we kind of still believe that treasury management and financing and payouts and payroll and all that will be offered more and more in a bundled form?
00:32:47.110 - 00:33:16.806, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that we it's a little hard to say because there's also this meta level question of do we even need Dow specific tools at all? I think the answer is yes. I'm building them, I invest in them. I have a significant portion of my career, my time and my assets tied.
00:33:16.838 - 00:33:18.074, Speaker A: Up in these little bit of bodies there.
00:33:18.112 - 00:34:06.374, Speaker B: Yes, but it's also because I truly believe it. Yeah, I have the belief first and then I execute on that belief rather than the other way around. I think that Dow specific tools do need to exist and will exist. I think that there's kind of like a big question mark, which is the regulatory situation for Dows right now. Dows, from a regulatory perspective look either like companies or nonprofits. And a lot of what Dows can do have to contort to fit into these definitions. And if they're forced to fit in these definitions, well, if a Dow looks like a nonprofit and it's regulated as a nonprofit, then maybe it should just use nonprofit tooling.
00:34:06.374 - 00:34:52.298, Speaker B: Maybe it doesn't need Dow tooling for nonprofits when it's forced to act like a nonprofit. But I think that the more crypto native experimental end of the spectrum is where Dow tools will likely thrive first. That's only a weekly held belief, since we're kind of on both aspects, there's some groups that are super experimental and totally on chain and some groups that are using corporate entities and manage a lot off chain. I only have a weekly held belief on that. I wouldn't say I formed a particularly strong opinion either way, but if Dows are allowed to act like truly crypto native Dows, I think we'll also see more innovation emerge. Dows are forced to look like companies, well, then maybe Dows won't. Look that different from companies.
00:34:52.298 - 00:35:15.486, Speaker B: So, like, the regulatory situation right now, I think, has hindered innovation in a significant way. And I think that if that embraces the truly cutting edge, autonomous features of Dows, that we'll start to see the Dows be able to really roam free and experiment more.
00:35:15.668 - 00:35:25.698, Speaker A: I think that's a perfect note to end this on. So really appreciate this, Will, and thanks again for taking the time today. And if you can share the slide deck, we'll also make that available for the attendees.
00:35:25.794 - 00:35:34.678, Speaker B: Thanks so much. Anyone can email me at will at syndicate. IO or find me on Twitter at willpapper. I'm definitely happy to chat about any of this.
00:35:34.844 - 00:35:36.998, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much.
00:35:37.164 - 00:35:38.580, Speaker B: Thanks so much. Talk to you soon.
