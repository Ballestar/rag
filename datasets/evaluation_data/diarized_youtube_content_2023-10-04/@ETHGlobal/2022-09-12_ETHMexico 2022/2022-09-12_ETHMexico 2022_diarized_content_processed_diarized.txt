00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.730 - 00:00:37.480, Speaker B: I think part of the reason why we have projects like hackathons and why we even want to have a decentralized ecosystem is because we know that we are not always the ones that have the answers right. I think our expertise as general purpose like Ethereum and technology builders is in the technology in kind of lot of more global trends and kind of bigger ideas around economics. But then there's also a lot of expertise around what specific issues different communities in different regions have.
00:00:38.330 - 00:00:52.362, Speaker C: East Global Mexico is a really good push in the right direction. So many people are just being exposed to what's happening that don't even know. So like, you know, my family came and that's 20 people that didn't know what the blockchain was.
00:00:52.362 - 00:01:01.520, Speaker C: And they're asking me like so what is this? So I think if you continue to do these events, especially in Latin America, it'll grow like we needed to.
00:01:03.410 - 00:01:10.610, Speaker B: And a lot of developers out of Latin America have manila built projects that are being used by people everywhere around the world.
00:01:10.680 - 00:01:36.134, Speaker D: The level of monetization is very high in Latin America, especially for people from Latin America, because we are not used to this kind of events. We are not used to a lot of hackathons or even maybe we are not used to see a lot of startups growing. So it's a big impact for the Latin American people to keep building this kind of projects and hackathons.

00:01:48.486 - 00:02:00.530, Speaker F: The community in Mexico is alive. It's just so vibrant and people are so excited to, one, learn new technologies but also go out and play.
00:02:00.680 - 00:02:22.182, Speaker E: I am a huge ETH global fan. ETH Global is kind of the reason I got started as a dev in Web Three. I did my first hackathon online and so coming in person has just been so magical because I meet all of my internet friends and I see people kind of through their full journey of their first project and then their second one, and then their third one, their startup, their VC funding stage.
00:02:22.182 - 00:02:27.530, Speaker E: It's just amazing to watch people grow and to be growing alongside such incredible leaders.
00:02:28.190 - 00:02:40.078, Speaker G: Massive, massive fan of ETH global. It is where I've seen a ton of different hackers get started, some of whom have later joined the Lens and Ave team. It's where we've seen a ton of great projects get started.
00:02:40.078 - 00:02:46.394, Speaker G: And especially for us as builders, there's no better way to get feedback than directly from those building on top of your platform.
00:02:46.532 - 00:02:57.506, Speaker C: Looking at it from a global perspective is exactly what we need to do because we want everybody in the world to be included, not just a specific region. It just helps with everything.
00:02:57.608 - 00:03:12.902, Speaker E: People have projects that are focused on public goods, regenerative, finance, there's a lot of solar pumps running around. So it's so fun to see all of these different communities hacking on local issues as well as global scalable problems that benefit all of Ethereum.
00:03:12.966 - 00:03:22.750, Speaker H: And for us, it's interesting place to actually see and get inspired from other developers and newcomers from the space to build the future of the internet.
00:03:25.490 - 00:03:35.678, Speaker I: Yeah, I think it's one of the communities that is first of all not like incentivized by some big centralized company. I think that's what makes it so powerful. It doesn't matter.
00:03:35.678 - 00:03:44.298, Speaker I: It's like I always say, it has music has no language and all those things. I think Ethereum is sort of getting there, but it doesn't matter. I've been in so many different countries.
00:03:44.298 - 00:03:47.462, Speaker I: Everyone gets it, what Ethereum does and what they can do on it.
00:03:47.516 - 00:04:03.910, Speaker A: The community is so warm and so accepting. I think it has to do with the fact that everybody that's here is chosen very consciously to be here and probably had to do some really hard work to get here in the first place. So everyone's really excited the next time somebody comes in and it's really warm and welcoming.
