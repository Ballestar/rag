00:00:06.170 - 00:00:16.830, Speaker A: All right, next up we have Kaido talking about how do we better use tools to measure our large treasuries. So without further ado, let's welcome Kaido.
00:00:18.690 - 00:00:19.440, Speaker B: Hi.
00:00:20.050 - 00:00:22.734, Speaker C: Hi, Karthik. Thank you for inviting me back again.
00:00:22.772 - 00:00:24.378, Speaker B: It's great to be here, but it's.
00:00:24.394 - 00:00:26.290, Speaker C: Going to be hard speaker.
00:00:26.370 - 00:00:30.870, Speaker B: Let me share my screen really quick. All right.
00:00:30.940 - 00:00:32.454, Speaker C: Does this look good to you guys?
00:00:32.572 - 00:00:33.846, Speaker A: I think it's good.
00:00:34.028 - 00:00:34.870, Speaker B: All right, perfect.
00:00:34.940 - 00:01:11.122, Speaker C: So today I'm talking about treasury and then the general sustainability of Dows, specifically from a treasury standpoint, I know I'm talking at a hackathon. So I want to in the end inspire people to build different things. This is a talk I give in May before the crashes happen. So I hope there's some updates here and there's some lessons I've learned definitely along the way. And some updates, as in some project I've mentioned in the past have decided to cease their business and go elsewhere. So it could be some interesting things to look through their journeys and see.
00:01:11.176 - 00:01:12.578, Speaker B: How we can learn from there.
00:01:12.744 - 00:01:46.990, Speaker C: All right, before I begin, I want to give a quick TLDR about myself, why I'm interested in this different work and why you should listen to me. So right now, I work at Incentive Design, llama and Gitcoin. And my work encompass from governance design Tokenomics to Liquidity Management. My goal is to in the end help DAOs to achieve their vision in this very cyclical crypto market. And at Llama we built economic infrastructure for DAOs. And here are some projects we've worked in the past. Previously, when I first started in crypto.
00:01:47.810 - 00:01:50.846, Speaker B: I was with Trader Joe's, which is.
00:01:50.868 - 00:02:01.060, Speaker C: A Dex on avalanche. And I was there working on token incentive to help different projects liquidity. And Trader Joe started.
00:02:04.950 - 00:02:06.470, Speaker B: When I was right here.
00:02:06.540 - 00:02:44.202, Speaker C: So when I first joined, Trader Joe had around 40, 50 million TVL. And when I left, we had about 1 billion TVL. And also in my free time, I started writing different design pieces on how do we think about different token incentives and how can we build sustainable business structures with tokens. And this main interest of me basically sparred off my time at Trader Joe where I saw numerous projects blow up overnight and then slowly die out very quickly because they didn't have a robust incentive structure or even a product.
00:02:44.356 - 00:02:45.060, Speaker B: So.
00:02:46.790 - 00:03:24.614, Speaker C: I hope through my time at Trader Joe all the learning lessons I could share with you guys through this talk and think about how do we build different projects that can help Dow sustain further. And this is a design I did with FWB to help there with their liquidity design. So let's start with the goals for the talk. So number one is I'll give you the nuts and boats for what is the protocol treasury and why should I build on top of it? I give the talk last May. A lot of people have thought about it was great. I want more people to building on top of it. Think about sustainable Dow development.
00:03:24.614 - 00:03:32.014, Speaker C: Second thing is what are the current solutions? Before you build anything, you want to look at what other people are doing and how should we innovate on top of it.
00:03:32.132 - 00:03:36.020, Speaker B: Lastly is of course what can you build?
00:03:37.110 - 00:03:41.060, Speaker C: And in the end I hope this is a fun and actionable talk.
00:03:41.510 - 00:03:44.786, Speaker B: In the end, after hearing the talk.
00:03:44.888 - 00:04:05.370, Speaker C: I hope there's some ideas flowing around. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter. I'm always happy to talk to different folks and help you on your journey. So first, what is Protocol Treasury and what is the problem? Protocol treasury by definition is just assets owned by the protocol for future development.
00:04:06.270 - 00:04:09.146, Speaker B: The common usage of treasury assets can.
00:04:09.168 - 00:04:15.710, Speaker C: Be split into three different categories. This is my definition from personal experience.
00:04:15.860 - 00:04:18.574, Speaker B: Number one is grant programs and the.
00:04:18.612 - 00:04:21.002, Speaker C: Goal of grant program is to incentivize.
00:04:21.066 - 00:04:22.846, Speaker B: People to build on top of your.
00:04:22.868 - 00:04:58.090, Speaker C: Own protocol because crypto by nature is open source and everyone can view it and becomes posable and build on top of each other. Grand program is really important to build a strong developer, ecosystem or even product suite around your core protocol. Second is ecosystem building. This is specifically talking about partnership with other protocols. This can be achieved through many levels. But the main one maybe we have experimented the most with is token swaps to try to align financial incentive to further or even deepen relationship between protocols.
00:04:59.070 - 00:05:03.574, Speaker B: Lastly is very underlooked, which is budgets.
00:05:03.622 - 00:05:04.926, Speaker C: I think that the main use of.
00:05:04.948 - 00:05:08.938, Speaker B: Treasury nowadays is for budgeting and budgeting.
00:05:09.034 - 00:05:53.854, Speaker C: By definition is to cover the cost of operations, salaries, marketing events and outreach for protocols to grow. And what is the problem here? So the opportunity spacing in Protocol Treasury is gigantic. Currently there's $9.5 billion in Protocol Treasury and it has increased more than ten X in the past ten months. And very interesting enough, what we saw is that even though my last deck was May, which is almost four months ago and there's a lot of fluctuation in prices, protocol treasury has not decreased that much. It stay around the 10 billion mark. And here's a list about all the.
00:05:53.892 - 00:05:58.670, Speaker B: Different protocol tokens that Uniswap have.
00:05:58.740 - 00:06:26.022, Speaker C: And you can see right here, uniswap is 99% of its own native token and they don't really have much ethereum or even USD, which is sort of less volatile than Unisoft's native token. So when I first saw this I thought oh my God, these projects have so much money and then they should be doing great. And then I realized most of these.
00:06:26.076 - 00:06:28.926, Speaker B: Protocols are native token and maybe native.
00:06:28.978 - 00:07:19.138, Speaker C: Tokens are not the best thing because it's not liquid, it's hard to sell and you introduce a lot of different weird incentives on managing your treasury. So I was thinking is it only uniswap or is there a lot of different Dows facing the same problem as it turns out it's definitely the same problem across many dows. So Uni has a larger Treasury UXD, which is a stable coin protocol on Salana also has this problem. They have $600 million of treasury and 99.4% of them are in their native tokens. And even one of the most established dows maker is also having the same problem where most of their treasuries make up native tokens.
00:07:19.234 - 00:07:21.066, Speaker B: And lido on the other hand is.
00:07:21.088 - 00:07:38.720, Speaker C: Probably the one that has the most ethereum or even just stable assets in treasury. And we can see 10% of it is in ethereum and another 1.6% is in staked ETH. So I think that the message here is quite clear where.
00:07:42.130 - 00:07:42.638, Speaker B: We have a.
00:07:42.644 - 00:07:52.798, Speaker C: Big market in the protocol treasury space but we have a big problem at the same time where most of them are in native tokens. And this is another graph from Mango.
00:07:52.894 - 00:07:56.386, Speaker B: Talking about how much they have, which.
00:07:56.408 - 00:08:09.046, Speaker C: Is very interesting because not a lot of people know about Mango but they actually have 50 million of USDS in their treasury. So I talked about why native token is not the greatest thing. I want to dive a little bit.
00:08:09.068 - 00:08:11.898, Speaker B: Deeper into it and talk about why.
00:08:11.984 - 00:08:25.360, Speaker C: High concentration of native token in protocol treasury has big problems and there are two main big problems. And the first one is crypto is a volatile market so there can be sharp decreases in crypto treasury value.
00:08:25.890 - 00:08:29.674, Speaker B: For example, these treasury values can decrease.
00:08:29.722 - 00:08:41.058, Speaker C: 50% or even 95% over three month period. Very fast. This is a graph of Uniswap and we can see decrease around 60% in the last six months.
00:08:41.224 - 00:08:45.938, Speaker B: And second is why high concentration of.
00:08:45.944 - 00:09:12.426, Speaker C: Native token is not great is because for any protocol to achieve its vision, it needs to continue to grow. And this growth mostly comes from cash but not native token. In a simplified example below, let's say we can see protocol treasury rewards people who drive the growth of the protocol. So treasury rewards people, and people drives growth because they build on top of.
00:09:12.448 - 00:09:15.078, Speaker B: It, where they do different outreach, but.
00:09:15.104 - 00:10:20.370, Speaker C: The people in the end have to pay for their utilities, pay for their rents, pay for their food. So they have to trade with the market to get USDC or ETH, which is more liquid assets for them to offboard. And a caveat on top of it, which you can think of as this third small point, which is okay. Yeah. This is an example where if you want to sell 1% of uniswap's treasury, it would cost the uniswap price to decrease 40% just to tell you how illiquid the market is for these native assets. And it's very hard to convert them into cash and pay contributors. Lastly, it's probably a small caveat building on top of the second point, which is the Huddle versus sustainability dilemma because imagine you're a protocol, you're telling your friends and your family to join the community to become a part of the Dao and at the same time let's huddle to the moon opportunity.
00:10:20.370 - 00:10:44.390, Speaker C: But at the same time you're like, oh, but we have to sell our treasury tokens for USDC, otherwise we can't function. So essentially you're using your token holders as sort of a semi form of exit liquidity which has by design very hard marketing and community management aspect to it. So one question naturally arise.
00:10:44.470 - 00:10:48.074, Speaker B: We have this huge amount of money.
00:10:48.192 - 00:11:01.374, Speaker C: Inside different protocol treasury. Is there any way we can generate cash from it? Whether it's you can be selling tokens very directly or is there any other way we can generate cash? So I would love to first give.
00:11:01.412 - 00:11:05.870, Speaker B: The current potential solutions for protocol treasury.
00:11:05.950 - 00:11:38.214, Speaker C: And the way I put potential because some projects may not be live or even they have not gained significant traction. And I divided these solutions into three categories based on its sort of difficulty of understanding this categorization is not meant to be which layer is better than the others because many times a simpler solution just wins. However, I do believe that we're still in the searching phase in which we're trying to find more optimized solutions to handle protocol treasuries. And on the bottom are the low hanging fruits.
00:11:38.342 - 00:11:43.454, Speaker B: You can see that these solutions are.
00:11:43.492 - 00:11:57.886, Speaker C: Already established and have been utilized by protocols quite extensively. In the middle are traditional finance solutions. These solutions borrow existing ideas from corporate finance, implement them into different ideas on chain.
00:11:58.078 - 00:12:00.226, Speaker B: And lastly, on top of it are.
00:12:00.248 - 00:12:51.134, Speaker C: Some sort of like crypto native solutions or innovative solutions where these solutions are less utilized in the traditional world, but will bring promising ideas to the crypto world. And there's a lot of different names here, there's a lot of different projects. I can see some projects being blurred out in black and white. The only black and white logo I found for Xerox Protocol they're still live, they're still doing well. But for Porter Finance and Faye Protocol, unfortunately, since the last time I made this slide, they have seized their operation and they have not moved forward as a Dow decided to stop working on their respective products. However, I think there's a lot of interesting ideas in this slide. So I'm going to do a quick rapid fire of different ideas.
00:12:51.134 - 00:14:06.570, Speaker C: People have been thinking about how do we diversify over treasury? The way I want to describe different designs is through how people are doing this problem in the past. What is the problem here and how is this specific project going to help or trying to change on top of it? So uma, success token is a way to deal with the OTC deals that are buying at cheaper prices. So normally when protocols sell its treasury, one way they do it is through accredited investor or a fund. Sometimes where people does a fund where the person buy treasury token at a lower valuation but at a higher lockup. The problem with this design is that it's really hard to generate community buy in because people always feel like, quote, unquote, they're gonna be dumped on. So uma is a way to align those incentives where instead of buying at a lower price you get more upside. So as the price increases you get sort of this linear bonus of more tokens where you can claim after a specific stripe price.
00:14:06.570 - 00:14:57.640, Speaker C: And I think this is a very interesting idea and know require some data oracles but normally it's not going to be a huge problem for the Dows to handle. I think it's going to be a very interesting way to see their design to get more implemented in the dao space for a protocol treasury Diversification second is a lock streaming auction. So in the past token sales are always with a fixed price. So for example the lido dow Treasury Diversification is a great example where they sold a lump sum of lido for a fixed amount of cash. The problem is it's generally very hard to agree on a token sale price for a community and we can see it from the second proposal from Dragonfly where there's a lot of discussions about what is the correct terms and how should we think about different things.
00:14:57.790 - 00:14:59.684, Speaker B: So lock is a way to essentially.
00:14:59.732 - 00:15:11.084, Speaker C: Do continuous streaming auction where people can commit capital and withdrew unlock capital at any time. The way is to find market clearing price for a set of tokens during.
00:15:11.122 - 00:15:16.636, Speaker B: Each epoch and to sort of achieve.
00:15:16.668 - 00:15:26.800, Speaker C: It in a way where people where this mechanism can absorb different price volatility and form a long term price stability for Treasury Diversification.
00:15:28.840 - 00:15:30.448, Speaker B: Next one is Faye's Turbo.
00:15:30.544 - 00:16:02.156, Speaker C: Unfortunately Faye has decided to stop building on top of the products but the code base is still there. I think people can definitely still innovate on top of it and find different ways to work on this problem. So in the past protocols you can't really collateralize your native token so what I mean by collateralizing it is deposit your token into Aave or any of other money markets and borrow USD or USDC on top of it.
00:16:02.338 - 00:16:03.756, Speaker B: And the reason why you can't do.
00:16:03.778 - 00:16:53.276, Speaker C: That is that most protocols do not meet the risk parameters because for any assets to be considered a collateral it has to be vetted extensively by the Aave community to make sure you don't introduce debt into the system. And what Faye achieves to do is to collateral against your own token and you can earn interest on top of it through Turbo. So instead of borrowing USDC and use USDC whatever way you can, you can only use USDC in different EO bearing asset standards. So for example if your token value decreased too fast and you need to be liquidated you can do it in a much more efficient way where quote unquote you don't really get liquidated because the protocol controls your collateralized assets at.
00:16:53.298 - 00:16:58.488, Speaker B: The same time next is ribbons treasury.
00:16:58.664 - 00:17:52.940, Speaker C: So in the past most protocols just do not have a diversification plan, right? What time shall we sell our tokens, how much we sell? That's going to be a very difficult discussion to have once you're in the bull market. But right now we're in a bear market so it's much easier for us to agree on how should we diversify and Ribbon's asset is just a cover call vault which essentially in plain man's term is that we decide on when we're going to sell stuff. Let's say right now, let's say we're in the uniswap dow and we think, okay, we should sell uniswap when uniswap two X and let's sell 1 million of uniswap, then that's essentially you can code that up in a ribbon vault and then sell this option to different people. And people can buy it as an option to get exposure to the upside.
00:17:53.020 - 00:17:54.370, Speaker B: Other than the two X.
00:17:56.180 - 00:18:33.324, Speaker C: Now this is a very fast rapid fire. I hope you guys are still with me. The whole point of the rapid fire is to give you some ideas people are building and also show you how innovative people are thinking about how can we build different structures for financial aspect of things. On the Dow Treasury although some projects are not specifically Dow focused but a lot of it going to be used by has been used very extensively for DAOs for example Ribbon where I mentioned at the last a lot of their customers actually are DAOs who are trying to generate yield on a passive manner. So now comes to a question what can you build?
00:18:33.362 - 00:18:33.516, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:33.538 - 00:18:39.330, Speaker C: There's a lot of ideas floating around. I talked about a lot of ideas what can you build?
00:18:39.780 - 00:18:43.650, Speaker B: So this is a graph I showed before.
00:18:47.060 - 00:19:37.730, Speaker C: When I was mentioning these solutions I mentioned they're only potential. A lot of these tools are extremely extremely hard for developers to understand especially the articles who does not have a strong finance background and guess what? Most Dow developers are like that because not everyone comes from a finance background. So the trade off between there's a lot of protocols have a lot of parameters you can tune but it's very hard to visualize how those parameters can have impact on different things and the second is the adoption of these system your protocol treasury is still very low. I think that could be a very key point where just very hard to talk to developers or even general community members on what does these things do and then how can we visualize the effects of different parameters on the end result.
00:19:39.060 - 00:19:40.192, Speaker B: So what can you build?
00:19:40.246 - 00:19:55.384, Speaker C: I think the first thing is that it's important to decrease the trust assumptions for different interactions we have when thinking about treasury diversification and what I mean by this is you can codify different.
00:19:55.422 - 00:19:56.840, Speaker B: Agreements on chain.
00:19:59.710 - 00:20:37.250, Speaker C: Sorry. So there are two very straightforward ideas that I have not seen a great implementation that has a lot of traction. So there are two kinds of contract I think would be very suitable for this kind of idea to decrease trust assumption. So number one is token swap contract. So token swap essentially is a way for protocol to exchange their token treasuries with different protocols to build partnership. For example Uniswap can exchange with Aave so they have sort of an alliance because they hold each other's token. The second one is pipe.
00:20:37.250 - 00:21:40.474, Speaker C: That's a fancy way of saying a private entity wants to invest in a public entity. Sort of like a lido situation where a lot of different funds wants to buy a large chunk of lido tokens through the open market. And you can do it in a one time thing, or you can do it in a streaming kind of way where these different funds can put money in and out and there will be very interesting dynamic on top of it. And I think a lot of these are not meant to be a product per se in the end for the end user because many times the people who interact with these kind of contracts or products are going to be developers or very experienced investor who understand these different contracts. So for number one I would say a public repo would be the ideal solution for this. The second is to decrease the coordination friction. So basically what I mean is basically toolkits to manage these different contracts or.
00:21:40.512 - 00:21:44.026, Speaker B: Different strategies and this is what I.
00:21:44.048 - 00:21:50.000, Speaker C: Meant when I was talking about the solutions are real innovative but really hard for people to understand.
00:21:50.450 - 00:21:53.914, Speaker B: So how can you decrease the coordination.
00:21:53.962 - 00:23:17.674, Speaker C: Friction between the people who are building the products and the people who will be using these innovative products in the future? Two very simple ways are number one is simulators for payouts as in if things change this much, what is our payment, what is our gain, what is what we're missing out? Can we justify we're missing out on that? And second is probably a very underrated thing which is front ends, a lot of people interact with the blockchain through front ends. So it's really important for us to build easy to understand front ends to not only educate developers and also even maybe users on how do we understand these different tools. And lastly lastly I think it's to bring existing concepts into the crypto world. I think we're still very early in the stage of crypto speed running through history so I think we're still trying to onboard different ideas we have tried in the world that has worked, what has not worked, maybe some didn't work in the real world is going to thrive in the crypto world. I think AMM is a great example of that. So it's really important for all hackathon participants to think about different ideas that you've seen in your existing industry that have worked or didn't work and want to experiment on top of the crypto world. Me personally, I think crypto is a great space to experiment with real financial value because the code is very public.
00:23:17.674 - 00:23:39.390, Speaker C: There's trustless execution based on the ethereum blockchain. So bring those concepts onto the crypto world and see what we can build. And that is the end of my talk. Thank you guys so much for hanging around. You can follow me as your ex Kaido, on Twitter. My DM is always, always open for if any of you wants to chat about different ideas.
00:23:39.470 - 00:23:41.874, Speaker B: But thank you so much. Amazing.
00:23:41.992 - 00:24:01.798, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Kaido, this was actually very informative, even for me, because I learned a bunch of new things. One question, and we do have to move on to our next speaker because of a time constraint, but could you send us these slides? We'll make them public to the attendees and also publish them, so if you can get a copy of them, that'd be amazing.
00:24:01.964 - 00:24:04.358, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely will. Definitely will.
00:24:04.524 - 00:24:04.998, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:24:05.084 - 00:24:08.360, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much, and I hope to get you involved more in the future.
00:24:08.810 - 00:24:12.198, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you, guys. Hope to be back soon. Have a good one.
00:24:12.284 - 00:24:13.220, Speaker B: You too. Take care.
