00:00:07.210 - 00:00:25.702, Speaker A: All right, so hey, I'm Carl Fluke. I am a solutions architect and starting to do devrel for Coinbase, specifically focusing on our new L Two op stack base. So today we're going to just run through a super quick all about that base, kind of some of the tools and partner ecosystem we've built up.
00:00:25.702 - 00:00:46.042, Speaker A: And then what bounty overview are we doing and what do we recommend that people build during this hackathon? So just curious for a show of hands, like how many people participated in on chain summer and did something with Base so far? Did anybody good amount? Awesome. Cool. Has anybody actually deployed something on base yet? Just one.
00:00:46.096 - 00:00:46.362, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:46.416 - 00:00:58.478, Speaker A: All right, well, we're going to change that this week or weekend. Okay. So a lot of people have heard Coinbase kind of the internal joke for the actual Base team is we're kind of like the biggest off chain L Two.
00:00:58.478 - 00:01:13.250, Speaker A: We have 120,000,000,000 some assets. All of them are off chain. And we slowly want to start pushing all of that consumer and institutional assets to be on chain so that we can actually use them in DeFi and start to go even further into crypto.
00:01:13.250 - 00:01:25.702, Speaker A: So our big motto for Base for probably the next year or two is on chain is the next online. So I don't want to overkill this, but before the Internet, we had Blockbuster Video. I'd actually go to the store.
00:01:25.702 - 00:01:34.102, Speaker A: I'd get my Xbox or GameCube? Game. And that was old school. And now that's gone physical is slowly moved to digital.
00:01:34.102 - 00:01:45.562, Speaker A: Now we have the Internet. It's super fast. We have things like Netflix, but kind of the it was very much so that these web two companies now control your content.
00:01:45.562 - 00:01:55.106, Speaker A: You have the ability to read and write, but at the end of the day, that ownership is with Google, it's with AWS. They have the ability to turn it off. And so now here we are.
00:01:55.106 - 00:02:13.126, Speaker A: Blockchain technologies are actually you have digital ownership and we can start to recreate all these web two tools to actually be permissionless. A big part of that is that I think crypto focused on infrastructure for the past couple of years. And now we have a whole bunch of kind of building blocks we can use.
00:02:13.126 - 00:02:30.186, Speaker A: And a big part of that is now we need more developers to understand them and use them to build actual consumer products. So our kind of thesis is we've been slowly growing on chain users. With more users means that there's more developers that can build tools for them.
00:02:30.186 - 00:02:45.002, Speaker A: There's more actual users that you can use to grow your protocol. So some example use cases here we have Farcaster for social media local to New York. There's Blackbird, which is starting to do some restaurant loyalty programs.
00:02:45.002 - 00:02:56.126, Speaker A: So you can imagine that's a combination of Tokens and NFTs and then good partner parallel. They have a trading card game that I like a lot. But starting to do some of that game phi on chain.
00:02:56.126 - 00:03:07.762, Speaker A: So as we have developers, they start to expand these use cases that we can provide. And then ultimately that means that transactions will continue to grow on chain. Here, the blue line is Ethereum.
00:03:07.762 - 00:03:23.566, Speaker A: It's been more or less at capacity since 2020. And so now these L Two roll ups are starting to come out and take over that actual transaction volume. But unfortunately, there's only 10 million people on chain so far, and we have 8 billion in the world.
00:03:23.566 - 00:03:31.680, Speaker A: So we got a long way to go. And our thesis is that we can slowly start to expand that pie. So kind of just super quick history.
00:03:31.680 - 00:03:47.978, Speaker A: Coinbase Central Exchange started with Bitcoin, started to a ton more assets. Our first kind of like on chain activity was USDC partnership with Circle. Now that USDC is on multiple blockchains, moving into DeFi.
00:03:47.978 - 00:04:00.278, Speaker A: Like Coinbase Wallet was our first true crypto product, noncustodial wallet. It enabled us to actually go into the DFI ecosystem and then that's kind of continued. And so now we have our L Two base.
00:04:00.278 - 00:04:18.910, Speaker A: And so here we say we're like maybe 10% on chain, maybe it's closer to five. But over the next five years, how do we switch that to be 100% on chain? Okay, so a lot of people have already used Base, so I'll kind of quickly go over this. We chose the Op stack mostly because it's MIT licensed.
00:04:18.910 - 00:04:33.060, Speaker A: Coinbase is the second core contributor to the Optimism collective and like the Op stack, so all of our contributions are open source. We actually directly are part of that code base. So as more Op stacks come in, we're in partnership with them.
00:04:33.060 - 00:04:45.026, Speaker A: The main thing that we're focused on is I'm super looking forward to 4844 hopefully coming out later this year. That would get us super close to transaction. It's probably eight to $0.11
00:04:45.026 - 00:04:57.194, Speaker A: today, but we think that there's a lot of unlocks that happen once we actually get to a $0.01 transaction. We kind of have a company goal if we want to be able to do transactions in 1 second under one cent.
00:04:57.194 - 00:05:18.062, Speaker A: And that's kind of like the two year journey that Coinbase wants to move is being able to give users that. So, as I said, base is a second core contributor to the Op stack. MIT licensed 15% of all revenues from the sequencer fees we actually give directly back to the Op collective and that helps fund their public goods funding.
00:05:18.062 - 00:05:32.834, Speaker A: So we're super happy to be part of that and help expand the open source and slowly keep helping optimism move to be decentralized. Okay, so as a bunch of you guys are already well aware of base. We had our on chain summer.
00:05:32.834 - 00:05:35.510, Speaker A: It's been open for seven weeks now.
00:05:35.580 - 00:05:36.440, Speaker B: Eight weeks.
00:05:37.610 - 00:05:45.834, Speaker A: So excited to get more people building on it. There's actually a ton of DApps out there today. We did a pretty good job on getting the ecosystem on board.
00:05:45.834 - 00:05:54.110, Speaker A: Definitely a long way to go to get more tools. If we're missing anything in our ecosystem, please let us know. We're always looking to expand partnerships.
00:05:54.110 - 00:06:09.780, Speaker A: So, yeah, so far today, we've actually already bridged 145,000 ETH. It's pretty gone pretty well. And then our transaction volume has surpassed Ethereum pretty consistently for a month or so.
00:06:09.780 - 00:06:30.410, Speaker A: We're also the fastest L two to actually get 100,000 users. So that's kind of the main thing that Base can bring is we have around 100 million, a little over 100 million KYC users on the exchange. And how do we slowly push them to actually being on Chain? We have a ton of users that bought Bitcoin, they bought ETH, they kind of get it, but they haven't done on chain stuff.
00:06:30.410 - 00:06:54.190, Speaker A: So how do we make good user experiences for them to move into this new world? So high level? The main thing that we wanted to build Base for was we wanted to have a tool out there that we could start to move a lot of our products on chain. We started as a very centralized company and so slow and steady. We will start to rebuild some of our internal products to be just completely on chain by default.
00:06:54.190 - 00:07:07.890, Speaker A: So there's lots of examples here and it goes across both actually our consumer facing products and our institutional. So you got the full list here. Gives you kind of like a good spread of where we're heading.
00:07:07.890 - 00:07:22.714, Speaker A: So I want to go over just some of the tools available to you. If you're a developer, a lot of these will be familiar, but we also have some net new ones that are kind of specific to the Op super chain. So I think Etherscan is probably going to be the best well known here.
00:07:22.714 - 00:07:30.246, Speaker A: We have our own version, it's called Base Scan. With that just for pure redundancy. We have a second version for Block Scout.
00:07:30.246 - 00:07:40.682, Speaker A: It's very familiar. But then these other three you may not be as aware of. Route Scan or super scan is actually a Op superchain explorer.
00:07:40.682 - 00:08:02.418, Speaker A: So it'll actually show like base optimism. Main net, Zora network, public goods network, all side by side. So being able to do a better job of putting L two blocks side by side in the Op super chain and then Dexru and Tenderly both have a little bit different focus, kind of based on use case node providers.
00:08:02.418 - 00:08:10.846, Speaker A: We have a ton, everybody needs an RPC endpoint. So a lot of these you are probably familiar with. I do think Alchemy recently launched.
00:08:10.846 - 00:08:20.140, Speaker A: So they are on here now. So easy for this. If anybody has any questions about node providers or if we're missing one that you like, come talk to us.
00:08:20.140 - 00:08:40.770, Speaker A: Oracles so I think Chainlink and Pyth probably have the most feeds that's just if you need off chain data and use it into your product, they have a ton of feeds available. Redstone is fairly new. They're starting to spin up more feeds and then supra launched their Verifiable random function.
00:08:40.770 - 00:08:59.590, Speaker A: So if you need random numbers, that's available on base now data indexers, I know that a couple of these are here, these are the big three. If you need to do graph API of on chain data or have it indexed in a custom way, it's available to you. Cross chain messaging.
00:08:59.590 - 00:09:14.550, Speaker A: So AxLR with squid, router layer zero with stargate, and then wormhole. So if you want to do Bridging in between other L two S or do cross chain messaging. We are focusing on kind of like base is a bridge, not an island.
00:09:14.550 - 00:09:30.690, Speaker A: So we do want to work with all the L two S and make it so that they're interruptible for Dows, for actual just bridging of assets for doing DFI. So very much so we are in it for the ecosystem and for furthering Ethereum. And some of these tools help further that mission.
00:09:30.690 - 00:09:42.360, Speaker A: Okay, so most of you guys are devs here. Tool chains, very basic, ripped a truffle. If anybody saw the Tweet yesterday or the day before, they did say they're going to close down in 90 days.
00:09:42.360 - 00:10:01.942, Speaker A: But as if you're familiar with EVM, very basic build, deploy, test and then clients, same work with Ethers, work with Web Three, one newer kind of client to the game. Has anybody used VM yet? A little bit. All right, so that's a newer client.
00:10:01.942 - 00:10:12.970, Speaker A: It's just much more tide friendly. I've been growing as a fan of it. Okay, so for support for this hackathon, we do have our own Base Discord.
00:10:12.970 - 00:10:22.610, Speaker A: We kind of break it down into infra developer smart contract, front end. So if you want support, it will be there. We also will be on the ETH Global discord.
00:10:22.610 - 00:10:39.750, Speaker A: Okay? So for our actual bounties here so build the consumer product. So kind of Coinbase is like a short motto, is the most trusted, the most secure, easiest to use. So that's kind of how Coinbase has grown to where it is, is focusing on those three tenets.
00:10:39.750 - 00:10:52.926, Speaker A: And in line with that, build a consumer product truly is like make it easy to use. So we want to see very creative consumer products. So we're not trying to go after just another financial use case.
00:10:52.926 - 00:11:01.280, Speaker A: We want to see something that's like a consumer could use, they could understand it. It's not confusing. So we gave just a few examples here.
00:11:01.280 - 00:11:28.760, Speaker A: Use account abstraction, make subscriptions easier, do something with ticketing, show kind of some benefits of what being on chain means and how that's more visible and helpful. Second big bounty is just do a creative NFT project. So we wanted to be vague on this on purpose just so that you can be creative and fit kind of with what you want to build.
00:11:28.760 - 00:11:42.382, Speaker A: So, examples here are like we had on chain summer. We had a ton of users go through and mint different NFT collections. Like, what could you find out from that activity? Another account abstraction kind of idea.
00:11:42.382 - 00:12:07.800, Speaker A: But how could you combine paymasters with NFT activity to actually choose, do I pay for gas for somebody or not? And some novel ways of doing that onboarding. Six x five one wallets. So if anybody has a good use case for actually using the NFT wallet for loyalty program, I don't want to be very prescriptive with use case, but just creative use of it.
00:12:07.800 - 00:12:32.018, Speaker A: And then lastly, how do you combine NFTs with Attestations? So Ethereum Attestation Service went live on Base two weeks ago, and it's just a way to be able to attest on a custom schema that somebody did something or has something. Okay, so before I do Q-A-I just want to show one fun project that I've been a fan of. So this is called base paint.
00:12:32.018 - 00:12:45.054, Speaker A: And so this was just a project that every day people agree on a theme. People can come in and do one pixel. So did anybody take place in the reddit our place? A few people.
00:12:45.054 - 00:13:01.234, Speaker A: So it's kind of like a different idea of that, is that every day you have pixel artists, they can do many pixels based on a time frame. After 24 hours, it gets snapshotted and people can mint those NFTs. So yesterday, apparently the theme was Lens.
00:13:01.234 - 00:13:06.870, Speaker A: So here's a Lens Garden custom art piece. You can mint it. They're not very expensive.
00:13:06.870 - 00:13:22.726, Speaker A: And then after that 24 hours, the open edition ends. And my favorite part is that the amount of ETH that was collected. So in this example, Lens Garden yesterday has had 1400 ish mints.
00:13:22.726 - 00:13:30.954, Speaker A: So far, that was 3.4 ETH. And what they do is actually take that ETH income that they had and they redistribute it to the pixel artist.
00:13:30.954 - 00:13:46.920, Speaker A: So 645 artists got some amount of that 3.4 ETH. So just a very creative, consumer friendly way of, hey, let's get people to collectively make an art piece, let's mint it, and let's redistribute those funds back to the artists with that.
00:13:46.920 - 00:13:50.760, Speaker A: Does anybody have any questions? Yeah.
00:13:53.770 - 00:14:03.640, Speaker B: Once documentation, can you provide to stuff like React Native or just seems like API for make for A?
00:14:04.030 - 00:14:23.120, Speaker A: Yeah. So Base is our main website, and under here, Docs, it kind of has like, the high levels of what all of our actual ecosystem partners have. But if you're kind of new to Solidity or Smart contracts, basecamp is a pretty well formulated walkthrough of all these.
00:14:23.120 - 00:14:33.746, Speaker A: Kind of like, what are ERC, 20 tokens? What is a lot of the basics of these? And we do have like, NFT badges once you get through certain sections. So this is always my starting point.
00:14:33.848 - 00:14:40.100, Speaker B: Okay, is there any doll SKS or V store?
00:14:42.650 - 00:15:05.130, Speaker A: Yeah. So the question was, are there any other SDKs for Base? So essentially the Op stack is EBM equivalent. So almost anything that works on just L one ethereum, you should be able to use directly in place with base, you would just switch out your RPC endpoints to point to the correct chain ID and the correct RPC node.
00:15:05.290 - 00:15:10.270, Speaker B: Correct. Sound good. Thank you from Dow.
00:15:10.270 - 00:15:19.182, Speaker B: I knew that outside. I didn't see it. You work on my mic? Both yeah.
00:15:19.182 - 00:15:21.040, Speaker B: Just went down. So question.
00:15:22.470 - 00:15:45.840, Speaker A: Yeah, so the question was, where can you guys seek out help in the ETH Global Discord? We should have a partner Coinbase channel, and so we have a few people remotely that will be monitoring that. And then we're more than happy to jump on Google Meet or Discord video. Yeah.
00:15:45.840 - 00:15:50.140, Speaker A: Then I think we got two minutes out of schedule. Thank you all.
