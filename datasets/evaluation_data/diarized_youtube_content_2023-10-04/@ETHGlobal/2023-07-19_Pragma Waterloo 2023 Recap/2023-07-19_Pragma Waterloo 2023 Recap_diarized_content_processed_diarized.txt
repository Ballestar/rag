00:00:02.490 - 00:00:08.590, Speaker A: Good morning, everybody. My name is Kartik, one of the co founders of ETHGlobal. And I'm super excited to welcome all of you to Pragma.
00:00:08.590 - 00:00:14.218, Speaker A: The goal of Pragma is to open up what's happening in this space to even a wider audience.
00:00:14.394 - 00:00:28.760, Speaker B: Waterloo is, I think, hub of Canadian computer science. Right. It's a university where there's just a lot of really great and frontier research happening.
00:00:32.250 - 00:00:43.286, Speaker C: It's amazing to be in Waterloo. I went to university here. It's also where CryptoKitties was born and that was obviously one of our first big projects and what kicked off all of Dapper labs.
00:00:43.286 - 00:00:47.002, Speaker C: So it's really exciting to be here. Almost exactly six years after we started.
00:00:47.056 - 00:01:06.210, Speaker A: The whole thing with the very first Hakathang, we did one project specifically stood out. You may know this as CryptoKitties. And when we're coming back here after all this time, I'm excited to announce that we have purchased a CryptoKitty for everybody here and it's now in all of your wallets.
00:01:07.750 - 00:01:14.900, Speaker D: It was a very intimate space and you really got to feel like you're in the same room with some of the speakers. Especially enjoyed Vitalik's talk.
00:01:20.250 - 00:01:29.450, Speaker C: I really enjoyed Vitalik's talk. I thought it was a great way to start the conference and it was really gratifying to see all the other teams building amazing things in the ecosystem.
00:01:30.910 - 00:01:44.830, Speaker B: EAP 1559 and the merge together, they massively reduced users experience confirmation times. For me, they reduced it from this weird thing that's between two minutes and an hour to just reliably being able to get stuff confirmed in 12 seconds.
00:01:45.330 - 00:01:55.410, Speaker E: It's actually something we've been working on for over two years. It's called power protocol. And what I presented on stage was the first live demo of our testnet.
00:02:00.550 - 00:02:15.010, Speaker F: We're here at Waterloo to actually announce a new product feature that we're going to be offering called Tally Swaps, powered by cowswap. And this allows DAOs to do on chain mev proof swaps for tokens. So it's very transparent.
00:02:15.010 - 00:02:19.290, Speaker F: You don't have any trust requirements and it's all on chain natively.
00:02:25.850 - 00:02:38.060, Speaker G: Love, innovation, community like regenerative projects. And so kind of what I'm trying to bring into the Web Three ecosystem is like converging all of my passions through building cool projects and meeting cool people.
00:02:42.110 - 00:02:59.570, Speaker A: For us, we're starting to open up quest creation to everyone. So we believe that in decentralization, we want to have a permissionless protocol where anyone can send and receive quests, just like anyone can send and receive emails. So we think quests are a way for protocols to assign work for anyone to assign work in a decentralized context.
00:03:00.790 - 00:03:09.346, Speaker H: The end goal of this is that we want to populate empty worlds. There's so many of these metaverses autonomous worlds that are very empty. They're ghost towns.
00:03:09.346 - 00:03:17.560, Speaker H: And we believe that it's going to be a factor of humans and NPCs playing around in these digital worlds and giving life to it.
00:03:20.650 - 00:03:21.400, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:24.250 - 00:03:48.900, Speaker C: I think the most important thing I always want to get across when people hear me talk is that we're just started on this technology, that there's no way in which we've figured out all of the interesting use cases that this technology can be used for. By now, there's just so much more to discover, and I just want to encourage everyone and get everyone excited about the idea of finding new use cases and not just leaning on and recreating what we've seen before.
