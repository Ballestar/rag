00:00:08.810 - 00:00:21.520, Speaker A: Jocelyn. And I'm the APAC growth lead from MakerDAO. So today I will talk about some of the challenges that Maker Dow actually face when we are transiting to make it out 2.0
00:00:21.520 - 00:00:52.460, Speaker A: and to talk about how much decentralization is enough. And how does MakerDAO focus on building stronger governance structure and finding ways to balance profitability with decentralization, which is I think it's a constant struggle for a lot of DAOs in the space. So before I start right, how many developers are there in the audience or everyone? Community builder? No.
00:00:52.460 - 00:01:05.918, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Obviously DAOs are here today and it is an emerging part of the ecosystem, the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:01:05.918 - 00:01:29.640, Speaker A: So today there are about 5000 Dows out there that you can potentially be a governor of. And obviously some might be focused on fundraising investment and then while others may be focusing on just specific verticals or social causes. So I actually took this diagram from Gitcoin report that they published last year.
00:01:29.640 - 00:01:57.330, Speaker A: I mean, this goes to show how complex Dow decision making process is, right? If you look at that model on the left, it's a splice of vote delegation data. So each node is a voter and each edge is actually a delegation transaction. And imagine this is just Gitcoin Dow voting desertion.
00:01:57.330 - 00:02:38.190, Speaker A: So why do we want to learn about Dao? Obviously by studying different know, we get a better understanding of the various ways in which they are structured and governed. And for example, some Dows may have a more democratic decision making process and then some of the Dows may be a little bit more centralized or hybrid decentralized centralized governance structure. Dow is essentially enabled by the smart contracts, right? And it is supposed to be self sustainable.
00:02:38.190 - 00:03:18.330, Speaker A: But the thing is, I figured that a lot of Dows out there today, they tend to actually focus on a lot of short term plans. For example, building the culture, building the team, building the product roadmap and then obviously fundraising and think about and scaling the protocol itself and a lot of times basically mapping out long term strategy for the protocol get left behind. For example, building a sustainable Dow, right? Because it is supposed to be self sustainable, it's powered by a set of smart contracts.
00:03:18.330 - 00:04:00.006, Speaker A: I'm just going to share a little bit more about MakerDAO journey itself before diving deep into the governance, the new governance structure actually. So if you look at back in 2017, PSI, which is the first version of Dai backed by just Ethereum, was launched in 2017 by the Maker Down Foundation. And then in 2019 we have the multicolateral die launch which is backed by various types of different decentralized collateral types.
00:04:00.006 - 00:04:17.562, Speaker A: For example, your LP pools on curve eve. Stake Eve and then stake Eve. And then some other governance tokens, for example, Urine Finance decentraland mana token polygonmatic as decentralized collaterals.
00:04:17.562 - 00:04:36.950, Speaker A: And then fast forward to 2021, the foundation dissolved. So the foundation was set up in a way where we have always set up in a way where eventually the foundation will be dissolved and it will become a Dow. It isn't a name itself, right? Make a dow.
00:04:36.950 - 00:05:07.210, Speaker A: In 2021, the foundation steps down and actually hand over, I think, 80,000 of MKR token to the Dow and transferring the full power to Maker Dow token holders. And in mid 2021, that's where we go on a full Dow mode. So we went on a full Dow mode where I think there are like about ten different core units being established for different various purposes.
00:05:07.210 - 00:05:48.982, Speaker A: We have the Protocol Engineering core unit, which is in charge of building the smart contracts for the Protocol. And then we have the Growth core unit, which I'm actually currently working for, which will be dissolved in two months. Essentially, core units are just, you know, like know, within the yeah, contributing to the in last year, we had a new endgame plan and that was introduced by the founder Rune Christensen.
00:05:48.982 - 00:06:09.140, Speaker A: So Rune actually came up with a new endgame plan, which I'm going to share a little bit more about endgame plan later on. And then we have the Maker institution approved early this year. And then right now, we're in the midst of actually restructuring the governance model.
00:06:09.140 - 00:06:52.062, Speaker A: So the existing governance model, it's powered by three pillars, right? Which is for example, we have contributors like me contributing to the Protocol. We get paid for working for the Protocol. And then we have the Maker improvement proposal, similar to the Ethereum Foundation ethereum improvement proposals, where partners can actually put forth proposals to put forth different proposals to make decisions about various different parameters within the Protocol itself.
00:06:52.062 - 00:07:31.280, Speaker A: For example, Die, I mean, like for for Die to be minted, you know, Avault holders will have to over collateralize at 150% today, but for different collateral type other than Ethereum, the collateralization ratio could be higher. So these are the decisions being made by the Mega token holders, right? Which is the third pillar. We have the Mega token holders and their delegates coming in to make decisions, to make important decisions for the Protocol itself.
00:07:31.280 - 00:08:02.498, Speaker A: This end of the year, we will be launching six confirmed subdoubs. So they're essentially like smaller Dow core units within the Protocol itself. There you and for all DAOs, including MakerDAO, right? The key goal for a Dao is really to balance decentralized governance and operational effectiveness.
00:08:02.498 - 00:08:36.034, Speaker A: Today, if you look at how long winded or slow the governance process is, it is because DAOs are very much relying on decentralized governance because there is no CEO in charge of anything. So decision making process becomes very slow and contentious. Another goal for DAOs is also to balance the trade offs between decentralization and profitability of DAOs, right.
00:08:36.034 - 00:09:14.618, Speaker A: For example, for MakerDAO, we have centralized assets backing Dai today. So like USDC, I do know that a lot of community MakerDAO, community members against the idea of having centralized collateral and the system backing die. But the thing is, if you look at say, tokenized rower assets today, tokenized Row assets like tokenized bonds are actually bringing in 75% of revenues to the protocol.
00:09:14.618 - 00:09:26.542, Speaker A: So we have been actually working with different banks, right, in Europe and US. But in Europe it was societal general which is the second largest French bank. It started out as a pilot.
00:09:26.542 - 00:09:47.726, Speaker A: Recently they minted 30 million die against tokenized bonds backed by consumer loans. And then we have Huntington Valley Bank, which is a tier two community bank in the US. They likewise used tokenized syndicated loans as collateral in the system to mint 100 million worth of Dai.
00:09:47.726 - 00:10:05.950, Speaker A: So that's a lot of revenues for the protocol. So that's something that we need to balance basically profitability and decentralization because ultimately I think Dow is still a business. We need to make money to pay contributors and to make the maker token holders.
00:10:05.950 - 00:11:09.234, Speaker A: So that's something regulatory risk. Dow exists in a very gray area today because there's no legal structure to determine what a Dow is. And for a Dow to basically how do Dao even actually function without traditional corporate management structures, right? How does the legal status be defined? And if there's something happened to a Dow, if the funds are stolen from the protocol, who are accountable? So these are the different questions that I think even people like us in the space, contributors like us in the space trying to figure out addressed and policymakers and regulators are also slowly looking at regulating DAOs in the US.
00:11:09.234 - 00:11:54.590, Speaker A: I know that they have a Wyoming Dao law that's I think probably the first regulatory framework put forth for Dows. Right? So the key challenges that we are facing today it's obviously, like I said, the very slow and contentious decision making process and it is difficult to achieve decentralized environment because it is just too slow. As the Dow or the protocol actually get more users, you see a lot more nuances in the forum.
00:11:54.590 - 00:12:21.046, Speaker A: So it's very difficult to actually filter off all these proposals being put forth by both the partners and also the noises on the forum, the feedback. Okay, I wouldn't say noises and that also slows down decision making process profitability. Again, like I said, it's very difficult to balance the desire for profitability with the need for decentralization.
00:12:21.046 - 00:12:51.646, Speaker A: Because like all DAOs, at least for MakerDAO, right, the purpose of launching Maker has been always for decentralization. Maybe along the way we onboarded some centralized collaterals in the system. But essentially I think what we are trying to aim here is really to build a decentralized protocol where it is 100% censorship resistant.
00:12:51.646 - 00:13:49.080, Speaker A: And that is also why we are going through this transition right now to build a stronger governance structure to take that complexities away from the current protocol because we have way too many centralized railroad assets that are exposed to the real world regulatory risk yeah. And so as you guys know, I think it is very clear today that how regulator rules will actually change the Dow's direction and therefore I think it is very important to take into consideration different possible regulatory stances or scenarios and plan ahead your development roadmap or even protocol roadmap. So these are the three different stances of collateral backing Dai itself.
00:13:49.080 - 00:14:20.462, Speaker A: So this might be outdated but then I think it's a good idea to actually showcase how we take into consideration all these different possible regulatory environments and basically make and adjust the different collateral types in the protocol itself. So for the first three years pigeon stunts is that we maximize full growth within the protocol. So we double down on all the real world assets collateral in the system.
00:14:20.462 - 00:15:17.250, Speaker A: For example, all these tokenized railroad assets that we have been onboarding in collaboration with centrifuge and we will use that income, which is the revenues to acquire more ETH. So basically going back to the genesis time where Dai or PSI was just backed by ethereum because today we have more than just so ideally after three years which can be delayed by governance, it's a balance between growth and resilience where we plan to actually reduce the railroad assets exposure to just 25%. So that is only if we find that there's maybe a slight, I don't know, like authoritarian threat to the protocol.
00:15:17.250 - 00:15:58.398, Speaker A: That's what we will do, which is to reduce RWA exposure to 25% and potentially free floating die away from the US dollars. But again, like I said right, it can be delayed by the governance and obviously it very much depends on the regulatory environment. And then so if the threat of authoritarian or regulator attack grows, what we will do is that we will still have railroad assets in the system backing Dai but we will implement physical resilient, centralized collateral in the system.
00:15:58.398 - 00:16:40.220, Speaker A: Which means which means regulators cannot seize all these assets, right? It has got to be on chain somewhat. Again, free floating die away from the US dollars is also likely if that happens. So what is the new end game plan? So the new endgame plan is to break down the Dow into smaller Dow units, right? For example, there are I think four subdoubs now being spun off.
00:16:40.220 - 00:17:20.170, Speaker A: I don't think we are the first to actually spin off subdows but for us I think the aim is really to overhaul how MakerDAO functions in its core. Core units, which is the existing structure can be a little bit gatekeeping sometimes because looking at the amount of proposals being submitted to the forum someone has got to do the filter, right? And the core units, which is the core contributors or workforce will have to do that, I don't know, filtering. So sometimes we can be deemed as gatekeeping.
00:17:20.170 - 00:17:51.410, Speaker A: But I think at the beginning when you launch a Dow, when there are a lot of proposals, I think there must be a filter in a way that's also the very reason why we recognize that it is an issue like core units. And core units cannot be submitting proposal on the forum and also at the same time executing it. So that's also the very reason why we are spinning off all these different subdals with different scopes and frameworks.
00:17:51.410 - 00:18:15.398, Speaker A: So yeah, basically to remove all the complexities and keeping the core protocol lean. The core protocol is essentially just make a protocol which users can go to and borrow die or min die against ethereum. So that's the end game for megadao.
00:18:15.398 - 00:18:49.990, Speaker A: And then all these subdoubs will be in charge of say for example, the tokenized role assets and then incubation of other different protocols built on top of MakerDAO. And all these subdoubs are supposed to adhere to the maker constitution. So the maker constitution is essentially like guiding principles to lay a new foundation for the protocol's, governance, development and investment of its reserves within the treasury.
00:18:49.990 - 00:19:23.046, Speaker A: And then it is also a set of official documents, right, which consists of twelve different articles to lock down all the rules and scope areas of MakerDAO's operations. This is what I was saying. So while we are entering the new endgame era for MakerDAO, this is something that we are in the midst of doing basically to restructure the protocol governance itself into constitutional voter committees and constitutional delegates.
00:19:23.046 - 00:20:05.022, Speaker A: So what is constitutional voter committees? In my view, they're like political parties. So basically you have different political parties forming different strategies which is aligned to what the mega token holders want. And then you have the members, which is the politicians joining this like making sure so CVC members, which is the politicians, discuss the vision and make sure that the constitutional delegates actually follow the and then, so in another words, CVCs are like political parties like I mentioned before.
00:20:05.022 - 00:20:55.260, Speaker A: And then CVC members are like the politicians and CDs, which is the constitution. Delegates are like experts that are hired that are tasked with removing all these different proposals and strategies, understanding them and making sure that they will vote according to the CBC strategy that they're following. As the protocol actually grows, it becomes way too complex and this is something that the new governance structure it's doing to help to basically decentralize the protocol more.
00:20:55.260 - 00:21:31.530, Speaker A: I'm just going to quickly go through a few of the key changes right within the constitution. So you have, sorry, eleven constitutional articles and twelve scope frameworks and one of the key changes is to invite constitutional conservers which is the external parties to facilitate governance operations. And then we are also allowing delegation of mega tokens as collateral because today mega token holders will have to stake their mega token in order to vote.
00:21:31.530 - 00:22:09.750, Speaker A: But that comes with an opportunity cost, right? Because with the current market environment there is a lot to do with their governance tokens. So this is a big change to the constitution allowing voters to be able to use maker tokens as collateral to so we'll be launching six subdaos by end of the year alongside with the activation of Endgame. And yeah, I think that's pretty much about it for the constitution.
00:22:09.750 - 00:22:39.390, Speaker A: So there are about twelve different scopes. Yeah, these are the different scopes and frameworks which is to establish the functional limits that make a Dow the protocol and Dai must operate within. So these scopes also outlines the specific areas where contributors can focus their efforts to improve the systems while staying aligned with Maker constitution and endgame goals.
00:22:39.390 - 00:22:57.910, Speaker A: So there are four ecosystem actors. If you look at these five different companies being spun off, right. They have been incubated and onboarded by the Mega governance.
00:22:57.910 - 00:23:28.990, Speaker A: Basically, the work previously handled by the core units, right, is being moved to all these multiple independent companies today, independent contracting companies today to basically improve decentralization because you have all these companies that are not part of the core Dow. So the core Dow will be just maker dow. Die, ethereum.
00:23:28.990 - 00:23:59.098, Speaker A: The structure will become more project based. I mean, as in a lot of all these different companies, they will be paid on project based funding. Basically, having been involved in both systems, I think this one is already looking to be much more efficient because as the protocol actually develops like Megadao, we have a lot of things that are already built.
00:23:59.098 - 00:24:24.240, Speaker A: And I think the things that we need to improve is actually governance process. So for example, we have protocol engineering building, multi chain strategy and those are separate projects, right? They're not part of the core protocol. In a way, yeah.
00:24:24.240 - 00:24:37.830, Speaker A: All in all, in summary, this is what MakerDAO 2.0 will become. It will become a third party ecosystem.
00:24:37.830 - 00:25:06.826, Speaker A: It will be formed by third party ecosystem players to create solutions on top of the maker protocol, all these independent companies rendering services to Makerdow and its subdaos. And obviously right now we're going through this restructuring, we're building a more decentralized, robust governance model. And then with this subdos being spun off, there will be a new tokenomic system for all these subdoubs.
00:25:06.826 - 00:25:39.770, Speaker A: So meaning that they will be having their own governance tokens. So with that yeah, let me just end this presentation with a quote from Lao Tzu the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step because I think DAOs are still a relatively new area and there is so much to be learned and explored in terms of their potential and limitations. So if you are decentralization Maxis Dows, this is just the beginning.
00:25:39.770 - 00:26:14.094, Speaker A: If you're building a Dow, there's so much to learn from other Dows. And I think as long as our intentions are pure, making sure that when you're building a decentralized protocol, meaning that you're building one and not just, I don't know, a hybrid one. And as long as we continue to experiment with all these new building blocks and new structures to improve the shortcomings.
00:26:14.094 - 00:26:27.702, Speaker A: I think Dows in the very future can very well become the only way to actually organize communities. Right. It might not be, I don't know now, it might be, I don't know, a decade or two decades from now.
00:26:27.702 - 00:26:41.054, Speaker A: Right. I think what I'm trying to say is that Dao is still very new even for Megadao being the oldest Dao in the space. Yes, that will be all for me.
00:26:41.054 - 00:26:53.166, Speaker A: Questions from the floor? No. Oh yes. Or subdow is being stopped initially.
00:26:53.166 - 00:27:13.846, Speaker A: You're curious about this for so there's a refi subdow and then there's also a real world asset subdow and the other two wait, hang on, let me see. Yeah, I mean, viridian is the RWA subdow, and then Phoenix Labs. Oh yeah.
00:27:13.846 - 00:27:45.810, Speaker A: And Phoenix Labs, the new labs similar to Uniswap Labs to incubate protocols. So the new protocol built that will be incubated on launch by Phoenix Labs will be a protocol called Sparks Protocol, which is an I mean, keep a lookout. I mean there will be a lot more protocols like being incubated by Phoenix Labs.
00:27:45.810 - 00:28:07.562, Speaker A: I can't remember the other one. Yeah. Wow.
00:28:07.562 - 00:28:47.014, Speaker A: I mean, looking at the current regulatory climate, right? Or even economic climate, it just doesn't make sense for us to look at some other risky assets, because in the past, we have been working very closely with Centrifuge tool. To use their tokenized invoices as collaterals and those actually has some risk with you're talking about a company defaulting on the loans and stuff like that. The current strategy is really to use the 1.25
00:28:47.014 - 00:29:03.306, Speaker A: billion USDC in the PAX stability module and use that to deploy into short term money market funds and US TBOS that is giving fetching like about 4.5% 5% yield. Right.
00:29:03.306 - 00:29:16.446, Speaker A: Now and basically use that revenues. Pump it back to the protocol, pay the contributors. I don't know, burn some maker, make the token holders happy.
00:29:16.446 - 00:29:39.378, Speaker A: Yeah, something like that. But I do know that I think one of the subdoubs will be spun off to basically focus on decentralized collaterals. So we have been actually in the process of offboarding a lot of decentralized collaterals this week and last week.
00:29:39.378 - 00:30:00.558, Speaker A: Yeah. So yeah. Christian, you yeah, I think if I'm not wrong, right.
00:30:00.558 - 00:30:17.582, Speaker A: I do know that CVC members or Facilitators, I mean, I don't know what is the term for it. They will have to stick their maker. They need to own a certain number of maker tokens in order to set up a CVC.
00:30:17.582 - 00:30:19.630, Speaker A: A committee. Yeah. Delegates.
00:30:19.630 - 00:30:50.412, Speaker A: Same thing, I think. Yeah, so I don't know, there's a lot of things going on right now, but if you want more information, I can actually send you a link afterwards. The bottleneck well, I think the bottleneck is still the governance.
00:30:50.412 - 00:30:59.510, Speaker A: Right. Too many people making decisions and then that slows down decision making process. Yeah.
00:30:59.510 - 00:31:23.610, Speaker A: And the thing is, I think as the protocol become more complex, there is conflict of interest or even incentives. I mean the difference of incentives incentives Are not aligned with all these different Maker stakeholders within the Protocol. It's very difficult.
00:31:23.610 - 00:31:48.752, Speaker A: I don't know, I think that's the key Bottleneck. I think the only way to really move forward is really to take away that, I don't know, independent Delegates. Delegates these days, right? They are also sort of I mean I don't want to say the wrong thing, okay.
00:31:48.752 - 00:32:35.056, Speaker A: I'm just going to be very honest with you because I think the group Is very small here. So I Mean, A lot of people actually see MakerDAO as the most decentralized Dao in the space, right? I mean, we are struggling with the whole centralization within the protocol because you often see certain decision being made by A party or a group of delegates that are being delegated this much mega Tokens. I guess when Dows progress, you will start looking at it like a country, right? You have all these different political parties and they have different strategies of making sure that the country does well.
00:32:35.056 - 00:33:09.094, Speaker A: So this is what I think Dow will become in the Future. It's still dow. But see, I think there's different definition of Dow, right? I Mean, if you come to think about it, I always tell people that doesn't mean that you cannot have a Leader.
00:33:09.094 - 00:33:30.722, Speaker A: I think It is still very important to have a leader to set the direction for the protocol because no one else will do that, trust me. Really? That's why people call it Leaders in the Pack, right? I mean, there is always a leader in the pack. Does that mean that it's not decentralized? I don't think so.
00:33:30.722 - 00:34:08.954, Speaker A: Because Decentralization can take it can be in the form of decision making process, right. Instead of just One CEO of a group of board members making decisions for that particular subject, you can Have, I don't know, maybe hundred of different Token holders voting on the decision. Yeah, I think it boils down to definition and like I said, I think over at Maker, I think essentially what we are trying to do is really to build just one simple base layer of Maker Protocol powered by backed by just Ethereum.
00:34:08.954 - 00:34:20.820, Speaker A: That's It. Or physical Resilient Collaterals where It is not possible to be seized by Regulators. Yeah.
00:34:20.820 - 00:34:40.924, Speaker A: And then if we want to work on or expand on Tokenized Row asset that will be handled by another Subdow or an independent Company. Okay. That's it, I guess.
00:34:40.924 - 00:34:44.580, Speaker A: All right, thank you everyone. Thanks for your attention.
