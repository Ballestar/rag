00:00:06.090 - 00:00:15.120, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETHGlobal and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to FVM Space War.
00:00:15.120 - 00:00:35.266, Speaker A: All of you are watching this on ETHGlobal TV. This is what we'll be using today for all of the live streams and talking about all the teams and the projects we're going to see, as well as answering any questions that may come up from what we will show off today. So for those of you who are joining us for the first time, this event is brought to you by Heath Global.
00:00:35.266 - 00:00:44.810, Speaker A: And Heath Global is an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the Web three ecosystem. And we do this by running hackathons and summits.
00:00:44.810 - 00:01:08.370, Speaker A: Space War Packathon is our first event of the year and we did both of these things for this event over the last couple of weeks. We kicked off the whole hackathon on Friday, the 20 January where we talked about what's happening in the entire world of Augment Virtual Machine and getting ready for the main net launch. But the next hour and a half is about the hackathon.
00:01:08.370 - 00:01:26.754, Speaker A: This is officially the world's biggest FBM hackathon out there. And our goal is to talk to all of you about what came out of this event over the past three weeks and all the amazing things that were built. We saw over 1000 people participate from 82 different countries standing 23 different time zones.
00:01:26.754 - 00:01:45.550, Speaker A: This is already such a massive widespread participation from our global community. And we're going to discuss all the things that everybody built and care about. We put everybody on a map to see where they're from and it still continues to blow us away that we have representation from so many different countries, continents and cultures.
00:01:45.550 - 00:02:12.786, Speaker A: On top of that, we also had six amazing ecosystem partners and 32 ecosystem mentors who are there to help you really understand what you can do on the Falcon Virtual Machine and all the creative things you can build when you now have programmable data. And to top it all off, we are giving over $125,000 in prizes and we're going to talk about all the prizes that all of you have won very soon. Want to give a quick shout out to all of our amazing partners.
00:02:12.786 - 00:02:31.470, Speaker A: So especially first and foremost ballcoin and also Huddle One Live Peer Lighthouse bush Protocol and Spiron. They're all giving an amazing amount of prizes and showcasing who built the coolest things using their technologies and SDKs. So we'll learn about all those winners very soon.
00:02:31.470 - 00:02:52.366, Speaker A: But let's get started with the demos. So, submissions were due four days ago from two and a half weeks worth of hacking time. And we were absolutely blown away to see that 1042 of you collectively worked on 275 projects.
00:02:52.366 - 00:03:11.770, Speaker A: That is already amazing to see. This represents such a big part of what's happening now in the FDM ecosystem. And from going through all of these submissions over the last few days, through kind of an intense judging process and a live feedback session and Q and A, we got down to twelve finalists.
00:03:11.770 - 00:03:32.746, Speaker A: These twelve teams are going to come on here today and demo what they built for all of us to see. And our goal is to highlight some of the really cool things that were built and are possible now on FVM. So, in no particular order, I'd like to announce and congratulate our twelve amazing finalists.
00:03:32.746 - 00:04:12.800, Speaker A: So please give a big round of applause, a shout out to Safe Build Filesaver collective dow Ninja, Dash, Z Kaggle, Honest Bill, Datablocks Eclipse, phil Swap FVM explorer FNS Lookup and Cosmic Chicken These are our twelve incredible teams that are going to come on here one by one and demo everything that they built. And our goal is to showcase to all of you the cool things you can do with these new primitives that are now possible by deploying on FDM. So, before we go into our very first demo, I want to take a quick second to highlight all the other incredible projects that were built during this event.
00:04:12.800 - 00:04:35.586, Speaker A: The 263 teams listed here were amazing projects that we were just absolutely excited about. We talked to all of our judges and our partners to get some feedback on what they saw and what they were excited about. And the excitement was unanimous from every single one of them.
00:04:35.586 - 00:04:56.810, Speaker A: And I want to congratulate all of these teams for taking the time to build so many really cool things and building things that you were excited about and really pushing what's possible in the world of Web Three. Just because you are not one of these twelve teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something that was not great. Our goal with the final is to highlight some of the things that we were super excited about.
00:04:56.810 - 00:05:28.360, Speaker A: And the goal here is that we want to help you and provide you with any resources we can to continue encouraging you to build and make sure that you get to continue building these projects after this event ends today. So please give yourself a massive round of applause for pushing to the end and building something that you can be proud of. And not only that, but also showcasing that and demoing it to all the amazing people that are part of these events from our ecosystem and now broadly, the Web Three space.
00:05:28.360 - 00:05:41.690, Speaker A: So congratulations to all 275 teams. But let's go back to our finalists. So if you are interested in seeing what came out of this event, you can now head over to Heapglobal.com
00:05:41.690 - 00:06:01.918, Speaker A: Showcase. You'll be able to see all of these projects here now, and that includes everything from how they were built to what they built, screenshots, video demos, and live demos, and their source code all of that is now public invisible and you can check this out immediately on our website. So let's go into the first demo.
00:06:01.918 - 00:06:14.900, Speaker A: So without further ado, I'd like to welcome our first demo of today and that is team Cosmic Chicken and they'll come on and show you what they build. So Jose, welcome and excited to see what Cosmic Chicken is.
00:06:16.950 - 00:06:24.920, Speaker B: Thanks. Well let me just share my screen. Cool.
00:06:24.920 - 00:06:46.670, Speaker B: So I'll start with the presentation. Hey everyone, thanks for your time. I'm presenting on behalf of the team that built Cosmic Chicken for this fem spacewarp akaton these were the epic people that spent last few weeks working on it and built something cool.
00:06:46.670 - 00:07:39.658, Speaker B: So what was our motivation? First we wanted to diminish capital costs for storage providers, then we wanted to create a yield opportunity for shield token holders and finally we wanted to leverage the chicken bot mechanism that was created by liquidity in order to bootstrap some protocol liquidity that could be a positive force inside the filecoin ecosystem. So, high level, what did we build? So we want to pay lenders and storage providers so each one of them will deposit 50% of the collateral into our staking pool and after that we'll be depositing the full amount of collateral that storage providers need on behalf of those storage providers and miners and accruing the rewards into our staking pool. So what does this mean in practice? So in this example we have three chicken bond holders that together will ship 40 field into the staking pool.
00:07:39.658 - 00:08:16.230, Speaker B: We have two storage providers that together deposit 25 field into the staking pool and afterwards the staking pool is depositing 50 field 2030 for each storage provider on behalf of them and accruing the rewards from their work until they repay the loan. So how did we made it? Both the chicken Laurens and the staking pool are solidity smart contracts that we deploy to wipersplane so you can check them addresses and afterwards we built a front end next JS where we use other JS and Loganity interact with the contracts and we deployed using Netlify. You can check the site at this URL.
00:08:16.230 - 00:08:33.722, Speaker B: So now it's time for the demo. This is our home page where we have time to do some coinumerations to explain what this is all about. As I explained, we have some information from lenders and storage providers explaining everything that happens when you join this protocol.
00:08:33.722 - 00:08:43.538, Speaker B: And we also explain about the Shigen bot itself. Shaken Bond is an er seven to one NFT token. It basically has three states.
00:08:43.538 - 00:09:05.610, Speaker B: You have the bonding state where we initially win the NFT where you are accruing the balance of booster field. You have Shikanin which means that you relinquish the initial capital that you used during the meet but get the yield that you accrued so far. And finally we got the chicken out where you lose the yield that you accrued so far but get back the initial capital.
00:09:05.610 - 00:09:22.320, Speaker B: We have a few more things in the home page, so feel free to check it out afterwards. I'm going now to move into the lender dashboard and I'll start by minting a new bond. So I'm minting a new bond for maybe 0.8.
00:09:22.320 - 00:09:48.258, Speaker B: We got the MetaMask notification where I'll be confirming and we should get transaction within Phil Fox that will be confirmed in a few seconds. Meanwhile, I'll explain to you what should happen in the storage provider dashboard. So in here, you need to deposit some money to act as your collateral.
00:09:48.258 - 00:10:10.554, Speaker B: Afterwards you can start a loan. As you can see here, the total one was for Tofield and eventually you pay it off and you will have it on the expired loans. For this, I'm going to switch to a new account just because this one already had a loan and I deposited some tokens previously.
00:10:10.554 - 00:10:22.178, Speaker B: And now I'm going to create a new loan for a storage provider. I'm going to put my address in both of the minor and yielder. I'm going to use my 0.5
00:10:22.178 - 00:10:42.858, Speaker B: and I'm going to consent to keep my eggs on the fridge. Again, we got this smart transaction, smart contract transaction, just open up on Shill Fox and I'll be going back to the lender. So in here we can see that we already got 0.8,
00:10:42.858 - 00:11:03.434, Speaker B: that I did the transaction, that a few minutes behind and that's pretty much it. Now, I can either she can in, as I explained, or she can out and both this will trigger a transaction that are not going now final. I want to explain a bit about the internal logic.
00:11:03.434 - 00:11:24.834, Speaker B: So, the Shiken bond itself has these five components. You got the pending bucket where the funds deposit might reside, you got the reserve bucket that accumulates deal both from the pending bucket, the permanent bucket and itself, and finally the permanent bucket which is the funds acquired by the protocol during the shaken. Finally, we got the virtual balance of boosted fuel.
00:11:24.834 - 00:11:43.046, Speaker B: That is the state where you are still bonding and accruing the boosted fuel on the virtual balance. And when you shaken in, you get the actual boosted fuel, which is an ERC 20 token that then can be used to claim from the reserve bucket funds. Finally, I just wanted to talk a bit about the future work.
00:11:43.046 - 00:12:02.754, Speaker B: So we think we should have some cool visuals for people to see what's going on to make sure that they are making a sound financial decision. We of course need some eggs that need to be fixed in the future. We also plan to deploy this to mainnet and need to still require a few changes for that.
00:12:02.754 - 00:12:06.630, Speaker B: That's it from my part. Thanks for your time, hope you enjoyed.
00:12:08.570 - 00:12:16.870, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much. Our first demo of the day and we're already seeing Deepi Primitives on FPM and also amazing T shirt.
00:12:16.870 - 00:12:30.220, Speaker A: Thanks for having us here at Global. All right, we are ready for our second demo and that is team Collective Dow. So Bachinar, welcome and let's see what you built.
00:12:30.990 - 00:13:29.600, Speaker C: I'm Kiril from Collective Dow team and during this hackathon we have been working on a non custodial liquid staking protocol on FalcoIn and what does it mean? For example if you are a fuel holder you can stake your field to our staking pool and get back interest bearing Shellfield token later you can use it in the future Falcon DeFi ecosystem or you can swap it back to your field with rewards which you got from miners and let me show how it works. Here is our UI connected to hyperspace network and now I can stake my fuel and get my clfuel in exchange. So we are sending transaction now and it will take some time from hyperspace to approve it and later I will see my changed balances here.
00:13:29.600 - 00:13:32.880, Speaker C: Also I can unstake it later.
00:13:35.410 - 00:13:35.822, Speaker B: Or.
00:13:35.876 - 00:13:47.990, Speaker C: Swap to myself heal to fill if there is not enough liquid in the pool and now Bach will tell you how it works. How can we help storage providers?
00:13:49.530 - 00:14:25.390, Speaker D: Hello everyone on the hyperspace we have a Jim who is an active hyperspace network storage provider. In order to cover his initial pledge requirements on filecoin storage mining he needs to provide some form of collateral called initial pledge and Collective dow liquid staking pool allows miners to get some file coin in order to cover those initial requirements. To get some of the file coin, miner need to perform two operations.
00:14:25.390 - 00:15:13.854, Speaker D: First of all is he need to register in the collected dao and change the beneficiary of his miner actor to the liquid staking pool and to do so he can use our Golang SDK which is a native Lotus extension model that you can see here a list of CLI commands. For example, storage provider can register in collective dow protocol, can change the beneficiary address and also interact with smart contracts such as collateral and staking pool. Right now I want to perform an operation which is called Pledging operation in which liquid staking pool will transfer some of the amount of file coin to cover the initial pledge requirements.
00:15:13.854 - 00:15:38.902, Speaker D: In order to pledge we need to provide the number of sector which is 53 and its proof and go long. SDK has generated our call data that we are going to pass here which is our Lotus node actively running on hyperspace network. And now we are going to wait for about 1 minute for this operation to be performed.
00:15:38.902 - 00:16:05.470, Speaker D: In the meantime I will come back to the presentation and continue. Our team consists of three people artong being our main designer, myself working on smart contract and Kiril being our full stack engineer. When it comes to our next steps, we want to integrate further with native proof built in method called proof commit sector which will finalize the ceiling process with Galactic dow protocol.
00:16:05.470 - 00:16:30.250, Speaker D: Also we want to introduce Staking router which is an obstruction layer that will give an opportunity for storage providers in the network to aggregate capital from multiple sources. After that we will perform a public audit and hopefully make it to the main net. As you can see now our transaction has not been confirmed.
00:16:30.250 - 00:16:45.870, Speaker D: In the meantime, I will show you what is the miners that we all know. The filecoin hyperspace network. Our miner has ID 24 eightya and its balance is about 1378 file coin.
00:16:45.870 - 00:17:03.406, Speaker D: We have two active sectors for half of the gigabytes. And now you see that our operation has successfully completed. Now this address is an owner of our hyperspace miner actor.
00:17:03.406 - 00:17:29.450, Speaker D: And if I refresh here I will see that my transaction which is a pledging operation. And in this pledging operation you can see that we successfully delivered 20 file coin to this address. If I click to this address, it's the same miner called Visa 24 80 and its balance has successfully increased by 20 fill.
00:17:29.450 - 00:17:53.380, Speaker D: We use 20 fill as a test value to show you that it's an amount that is covering both precommit deposits plus initial pledge requirements. In this case, we deliver the collateral on demand on the new sector added to the network without delivering the amount of file coin upfront. Thank you.
00:17:56.870 - 00:18:04.498, Speaker A: Amazing. That was really good to see. And another amazing primitive to add to the DSI bucket where we could do an FPM.
00:18:04.498 - 00:18:13.500, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much for that demo. And with that we are ready for our third demo of the day and that is Team FVM Explorer. Whenever you're ready.
00:18:16.750 - 00:18:39.366, Speaker E: So hey all this is drove and I will just go ahead and share my screen. Presenting to you all FPM explore and for FCM space replica thon myself Dhruvadawal. I am a FC developer and I have built this platform in the backend part.
00:18:39.366 - 00:18:57.470, Speaker E: I have my teammate of BHAZ Khan with me who has worked on the front end platform. So let's go over the problem first. For developers will discover the full potential of FPN chain and take advantage of all the perks it provides, which is important for it's important that the developer SPLs to be more accessible and easier to interact and contact.
00:18:57.470 - 00:19:06.700, Speaker E: Deployment verification, interaction and testing is a time consuming process for developers and it can result in lots of private keys as well. So we came up with.
