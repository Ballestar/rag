00:00:07.610 - 00:01:01.870, Speaker A: Hi guys again so today we will go talk more about business business stuff, less about technical stuff because about technical stuff you can find thousands of workshops, courses et cetera et cetera now we will be talk about something which hide it in the developer but in developing process. So as you know my name is Arseni, I develop relations in Gnosis builders, I'm in crypto since 2018 and I previously was founder of two startups so for this reason I went for all stages which I will talking today. So also alumni of Alchemist accelerator is like white combinator but for B two B startups and I also part of few dows and won a lot of hackathons.
00:01:01.870 - 00:01:36.762, Speaker A: So what we're talking about? So what's? A hackathon could be useful for build the project. How? Usually I look on the building project it's some kind of summary about experience of a lot of my friends and articles from YC and lectures and few books. And also we will talk how effective use the hackathons as conclusion and we'll try to help you convert your idea of the hackathon to the business idea.
00:01:36.762 - 00:02:34.162, Speaker A: So let's start from the reason why the people in general participate in hackathon most of people which I met and I was maybe on more than 100 hackathons third of this I won and I meet a lot of people around the world. Most of people I arrived make some achievement to take some achievement for CV spoiler it's not working usually hrs really don't understand what this hackathon is how it's working brings rise a reputation. This is the most important point I think earn money bounty style hunting it's also work partially because from my expertise when you're traveling to offline hackathon exactly to Europe or United States you not earn money because the trip and accommodation cost eat all your prices.
00:02:34.162 - 00:03:07.800, Speaker A: It doesn't matter how much money you want it will be spoiling on the travel. But it's a good point if you're going also into conference hackathon is partially work for creating MVP and to be ready to rise a grant or rise but it only depends not only your technical it's mostly dependent on not your technical skills. It's more dependent on your soft skills and business skills improve network also very important part find a job.
00:03:07.800 - 00:03:34.190, Speaker A: To be honest, I never find a job on the hackathons. But you can find by networks the guys who can hire you in the future and learn new technologies that also work, partially because the people who arrive the conference are mostly marketing guys or developer relations guys, and they provide you basic workshops. And you still need to spend time to learn it by ourselves.
00:03:34.190 - 00:04:13.422, Speaker A: So you still need to learn by yourself it's not working. So let's start what I can recommend to prepare how organize the process of creating Q ideas I use standard white combinator one pager as example you can see on the right of the slides. It usually consists of one liner problem product, market size, revenue model traction, team competitors and financing to be success on the hackathon and to be success in rising grant in building the project.
00:04:13.422 - 00:04:34.354, Speaker A: Success project will be generate not only wasting money but also revenue. You need to answer these questions and be ready to answer this question to guys who you pitch it. It also help you to transmit your idea to other guys and attract people to your team.
00:04:34.354 - 00:04:41.206, Speaker A: So let's start from one liner. On the right part, you see the example. And let's see on this.
00:04:41.206 - 00:05:07.646, Speaker A: So good one liner consists of the problem solution as a result. So the problem is identification of the problem which you're trying to solve. And usually it's related with customers which are focused on to solve this problem for the solution is usually description how products are going to solve this problem to customer which you mentioned in the first part and result is describe the success.
00:05:07.646 - 00:05:34.502, Speaker A: It's usually describe what kind of goods or pain points will be solved for customer and the good if you can add mechanics how you're going to earn the money from this solving the problem. So that's example many people struggle with answering what they do with the clarify and confidence. So it's a description of the problem.
00:05:34.502 - 00:06:02.818, Speaker A: There's a two abstract many peoples but still working the story brand one liner is a simple format that will help people realize why they need your product and service. The story brand is a name simple formula. It's a description of solution and result that people will realize their products and service they need the product and service.
00:06:02.818 - 00:06:33.142, Speaker A: So it's an example of this formula. Creating one liner is really important part because if you will watch y combinator videos about how to pitch your ideas to investors they have a classical formula with a 30 seconds pitch or they also name it as elevator pitch. And also starting from one liner.
00:06:33.142 - 00:07:22.922, Speaker A: The one liner is the first touch with your investor or customers to describe what you really do and it should attract attention of people which you're talking with to rise interest why they need to listen you next. So then usually going more information about the problem. The problem could be divided to main to four types is finance, financial it's usually what's the financial problem or what kind of financial goods you're going to bring to your customers.
00:07:22.922 - 00:07:58.870, Speaker A: It's usually reducing cost or help rise money or give opportunity to rise money from some free assets. For example productivity pain point it's usually improve the time management of your customers. For example with our solution you will don't waste time on the cleaning your house for example, it's about time effectiveness process pain point, it's about how you're going to improve the process.
00:07:58.870 - 00:08:31.040, Speaker A: It's pretty close to productivity but more about process itself. Where is where you involve with more people than just you and support pain point. Sorry is a it's a problem for example when you situated in critical situation and you need some kind of some support.
00:08:31.040 - 00:08:51.254, Speaker A: The good example of the support pain point is a lot of startups which provide chat, bots or personal assistance, et cetera, et cetera. Then going with switching to the product. Usually descriptions of products are strong related to the customers.
00:08:51.254 - 00:09:25.502, Speaker A: Every time you should think about who are the main customers, it could be one, it could be a few, it also should connect it to the problem. But in this point you need to be focused on how you're going to solve a problem and please do not use the technical terms. For example we are going to use the K book for blah blah blah just remove the technical stuff and focus on the solving of the description, what's the problem and how you're going to solve or what's the form for customer of a user will be.
00:09:25.502 - 00:09:54.006, Speaker A: And of course you need to be transparent to understand how you're going to earn money from this I can show you the bad example of this. We are creating ZK breach as a product description. It's not transmits the value, it not transmits who the customers, it's not transmit what's the difference with the competitors, et cetera.
00:09:54.006 - 00:10:25.226, Speaker A: But if you convert this product to we are going to make a service which allows in permission unless and protected by ZK Mathematics. ZK Mathematics is useful to describe that you don't need to pull off validators that help people to transfer money from one chain to other chain and we focus for example on hedge funds. It shows that you focus on the big zooms or you are focusing on interoperability messaging.
00:10:25.226 - 00:11:22.562, Speaker A: It means you will be focusing on the developers of cross chain DeFi protocols. Market size the few terms I don't want to spend much time on description because I'm not so good in marketing size. But usually if you can calculate a total addressable market service addressable market service or obtainable market as a different points which can help you to understand is it big market, what's the part of market you're going to cover with your service and what kind of money you need to cover this type of market? It usually help you to create hypothesis? Hypothesis because at the stage when you create idea, you make a lot of predictions.
00:11:22.562 - 00:11:59.890, Speaker A: And this type of research help you to understand how big is the market and how many people. You need to attract and how to attract these people what's the cost of attraction of these people and really help you to build you to build the business mobile and understand and understand from the beginning as a good project to spend time in general or it's just too small market. It's better to change idea a little bit or change customers target audit or something like this.
00:11:59.890 - 00:12:24.086, Speaker A: So it will be have to prove that this idea is big enough to earn money on this. Sorry. Yeah, I put some video about the description what is the market size? So use this because this guy is more professional in the market size stuff revenue model yeah, you should be transparent.
00:12:24.086 - 00:12:52.740, Speaker A: It's one of the important stuff when you pitch idea on the hackathons because most hackathons are focusing that after hackathon you're going to the sponsor expects that you will build the business. And it's important to tell people why your project will be profitable. Because if it will be not profitable, you can lose a motivation to spend time for nothing to building this project.
00:12:52.740 - 00:13:46.898, Speaker A: And sponsors don't understand why they need to support you if you're not going to continue work on this project. And in a very early stage of the project, of course you can make adjust hypothesis how you going to earn the money. But it's good to start think about this process from the beginning because it can be important to architecture and structure of your smart contracts or processes to be ready accept the payments or other type because if you build for example effective some tools which are for free solves the problem but you don't put any stuff how to earn Money from this Solving the problem it will be bad product first of all for you because you will not receive the money from this it's attraction.
00:13:46.898 - 00:14:30.850, Speaker A: It's more about after hackathon stuff, it's more about traction is usually proof that your predictions about the solution, about target auditor, about market, about the business model makes sense because attractions is only proof that shows that you was right. The traction could be different on different stage of MVP because MVP also could be different. It could be subscribers on your twitter because you provide some interesting stuff or you provide the interesting update and people really wait when you will be released.
00:14:30.850 - 00:15:07.214, Speaker A: But in this type of traction it's really hard to understand first of all for yourself that your product interested or your twitter interesting you should be careful with this traction. It's loyal, it's letter of intense, it's really cool stuff exactly for B, two B project to have letters of the potential customers who already know about your projects, who already want to buy your goods. It's much better than nothing.
00:15:07.214 - 00:15:37.042, Speaker A: Of course loyal not every time a loy converted to the deal but it's much better than nothing. Daily active wallet wallets sorry, my mistake. Daily active wallets it's some kind of abstractions when we believe that one wallet, one user and it's only one true characteristic which could be getting on chain from the yoda DeFi protocol.
00:15:37.042 - 00:16:26.680, Speaker A: So usually when you see the statistic of the big players like one inch or uniswap it shows that active wallets, how many tokens take it, how many LP tokens, et cetera and of course turnover and turnover it's also not direct stop exactly on the early stage but it's more important progress of the turnover. It's a going up, it's a good sign it's going down or not going at all, it's a bad sign. But important that you to show a dynamic of these parameters also and most important stuff at the beginning is because team because on the early stage investors are more interesting in the team.
00:16:26.680 - 00:16:47.374, Speaker A: So you need to show that you are able to build the projects. You're able to understand that your products are not good enough and you make a wrong decision at the beginning. And you should show that you're ready to understand this mistake and make a pivot before that.
00:16:47.374 - 00:17:29.222, Speaker A: You just will be out of investor money and arrive to new grants. So you should show that what's the way how to show it? First of all, you need be a team which I work together for sometimes so minimum one guys from your team should be expert in area where you're building a business. You also need to all expertise which required for this type of project and it's very cool if you have some guys who already have success exit from the previous startups.
00:17:29.222 - 00:18:06.710, Speaker A: These points are usually give advantage compared with the same team with the same product in the pitching to investors and in crypto people really afraid to put their real photos to the pitch decks but humans we still believe only in people which we meet in person. I have a lot of examples. When we have a call and then meeting and then have one more call, it's produced totally, much better results than we just have calls without any handshake and physical activity.
00:18:06.710 - 00:18:54.200, Speaker A: And it's much worse when we just talking with the guys on the call and don't show their face and we didn't see these guys in presentation tool and it's really not bring the connection and bring the relations because investor you should choose investors much careful than your wife because wife you can change an investor not sometimes no competitors Competitors is also important stuff. It's important to show direct and indirect competitors. The classical example of this is Airbnb not Airbnb, sorry.
00:18:54.200 - 00:19:27.982, Speaker A: There's some platform for Uberization cleaning service. For example when you can request the cleaning for your apartment in Uber style so in the same time or a little bit in advance they have direct competitor is a cleaning firm which you need to book in the one week you need a big apartment. They request a lot of time for this but the main competitor was indirect.
00:19:27.982 - 00:19:57.642, Speaker A: Indirect competitor in this example is people who clean their apartment by ourself. So it's also important to have a direct indirect competitors and understand who are bigger competitor and how you're going to fight with him show the difference and sometimes a faster and cheaper exactly when you have a B, two B business is not a true competitor advantage. You should be careful with this.
00:19:57.642 - 00:20:26.322, Speaker A: But if there isn't any difference, you need to show or describe to your potential investor and customers potential customers, how you're going to compete, how you're going to attract the users of already existing services. And also very hard to build your own business. It's very hard to build new market like it's produced by Uber.
00:20:26.322 - 00:20:59.662, Speaker A: Before Uber, we haven't any aggregators of taxi. So they create a totally new market and they spend time and money for educated people to grow this market from the beginning. And for these reasons, no competitors is usually a bad sign because you need in two times or three times more experienced and with good backup by investors and experts and very belief in your idea.
00:20:59.662 - 00:21:45.680, Speaker A: Because when you don't have competitors, it usually means that the people don't need this type of service. You should be careful with this financing, it's usually last part when you already have some prepare all other slides you understand how many money you need to prepare the time sheet about how many money for which type of activity you need to prepare. Some investors are recommend to avoid naming ground like don't name it Serra A or Sera B because bring labels, bring expectation of the size of the round so some people avoid this and have a good traction about it.
00:21:45.680 - 00:22:22.970, Speaker A: Don't include the terms because sometimes it's really flexible stuff so there isn't any best there are a few best practices, but it's so flexible because investigation market is exactly on the precede stage. It's really relation focused. So you can make a really different you have really different terms compared with your competitors with a better relation with investor or opposite.
00:22:22.970 - 00:22:54.206, Speaker A: It's really good to make the investigation or milestones or money spending connect to roadmap. It really can show that easy to show why you need this money and you have a plan how you're going to spend this money, that you see the risk and how you're going to manage this risk. One of the weaknesses of a lot of crypto startups they ask money mostly for technical stuff, for developing or team, et cetera, et cetera.
00:22:54.206 - 00:23:21.760, Speaker A: I totally forgot about go to market and marketing stuff or initial sales, lower stuff, audit stuff, et cetera, et cetera. So it's important to include to the budgeting also this nontechnical stuff also for incorporation. So how typical process of success startups looks like from my retrospective first of all, you should make a team.
00:23:21.760 - 00:23:50.614, Speaker A: You should be really good, cool, professional together which I will comfortably work together. You should understand weaknesses and benefits of all two members and how to work with these guys. I know a few teams which met on the one hackathon and after five or six hackathon, after year and a half they build a strong project which are rising money.
00:23:50.614 - 00:24:16.874, Speaker A: So the pro hackathon is really a good place to ment the team members to build the project in the future. Finding a problem. It's also not clear to developer guys because they working only in technical stuff and they think that okay, I will create this tool and it will be useful for every developers.
00:24:16.874 - 00:24:52.570, Speaker A: But unfortunately it's not working in this way. So you need to use researchers. It's a good idea to use already prepared research it's a good idea to create your own research customer developing, make interviews, talking with experts it's one of the reason why in team you need experts in the area who work more than 1015 years in area and he knows the pain point of this industry and understand who are the main customers Then we'll be creating product hypothesis.
00:24:52.570 - 00:24:58.860, Speaker A: This I'm talking before. It's about this is a problem. It's a problem for this type of customers.
00:24:58.860 - 00:25:51.254, Speaker A: These customers already pay this amount of money and these customers this number and big enough and a lot of hypothesis and you need to prepare the way how to check this hypothesis and what is a successful rate, what will be successfully showed this hypothesis working it's also important stuff so it could be solved by interview? It could be solved by surveys it could be solved by a B testing it could be solving a lot of stuff in web free not a lot of companies who provide this type of service and also painful stuff but at the same time it's transparent by on chain activity. So we can use only after this. I recommend you to go to the hackathon because you already have team, you have already problem, you already have hypothesis.
00:25:51.254 - 00:26:06.910, Speaker A: You only need to create something technical to prove this hypothesis. And also in hackathon you can get the first traction. First of all, you can go to the sponsor to make letter of intents.
00:26:06.910 - 00:27:02.930, Speaker A: You can go or use hackathon participants to for example mint some NFTs or make survey, provide some other type of activity and usually it's work really cool because people who attract hackathons are already active so they really like to learn something, they're really active, they're really ready to try it and they open to any problem which they are facing during the using your better version. For example, then usually after when you receive the traction, you have a hypothesis, you have, for example, this type of pitch deck, of course you're going to rise the money and you successfully rise the money. You start scaling, so you get more traction, you get more features, you get more et cetera, and you start just traditional loops of the bi agile methodology.
00:27:02.930 - 00:27:29.366, Speaker A: So what to do on the hackathon? So let's imagine that we arrive with team or we successfully find team on hackathon and we find the idea. So on the hackathon you can do market research, customer development, you can build your network of the early adopters or early users. It's a good idea to prepare a list of questions and organizers to effectively work on the venue.
00:27:29.366 - 00:28:06.040, Speaker A: Create a Team if you still haven't a team, it's good to create a team to the next hackathons. Create MVP or part of the MVP or check the hypothesis that it's impossible to implement at this point or see that the technology have a bags and owners of the technology need to solve the problem before you're going to create MVP. Get attraction because during the hackathon you can build for example some tooling which you can definitely ask to use by users or organizers and of course learn something new.
00:28:06.040 - 00:28:45.418, Speaker A: We're providing workshops, you ask us in the telegrams or discord and other channels and we're trying to help you and you do by the more important you read something, you try something and of course you need to have a fun because it's your life and it's too boring to spend all life on some serious shit. What to do after hackathon? It doesn't matter I will be winner or not winner. It's only have your useless achievement in your portfolio because from my experience it's really not help to raise the money if you're just hackathon winner without other stuff like strong team and traction.
00:28:45.418 - 00:29:10.602, Speaker A: Only winning hackathon is not bring you nothing. After hackathon you still have a group of the people which participate, you still have a connection with the sponsor and organizer. So continue make research, continue make customers development, continue talking with the people and provide updates about your project or other project or the same project which you built on the hackathon.
00:29:10.602 - 00:29:22.970, Speaker A: Also use these active guys to get attraction and of course spend time on the prepare new hackathon, learn new features and make everything from the list from beginning.
