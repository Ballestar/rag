00:00:07.290 - 00:00:14.330, Speaker A: So let's start since we've got like all the friends over here. So hello everyone. My name is Susie.
00:00:14.330 - 00:00:20.650, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. And just a little bit about me and also a little disclaimer.
00:00:20.650 - 00:00:58.462, Speaker A: So I used to be in part of some of the projects including some DeFi defy social Graph Matters, NFT and also I used to be Partnership and Growth for BNB chain. So it's a layer one blockchain and my expertise lies in growth, ecosystem growth, BD marketing and operations. So this little disclaimer here is that since I have a background in those kinds of areas, so I won't be too tax savvy person, so I won't touch a lot of details in the tech side.
00:00:58.462 - 00:01:14.906, Speaker A: But if you are willing to talk, we can definitely talk later about some tech. I'm always open to discussion, but let's dive into the topic for today. So before we dive into ERC token standards, we need to know a little bit more about EIP.
00:01:14.906 - 00:01:34.426, Speaker A: So EIP stand for ethereum improvement proposals. So an analogy here is like it's a suggestion box for Ethereum blockchain. So if you have a cool idea for Ethereum, either it can be new features or maybe changes to the system, or maybe just sharing information.
00:01:34.426 - 00:01:49.006, Speaker A: You can definitely raise an EIP standard. And there are different types of EIPS, including standard AIPS. It's absolutely system changing and those are very big ones.
00:01:49.006 - 00:02:11.266, Speaker A: It can define working mechanisms for Ethereum blockchain and there are meta EIPS, those are more about processes and environments and there are informational EIPS. So literally it's sharing information and guidelines. And let's touch a little bit more about standard track EIP categories.
00:02:11.266 - 00:02:25.306, Speaker A: There are four categories within the standard track EIPS. So the first one is core. So it propose changes that require consensus or even modify Ethereum's core code.
00:02:25.306 - 00:02:43.838, Speaker A: So this is a really big one. And other ones including networking, for example, like improving Ethereum network protocols. So for example, how Ethereum nodes communicate with each other is within this networking category and the third one is interface.
00:02:43.838 - 00:03:02.070, Speaker A: So for example, if you want to make changes to Ethereum's client API or standards. So for example, like how we interact with Ethereum, it's within the interface. And lastly it's ERC, those are application level standards and conventions.
00:03:02.070 - 00:03:26.990, Speaker A: So I want to touch a little bit about the review processes just in case. Like some of you guys here want to make an EIP proposal. So the first you need to draft your EIP and then you will go through reviews and feedback sessions and then there will be a last call for content or maybe like feedbacks and then it will be published to Ethereum.
00:03:26.990 - 00:03:44.542, Speaker A: And if you want to write a good EIP, there are certain standards. So for example, you need to be well written and thought out and also if you want to raise an EIP. So single EIP should only cover one idea or proposal.
00:03:44.542 - 00:04:07.094, Speaker A: So if you have several core ideas, you should be raising several EIPS and also as authors and content creators, you should build consensus and also deal with disagreements. So you're the mother and fathers of this EIP standards, so you need to take care of them. So it's truly a big deal for Ethereum network.
00:04:07.094 - 00:04:18.826, Speaker A: So take it seriously. We are going to diving deep into some of them. So let's dive into ERC So ERC stands for Ethereum request for comments.
00:04:18.826 - 00:04:41.014, Speaker A: So if you want to go to maybe ERC website, you can see a ton of them, including maybe the status of them. So including 27 21 and also like in the last session from Vitalik, he also mentioned like maybe 1271. Let's take that as an example.
00:04:41.014 - 00:05:10.126, Speaker A: So for example, it has the title and subtitle standard, signature validation method for contracts and table of contents, abstract motivation specification, rationale, code copyright, citation. It's like writing an academic article. So you need to be very careful about everything and also it has all the information on the website.
00:05:10.126 - 00:05:36.466, Speaker A: So go check that out. I know you guys are more techy than I am, so you guys know a lot about codes and everything, but I do want to mention about ERC 20 and ERC 721 a little bit because those are some things that we cannot really skip. So the first one is ERC 20 which stands for fungible token.
00:05:36.466 - 00:05:59.070, Speaker A: So it's the brainchild of Fabian and Vitalik which was introduced in 2015 November. So this is the first one size for all standard for Ethereum token. And also analogy that I really want to use is the sheer language, just like English for all the token that is established on Ethereum.
00:05:59.070 - 00:06:36.646, Speaker A: So since we all use English so I can communicate with you and I can communicate with you, it's not really like other languages like Mandarin. There are definitely other token standards that fit for maybe like some regions but not really like ERC 20 and some feature functions including total supply, balance, off allowance, transfer, approve and transfer from. And also we have other speakers from Open Zeppelin which is like I want to use the analogy of an Open recipe.
00:06:36.646 - 00:07:00.206, Speaker A: So if you have all the codes from that library, you can make your own cake, but you can spice it up with your talent. Just like adding some fruit onto that ERC token standard that you want to develop. But it's not all sweetness, it's not all like rainbow and sunshine about ERC 20, although it's a breakthrough.
00:07:00.206 - 00:07:17.350, Speaker A: So for example, if you guys are around here in 2016, there's the Dow attack. So there's a hacker finding a loophole within the smart contract of incoming token. So it caused 15 million loss into the black hole.
00:07:17.350 - 00:07:42.778, Speaker A: And also there are some limitations. I love this meme because like ERC 20 standard need to create a separate smart contract for every unique token type or combination of customizable features. Therefore there's an explosion of ERC 20 token standards and smart contracts on the market right now.
00:07:42.778 - 00:08:08.186, Speaker A: And also it's really hard for people to do those due diligences on those contracts. And another contract token standard that we definitely need emphasis is ERC 721. We also have speaker yesterday from Pragma, Deirdre from Dapper Labs who is also the author of this token standard.
00:08:08.186 - 00:08:33.150, Speaker A: So it was created in 2018 and this is actually making like the name just makes it sound it's the non fungible token. So you guys all know about NFTs. So those tokens are one of a kind and holding its own special of attributes that is different from any other NFTs.
00:08:33.150 - 00:08:54.018, Speaker A: So for example, like Azuki, they have attributes like background, clothing, eyes, hair, mouth tight, et cetera, which is different from any other ones. And I hope you guys all go to Pragma yesterday because it was so cool. And also you can get a CryptoKitty.
00:08:54.018 - 00:09:32.370, Speaker A: So one of the case study of ERC 721 is definitely CryptoKitties. I won't dive into too much details but if you want to check that out, this is super important. And with ERC 721 the limitations is that it do not really offer quantitative features so there's less computability liquidity and manageability with ERC 721 token and also it's not really good application for financial instruments, so like bonds, insurance policies or vesting plans.
00:09:32.370 - 00:09:59.142, Speaker A: An analogy that I like to use. So if you guys have watched the anime Yu GI oh, so it's a last century anime and also like card game. So if I want to share a Yu GI oh card with my sister so I cannot really tear it into half and maybe send her a half of that without losing its own asset.
00:09:59.142 - 00:10:37.222, Speaker A: So with ERC 721 it's not really enabling people to maybe divide those NFTs and send it. And yeah, especially with financial instruments like bonds, like invest, like insurance policies where we need to divide it. Like ERC 721 is definitely not the case and I want to give credit to ERC 651-6551 and also maybe seven, seven, seven and all other token standards because we have a limited time today.
00:10:37.222 - 00:11:06.030, Speaker A: So I won't dive into too details but you can definitely find those authors outside and also in other panels to talk about details about those token standards. But for today, like we're going to mention ERC 1155 and ERC 3525 which is in the system, it tries to improve ERC 20 and ERC 721. So ERC 1155 is also a very foundational one.
00:11:06.030 - 00:11:26.194, Speaker A: It's called multitoken standard. So imagine it's actually created by mid journey, a vending machine where we can get all kinds of food. So if I want to get a soda and also maybe a candy bar, all I need to do is press the soda number and press my credit card and soda drops.
00:11:26.194 - 00:11:45.454, Speaker A: If I want to get the candy bar, candy bar number, credit card and it drops. But if I imagine this vending machine as ethereum blockchain, then whenever I press the credit card I need to pay the gas fee. It's not very time efficient or maybe like money efficient at the same time.
00:11:45.454 - 00:12:25.420, Speaker A: But with ERC 1155, it's actually solving this problem because it's combining maybe the soda and also the candy bar in one slot together or maybe like some digital collectibles in one slot also. So I only need to press the credit card for once and then everything drops and we need to give credit to Enj, which is the author of this token standard. So it's a blockchain gaming company and also they use ERC 1155 for their gaming token avatar, in game, Asset and Land.
00:12:25.420 - 00:12:48.958, Speaker A: And as we mentioned, every token standard have its advantages and also disadvantages. This is also like one thing I want you guys all take from today's panel. So the limitations with ERC 1155, although it's a breakthrough and also I think it's underrated, it's very intricate.
00:12:48.958 - 00:13:03.186, Speaker A: And also we find each token has its own set of rules. So we want to combine them together. For example, like the analogy that I use if I want to make soda and candy bar into one slot, like soda is soda, candy bar is cannibar.
00:13:03.186 - 00:13:23.454, Speaker A: Like why we should combine them together, there might be some inconsistency like happening within that slide. So adding on to just one more sentence about that. So I think for 1155, maybe there are some real life applications as well.
00:13:23.454 - 00:13:53.560, Speaker A: So, for example, like real asset management, supply chain management and so other than maybe like in crypto industry, we can definitely use this token standard in other areas as well. So ERC 3525 is also adding another layer on top of everything else. So it was introduced by the Soft Protocol team and also it was created late 2020, so not very far away.
00:13:53.560 - 00:14:08.700, Speaker A: So it's called semifundable token. Let's imagine something right now together. So if I have a water bottle, I'm sorry, I did not really bring my water bottle today, but let's imagine it sitting here.
00:14:08.700 - 00:14:46.050, Speaker A: So it's a container holding a unique item, it's indivisible most times and also it has to be used as a whole. But with ERC 3525, just like this picture of a container having lots of bottles inside, I can pour it into smaller bottles and maybe distribute with anyone in the classroom in this panel together. So it's devisable and combinable and also it's a universal digital container and also it's visualizable smart contract.
00:14:46.050 - 00:15:12.640, Speaker A: So like this picture over here, if Alice want to send Bob an NFT of $50, then Bob is getting like $250 NFT. But with semifungible token, which is ERC 3525, he can combine the $250 together and form a $100 NFT. So fractional come true.
00:15:12.640 - 00:15:47.930, Speaker A: Another example that I want to give you guys is for example, I am a digital artist who is making a masterpiece. For example, this masterpiece, Mona Lisa over here, if I want to sell it right now, probably I'm going to deploy a ERC 721 token and sell it as an NFT. But with the help of ERC 3525, I can fractionalize that maybe into different fractions and distribute or sell it to everyone in this panel room today.
00:15:47.930 - 00:16:17.590, Speaker A: And each of you guys will get a little piece of that artwork. So if the market goes up, maybe, hopefully maybe later this year, and you guys can divide it up into even smaller pieces and get profit, maybe just selling that out. And if you guys want to form that masterpiece together maybe in the future to display in the library, in the museum, then you guys can come together and combine that.
00:16:17.590 - 00:16:34.554, Speaker A: So it's combinable and dividable at the same time. And think about this aquarium. So it's a transparent aquarium so that we can see like how many fishes are inside, how many corals, how many things are inside.
00:16:34.554 - 00:17:07.538, Speaker A: So it's a visualizable smart contract. So you can sneak peek and assess the quality of everything within that smart contract. So with Salt Protocol, they have digital vouchers that you can see all your financial investment and everything with that Voucher, with that NFT, so that you can as an investor, you can make informed financial decisions, you can mitigate your risks and also promote transparency.
00:17:07.538 - 00:17:32.890, Speaker A: So let's think back to the financial crisis of 2008. So with that transparency, maybe like we can mitigate the damage of that financial crisis with maybe the help of ERC 3525 or maybe other token standards. And also it can help to do maybe dynamic NFTs, where dynamic semifungible tokens.
00:17:32.890 - 00:17:55.614, Speaker A: This is a picture of using chainlink to collect some off chain data within the Oracles. But with the ERC Three Two five, you can easily upgrade, evolve or debt or improve your NFT, your Sft with the help of other information. This is a very clear picture.
00:17:55.614 - 00:18:35.746, Speaker A: And I found ERC 3525 and also like ERC 1155, like in the middle of the spectrum where ERC 20 is computable but not really self descriptive. ERC 721, on the other hand, is self descriptive but not really computable, but maybe like 3525-1155, they are having both of the asset and some data structures, finally some tag information. So ERC 20 is having the value, ERC 721 is having the token ID or we call ID.
00:18:35.746 - 00:19:01.994, Speaker A: ERC 1155 is ID value metadata underneath. And 3525 is also adding a slot where you can maybe add different slot into that token and ID. And one five five also has batch transfer and 3525 has transfer to token, which is also illustrated here.
00:19:01.994 - 00:19:25.022, Speaker A: You can see that ID to ID token to token transfer, but there are some limitations. Although it's a very functional token standard, 3525, but it's very complex. So there might be some higher potential for Glitches or security vulnerability.
00:19:25.022 - 00:19:59.858, Speaker A: So as coders, you guys need to be very careful when you're coding that. And also for users, although I mentioned how beneficial that fractionalized NFT can benefit all the other people but it's hard to use, right? Like for NFTs, I can just transfer to you guys but with fractionalized NFTs we need more educational information on how to manage the shared portion of those NFTs. But one example that I want to give you guys is X winner.
00:19:59.858 - 00:20:39.910, Speaker A: So it's a gaming platform and it's true free to play mini or casual game with onchain asset that is using ERC 3525. So with the help of ERC 3525, maybe in gaming we can see dividable in game assets like tickets, like player characters, skins, weapons, power ups, et cetera. And also with fractional HEZ NFT, I'm so sorry Bori Khan we can have more liquidity in the market so that you do not really need to sell a whole NFT.
00:20:39.910 - 00:21:01.550, Speaker A: You can just fractionalize that and maybe sell a portion of your NFT which has maybe less money invested in that portion. And we can also imagine some new gameplay mechanism for guilds. So right now the guild for GameFly is shrinking if you guys are familiar.
00:21:01.550 - 00:21:22.498, Speaker A: So we can combine fractions for a ball stage. Just imagine like all of us in this panel room has a portion of a sword and we can combine together maybe to tackle a ball stage together instead of maybe just trying to play your own GameFi. I do think like socialization is very important for gaming.
00:21:22.498 - 00:21:45.358, Speaker A: So right now with gameFire, this is something that we definitely want to tackle and the second one is variety for game can be united. So you guys know, like variety is definitely the spice for our life especially with gaming. If I play a game for maybe 24 hours, I will get tired, I just want to play something else.
00:21:45.358 - 00:22:17.030, Speaker A: So we want to have a variety with ERC 3525 we can have different slots for different types of game, different gaming genres. So for example, we have maybe puzzle game, we have casual game for slot one and slot two and there's some games underneath. So for example like 2048, we have Sudoku, we have chess under the puzzle game and we have smart contract attached, pools attached and algorithm attached.
00:22:17.030 - 00:22:44.420, Speaker A: So there are some demos Sudoku and Pacman and I don't know, I am a heavy gamer and I do believe in the future of GameFi. So like with this concept we are building Ads Winner and we want to restore the trust and confidence in GameFi. And right now I have been questioned a lot, like whether GameFly is still a thing.
00:22:44.420 - 00:23:11.590, Speaker A: GameFi is not only a thing, it's the future. And all the companies, all the big companies in Web two are investing thousands, millions of dollars into maybe developing their marketplace and also developing GameFi. And with the help of ERC 3525, the token standard, we can reward those time invested in those gaming.
00:23:11.590 - 00:23:44.622, Speaker A: So a minute of enjoyment of time that you put in that game is a minute invested so that we can have a united leaderboard for all the game. Instead of, like, maybe having one game with their own system algorithm, we can have a united board for all the things. And therefore, we are here to restore faith, to reignite passion, and to reassure the world that GameFi is not only alive, but thriving with potential.
00:23:44.622 - 00:24:09.638, Speaker A: And also, I want to encourage you all to think about something. So, as we mentioned, there are all kinds of token standard in the market right now. You can check the board for all of them, but for builders out there, since ERC is definitely your weapon, you need to think about its function, whether it's definitely something you need or not.
00:24:09.638 - 00:24:16.060, Speaker A: Go check them out and to see if they're sharp enough for your use. Case, thank you so much.
