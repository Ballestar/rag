00:00:07.370 - 00:00:19.514, Speaker A: Alright, so I'm Harsh, founder and project lead of Push Protocol. What does push protocol do? That's what we are going to find out in this workshop. And then we are going to dive right into coding.
00:00:19.514 - 00:00:49.130, Speaker A: So let's get started. So what is push protocol? Well, first protocol is your decentralized communication middleware using which any smart contract, any protocol, any DAP, any back end can send notifications, gaslessly and that are directly tied to a Wallet address. Why so? Because when you are interacting or when Web Three user is interacting with the protocol, they are interacting with a Web Three Wallet address.
00:00:49.130 - 00:01:05.262, Speaker A: And therefore notifications or messaging directly to Wallet address makes so much sense than any other sort of alerts. And that's what Push did. We started notification for Web Three back in 2020 from ETH Global.
00:01:05.262 - 00:01:24.770, Speaker A: So we are ETH Global alumni. Hackers. All right, so just to elaborate a little bit more, why so Dows? They are not able to talk whenever governance proposal happens, whenever anything happens around voting, there's no way that you can notify those voters or wallet addresses.
00:01:24.770 - 00:01:44.618, Speaker A: And that's where Push helps DeFi loan, liquidates farming epochs. All of these things can be eliminated if you are using Push notification to Wallet addresses. And it gets interesting, like if you are even building a L Two to L One bridge, if you are even targeting NFDS, anything and everything that we do happens from notification.
00:01:44.618 - 00:01:56.718, Speaker A: And that's what we want you to use in Web Three as well. Yeah, I already spoke about the solution, but a little bit about it. The solution is Blockchain agnostic platform agnostic.
00:01:56.718 - 00:02:14.562, Speaker A: It's open yet secure. And it works with DApps, it works with Backend, it works with Smart Contract, whatever you are using. All right? Right after that we realize that once you do notifications, you have something that we use on daily basis, which is WhatsApp? And telegram.
00:02:14.562 - 00:02:28.074, Speaker A: Right? And that is messaging. So, notification usually happens from a protocol to user perspective or a one way communication. And messaging is what drives the social nature of our everyday life.
00:02:28.074 - 00:02:38.398, Speaker A: So think about it. When we are talking on WhatsApp we are talking by a messaging and we are utilizing notification for the engagement. And that is the idea of Push chat as well.
00:02:38.398 - 00:02:53.822, Speaker A: You can basically use Pushchat to create support chats. You can even token gate and create a very unique Web Three native Dow chat, or you can use it in your Web Three social. And of course Push chat is available right now to build or chat.
00:02:53.822 - 00:03:16.694, Speaker A: The SDKs are out. And as I said, the group chat enables public or private token gating, transaction gating and so much more. So yeah, just by using these two tools, we actually are proud to say that we transformed or terraformed the Web Three communication era we have from 2020 E Global to now, we have sent over 45 million notifications.
00:03:16.694 - 00:03:37.010, Speaker A: We have over 95,000 subscribers and over 650 plus integration, some of which are on your screen. We power notifications and messaging for a lot of partners. Uniswap or socially gitcoin, polygon are some of our favorites.
00:03:37.010 - 00:04:00.540, Speaker A: All right, so what's next? Before we dive into the workshop, what we have made a culture is to announce products around the global, because we started from Eat Global, right? So we launched push notifications at the Global 2020. We launched push notifications or push chat at eat. Bogota 2022.
00:04:00.540 - 00:04:47.254, Speaker A: Next came Push Video, which is Legoface, same level video that we launched at Tokyo 2023. And we have a very special video which we are sharing with all of you guys about what's coming next. Awesome.
00:04:47.254 - 00:04:58.954, Speaker A: So, yeah, we are launching push pieces right from ETH Global. Paris 2023. What is push pieces? Well, it's just like Twitter spaces, but for Web three.
00:04:58.954 - 00:05:20.340, Speaker A: Peer to peer supports any identity, including Wallets, including polygon, crypto profile, any NFT profile even. And it can be access controlled, which means that these spaces can be token gated and Ft gated, even when someone is listening or someone is talking. So very, very cool things that you can do with this.
00:05:20.340 - 00:05:40.280, Speaker A: And, yeah, just to announce our messaging and Twitter space launch partners, they are revised Socially Xenon, Lynch Lens Play. These are playing around Web Three socials, and we would love you guys to check them out. All right, time for the demo.
00:05:40.280 - 00:06:01.150, Speaker A: The demo video is not accessible, but that's cool. Thankfully, I basically did a rework on my technical talk, so we can get started directly from the workshop. All right, how to do notifications, right? And before that, I'll just put this slide out.
00:06:01.150 - 00:06:12.082, Speaker A: So there's a live workshop and live discord link in case you guys want to join that. I will show it out to you guys again. So you don't have to really scan it right now.
00:06:12.082 - 00:06:28.802, Speaker A: But yeah, to get started, let's talk about notification first. So, notification sending notifications is extremely easy. All you have to do first is you have to activate your protocol on our protocol, and the best way to do it is from the DAP.
00:06:28.802 - 00:06:40.742, Speaker A: When you do that, we call you as a channel. And I'll come to why channels are important. But as you see, when I go to staging push and I'm signed in with a Wallet address, I see all these channels.
00:06:40.742 - 00:06:58.730, Speaker A: And channels are important because we don't want user to be spammed, right? We want users to be opted in to notifications, just like how Web Two does it. So over here, when I go to channels, I can see all the channels. Let's say I want to opt into Ryan's channel.
00:06:58.730 - 00:07:06.162, Speaker A: It's looking interesting, so I just click on opt in. This is, again, a protocol level event. I'm just gaslessly signing everything.
00:07:06.162 - 00:07:16.840, Speaker A: You don't even have to come to the tab to do it. You can do it from your front end as well. But yeah, once I'm opted in, I'm all ready to receive notification from Ryan's channel.
00:07:16.840 - 00:07:39.998, Speaker A: When you have to send notification, you have to create a channel. I've already created one, but if you go over here, you'll see create a channel instead of the channel name and you can just walk down the steps to create the channel. It's very easy, just five steps, making sure that you own the Protocol Wallet address.
00:07:39.998 - 00:07:54.526, Speaker A: That's all what Push wants to know. Okay, once you have the channel, you can send notification from anywhere. Over here we are going to send it out from the DAP itself first and then we are going to go deeper and deeper.
00:07:54.718 - 00:07:58.100, Speaker B: So let's do he.
00:08:01.130 - 00:08:21.062, Speaker A: Hackers and notification doesn't have to be just text, you can do so much more with it. You can basically also attach a YouTube link or a Mets link or encrypted transaction, whatever you want to do. So over here I want to attach.
00:08:21.126 - 00:08:31.886, Speaker B: A cat meme because cats so perfect. So I'm just going to paste this.
00:08:32.068 - 00:08:43.058, Speaker A: As a media URL, it will show me the preview. I'm selecting broadcast. Broadcast means that I'm going to send this notification to all the users who opted into my channel.
00:08:43.058 - 00:09:08.986, Speaker A: But there's targeted which is directly to a single wallet address and there's subset as well, which is I'm going to send a notification to a part of the Wallet addresses that have subscribed. But yeah, let's do Broadcast hit send notification, just sign it gaslessly and you have the notification delivered as well because I have opted into my own channel. So you can see it over here.
00:09:08.986 - 00:09:34.670, Speaker A: But not only that, you can see notifications everywhere where they are integrated so you can see notifications on the extension. And very excited to announce that you will be seeing these notifications and chat on unstoppable domain website and mobile app as well. We recently announced enabling messaging and notification for 4 million of their wallet addresses.
00:09:34.670 - 00:09:51.662, Speaker A: So it's totally interoperable, it's totally web three. So yeah, just try it out. So yeah, coming back, this is one way to send notification, but this is basically a manual way how to do it via programmatically.
00:09:51.662 - 00:10:34.920, Speaker A: So the first thing you need to do or your best bet is going to Docs Push. And once you are there, you can go to Developer Docs and you have everything over here on how to get started with the channel push notification web three and you can even see how to send notification from so many other things, like from a smart contract, from push SDK, from push DAP, even using Showrunners, which is basically a scaffold framework. That we have to get you going in an instant and using subgraph as well, because subgraph and graph and push the V work together.
00:10:34.920 - 00:10:57.950, Speaker A: So let's see how to send notification from Push SDK. So I've prepared some of the things, but one thing like only couple of things you have to keep in mind. First you need to make sure that you're going to our GitHub and you're cloning push SDK.
00:10:57.950 - 00:11:05.578, Speaker A: Push SDK has all the examples about everything. So it really, really helps to clone it out. That's what I've done.
00:11:05.578 - 00:11:36.540, Speaker A: And the other thing I've done is I've just created a boilerplate NPM repo just in advance to show you how we can do cool things with notifications and bitchat. All right, so over here I've just opened the push SDK. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to packages, I'm going to go to examples backend node, but they're examples of front end as well.
00:11:36.540 - 00:11:52.800, Speaker A: And I am going to try getting notifications. And over here I have the example of all the things that the notification can enable and how to use them.
00:11:54.530 - 00:12:08.610, Speaker B: This crawl is not working. Hold on, let me just restart Vs code. All right.
00:12:08.610 - 00:12:15.330, Speaker B: Okay, as I said, notification index and.
00:12:19.160 - 00:12:31.896, Speaker A: Cool. So we can see all the ways by which we can send notifications, get channel, get subscription, opt in, opt out. All of these things are here.
00:12:31.896 - 00:12:50.744, Speaker A: But for this example, let's try to first get my notifications internally. The function has been named as Get feeds, but all I have to do.
00:12:50.882 - 00:12:54.416, Speaker B: Is I'll just copy this function out.
00:12:54.518 - 00:13:11.620, Speaker A: And this is a boilerplate I have created. So I've just imported the APIs of push protocol. Imported ethers have a channel private key, which I've already doxed and using, which I'm creating a sign up.
00:13:11.620 - 00:13:42.816, Speaker A: So over here, what I want to do is I want to retrieve all the notifications that have been sent to the channel address. We use something called a Keep ten format because push is web three Agnostic, which means that it can deliver notification not only to ethereum but to finance, to solana, whatever. And that's why keep ten, because keeped in defines exact blockchain address, not exact ethereum address.
00:13:42.816 - 00:13:52.290, Speaker A: So EIP one five, five is EVM, five is Glorally, and then you have the address and that's about it.
00:13:52.820 - 00:13:55.030, Speaker B: This is just one line of code.
00:13:55.880 - 00:13:58.740, Speaker A: And once I do, I unstart.
00:14:01.400 - 00:14:02.390, Speaker B: Over here.
00:14:05.780 - 00:14:21.670, Speaker A: Yeah, I can see all the notifications that have been sent. So that's retrieving notifications. Let's look at one more example from notification site, which is sending notifications out.
00:14:22.120 - 00:14:27.610, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think my Vs code is.
00:14:30.220 - 00:14:35.676, Speaker A: A little buggy, but yeah, what.
00:14:35.698 - 00:14:44.750, Speaker B: Do we want to do? We want to send a direct payload to a single recipient. So let's see that.
00:14:45.220 - 00:14:48.400, Speaker A: So, yeah, again, extremely easy to do.
00:14:48.470 - 00:14:51.264, Speaker B: There's one line of code, a couple.
00:14:51.302 - 00:14:53.536, Speaker A: Of lines of code, just because we.
00:14:53.558 - 00:14:55.410, Speaker B: Want to do console log as well.
00:14:56.020 - 00:15:04.672, Speaker A: Cool. So I am using the Push API to send notifications. Who's the signer? My channel is the signer.
00:15:04.672 - 00:15:30.316, Speaker A: If we want, we can also have delegate signers, which basically means if we go back to our channel, not only we can send notification from our channel wallet, we can add delegates as well. And that delegates can be different wallet and that can send notification on behalf of our channel. Just in case you are using back end and you don't want the private key to be in the back end as well.
00:15:30.316 - 00:15:40.576, Speaker A: You can use this to add an additional form of security layer. But for now, we have already talked my private key. So signer will be the signer channel.
00:15:40.576 - 00:15:52.070, Speaker A: Type three is targeted. Notification. Again, if you go to documentation, you will see all the notification standards and how to use them.
00:15:52.070 - 00:16:07.864, Speaker A: So over here you can see notification standards advanced and basic. They will tell you what are the types and how to use it. You can even actually go ahead and define your content to have bold italics or whatever.
00:16:07.864 - 00:16:19.500, Speaker A: But yeah, check that out coming back. Type three is targeted. We want to send a direct payload to the notification wallet.
00:16:19.500 - 00:16:36.944, Speaker A: Push basically supports any storage protocol. And that basically means that you can send notification from smart contract, from IPFS, from a direct payload or anything else. That basically is what identity type is.
00:16:36.944 - 00:16:46.710, Speaker A: Because we are sending it not from a smart contract but directly as a JSON. We basically say that then we have notification title and body.
00:16:47.160 - 00:16:57.640, Speaker B: We will say global cats and hackers.
00:16:58.380 - 00:17:15.756, Speaker A: Notification title and body and payload, title and body. They can be different, but in most of the time, people usually choose to have the same thing. So notification is something that you see on screen and the payload is something that you see when you go inside.
00:17:15.756 - 00:17:38.390, Speaker A: Any app that is supporting Push, sometimes it's different because it can be a video call, right? So notification will be someone is calling you, but when you go inside, that might be the face of the person or the real life feed. So that's why recipient, I want to send this to the recipient, which is my channel address only.
00:17:39.400 - 00:17:46.120, Speaker B: So I'll just do you know what, let me have the recipient.
00:17:46.620 - 00:18:00.104, Speaker A: Yeah, so recipient in this case because I'm just sending notification to me, that's why it's the signer channel address. But it can be any address and environment should be staging.
00:18:00.152 - 00:18:19.876, Speaker B: So I'll just do this and that is it. If I run and give it a few seconds, silent is something that I haven't defined. So I'll just take this out, run it again and yeah, if I go.
00:18:19.898 - 00:18:44.188, Speaker A: To the DAP, it's already here. So that's how easy it is to send any sort of notification from any platform, any protocol, any smart contract. Now let's talk about chat, which is also very interesting because you can do support chats, you can even do AI chat, something that we have done and you can do so much more.
00:18:44.188 - 00:19:09.780, Speaker A: So for chats, I mean, I'm just going to chat over here and I'm going to chat with another person over here. Chats are again user and spam controlled or has anti spam mechanism, which means that when you send a chat to someone the first time they have to accept the chat request. Only then the notification are enabled and only then they can see it in the chats.
00:19:09.780 - 00:19:25.000, Speaker A: But yeah, you have the request app that basically acts like an anti spam mechanism. Same for notifications. Like if I send a notification to a wallet address that has not opted in it lands on the inbox.
00:19:25.580 - 00:19:43.230, Speaker B: But yeah, over here, let me find this guy. I mean I can find this guy which is seven nine two. So yeah, take my click.
00:19:43.230 - 00:19:50.300, Speaker B: Yeah cool.
00:19:50.450 - 00:20:05.040, Speaker A: So sending chat again, very easy to do. I am going to go back to Vs code example. I'm going to go to chat and we have chat which is wallet to wallet chat.
00:20:05.040 - 00:20:20.312, Speaker A: We also have NFT chat which means that you can have your NFTs defined as a chat. So your board ape can also talk to one another if you want to. The only exception is that the NFT chat has a different standard.
00:20:20.312 - 00:20:29.756, Speaker A: So instead of using EIP one five five you basically have the NFT address standard. Again it's mentioned in the dogs. So no worries around it.
00:20:29.756 - 00:20:37.944, Speaker A: Over here we are just going to go with a normal wallet to wallet chat. So I want to do a send chat example.
00:20:38.082 - 00:20:50.930, Speaker B: So I'm just going to copy this example out and I'm going to explain it to you guys while we work this out together. So yeah, thanks.
00:20:51.860 - 00:21:08.010, Speaker A: Paste it out. So first thing charts are very encrypted, charts are extremely encrypted. So the first thing that we need to do is we need to make sure that we are first getting the encrypted chat address.
00:21:08.010 - 00:21:39.756, Speaker A: Then we are doing a staging env file. Then once we have that encrypted chat PGP key which is what WhatsApp also uses that encrypted chat PGP key we put together a decrypted helper function and we pass that encrypted private key along with the address of the signer to decrypt it out. Once we have decrypted the PGP key we can send chats as a normal user.
00:21:39.756 - 00:21:50.212, Speaker A: That's how we achieve end to end encryption. So that's why you have double way encryption and decryption. So yeah, once you have that all you have to do is again send your sign up.
00:21:50.212 - 00:22:06.300, Speaker A: Signer is the signer channel. In this example we also basically did a signer second account which is a random account that we have. But what we can do is instead.
00:22:06.370 - 00:22:22.476, Speaker B: Of random account, let me just do a copy on this account. So receiver address is going to be EIP one five five and the receiver.
00:22:22.508 - 00:22:40.470, Speaker A: Wallet address notifications has like the chain ID. But chat doesn't have the chain ID, just the blockchain which can be like chat because it's like EVM compatible. Right? So it's EIP one five five which means all em EVM and then the chat address.
00:22:40.470 - 00:22:42.816, Speaker A: And over here we are just going.
00:22:42.858 - 00:22:57.868, Speaker B: To do staging and hopefully console log response. If everything looks good this should work. Cool.
00:22:58.034 - 00:22:59.468, Speaker A: So this is done.
00:22:59.634 - 00:23:05.164, Speaker B: And if I go to chats yeah.
00:23:05.282 - 00:23:14.976, Speaker A: I can see a chat delivered right now. So yeah, it's that easy to do. Just go to the backend node and you can figure everything out.
00:23:14.976 - 00:24:00.908, Speaker A: We also have something called NX Control which is a UI plugin which if you install and then you generate a front end interface or you serve a front end interface, it works pretty well. I think we are running out of time so I will not be able to explain that to you right now but happy to do it on our boot again. The best way is go to Docs Push and lastly, if you go to NPM you have all the examples of everything that you need to do and how to do it right along with the patterns and the expected response.
00:24:00.908 - 00:24:17.328, Speaker A: We also have cheat sheets which the girl in pink is basically having. So yeah, just have that. And our discord is 24 x seven, so is our booth.
00:24:17.328 - 00:24:32.152, Speaker A: So just scan the link and ask your technical question either on discord or come to us and talk to us directly. The live workshop link basically takes you through all the examples that we have in the SDK. Thank you so much.
00:24:32.152 - 00:25:07.938, Speaker A: If you have any questions yeah, got it. So of course those notifications are visible, it can be visible on your DAP as well. So there is a front end SDK functionality in which you can have those notification integrated on your DAP front end and because of that you can show it over there or you can have your Dwap also have a pop up notification which you can achieve by delivery notes.
00:25:07.938 - 00:25:26.980, Speaker A: But yeah, because it's interoperable all the DApps that support Push as well as, as he said, unstoppable DAP and Unstoppable wallet also supports push, right? So as long as the user is there, your notification will be there and that's why we recommend that you add it to your DAP as well.
00:25:30.150 - 00:25:41.830, Speaker C: Hi, I want to ask you something about this Push notification for broadcast. So as I see in the demo, everyone can send a notification. So is there any whitelist option because it can be used as a malicious notification.
00:25:43.450 - 00:26:01.114, Speaker A: Got it. So not everybody can send a notification. Like that's why you have your channel and only your channel can send a notification to all the users or a channel or a delegated person that you have delegated can send a notification on your behalf.
00:26:01.114 - 00:26:25.140, Speaker A: So we are working like we are powering notification for Uniswap and Safe and so many more companies using this logic and because of that it's only Uniswap wallet that can send notification to you. No one can spoof it. We also have like a blue verified tick mark which basically allows user to know that this is coming from a ledger channel and not a spoof channel.
00:26:25.990 - 00:26:26.706, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:26:26.808 - 00:26:37.080, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks everyone. Thanks for coming and happy hacking stop.
