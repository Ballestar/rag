00:00:00.330 - 00:00:18.160, Speaker A: I 8735-4321 more happy now. Here we go now. Here we go now.
00:00:18.160 - 00:00:25.910, Speaker A: Here we go now. Hacker. Tony.
00:00:25.910 - 00:00:37.686, Speaker A: My favorite part is the energy. Everyone is so happy and excited to be here and is so supportive and helpful. So if you get stuck on anything, there's always someone who's really willing to help you.
00:00:37.686 - 00:00:47.818, Speaker A: And I just love that energy. It's unmatched Colombia. I love how it's always focused on building.
00:00:47.818 - 00:00:58.590, Speaker A: I think that's probably the main thing is something that East Global has done a great job at is making it so that hackers can work on whatever they want to work on and just have fun coding.
00:01:00.690 - 00:01:08.190, Speaker B: Mentor you and those sorts of things. And before you know it, you're going to have dozens of friends and you're going to leave here wanting to come back to the next ETH Global event.
00:01:08.260 - 00:01:14.998, Speaker A: I think it's important for a few reasons. It's important to me personally because I'm Colombian, I'm from Boata, I was born here. It's where all of my family is.
00:01:14.998 - 00:01:24.550, Speaker A: So it's kind of like the universe converging back onto one thing. For me, I think this is one of the first steps to closing that gap. It's the PUFA Bulos experience of De Mira.
00:01:29.550 - 00:01:40.842, Speaker C: Don't be afraid. There's tons of support, whether it's from your fellow hackers staff, mentors, materials online. I think everybody was a new hacker at one point.
00:01:40.896 - 00:01:44.282, Speaker A: This is not a competition. It's under martin. It's on a sprint.
00:01:44.282 - 00:01:49.166, Speaker A: We are here to have fun. We are here to learn. We are here to build cool stuff.
00:01:49.166 - 00:02:13.558, Speaker A: For as long as those things are happening, things are good and this is why we are here. Bob is bringing like 15 people to Bogota and it is the highlight of the year. East Global is an incredibly welcoming space for all kinds of skill sets and you should feel confident coming in with whatever your background is and just let people know what you're good at and find a team where your skill set is needed.
00:02:13.558 - 00:02:24.762, Speaker A: Come along, participate and have fun. It is a lot about enjoying yourself and doing things in a way that you are going to learn, but also not to burn out. Just get to know some new friends and keep going.
00:02:24.762 - 00:02:41.978, Speaker A: This hackathon was my favorite hackathon, yet I actually judged a lot of the hackathons. I love it when I'm in a new region and the hackers are teaching me something new through the hacks. It could be something political, it could be something economical, it could be something just really localized.
00:02:41.978 - 00:02:59.078, Speaker A: And that is really awesome as a judge to also learn something while I'm seeing what the hackers are building. This hackathon's projects were definitely very rigorous. We saw a lot of teams who had the ability to pivot and still deliver really awesome solutions from the NFT Space, DeFi and everything in between.
00:02:59.078 - 00:03:23.550, Speaker A: My favorite part of the East Global community is, of course, the people, but specifically the incredible diversity of perspectives and experiences that they all bring to the protocol. I think at least half of the projects we saw today, maybe the majority, are local to Latin America. Those are people I don't interact with on a day to day basis from home.
00:03:23.550 - 00:03:45.170, Speaker A: So seeing how people are using these tools in just totally creative, outside the box ways in different communities and adapting them to the needs of those communities is really exciting. Definitely about meeting new people, right? You can meet people from all kinds of backgrounds. These in person events is a lot more spontaneous.
00:03:45.170 - 00:04:02.180, Speaker A: Well, there's an amazing sense of teamwork and collaboration at East Global Hackathon. So I really would say lean in on the community, lean in on the hackers. The hackers, the staff and all the sponsors are really here to help you along your journey in building.
