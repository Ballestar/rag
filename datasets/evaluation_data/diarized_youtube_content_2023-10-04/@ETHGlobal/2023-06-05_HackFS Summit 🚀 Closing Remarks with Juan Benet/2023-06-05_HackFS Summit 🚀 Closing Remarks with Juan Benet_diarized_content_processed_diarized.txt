00:00:07.530 - 00:00:22.190, Speaker A: And before we wrap up, a little bit of an addendum to the schedule, but exciting nonetheless. So really excited to welcome Juan Benet to the stage. So Juan Benet is the founder of Protocol Labs, so we're really excited to have a surprise guest at the end of the summit.
00:00:22.190 - 00:00:28.200, Speaker A: Everything kind of lined up so that Juan could be here. So yeah, welcome to stage one and excited to have you here.
00:00:28.570 - 00:00:31.014, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going? Can you hear me?
00:00:31.212 - 00:00:32.600, Speaker A: Yeah, everything's great.
00:00:33.130 - 00:00:36.402, Speaker B: Awesome. Super excited to be here. I love hackfs.
00:00:36.402 - 00:01:22.058, Speaker B: We've been doing this for a few years now, and it's one of my favorite parts times of the year to be able to work with all of you and hang out and have fun talking about new ideas, new projects, cool things to build, things that might turn into products, things that might turn into really good open source projects, and so on. So I'm super stoked for hackaths starting, it's very near and dear to my heart and one of the cool things to see this year is so many teams and people from prior Hack FS are now participating again this year in some cases as sponsors, which is super cool to see. I was looking through the grid and saw three or four teams that started as Hack FS.
00:01:22.058 - 00:01:43.900, Speaker B: Teams like where you are right now turn into projects and then companies and now have good products that tons of people are using and now are coming back to pay it forward and work with you and build more cool things. So it's really awesome to see just that entire cycle rebuilding. So it's awesome to be here.
00:01:44.350 - 00:01:53.502, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah, maybe. I know you also have a last minute slide as well so feel free to if you want to share your screen now, it'll show up in the back end and I'll promote it when you're ready.
00:01:53.502 - 00:02:12.600, Speaker A: But if you go back to the start of your founder's journey and starting your first project, envision yourself back in the shoes of the people who are building for the next three weeks. You have three weeks to learn, you have three weeks to build, you have all these resources, teams, projects, interesting things ahead of you.
00:02:12.970 - 00:02:41.834, Speaker B: Where would you start? Yeah, it's a great question. I kind of also got my start through Hackathons initially and it's one of the things that I found super fun to do and I learned a ton from so I built a lot of things early on that ended up turning into really useful projects through hackathons. And where I would sort of start is you kind of want to find something at the intersection of a few parts.
00:02:41.834 - 00:03:05.142, Speaker B: One is something that you're really interested in, like follow your curiosity, follow what you like, follow things that you kind of want to explore. The second is to find something that's going to definitely challenge you and push you to learn new ideas, new technologies, new experiment. It's going to push you out of your comfort zone so that you can kind of use this as a great learning experience.
00:03:05.142 - 00:03:15.946, Speaker B: It's one of the best things you can have through hackathons. Use it as a great learning experience. But you also don't want to pick something that's maybe too far away from what you know already.
00:03:15.946 - 00:03:32.462, Speaker B: So kind of pick the challenge set carefully where if you go too far away then it might just be super difficult. Now you're excited to do that, go for it. You may want to calibrate what you do based on how easy or hard you're finding it to be.
00:03:32.462 - 00:03:53.880, Speaker B: You want it to be kind of challenging and you want it to be motivating and exciting and new and different but you don't want it to be so hard that it's hard to make progress. Then I would kind of explore a lot of ideas initially. There's a bunch of lists that we've generated over the years with lots of ideas, many of which some people have tried building, but certainly tons of open space.
00:03:53.880 - 00:04:07.594, Speaker B: You would go to the brainstorming session and think about a lot of things. I mean, just kind of figure out what you find yourself drawn to that you think would be really cool. The cool and attractiveness factor for you matters a lot.
00:04:07.594 - 00:04:45.480, Speaker B: Because one of the things about building projects and products is that if you're really excited about building the thing and you really like it, then you're going to kind of find it much more rewarding to work on it and build with it and learn from it and so on. So it's this really great self fulfilling loop where if you are learning a ton and having fun with it and building something useful, that's a great intersection where that'll help you power through lots of challenges. As you're building a thing, right, you have to kind of have the vision of the full thing working and get really excited about that to kind of make it through the challenges of building a product.
00:04:45.480 - 00:05:06.830, Speaker B: So I would kind of start there. It's kind of like find that intersection between things that are going to push you to learn things that you're going to like and find a lot of ideas out there that you think are interesting. And maybe I would go to a lot of the workshops, even things that you maybe don't know that much about, just to kind of see what ideas pop up there.
00:05:06.830 - 00:05:13.946, Speaker B: Because you might find something super cool there. I'll give an example from one hackathon. A very long time ago I went to Hackathon.
00:05:13.946 - 00:05:52.220, Speaker B: It was like a week long hackathon that I sort of got together with a set of other people there that I met at that hackathon and we had the idea of like, hey, this is right around when iPhones were first coming out and becoming popular. We're like, hey, wouldn't it be great to have Pokemon but on a phone way before Pokemon Go? And we kind of made a monster capture initially in that week, and that ended up turning into our first startup. And we made a game called Giamon that came out of that idea, and we just kind of pursued what we thought was really cool and exciting, and that turned out to be a super exciting, fun project.
00:05:52.220 - 00:06:12.498, Speaker B: And that wouldn't have happened if we hadn't been brainstorming a bunch of ideas. And if we had sort of come in with, like, I'll only look at one set of things, then we would never had found that set of ideas. So just kind of explore a lot, use it as a learning point, use it as a vector to meet a lot of other people in the community.
00:06:12.498 - 00:06:40.682, Speaker B: That's one of the great things about these kinds of hackathons is they let you get to know a lot of other people in the community, get to build relationships, form teams. I was just thinking back that Ayushan Sushmit from Huddle met. I think they knew about each other before Hagafest but they really met and started getting to know each other and work together through hangifast and that really became the moment that that team formed and now built a really awesome product and company.
00:06:40.682 - 00:06:52.400, Speaker B: So these are great. Also be open to the ideas that your friends or the people that you're getting to know get really excited about and be willing to kind of go along and try something new.
00:06:53.330 - 00:07:13.462, Speaker A: Yeah I love that idea of picking something that's challenging, that is hard but at the cusp where you can make incremental progress and kind of keep feeling that motion moving and I think people will always be very surprised in how much work they can do. How many things they could do in 20 days is a long time. Awesome.
00:07:13.596 - 00:07:37.150, Speaker B: Yeah, the length of time here is really good because it gives you enough time to build a solid prototype or sometimes a full product. And so it's not so fast that you can't actually have the thing working, but it's also short enough that you can try something new. And if you ultimately choose to not pursue that, that's totally fine.
00:07:37.150 - 00:07:56.040, Speaker B: You just learn a ton through a few weeks of hacking on this particular project and you learn through it. So yeah, one big message is good luck and have fun. The have fun part is a huge component of hackathon so really let your curiosity and whatever you enjoy drive a lot of it.
00:07:56.810 - 00:08:01.398, Speaker A: Amazing. I don't know if you had any slides or any presentations, I would kind.
00:08:01.404 - 00:08:12.520, Speaker B: Of show the sponsors grid and highlight a bunch of them that got started through hackemist but maybe I'll show that later on.
00:08:13.130 - 00:08:22.474, Speaker A: What I can do is I can go to the page and I can just highlight them myself. So I'll do that and actually then everybody can see which ones are past hackfs teams, basically.
00:08:22.592 - 00:08:29.726, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that'd be cool. That'd be a really cool thing for to do in the future is kind of like little badge if your team started in school.
00:08:29.828 - 00:08:30.414, Speaker A: Oh, there you go.
00:08:30.452 - 00:08:31.040, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:08:31.810 - 00:08:43.362, Speaker A: Juan is another one of those people, like I mentioned Gabriel, where I talk to and I get immediately a bunch of really cool ideas that I immediately want to go implement. Awesome. Well, thank you for popping in.
00:08:43.362 - 00:08:49.170, Speaker A: I'll leave the last word if you have anything else to add, but it's been a pleasure. Always great to see you. And I love the beard.
00:08:49.170 - 00:08:49.958, Speaker A: I love it.
00:08:50.044 - 00:08:52.198, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, you inspired me.
00:08:52.364 - 00:08:56.006, Speaker A: Oh, thank you. There you go. Thank you.
00:08:56.006 - 00:08:56.358, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:08:56.444 - 00:08:57.238, Speaker B: Take care.
00:08:57.404 - 00:09:10.540, Speaker A: Happy hacking, everybody. Awesome. So just to wrap up the summit that's been the Hack FS summit, thank you so much to everybody for joining us today and for being a part of this awesome event.
00:09:10.540 - 00:09:25.930, Speaker A: Applications are actually still open, so if you have a friend that you think would be inspired by the conversations that we had today, send them an invite and get them hacking with you and building over the next couple of weeks. And, of course, like Juan said, good luck, have fun. Happy hacking.
00:09:25.930 - 00:09:42.614, Speaker A: This is what it's all about. It's about having fun, experimenting, building something new, playing around with new ideas, and all around this kind of amazing ecosystem that protocol apps has built, both in the technical side and on the sports side. So thank you all for being here and really excited to hack with you over the next few weeks.
00:09:42.614 - 00:09:44.370, Speaker A: See you soon. Bye.
