00:00:11.470 - 00:00:34.600, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. Good morning. Good evening. Afternoon. Hi there, how's it going? Going well. Can't wait to hack you.
00:00:34.600 - 00:00:45.058, Speaker A: Good. We'll just give it a minute or.
00:00:45.064 - 00:00:50.820, Speaker B: Two, let people join. Will this be your first global hackathon or?
00:00:55.650 - 00:01:00.720, Speaker A: For me it's the third or fourth. Okay.
00:01:01.810 - 00:01:04.800, Speaker C: First ever hackathon in my entire life.
00:01:05.510 - 00:01:06.306, Speaker B: Nice.
00:01:06.488 - 00:01:07.570, Speaker A: You excited?
00:01:08.630 - 00:01:13.220, Speaker C: Oh yeah. I don't know what's in front of me, but we'll see. Let's go.
00:01:19.830 - 00:01:20.194, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:20.232 - 00:01:24.360, Speaker B: Hopefully this helps ease any nerves you may have around it.
00:01:27.050 - 00:01:28.006, Speaker A: And yeah, of.
00:01:28.028 - 00:01:58.170, Speaker B: Course we're here to help if you need anything. From Switzerland, Spain. I personally am from Texas or based in Texas.
00:02:29.820 - 00:03:17.590, Speaker A: Let's give it another minute. Okay, we can go ahead and get started now.
00:03:17.740 - 00:04:06.530, Speaker B: So awesome. Welcome everybody to the beginner's workshop for SuperHack. SuperHack as you probably know, is starting this coming Friday. So we have a few events kind of lined up before the hacking officially begins, before the opening kickoff and ceremony starts this Friday. And yeah, we've kind of done a couple of these beginners workshops this year. So a little bit background. We received a lot of feedback requests for folks who are completely new to E Global events and to hackathons in general kind of trying to asking for guidance and tools, resources before the event actually begins just to make sure that they're as fully prepared as possible in order to participate in the hackathons.
00:04:06.530 - 00:04:19.542, Speaker B: Of course, Youth Global has been around for five years and so we have a lot of hackers that are veterans but almost every of our events and as we continue to grow and grow we obviously get a lot more new hackers.
00:04:19.606 - 00:04:22.026, Speaker A: So the idea is really just to.
00:04:22.048 - 00:04:48.658, Speaker B: Make sure that provide the comfort and guidance that if this is your first event, you're not meant to feel any pressure or anything. Whilst this is a hackathon, it's not really meant to be competitive. Your ultimate goal should be to really learn something to take away whether it's something that a partner or a mentor showed you within a particular tech stack or that you just kind of kept pushing yourself to learn and learn and.
00:04:48.664 - 00:04:51.598, Speaker A: Grow and fail and grow again, that's.
00:04:51.614 - 00:05:48.534, Speaker B: Kind of basically the outcome of our hackathon. So again, if this is your first one, please definitely do not feel any pressure whatsoever. If you see some names that go, wow, this person did this hackathon. I'm not trying to create that sort of environment here, but yes, as long as you're learning and you're growing and you're pushing outside of your comfort zones and your boundaries, then that's ultimately what we're trying to achieve here with our hackathons and our events. So yeah, I'm just going to go over a few things on the dashboard that some of you may or may not be familiar with yet, as well as kind of go through the discord a little bit and just kind of talk about stuff that's coming up as well. Some opportunities that I think you all might find interesting. And generally if people will ask questions throughout the workshop and that's totally fine as well.
00:05:48.534 - 00:06:28.578, Speaker B: So if you do have a question, feel free to sort of maybe interrupt me because I might not be able to see it if you type it in the chat. So don't be afraid to just kind of, hey, I've got a question real quick about something I just spoke about. And then there'll also be time at the end for Q A as well. So I don't expect this to go the full hour, but you never know, we might get to that point. So let's go ahead and get started. So this of course is the super hack dashboard. If you haven't been here already or if you're not familiar with it yet, definitely take the time between now and Friday to kind of acclimate yourself to it.
00:06:28.578 - 00:07:14.378, Speaker B: There's a lot of resources on the dashboard and so if you have particular questions, chances are it's going to be here. You just kind of have to find it and sift through it a bit. So if this is your first hackathon for the ETH Global, you're probably overwhelmed with all the material that's on here. But I guarantee you that everything that you could ever want is somewhere on our dashboard on this page. If this is your first hackathon and maybe you're kind of worried like, I don't have a team yet or I don't want to hack solo, what should I do? Do not fear. We do have a couple of team formation and brainstorming sessions this week. One is on Thursday and then the other is Friday.
00:07:14.378 - 00:07:44.362, Speaker B: So Thursday morning, Friday evening if you're in the States, depending on what time zone you're in. And then also if there's the Discord Find a Team channel as well. So I'll show you that in a little bit. But if you don't have a team yet, definitely don't be alarmed or worried. But one thing that some people don't necessarily know about, and this is something that we're working on, is on the dashboard. If you scroll down a bit, you have your team overview of your team. So this is the ETH Global team test dummy account.
00:07:44.362 - 00:08:31.446, Speaker B: If you click this, I agree to my discord username being shared with other hackers to contact me. For team formation, you'll basically become part of a directory. So if you click Find Team Members and then you'll see your information, your details, this is stuff which you filled out in your application. And then if you want to filter by particular DevTools programming languages, you'll begin to see hackers that have also provided this information. So this is sort of like a really neat way to see who else is maybe hackers that want to join a team or teams that are looking for more members. So if you haven't seen this yet, definitely take advantage of this. And of course, everybody's discord name is provided to, so it's easier to also reach out to folks as well.
00:08:31.446 - 00:08:33.590, Speaker B: But this is something that people haven't.
00:08:33.950 - 00:08:35.898, Speaker A: Sometimes don't really notice that it's there.
00:08:35.984 - 00:09:21.420, Speaker B: And so it's up to us to really kind of make sure that we do a good job, better job of promoting that information as well. But if you scroll all the way down, you can see there's 240 results, 240 hackers that have opted in for this in Discord. So I would say if you're unfamiliar or not still looking for people to join your team, or you want to join the team with somebody, please take advantage of the filters and then all the other hackers that have provided this information. As you may or may not know in the Discord, we have the Find a Team channel as well. So people have been posting on this channel to try and say, hey, I'm here, full stack engineer looking for this or that.
00:09:21.790 - 00:09:23.450, Speaker A: So this is another great way to.
00:09:23.520 - 00:09:37.294, Speaker B: Find team members as well. One thing with Discord, just make sure that if you're pinging somebody that the DMs aren't private, they're open, or that you accept friend requests. That's just kind of the one bad.
00:09:37.332 - 00:09:40.094, Speaker A: Thing that Discord has if you're trying.
00:09:40.132 - 00:10:00.866, Speaker B: To connect with people that you may or may not know already. So that's that if I go back to the dashboard, that's that and then the project. This is where right now you can.
00:10:00.888 - 00:10:04.820, Speaker A: Basically kind of start doing an outline for your project.
00:10:05.510 - 00:10:47.498, Speaker B: There's some items that you won't be able to obviously submit when it comes to the project. But if you click a few things, your name or the category or whatever emoji that breast represents your project, you click on Confirm, Create Project and then boom, you'll be able to see kind of what you're going to expect it to be to fill out. So you confirm that you read all the points and create event rules. Create Project. Okay, so obviously you can't submit a project yet, but there are some things that you can go in and start filling out. Like maybe the short description, if you have a description, what you want to do already. Of course, as you go further and further along this, you won't be able to fill out everything.
00:10:47.498 - 00:11:25.900, Speaker B: But if you kind of have an idea what you want to do already, definitely take advantage of this. Start submitting, start providing this kind of the admin stuff, administrative stuff early on. That way when it comes to crunch time towards Sunday, the middle of August, that you're not feeling that pressure and you are able to edit this. You can go back anytime and edit this before up until you submit your project. So if you were to create something now, and then two weeks from now I completely done something new or different, then you can go back and edit that. That is not a problem. Once you submit your project, that's when you won't be able to edit it, obviously.
00:11:25.900 - 00:12:13.510, Speaker B: But yeah, this is something that you can certainly kind of do right now. So we asked for the logos, cover images, screenshots of what you're doing, and then the demo video as well. The demo video, this is something that I would say definitely don't wait till last minute to create your demo video. The demo video is used for whenever they're doing the live judging and the asynchronous judging. So it's quite critical and quite important piece for an online event. For in real life events, it's a bit different, but there are certain guidelines stipulations around the demo videos as well. So just make sure that you read through the materials around this and I'll go over it a little bit in the Info center.
00:12:13.510 - 00:12:53.282, Speaker B: And you can also see past projects and what other teams have done as well. And then if you can go to the Showcase page, Ethglobal.com showcase, you can search for projects and select different events. So the most recent online event was Hack FS 2023. So you can go in here and check out other projects, what folks did for that event. Currently there isn't a good way to filter by like project winners or the E Global finalists. But if you scroll through and you can see some of them that have these partner icons next to them, that means that they were a partner prize winner.
00:12:53.282 - 00:13:30.622, Speaker B: So Mintlock was the push protocol. Best use of push SDK. But you can see here, like, this is their video. They have a few screenshots, logos and stuff. So all this stuff that you provide here, this is kind of where it ultimately will go into the Showcase page. And so this is something that obviously you can share with potential employers or anybody really, to show that this is what you worked on at an indie global hackathon at SuperHack. And then, yeah, the video here again, this is what you're creating, what you're making whenever you submit upload your video.
00:13:30.622 - 00:13:33.026, Speaker B: So definitely take the time to kind.
00:13:33.048 - 00:13:35.554, Speaker A: Of have a really good thought around.
00:13:35.592 - 00:14:27.860, Speaker B: How you want to present it and do it. But I highly recommend not waiting till last minute to create your video when it comes to submission, close to the submission deadline. So that's that if you found somebody, you want to invite somebody to your team, you can enter their name, email, click invite, they'll receive that acceptance. There is a maximum of five team members, but you can also hack solo. You don't have to have team members if you don't want to. Some people hack solo and that's fine, but you can't have more than five team members, and anybody that's on your team has to be a registered, confirmed hacker. So that means that they submitted a super hack application, they've been accepted, they've staked their five ETH and so they're confirmed, they're good to go.
00:14:27.860 - 00:14:32.834, Speaker B: You won't be able to invite team members that have not submitted application, done.
00:14:32.872 - 00:14:34.774, Speaker A: Anything like that at all.
00:14:34.972 - 00:15:03.646, Speaker B: So if there's somebody that you really want to hack with and they haven't applied yet, definitely tell them to submit an application. The application deadline is this evening at midnight Eastern time. So still have a good while to submit an application and be accepted. Sometimes we have a few people that don't necessarily do that, make sure that.
00:15:03.668 - 00:15:08.154, Speaker A: All the teams are there if I keep scrolling.
00:15:08.282 - 00:15:37.714, Speaker B: Mentors. So we've got a few tech mentors joining us. So these aren't people that are part of the partners, so they're not part of optimism or WorldCoin or Zora or anything. These are just folks who've done hackathons before with us who are just worked in the industry for several years and want to give back. So they are here to help you all. We currently have four. Right now we're trying to get a few more online events.
00:15:37.714 - 00:15:47.742, Speaker B: We don't necessarily receive that many just because it's an online event, it's drawn out over the course of a couple of weeks. But these mentors are here to help you answer any technical questions that you may have.
00:15:47.796 - 00:15:50.558, Speaker A: So you could find them in the.
00:15:50.564 - 00:16:14.200, Speaker B: Mentorship Help channel on Discord, which is right here. And if you want to reach out to them personally, individually, of course you have their Discord names and their Twitter handles as well and you'll see what time zones they're in too. So depending on if you're trying to get an answer for them right away, you might not get an answer right away, depending on where you're at and where they're at, if they're sleeping or not.
00:16:14.810 - 00:16:18.294, Speaker A: But yes, the mentors are here to.
00:16:18.332 - 00:17:40.574, Speaker B: Provide the technical guidance, help you get through your blockers for your projects or clarify any ideas or thoughts that you may have around your projects. But then also we have the mentors, but then we also have the partners and the partners have their own mentors, technical mentors associated with their projects as well. So if you go here my colleague Anna, she's already begun filling out prize information for the different partners and prize information links related to each of the different partners. But if you have a particular question around Hyperlane, then definitely send a message here in the Partner Hyperlane Channel or Partner World Coin. And then the Devrels or the Devs from these teams will answer your specific questions around their protocols. The mentors are there kind of like overall general guidance, but if you really want something, an answer specific to a particular question around a project, then definitely take advantage of the Discord partner channels as well. And if you're not getting a message, like I monitor these the channels, so if somebody has responded to you yet, then I will make sure that I follow up with the partners and the mentors say, hey, this hacker is asking for help and needs your guidance.
00:17:40.574 - 00:17:44.626, Speaker B: So I will make sure that somebody does answer your question as quickly as.
00:17:44.648 - 00:17:54.612, Speaker A: Possible and the schedule.
00:17:54.676 - 00:18:05.912, Speaker B: So right now of course we have the beginner's workshop we actually do have inside the Op stack workshop tomorrow by Kelvin from Optimism.
00:18:06.056 - 00:18:10.176, Speaker A: So definitely suggest that everybody you take.
00:18:10.198 - 00:18:59.150, Speaker B: A look at the events that are coming up here's the idea braids from routine formation session I mentioned on Thursday and then the other one Friday. Of course hacking begins Friday at 11:00 a.m. My time, which is noon so if you have a question about time zones it'll be automatically filtered for the schedule will be filtered for your time zone based on where you're at so if you're unsure it's double check the time zones and everything. This becomes really important whenever we get obviously to the submissions. So project submissions are due Sunday August 13 at 11:00 a.m. My time which is noon Eastern time. We try to make sure to make it as clear as possible because sometimes people may forget or they thought that project submissions were due on the Monday instead of another day.
00:18:59.150 - 00:19:08.036, Speaker B: So, yeah, just keep an eye on the schedule. This will be sort of a great reference point for you all to look.
00:19:08.098 - 00:19:08.740, Speaker A: Gap.
00:19:11.480 - 00:19:17.650, Speaker B: And then yeah the project feedback sessions these are next one next Tuesday, one's next Thursday the.
