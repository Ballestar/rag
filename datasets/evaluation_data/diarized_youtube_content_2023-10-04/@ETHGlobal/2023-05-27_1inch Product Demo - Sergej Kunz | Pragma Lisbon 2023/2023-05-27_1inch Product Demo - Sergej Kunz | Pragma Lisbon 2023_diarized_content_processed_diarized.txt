00:00:07.210 - 00:00:26.070, Speaker A: All right, for our second demo of today, we're going to bring on Sergey from One Inch, and Sergey is going to talk about a really cool product that they've recently launched, which is One Inch Fusion. So we're going to see a quick intro on what Fusion is and a quick demo on how it actually works. So, without further ado, let's welcome Sergey.
00:00:26.730 - 00:00:32.194, Speaker B: So hi, everyone. My name is Sergey. I'm co founder of One Each Network.
00:00:32.194 - 00:00:41.770, Speaker B: It's really a pleasure to stay here. I and Anton, my co founder. We actually started on ETH Global hackathon back in 2019.
00:00:41.770 - 00:01:04.446, Speaker B: We have built the first version of our One Inch network, the Aggregation protocol. I was walking around the hackathon, was pitching the idea to everyone, and everyone was really excited. Ethereum, founder of Vitalik Buterian, said, It sounds reasonable, just do it.
00:01:04.446 - 00:01:25.462, Speaker B: Hayden Adams, walk around my table, catch him and ask, what do you think? And he said it's okay. But one guy said, this is the next big thing, what you're going to build here if you can really do it over two nights? It was Liam Horn, the co organizer of Ethereum Global. And I didn't trust him.
00:01:25.462 - 00:01:40.482, Speaker B: So at the end, after three years, we have built a lot of products. We have built a lot of open source protocols, which you can find on GitHub under MIT license. You see, we have Liquidity protocol.
00:01:40.482 - 00:01:57.266, Speaker B: We have our spot price protocols based on smart contracts, our limit order protocol, which is kind of a decentralized order book. We have built our Fusion. It is kind of new approach, how to exchange assets in DeFi and Web Three.
00:01:57.266 - 00:02:12.040, Speaker B: We have built our nice self custody wallet with really nice features. We have our Dow, we have our Token. It's really long story, and I would say one year in DeFi is like ten years in traditional world.
00:02:12.040 - 00:02:31.274, Speaker B: And I started already to get some great creators. Nowadays we are working on institutional products, trying to also improve the space for institutional space, because the settlement on the blockchain is the best, I would say, right now. And they still don't understand it.
00:02:31.274 - 00:02:43.870, Speaker B: And we try to teach them. So we keep still 70 percentages of market share. We came to the idea to introduce the new market aggregation market among these real estate exchanges.
00:02:43.870 - 00:03:02.546, Speaker B: Eliminatoral market share, it grew from zero. We overtook everyone and keep 80 percentages. Right now, we have since 2019 330 billions of west loss of volume handled by the smart contracts.
00:03:02.546 - 00:03:27.834, Speaker B: Four and a half million of unique wallets, 180 core contributors around the globe, kind of freelancers who are working full time, some of them part time on the project. And our labs raised $190,000,000 in three year financial rounds. What was not really easy for us, we were just normal two software developers who didn't know how to raise.
00:03:27.834 - 00:03:46.870, Speaker B: It took like one year to get the first fundraising, and I did at least 1000 pitches in my life so I know how that is. So what's new? We introduced a new thing, we call it Fusion. It offer really nice features like gasless swaps so you don't pay for the transaction itself.
00:03:46.870 - 00:04:32.142, Speaker B: It is done by professional market makers through this fusion approach you get huge really great access to the huge liquidity of everywhere because market makers are bridging the liquidity also from centralized exchanges you get math protection by design. What I faced last year in summer I would say I sold Ethereum and bought Ethereum in the same time because of tax reasons ethereum dropped with the price and I just sold and bought. Now I have a loss in my declaration and I faced a problem that I was front run like and sandwiched I lost ten Ethereum.
00:04:32.142 - 00:04:49.034, Speaker B: It was kind of huge for me. It's a lot of money. And of course we introduced also new thing at one inch recently in December also economics upgrade we introduced new staking with locking over specific period of time and you get unicorn power.
00:04:49.034 - 00:05:29.606, Speaker B: So one token is not equal one vote in our dao you need to lock for specific periods of time to be able to participate. So fusion fusion kind of is a limit order approach with a Deutsche auction behind that. And this environment which we set up offers from one side people to send offers to create orders in a specific price range and from other side every market maker can participate in this environment and take the orders you have really best execution on the market.
00:05:29.606 - 00:06:05.474, Speaker B: Since we introduced Dutch auction approach with specific price curves so all the market makers compete with each other to fill your order or to match your order with someone else. Because someone is buying ethereum, someone is selling ethereum and this can be matched we have asynchronous trading on chain that means you can do ten trades. You don't have to wait kind of in order so you don't have to wait for the first trade to execute the second one just sold one of nice things all liquidity in one place.
00:06:05.474 - 00:06:28.870, Speaker B: Already said you don't pay any gas with native tokens. It can be that you just get a little bit less in destination token since someone need to pay the gas costs and on lower amounts you just get paid with destination token, on the higher amounts you don't pay anything. I will show you this is a good example.
00:06:28.870 - 00:06:59.554, Speaker B: Someone came and exchanged on one inch 3700 ethereum to USDT and at the end they got $2,300 more compared if they would just trade it on the market if they just would use and also another aggregator to just execute it on the market. Since you face the problem on higher months that you have a price impact because there's not super high liquidity. And our Dutch auction approach follows the price curve of the market.
00:06:59.554 - 00:07:22.938, Speaker B: So at the beginning the protocol tries to sell little bit for really good price the current Oracle price I would say and then it goes down slowly over time. In this case ten minutes to their current market rate, the rate of the aggregator, whatever you use. So this is the price impact included in the price.
00:07:22.938 - 00:07:43.054, Speaker B: And then it goes a little bit down below to little bit below to take care that the trade will be executed because of the gas cost protected from f by design. It's just limit aura you sign, it's just a permit you send it to, you share it in a network. You don't pay anything for this.
00:07:43.054 - 00:08:01.734, Speaker B: And no one can front run you, no one can sandwich you swap before, you swap after you. And if you like to integrate fusion, we have nice SDK, we have nice API, we offer hands on. So just speak with us.
00:08:01.734 - 00:08:14.102, Speaker B: I'm going to show you a small example how fusion works. This is our soap interface. We can connect wallet.
00:08:14.102 - 00:08:34.898, Speaker B: I'm using one inch test wallet. So the one inch wallet you can download on the App Store. Of course, we face the same problem as uniswap as well with App Store rules and kind of policy, which is not clear for anyone.
00:08:34.898 - 00:08:52.614, Speaker B: So in this wallet we have some one inch tokens, we have some ethereum. So if you don't want to pay any gas costs, you can just choose a token which support permits. This is in one stock in the case.
00:08:52.614 - 00:09:10.034, Speaker B: And if you are going to buy here uni token, we can select here different modes. We have the legacy mode. This is the first approach we came to on the hackathon, just to offer kind of already prepared call data for the user and the smart contract execute on multiple liquidity sources.
00:09:10.034 - 00:09:36.338, Speaker B: The execution path could looks like this, or it can be very complicated on a higher amount, for example, on really high amounts, a lot of liquidity source would be used. You take into the risk that the transaction fails and to avoid this, and from our point of view that the risk should be taken by professional market makers. And this is fusion.
00:09:36.338 - 00:09:56.730, Speaker B: So you don't pay any transaction costs with the fusion and you can execute it smoothly. I give a permit, it's just a signature in the wallet. Now I confirm I'm okay with the rates and now I see the pending transaction.
00:09:56.730 - 00:10:24.994, Speaker B: And now we need to wait a little bit until professional market maker takes this. So on a lower amount, they of course take into account the gas codes and it can take maybe a couple of minutes to execute this, sometimes very fast. If the price goes up on higher amounts, already explained, you don't pay at the end, nothing, because there's a huge arbitrary opportunity for the traders to fill the order.
00:10:24.994 - 00:10:45.414, Speaker B: So this is fusion. This is kind of, from our point of view, the new thing, which also introduced a new way also in direction of account abstraction. So here are actually mirror kind of transactions which are executed by someone else, not you, not by your wallet.
00:10:45.414 - 00:10:51.280, Speaker B: And it too specific thing. It exchange assets. Now the trade is done.
00:10:51.280 - 00:10:59.546, Speaker B: You can see here it was executed. So 100 percentages filled. It's done by the professional market maker.
00:10:59.546 - 00:11:10.350, Speaker B: You got the best rate by taking into account of the gas costs on Ethereum. We support also multiple other networks which are cheaper, arbitrary. For example, optimism.
00:11:10.350 - 00:11:14.366, Speaker B: Yeah, that's it. Thank you very much. If you have any questions, I'm here.
00:11:14.468 - 00:11:15.380, Speaker A: We can quick. Thanks.
