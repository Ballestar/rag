00:00:06.490 - 00:00:54.874, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Excited to be back. Hope you enjoyed some Lo Fi beats during that break. And, yeah, really excited to say that we have Camilla Russo with us, who's going to be joining us in just a second. When I was thinking about putting together The Summit, one of the key ways in which Ethereum has had a huge impact and the key people that they have as creators. And Camilla has been a creator not only as a journalist, but also in her work at the Defiant and also now as a producer of an exciting new documentary that's coming up, or actually full exciting feature like film that's coming up, actually not a documentary about the creation of Ethereum. So instead of making myself look like an idiot on stage, I'll probably enjoy I'll just invite Camilla up right away to chat about this and her work, both of the documentary and how Ethereum has been able to impact the creation of it.
00:00:54.874 - 00:01:02.742, Speaker A: So, Camilla, when you're ready, feel free to share your video, share your audio, and really excited to have you join us on stage.
00:01:02.906 - 00:01:06.802, Speaker B: All right. Hi. Is this working okay?
00:01:06.936 - 00:01:08.146, Speaker A: Yeah, everything's great.
00:01:08.248 - 00:01:28.700, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Super excited to be here. Thank you for inviting me. Thanks for the intro. Yeah. And it's really crazy that I'm seeing my book being turned into a movie. So yeah, excited to chat about that.
00:01:29.310 - 00:02:10.374, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, I think on my side, I was really inspired to hear a bit about just the process of turning from journalists to basically company startup creator to then now book writer and now movie producer. I think it's been a crazy journey. Maybe it'd be great to kind of walk through a little bit on the timelines of kind of how you just started out and just kind of getting into it. And then we'd love to kind of dive a little bit more into kind of the new stuff that you've been working on. But I think it'd be great for everybody to recognize how quick that journey was for you to go and just kind of give a sense of those milestones for you.
00:02:10.492 - 00:03:14.970, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So my a I'm a journalist. I started my career well in a newspaper in Chile, but then came to the US and was at Bloomberg News for eight years covering all sorts of markets. Was based in Argentina and Spain and in New York, where I'm at now. And my final two years at Bloomberg were focused on crypto. I actually kind of wrote my first crypto story in 2013 in Argentina about kind of this growing bitcoin community there, but was able to really focus day to day in kind of the crypto beat starting in 2017 and then covering kind of all the craziness of that time. Everything was really boring in comparison and decided I would just stay in crypto.
00:03:14.970 - 00:04:35.570, Speaker B: And that's where kind of the idea of the book came about. So this was like, end of 2017, I had always wanted to write a book and covering crypto, it was like, there has to be a book idea here somewhere. And I started thinking about what the biggest stories in the space were and it was pretty clear that that was Ethereum. That there was a gap there in that there were no books on Ethereum at the time, or at least notebooks kind of telling the story of how Ethereum had come to be, how it was founded and created. And so I decided to take that on. And that's kind of how the book idea came about and luckily found a publisher, Harper Collins, interested in seeing it come to life and then started working on the book all through 2018 and left Bloomberg in January of 2019 to finish writing The Infinite Machine. And because I had been kind of at the same spot for too long, for eight years, I decided I wanted to be an independent writer.
00:04:35.570 - 00:05:43.194, Speaker B: And then that kind of evolved into just the idea of The Defiant. So The Infinite Machine and The Defiant are pretty kind of tied because it was researching for The Infinite Machine that I was, like, following the Ethereum community around all the hackathons, all the ETH global hackathons conferences, and just was seeing all this innovation coming from the Ethereum community and especially DFI emerging. And I realized it was super undercover. To me, DFI in 2019 was by far the most interesting thing happening in crypto. And so I decided to start a D five focused newsletter with The Defiant in June of 2019. And, yeah, that really stemmed from my research of The Infinite Machine. So that's kind of how everything came together amazing.
00:05:43.312 - 00:06:31.866, Speaker A: And I think the timing of that should be noted that I think to recognize that DFI was such an important part of this ecosystem, I think, in a lot of ways, early. Right. I think 2020 is like when DFI summer hit, and it was absolutely chaos, and a lot of people were just like an amazing period of explosion of new things happening in DFI. But to have noticed that that year early and then be, I think, in the right position and have built the brand over that year in between, to be able to really report on everything that was happening in a really measured way, I think was something that the ecosystem really needed in summer 2020 and of course, beyond. But, yeah, it was amazing to have you be a part of that and very helpful, I think, for the entire team.
00:06:31.888 - 00:07:20.658, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm glad. I really hope so. My goal with The Defiant was to bring the just, like, high quality, objective, unbiased reporting that I had learned at Bloomberg, bring that into crypto and just focus it on specifically finance, which I think there are some great crypto media and publications out there CoinDesk the blog. They do great work. But I was seeing kind of this missing space of just, like, finance focused information and DeFi focused information that was really just, like, had really high standards. So, yeah, that's what we've been trying to do at The Defiant.
00:07:20.834 - 00:07:46.640, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, I think you've been very successful in doing so. Very exciting to see that happen. And then, as you were sort of kind of, in a way, doing both of these. As you mentioned, they're very kind of interrelated, both the book and the defiant, I guess. Kind of curious as you were going through and chatting with people and interviewing and meeting the community. And as you mentioned, for kind of working towards this book.
00:07:46.640 - 00:08:08.460, Speaker A: I guess what comes to mind is maybe a story or an anecdote or something that you learned as you were doing this that you hadn't heard before that was really unexpected. That either was really positive or really negative. I don't know, however you want to take it. But I guess really curious what was a really cool story that you had heard that you hadn't heard before while you were kind of researching for the book?
00:08:12.110 - 00:09:21.280, Speaker B: That's so hard. I think I did, like, over 100 interviews for the book. Let's see, to me, when I was researching for The Infinite Machine, a lot of just like, the Ethereum founding story, I had no idea. I came into this pretty knowing, of course, about vitalik knowing just what an exceptional and just charismatic person he is. And I thought, there's this really great character that can drive this story. And I knew some about kind of the other co founders at the time, like I had interviewed for, you know, at Bloomberg, but I really didn't know about all the drama that happened in Ethereum in its early days. And as a writer, I was really happy to see that was the case.
00:09:22.790 - 00:09:24.740, Speaker A: Source material, right? Yeah.
00:09:25.670 - 00:10:41.980, Speaker B: So I guess these things are well known now, but at the time, 2018, when I started researching for this, I hadn't seen this written anywhere. Kind of this tension between Ethereum being a for profit company and a nonprofit foundation, the fallout with kind of different factions between founders, kind of what I call in my book this kind of Red Wedding situation, all of that tension yeah. I thought was so interesting and kind of at the core, it really spoke to just the values that later made Ethereum what it is. The fact that this vision for a nonprofit foundation, this open protocol, that vision for Ethereum was what finally kind of won out, was, of course, what has driven and shaped the network and the community to be what it is today.
00:10:44.030 - 00:11:22.294, Speaker A: It's amazing to hear. Yeah. And definitely, I imagine that that sort of, I guess, kind of pivotal thing at the at the foundation story at the beginning. It does make for an interesting opportunity to write and be able to tell that story and that kind of foundation journey, a little bit of like a hero's quest in some way. Yeah, I think just to kind of pause and reflect a little bit on that. The community is largely built up of at least at the beginning of kind of idealists, but largely just people who really excited about technology and often weren't writers, I think. Right.
00:11:22.294 - 00:12:30.560, Speaker A: And I think this in a way, is a testament to the importance of having writers in the space to be able to go back and tell those stories. Because at some point, and that feels like now a long time ago, the kind of foundation story, but at some point the story of the merge, for instance, will need to be told in a much more cohesive, really easy way to read. And it's so fresh and so new right now, but of course, that's going to be another big kind of pivotal moment in the ethereum story. So, yeah, I think just, I guess a shout out to all writers, not just to you in this space, but just being able to tell that story for people who I would say are not often too worried about telling that story themselves. And I think it's still an important story to be told. Kind of maybe transitioning from the book to now your kind of new project that you're working on that you announced recently, which is the movie or the adaptation of that book, I guess maybe it'd be cool to actually kind of hear a little bit more about kind of just how did that even start? I have no idea how to write a book. I have no idea how to turn a book into a movie either.
00:12:30.560 - 00:12:36.240, Speaker A: So I guess how does that journey even start for you and where did that begin?
00:12:36.930 - 00:13:49.270, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been pretty crazy. I didn't really expect my book to be turned into a movie. I mean, I could only dream of that happening. And now that it is, it's really crazy. So basically we published a book in July of 2020, and about a few months after that, I started getting some inquiries from a couple of movie studios about the rights of my book. So so how it works is that the author usually keeps owns the rights to sell their books to producers who want to turn that book into a film. I held those rights and so I was getting increase as to potentially selling them to different movie studios and producers.
00:13:49.270 - 00:15:27.606, Speaker B: So I had some initial conversations and it was fine, but I didn't get a sense of these groups having a real understanding of what crypto was about or just didn't see kind of a commitment to actually making it happen. My agent told me of all the movies that get sold, maybe like 1% actually get turned into a movie. So it's like movie studios kind of like buy these rights as an option. So it's like, okay, maybe we will one day take this and turn this into a movie, but it's not a sure thing that if you sell your rights, your book will actually be shown on screen. And so that was really hard for me to decide. It's like, okay, do I give this up and maybe lose an actual chance of seeing this on screen? And then this Spain based production studio reached out to me, and it was through someone who was actually in crypto to this day, francisco Ordillo has a hedge fund that invests in the space, and he's been kind of around since 2014, like, really kind of early on involved in crypto. So that was a really good sign to me.
00:15:27.606 - 00:16:30.458, Speaker B: It's like, okay, they get it. They're literally invested in the space, and they also offered to make me a part of production, so they offered me an executive producer role in the movie. So even though they weren't, like, a Hollywood studio, I decided to go with them because I saw just, like, a bigger chance of my book actually making it to be a movie and because I would be more involved in production. So that's how that happened still. I was really clear with them, like, okay, I'll go with you guys, but I still want this movie to be a Hollywood movie. I want this to be shown all over the world. I wrote this book for a mainstream audience and for this story to reach everyone.
00:16:30.458 - 00:16:54.160, Speaker B: And so I want the movie to have that same kind of impact. So the vision for this movie is for it to be like the Social Network, but for crypto. So a dramatized story that's meant to be like a blockbuster is kind of the big dream. So that's what we're going for.
00:16:54.530 - 00:17:46.882, Speaker A: Amazing. And I guess that has to be, like, a very, I think, very emotional journey, I would imagine, because the book, I'm guessing, is you put so much work into that, that must feel, in a way, like a little bit of a piece of you right? And to then kind of license that out to somebody else, where maybe you're not totally sure exactly how they'll respect the amount of work that you put into it, honestly. Especially in the case where, like you said, I didn't know that only 1% of these things get often turned into movies, these agreements. So, yeah, I imagine that must have been quite an emotional journey to kind of go through. And I really happy to hear that you found somebody that you can trust and also that you're part of the movie, I think, in a lot of ways, too, right? As a producer, maybe worth speaking to, what kind of influence and maybe kind of impact you get to have as a producer, because I'm actually personally not too familiar either.
00:17:47.016 - 00:18:03.590, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question, because I had no idea about the film world, but executive producer sounds like, okay, that should be at the top, but it really isn't.
00:18:04.250 - 00:18:05.778, Speaker A: It sounds very fancy.
00:18:05.954 - 00:19:08.602, Speaker B: Yeah. But it's really kind of when you're the producer, then you actually have, like, hands on influence on how things are made. Executive producers are more like an advisor kind of role. So executive producers usually kind of help with bringing in investors or bringing in kind of their network. It's like, okay, maybe they're really well connected with actors and they can get a good cast, or maybe they're well connected with investors. It's really like more of an advisor role. Or maybe they can just weigh in on the script, which, of course I want to do, but it's not like I don't get a real say, actually on how the movie gets made, but I do at least get a chance to kind of look behind the scenes at how it is getting made.
00:19:08.602 - 00:19:37.330, Speaker B: So I'd rather take that than nothing. What it does is I can be involved and I am involved in the funding of the movie. And so we can get into that how I wanted to bring in NFTs, and then I luckily get to at least look at the script and kind of give my opinion, although I am not kind of directly involved in writing it.
00:19:37.480 - 00:19:52.146, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. Got you. So, yeah, every time I said producer so far, I suppose I should have said executive producer because the fancier title means advisor instead of the actual yeah, got it. Okay, cool. Awesome. Learn something new every day. Yeah, I mean, that's a perfect segue.
00:19:52.146 - 00:20:20.820, Speaker A: I mean, I think one of the reasons why I in particular I thought about having you on was part of that kind of fundraising process or even mobilizing the community that you've been able to build over the years to be a part of this movie. So, yeah, maybe I think it totally makes sense to segue into talking a little bit more about that. As you mentioned, did you use kind of NFTs and the community that you built over the years to be a part of this movie and be part of that journey with you?
00:20:21.190 - 00:21:06.914, Speaker B: Yeah. So when we started having kind of the first conversations about funding, I immediately thought, we should do this with NFTs. This is going to be the first feature film about Ethereum. We should bring in the Ethereum community and bring in Ethereum kind of technology somehow into the production process. And NFTs seem like a good you know, the other producers agreed and we started to brainstorm on how this NFT project would actually work. So that's kind of the genesis of that.
00:21:07.112 - 00:21:45.258, Speaker A: Awesome. And then yeah. Can you maybe speak more to maybe even just the thought process about that? I know that over the last couple of years, a lot of creators, like individual creators, have basically gone through this exact mental math of just sort of like thinking about how they can get their work into more of the hands of people that support them and do so in a more direct fashion, using NFTs, using blockchain, using different primitives to kind of do that. Yeah. Maybe even diving into a little bit more about the different kind of options or different ways that people could help be a part of it through the NFTs that you were offering.
00:21:45.434 - 00:22:54.210, Speaker B: Yeah. So when we started thinking about the NFT side of the movie, the first thing was we want these NFTs to be a way to involve the ethereum community into the production process. So by giving these tokens some sort of utility or kind of reward attached to them. So what we decided is that we would treat these tokens as kind of backstage passes into production. And so there's, like, different Easter eggs attached to these NFTs. So some of them will give you the ability to be named in the credits of the movie so your name appears at the end. Some of them give you an invite to the premiere of the film.
00:22:54.210 - 00:24:02.602, Speaker B: Others make you an extra. There's, like 20 NFPs that allow you to be an extra in the movie. Yeah. And there's also an invitation to visit, like, a shooting location. So that was kind of our way of just involving contributors to the funding process into production. I'll say that ideally, kind of the obvious and right way, I think, to do this would have been to share kind of the royalties and actual kind of equity in the film with NFT holders, of course, kind of discussing that with lawyers. It was, like, impractical to, yeah, nobody wants to go to jail, but it's this situation we're in with kind of lack of regulatory clarity that we have to just be careful how we do things.
00:24:02.602 - 00:25:50.570, Speaker B: And so we found this way of adding value to NFTs without having to just step into kind of murky regulatory waters. So that's kind of on the utility side and then on kind of the actual just, like, visual aspect, like the design aspect. It's one of my favorite things about the project. We decided on kind of, this is the utility. And then I reached out to one of the people who had been involved in the creation of the and I thought, you know, it'd be really cool if this guy also designs our NFTs. And then it happened that he is involved in a group of artists in like, he organizes this group of artists together with a professor at the University of Havana, and they make sure that these artists are able to sell their work in kind of like a global market via NFTs. And I thought it was an amazing project, so I said, Why not bring in this group of artists to make the visual kind of side of our project? And then we just decided to open up that process to any artist, but especially artists in emerging.
00:25:50.570 - 00:27:13.058, Speaker B: You know, this is just very close to me. I'm originally from Chile. I lived a long time in Argentina, and I really do believe that crypto has the opportunity to actually change lives in emerging nations and make a bigger impact. Of course, in developed nations, crypto has the opportunity to upend the financial system and make it much more efficient and also be more inclusive. But for countries where you really have a deeply devalued currency, where you have currency controls, where you have extremely corrupt governments, that's where crypto can make an even bigger impact. So I just wanted to bring in artists from those areas and regions of the world and provide kind of a platform for them. So we opened up the process for any artist to apply and we ended up with a group of 36 artists from Cuba, Argentina, Tile, venezuela, Kenya, India, and a few other places.
00:27:13.058 - 00:27:42.974, Speaker B: And they designed a collection which is each artist designed ten versions of the Ethereum logo and then we divided that into Mosaics and then programmatically combined these tiles. And so the result is a really cool, just like, explosion of Ethereum. It's really colorful and different textures and styles and it's just really cool. So really happy with how that turned out.
00:27:43.092 - 00:28:22.038, Speaker A: It's amazing. Yeah, I took a look at them after I saw you chat about this the first time, and they're absolutely beautiful. I think Mosaics of just explosions, like you said, of colors and shapes and everything, they're really beautiful. So that's awesome. And I think one other thing that's worth noting is I just realized I think you've been doing interesting stuff with NFTs for actually a while. I remember one of the first NFTs I got, aside from a crypto kitty way back when was when I pre purchased your book in 2020 and you did these kind of voice notes for everybody and minted those as NFTs. And that was the first time I ever realized that an NFT could be more than just like, a picture.
00:28:22.038 - 00:28:29.166, Speaker A: I didn't realize it could be also. Yeah, so that was like a really cool unlock for me back then, too, and yeah, cool. Kind of like full circle there.
00:28:29.268 - 00:28:35.018, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. I kind of even forget that I did that. I did this kind of proof of preorder.
00:28:35.194 - 00:28:36.094, Speaker A: It was awesome.
00:28:36.212 - 00:28:37.774, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right.
00:28:37.972 - 00:28:59.766, Speaker A: It was really cool. Awesome. Well, I don't want to take up too much more of your time. I know that we're at the kind of scheduled time here, but well, thank you so much for being a part of this. I'd love to just give you a second if you can shout out where we can learn more about the movie. If there's any place that's like a resource for us to learn as we kind of wait for its reveal. But yeah, where should we turn to hear more about that movie?
00:28:59.878 - 00:29:17.774, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for giving me the opportunity to share. So we have, like our website is theinfinitmachinemovie.com and Twitter, I guess, is the other best place at eastmovie, and then you'll find links to the discord as well.
00:29:17.972 - 00:29:34.834, Speaker A: Amazing. Okay, well, thank you so much, Kamala. I cannot wait to watch the movie. And thank you so much for being a part of this. We're excited and yeah, thank you so much. And I think that actually brings us to the end of our day today. So I'll just kind of quickly share.
00:29:34.834 - 00:30:01.438, Speaker A: Thanks again, Camilla, for your time. And I just want to kind of give a quick overview for everybody else as a big thank you for being a part of this. Of course, if you're part of the hackathon that is going on right now, I do want to note that submissions are due on Sunday at 03:00 P.m.. So get your pencils going and get your submissions in. You could start now. Submissions are open and yeah, otherwise, happy hacking. And thank you so much, everybody, for being a part of this.
00:30:01.604 - 00:30:06.990, Speaker B: Nice. Thanks. And also good luck to everyone participating in the hackathon.
00:30:07.570 - 00:30:08.414, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:30:08.612 - 00:30:09.034, Speaker B: Bye.
00:30:09.082 - 00:30:10.700, Speaker A: Thanks, Kevin. See you, everybody.
