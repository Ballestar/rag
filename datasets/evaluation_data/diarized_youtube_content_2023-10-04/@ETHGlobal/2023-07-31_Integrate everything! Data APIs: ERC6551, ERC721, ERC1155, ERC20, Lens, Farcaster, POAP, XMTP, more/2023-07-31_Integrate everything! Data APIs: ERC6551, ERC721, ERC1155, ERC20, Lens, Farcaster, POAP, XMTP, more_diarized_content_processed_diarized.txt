00:00:07.610 - 00:00:17.546, Speaker A: I'm Jason Goldberg, founder and CEO of airstack. And I'm here with Rishi Thakur, one of our senior developers. Today we're going to give you an overview of airstack.
00:00:17.546 - 00:00:40.890, Speaker A: Rishi is going to show you how to write some more complex queries. I'm going to first provide an overview of the APIs that we provide, and then I'll show you how you can use our AI engine to write your queries, give you a glimpse of our new Explorer that we launched yesterday. So it's a graphical interface on top of our AI, on top of our APIs, and then I'll hand over to Rishi to go into some of the queries.
00:00:40.890 - 00:01:16.150, Speaker A: First of all, we want to make it as easy as possible for you to integrate any web three on chain and related off chain data into your apps. The whole mission of the company is just make it easier and easier for developers to integrate with the things outside of their apps so you can focus on your app, use our APIs to get the data about everything else. And so everything we do on our roadmap is all about how do we make it easier and easier so that you don't even have to run any backend infrastructure if you don't want to, to be able to bring data in about your users, about their on chain activities and things that increase relevance.
00:01:16.150 - 00:01:32.934, Speaker A: So first, I'll just show everyone really quick the APIs that we have. Let me go here. So airstack offers a number of APIs today, just from a company strategy standpoint.
00:01:32.934 - 00:01:55.646, Speaker A: We decided to go really deep on Ethereum and Polygon. So rather than doing like, ten chains and doing a little bit on each, we decided to go really deep on these two chains. We also have Poops on Gnosis, but really deep on Ethereum and Polygon, and offering features and API access, especially around social and identity that you don't find anywhere else, and helping solve very specific use cases.
00:01:55.646 - 00:02:16.518, Speaker A: And then we'll take all that in the coming months to other chains going on the left hand side. We provide APIs for tokens ERC 27, 20, 111, 55, every transaction since the Genesis block, and new transactions within seconds are coming through our nodes very strong. Obviously.
00:02:16.518 - 00:02:26.540, Speaker A: Also in NFTs, we also offer resized NFT images inside of our APIs. You don't have to go out to IPFS and fetch images. It's all right there in our APIs, which we'll show you in a second.
00:02:26.540 - 00:02:41.614, Speaker A: We also are the first and only indexer right now of ERC six, five, one token bound accounts. Rishu will show some examples of that, and we're thrilled to work with the token bound working group. Very close with the team there.
00:02:41.614 - 00:02:55.690, Speaker A: And a lot of developers building on 6551 see huge potential in that. And we'd love to work with you. If you're thinking about building on 6551 here in Paris, you can also use Airstat to get all token balances, token transfers of users.
00:02:55.690 - 00:03:14.550, Speaker A: And then, as I said, we're especially strong in identity. So we have fully indexed ENS, subdomains and regular ENS domains, lens and Farcaster. When it comes to social poops, all six and a half million Poops that have ever been handed to anyone we have inside of airstack and New within seconds.
00:03:14.550 - 00:03:29.594, Speaker A: And also as of yesterday, we also index Xmtp. And so Xmtp you might be familiar with is a messaging protocol enables you to miss messages from 10 X address to another. airstack is the only way today you can find out who has Xmdp.
00:03:29.594 - 00:04:03.178, Speaker A: So you could query does this Farcaster address or this lens or this ENS, or does the holder who in this Poops has Xmdp? So we enable that as well as a benefit within airstack. And the other thing that we do also with related to Xmdp that's really interesting is we act as the universal resolver for Xmdp, right? So with Xmdp you can message from a zero X address to another zero X address, but I don't know Rishi's Xerox address, but I do know his Farcaster name and he might know my lens handle. And with airstack, the messages get through because we help developers resolve those.
00:04:03.178 - 00:04:17.950, Speaker A: So all you need to know is the name of the person that they have, whether it's their ENS or their forecast or their lens, and we help devs resolve that. We'll show you in a second. And then we have a lot on NFT sales and marketplaces in our APIs as well.
00:04:17.950 - 00:04:22.080, Speaker A: So let me go back here and where we go.
00:04:24.610 - 00:04:28.000, Speaker B: Okay, so 1 second, sorry.
00:04:30.390 - 00:04:50.134, Speaker A: Let me show you. All right, so when you go to airstack, the first thing you'll see is that once you run a query in airstack, if you want to, you can share it with the community. If you want to really start to jump in and learn about the APIs, one of the things you can do is just browse queries other people have done.
00:04:50.134 - 00:05:05.322, Speaker A: So you can see there's a query someone did that has 374 runs and four forks. I've got all, ERC, 27, 21 tokens and poops NFTs to someone or bulk check if a zero X address have Xmtp and primary ENS. And I think Rishi is going to actually show how to write this query today.
00:05:05.322 - 00:05:20.654, Speaker A: And you can just see also there's by different tags, you can see queries that people have done about socials. And you can just dive into any one of these and you can see the GraphQL query that the user did to get this right. And so I'm just giving you an overview.
00:05:20.654 - 00:05:33.058, Speaker A: We'll walk into some of these and walk through some of these in detail in a second. But the first thing I want to show you is the cheat codes. So the cheat codes is we want everyone, obviously to learn our GraphQL schemas and our APIs.
00:05:33.058 - 00:05:43.686, Speaker A: But you can also get started using our AI engine, our AI engine is built with GPD four. We've been working on it for seven months now. It's fully trained on the airstack APIs.
00:05:43.686 - 00:05:49.990, Speaker A: It's over 99.9% accurate. So anything that is in our APIs, it can help you write the query.
00:05:49.990 - 00:06:10.018, Speaker A: So I'm going to show you, for instance, I'm going to show you two queries here. First, I'm going to pick on my friend Shane Mack, who's the CEO of Xmtp. I'm going to say show all NFTs tokens, socials, ENS and Xmtp for Shanemac E.
00:06:10.018 - 00:06:18.322, Speaker A: And I'm going to ask the AI to generate this for me. Pretty complex query. I mean, this is basically saying NFTs across ethereum and polygon, tokens across ethereum polygon.
00:06:18.322 - 00:06:30.140, Speaker A: Socials is both Farcaster and lens ENS and not even providing a Xerox address, providing his ENS that it's going to resolve. And there he goes. There's the result.
00:06:30.140 - 00:06:38.602, Speaker A: And here you can see his forecaster name is Shane Mack. His lens is Shane Mac lens. Here's other domains that he has.
00:06:38.602 - 00:06:51.438, Speaker A: Here's his tokens. Here you can see we also bring back the images of those tokens all here in a single query and response. So you can create all sorts of amazing user experiences with this just from a single API call.
00:06:51.438 - 00:07:08.882, Speaker A: Obviously, you could also do this in multiple API calls, but the AI helps you learn this. And just to show you an example here I mentioned we built an Explorer that we launched yesterday. And this Explorer is a front end to the APIs.
00:07:08.882 - 00:07:20.198, Speaker A: I'm going to do the exact same query. So I'm just going to type in Shanemac E, and there's the results. And the Explorer is designed in a way where this is entirely forkable.
00:07:20.198 - 00:07:31.574, Speaker A: You can grab SDKs for this with react and JavaScript and python. The code is available for the front end here. You can get it from our GitHub.
00:07:31.574 - 00:07:48.466, Speaker A: And then for any of these queries that you do, like the one I just did from the front end Explorer, you can also jump right back into the GraphQL and get the API. So here I'm going to go right back in and get the API for that query right there. That made the front end so very easy to learn it either way.
00:07:48.466 - 00:08:01.766, Speaker A: You can use the AI or you can use the Explorer front end. Something else I'll show you from the Explorer real quick is we also not just wallet balances, but also token holders. Here's an example.
00:08:01.766 - 00:08:08.866, Speaker A: This is very current. This is ECC Six. We have aggregated counts of the token holders.
00:08:08.866 - 00:08:19.530, Speaker A: You can see the Socials, how many have ENS, farcast or Lens. Pretty impressive actually, that 570 people from the 1136 have signed a transaction on polygon and got a lens address. Just claim.
00:08:19.530 - 00:08:28.830, Speaker A: And here you can see all the token holders. And then same thing again. If I go to the GraphQL here, you can get that exact query right there.
00:08:28.830 - 00:08:42.740, Speaker A: And as I said before, you can also see that the images are resized. So you can literally just call our APIs and get whatever size you need and plug it right into your application. So you can build something like an Explorer, but you can also do all sorts of other things.
00:08:42.740 - 00:08:59.570, Speaker A: And just to show you real quickly, in our docs, we have a number of different use cases. We have specific around Token bound six five one has Xmtp resolving identities. We've also done a lot with contact recommendations.
00:08:59.570 - 00:09:22.566, Speaker A: So we've done work both with Farcaster and with Lens and with Xmtp to help recommend people that, you know, based on your on chain behaviors. So people that you've sent Tokens to or sent to you who have NFTs in common, or PO ops that you've been to. Also, there's a Lens playground we built, happy to share if anyone's interested can show you some of that and lots of other use cases as well that you can dive into in our docs.
00:09:22.566 - 00:09:32.370, Speaker A: Lots of tutorials here as well. All right, over to you, Rishi, to get into more. That was the fast overview and Rishi is going to details.
00:09:34.150 - 00:09:39.830, Speaker B: Thanks, Jason. Hi, everyone. So let's get started with some pretty interesting queries.
00:09:39.830 - 00:10:04.880, Speaker B: So for the first one, let's try and get all the people that hold the Poop for each CC Paris, and let's see what extra information we can get after we get those owners. So for that we can use our Poop API over here. We need to pass the event ID.
00:10:04.880 - 00:10:31.600, Speaker B: I have that here. And we can see the owners and their addresses. We can see more things about the event such as which country, city.
00:10:31.600 - 00:10:52.738, Speaker B: Yep. And there we go. Right, so we got that this is like the Poop event for ECC Paris.
00:10:52.738 - 00:11:11.590, Speaker B: We've got the metadata, we have some description associated with it. And yeah, this is the owner for this particular Token ID. So now, supposing you met somebody here at ECC and you wanted to reach out to them, say, on Xmtp.
00:11:11.590 - 00:11:44.216, Speaker B: So you can quickly check with Xmtp whether they have Xmtp enabled or not. And let me right, so for whomever it is. So for example, this address xmtp is enabled.
00:11:44.216 - 00:12:05.036, Speaker B: This address xmtp is enabled so you can directly reach out to them. And we can even get their primary domain as well as their different social. So for example, this user has Xmtp enabled.
00:12:05.036 - 00:12:13.990, Speaker B: Here's his ENS, here's their profiles as well. So this is one pretty cool query that we have. Moving on.
00:12:13.990 - 00:12:24.340, Speaker B: Yeah. So for the next one, let's look more into ERC six, five, one. And let's try to form a pretty cool query.
00:12:24.340 - 00:12:43.796, Speaker B: So we have the accounts here. So this account represents the account which the NFT is owning. And let's say we want to get all the let's start with getting all the ERC, six five for an accounts.
00:12:43.796 - 00:13:22.056, Speaker B: You can get the address, the Token address, token ID, some information about the NFT as well. Right? Yeah. Right, so here we have the so this is the address of the contract deployed.
00:13:22.056 - 00:13:50.360, Speaker B: This is the address of the NFT because this is a wallet so we can get other information about it as well like whether it has any ENS or any lens accounts. And here we have the NFT and there's metadata related to it for ETH. So we can take a specific token address and token ID and we can add it into our filters.
00:13:50.360 - 00:14:33.892, Speaker B: So token address here and ID. Right so here we have for that particular NFT, we have the address of the deployed contract and we also have the token address of the NFT which is owning that account and say we want to get the owner of that NFT as well. So you basically have the account, then the NFT and then the owner of that NFT.
00:14:33.892 - 00:14:52.460, Speaker B: So you get the true owner of the entire sort of tree here. For that we just need to go into NFTs. We have token balances and here we get owner and after that we get the addresses.
00:14:52.460 - 00:15:10.164, Speaker B: Yeah. So now we get this particular address here. So this is the externally owned account which owns for this particular token address and this token ID, he owns this NFT and this NFT is what is owning the account.
00:15:10.164 - 00:15:46.336, Speaker B: So just putting that together, we have a pretty complex query here and using this there can be ways to get like for a given account or a given set of NFTs. We can get all the ERC six five one accounts related to that and as well as the owners for it. So it could be a way to kind of get the total balance of a particular NFT because if you have this NFT and each ERC six five one can hold multiple NFTs and those NFTs again can have 6551.
00:15:46.336 - 00:16:01.472, Speaker B: So you get like a complete tree. So yeah, we can get that all through airstack. And for the last query I can show you how to use variables.
00:16:01.472 - 00:16:28.844, Speaker B: So rather than entering everything in the UI, we can just take a bunch of variables here. These are a bunch of addresses that I have and I'm building a query now where we can get a given owner's. For each address we can get their ENS name as well as whether they have Xmtp enabled or not.
00:16:28.844 - 00:17:17.110, Speaker B: We can go through token balance. How we add a variable in the UI is we select the owner and then we just this dollar sign here, add the variable and here we can just pass addresses and get their owner. We have their social domains.
00:17:17.110 - 00:17:33.870, Speaker B: Let's start by getting their ENS names, file names and Xmtp is enabled.
00:17:34.290 - 00:17:34.750, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:34.820 - 00:18:03.548, Speaker B: So here you can just summarize like we have an array of addresses which we're going to pass as a variable and we're getting all this different information about these particular addresses. Let me add a few more. Yeah, so I think a tabular form might be a bit better here.
00:18:03.548 - 00:18:14.556, Speaker B: So we can see, like, for this particular address, there's Socials. So this particular user has two Socials. One is Cr, which will be on Farcaster.
00:18:14.556 - 00:18:41.530, Speaker B: The other is his Lens, the domains, which he has, he has three couple of at least ten ENS names here. And this particular address has Xmtp enabled. So, yeah, that's really powerful because in a single query you're able to get the owners and their socials Xmtp status as well as their domain information.
00:18:41.530 - 00:18:54.860, Speaker B: And we can even add token addresses as well here. So you can get for a particular NFT all the owners and their particular social handles and other identity fields.
00:18:57.680 - 00:19:13.344, Speaker A: Yeah, so we'll take questions in a second. Just if you're interested in 6551, definitely recommend reading through the docs that we have on 6551. And also the 6551 founders are in our Dev chat and they're on standby if anyone needs any help deploying your 6551.
00:19:13.344 - 00:19:43.070, Speaker A: Our team can help somewhat and they're staying by to help. And in particular, in our dev docs, we also have some queries you can just kind of like replicate on 6551 of the very interesting ones is you can just say, show the last ten where you need to show all 6551s either deployed on Ethereum or Polygon. And if you just add in at the end and all the assets in them, you'll see the whole tree of every asset, the images of the NFTs that those 6551 accounts own.
00:19:43.070 - 00:19:53.904, Speaker A: Obviously, we can go into a lot more. We also can answer any questions 101 or come to our booth. And if you're not in our Telegram chat yet, please join because our whole team is standing by to answer questions.
00:19:53.904 - 00:19:58.050, Speaker A: And we have six minutes to answer questions now. Good. Please.
00:19:58.050 - 00:20:16.816, Speaker A: Yeah. So airstack is completely free until September 1. Starting September 1, we will have a generous free tier and then I'll be charged based on usage.
00:20:16.816 - 00:20:24.256, Speaker A: But for now, it's entirely free. There is a rate limit. If you need a rate limit increase, we have five additional free plans right now.
00:20:24.256 - 00:20:36.812, Speaker A: So just let us know what your needs are and we'll give you a rate limit increase. You can just request one from our team. Yeah.
00:20:36.812 - 00:20:44.576, Speaker A: So ethereum mainnet polygon mainnet. And so we do recommend hackathons. We don't need an X squarely right now.
00:20:44.576 - 00:20:51.744, Speaker A: We know a lot of folks would like us to, so if you need some matic to use on Polygon, just let us know. We'll send you some.
00:20:51.942 - 00:20:53.270, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah.
00:21:05.280 - 00:21:16.972, Speaker A: So new transactions. I think you're asking, how fast are things in airstack? A new transaction in Ethereum or Polygons should be in airstack within a couple of seconds. We've tested over and over again for performance.
00:21:16.972 - 00:21:38.326, Speaker A: It's the very low latency. It's not real time, but it should be just a couple of seconds right now. We run our own IPFS nodes right now.
00:21:38.326 - 00:21:47.526, Speaker A: IPFS. We have a couple other off chain data sources we use for descriptions and metadata. We're not right now, unfortunately.
00:21:47.526 - 00:21:49.020, Speaker A: Not indexing where we've yet.
00:21:54.190 - 00:22:12.386, Speaker B: Sweet. So the token Uri, which is there in the contract, like if it's an Airwave URL or an IPFS URL, we're making the call to the nodes, getting the data, storing it, and you wouldn't have to add any extra effort from your side to fetch it. It's all on airstack, even though I.
00:22:12.408 - 00:22:18.900, Speaker A: Learned something new today. So it does that. Are we a delete? In a way.
00:22:18.900 - 00:22:25.982, Speaker A: We have two minutes left.
00:22:26.036 - 00:22:26.640, Speaker B: Anyone?
00:22:30.010 - 00:22:31.686, Speaker A: All right, thank you, everyone. Appreciate it.
00:22:31.708 - 00:22:33.350, Speaker B: Thanks, Ben. And Kira.
00:22:34.210 - 00:22:34.620, Speaker A: Thank you.
