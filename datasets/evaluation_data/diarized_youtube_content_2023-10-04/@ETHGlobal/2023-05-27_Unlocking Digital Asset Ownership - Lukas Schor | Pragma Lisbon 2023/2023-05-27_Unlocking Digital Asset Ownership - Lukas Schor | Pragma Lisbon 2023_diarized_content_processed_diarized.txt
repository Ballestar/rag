00:00:07.210 - 00:00:14.586, Speaker A: Good afternoon, everybody. Hope you had a great lunch. And we are ready to kick off the second half of Pragma.
00:00:14.586 - 00:00:31.394, Speaker A: We got two more talks to go and two more demos, and this is the 50% mark. So let's buckle in and just begin right away with our next upcoming interview. So for our next talk, and that's our third talk of the day, I want to bring on Lucas from Safe.
00:00:31.394 - 00:00:56.334, Speaker A: A lot of you have used Safe before. If you are part of a Dao, if you care about custodying your assets and managing a lot more securely what you're holding, whether it's your NFTs or your money or everything in between, you have heard of Safe. But there's a lot more to Safe than just a multi SIG and there's a lot more history to how Safe got to where it is.
00:00:56.334 - 00:01:16.610, Speaker A: And to talk about all of that, we're going to bring on Lucas and cover a lot more of these themes. So please join me in welcoming Lucas and giving a big round of applause. Back in my day, this used to be called Gnosis Safe.
00:01:16.610 - 00:01:37.660, Speaker A: And a lot of people who are coming into this space now know it just as safe. So I'd love to kind of start off by having you talk about the history of how this came to be a product. Tell us about Gnosis Safe, what that was like, the decision to sort of go spend more time on this and this eventual brand to save.
00:01:38.270 - 00:01:41.002, Speaker B: How much time do we have? Because it's actually quite a long story.
00:01:41.056 - 00:01:42.320, Speaker A: In the next five minutes.
00:01:42.850 - 00:02:03.966, Speaker B: All right, yeah. In five minutes, I'd like to go back maybe to the origin of Safe being part of Gnosis because we did this spin off last year, but the origin of the project goes back way before that. Yeah, Gnosis was originally a research project within Consensus.
00:02:03.966 - 00:02:27.846, Speaker B: It was actually the first spoke from Consensus, the first project that then from within Consensus got spun off. What Gnosis wanted to do is build prediction markets, so market mechanisms that allow for crowdsourcing of knowledge in order to have better informed decision making. And, yeah, that was the goal of Gnosis.
00:02:27.846 - 00:02:51.042, Speaker B: They did the ICO to fund this project and when they did the ICO, they suddenly had a lot of digital assets efer they had to safeguard. And there was not really a good solution out there to do so. You don't want to have a lot of efer just sitting on a single private key being managed by multiple people.
00:02:51.042 - 00:03:17.930, Speaker B: You don't know when a transaction is made, who triggered this transaction and such. So Gnosis had saw this need of building a tool that allows for coordination around assets, which ended up being the Gnosis multisig. And it was really just like an internal tool Gnosis did to safeguard these ICO assets, but they ended up open, sourcing the project.
00:03:17.930 - 00:03:46.662, Speaker B: And it happened that a lot of these ICOs back then in 2017 had a similar problem and they just started using Gnosis Multisig. And as things go, if you open source something and someone else starts using it, suddenly you have people having feature requests, people want to have like a hosted version of this product, you have to maintain it, build it out. So Gnosis started building a team around.
00:03:46.716 - 00:03:50.870, Speaker A: This project to just this time everything is still internal.
00:03:52.010 - 00:04:04.730, Speaker B: It was already used externally. But this was exactly this transition period where Gnosis saw this is actually something that the market needs. We need to put a team behind it, we need to productize the Gnosis multisig.
00:04:04.730 - 00:04:30.610, Speaker B: And then the next step was this is very valuable for teams, but it also has a lot of potential for individuals that want to have more secure way to custody their assets. So that was when Gnosisafe was born, which was the next version of Gnosis Multisig. New contracts, more gas efficient, like many improvements there initially mainly with the purpose to bringing this to retail users, to individuals.
00:04:30.610 - 00:04:46.120, Speaker B: But then still this team use case of having multiple people store assets together was still quite important. So Safe was also adopted there. Yeah, and at the same time Dosys did a lot of other things.
00:04:46.120 - 00:05:23.918, Speaker B: They Kickstarted, the dxDAO, they took over the Parity client development, then open Ethereum, they created new market mechanisms which then was initially researched and then developed into Cowswap now and kind of loaded itself with so many different projects. And then there was this opportunity to merge also with Xdai, which is a separate layer, one which has Dai as its native coin and cheaper transaction fees. And so there were just too many things on the plate for Gnosis.
00:05:23.918 - 00:05:54.890, Speaker B: And the decision was then made that the future of Gnosis is going to be Gnosis chain. So formerly Xdai and the other projects that were too big to be part of this Gnosis chain vision had to spin off, had to develop their own identity, go outside of Gnosis because I wouldn't say they were standing in the way, but it's harder to balance multiple projects. So Safe had like a huge potential.
00:05:54.890 - 00:06:13.534, Speaker B: So they didn't just want to close it down, but they said it has its life on its own. So beginning of last year then this decision was made from Nosystow to spin off the Safe project. And then there was the question like how do we call this thing? Because people actually always been gnosis safe.
00:06:13.534 - 00:06:36.170, Speaker B: People call Gnosis Safe, just Gnosis in many like I use Gnosis to custody my assets. But the idea is that when people say I build on Gnosis, they should mean I build on Gnosis chain. Because that's what the now Gnosis is going to focus on and we want to prevent a little bit this confusion also around this.
00:06:36.170 - 00:07:05.460, Speaker B: So we said Gnosis was nice for the time being, but now we need to focus on Safe and it is a very hard transition to make because people call it Osis, also safe. It requires a lot of education that you associate with safe, not this physical safe, but this new digital safe that we create. I think it's a process and we start seeing a little bit the benefits of having our own identity now and our own project.
00:07:05.460 - 00:07:20.610, Speaker B: Also, Kauswab by the way also did its spin off last year so that also happened. And yeah, it's still like a bigger gnosis family in a sense, but the safe now is completely independent.
00:07:20.770 - 00:07:49.090, Speaker A: Well that's awesome. We're going to dig into what does that actually mean? But no, you are right because I've had to remind myself multiple times to not say no to Safe on stage accidentally because I've just been so used to over the past few years and it's not quite easy. You started off as a multi sick kind of internal tool, became public open source and then people started using it and that means you were kind of focused on priorities for people at that time and now multiple years have passed.
00:07:49.090 - 00:07:53.540, Speaker A: Is there something that you feel like people still misunderstand about what safe is?
00:07:55.370 - 00:08:24.666, Speaker B: I think definitely one thing that safe because it has so much traction within teams and dows and everywhere where multiple people coordinate around assets, it's often mistaken as a Dow tooling or as a company solution. But I think also if you look at the stats there's about two and a half million safes out there. More than half of that are controlled by individual users.
00:08:24.666 - 00:08:49.218, Speaker B: Actually interestingly. Everyone who did this onboarding with WorldCoin today. They actually use a Safe because WorldAPP deploys a Safe for every user and I think that's something which will become more clear over the next months as well as we explore more the opportunities of account abstraction and smart accounts that there's so much more than just multisig that's enabled through Safe.
00:08:49.218 - 00:09:13.014, Speaker B: Because also if you look at just pure smart contract architecture, there's like this multisig component in there. So there can be one or multiple private keys that control a safe but then it allows to add additional functionality through plugins. We call them modules, guards and fallback handlers that extend the functionality of a safe and that can make it extremely useful.
00:09:13.014 - 00:09:37.640, Speaker B: Not just in a team where you have multiple private keys, but even if you just have one private key. But you might have a module that gives the user like a spending limit that they can use a certain amount of assets per day or like a guard that protects you from certain interactions with deny listed list of contracts. So there's like a lot of more functionality beyond just the multisig part.
00:09:37.640 - 00:09:47.320, Speaker B: So I would say biggest misconceptions is that Safe is more than just a team solution and Safe is more than just a multisig part.
00:09:48.170 - 00:09:57.574, Speaker A: And that sort of kind of opens up the whole platform piece which I want to talk about in a second. 2.5 million deployments of the contract.
00:09:57.574 - 00:10:07.200, Speaker A: That's a big number. And especially in the kind of context of our ecosystem and where we are, that's a lot. Are there any other stats that you're proud of for how safe is doing?
00:10:07.810 - 00:10:18.290, Speaker B: There's a few stats that definitely boggle my own minds because right now there's about $70 billion worth of assets being secured through safe.
00:10:18.790 - 00:10:19.970, Speaker A: No big deal.
00:10:20.120 - 00:10:26.850, Speaker B: If you compare this, this roughly 5% of the entire crypto market cap, including Bitcoin, which you cannot even store.
00:10:27.000 - 00:10:29.414, Speaker A: Not Ethereum, just a crypto market cap, let's say.
00:10:29.452 - 00:10:52.758, Speaker B: I mean, take this with a pinch of salt because on safe, there's also assets that are not part of the traditional market caps are not circulating supply, and there's a lot of these assets that are accounted in there. But still there's ton of value being secured. And even if you look beyond just the regular ERC 20 native coins, there's a lot of NFTs secured for safe.
00:10:52.758 - 00:11:07.214, Speaker B: About more than 10% of all crypto punks or Beladys or all the kind of the major collections, if you look at the stats, usually are unsafe. Also, more than 10% of all USDC is currently unsafe.
00:11:07.262 - 00:11:30.234, Speaker A: And that's a big number. The most obvious question I have with this is, well, that's a lot of money being trusted with the same code. How do you think about security, especially as more assets get custody and kind of what's your thinking and policy and framework around security?
00:11:30.432 - 00:12:00.610, Speaker B: Yeah, we were also lucky that all this value wasn't just secured overnight and it took people a lot of time to really trust the safe contracts. I think the first three years it was always below like 10 million maybe in total. I mean, this was also pre last bull market, but then people always were still having in mind the parity hack and putting money on a smart contract wasn't as common as after DFI summer.
00:12:00.610 - 00:12:25.126, Speaker B: Obviously, we do all precautions and this starts already when developing a smart contract with security considerations around how code is developed, documentation around it. Then obviously the audits where every new version is multiple times audited. Also, we did formal verification for the initial base contracts.
00:12:25.126 - 00:12:38.014, Speaker B: We now do it for every future update we do. Again, there's like a bug bounty of 1 million for critical bugs. Luckily, no one got it so far.
00:12:38.014 - 00:12:54.260, Speaker B: And yeah, we also have a honeypot safe. So whenever we do a new version, there's like a safe with tons of assets that I upgraded the first before we even have others or try to implement it in our solutions. For example.
00:12:54.260 - 00:13:26.880, Speaker B: There's many things we do, but I think the most critical part for security is still the lindy effect of the smart contract because every day that passes where the contract is not hacked and there's so much value on it, the better. I sleep at night because it's just this huge honeypot and I would say if it hasn't been hacked so far, the likelihood just decreases over time that there's really this big issue but you can never exclude it. But I sleep better now.
00:13:27.250 - 00:13:51.798, Speaker A: Well, that's good to know that it's not too active of a concern for you in terms of not being constantly worried about it because all those things do help. I do want to talk about centralization risk of now everything being because you kind of brought up the honeypot piece here. It is true the more amount of assets are there, the more attractive it is for somebody to now have an incentive to try to figure out a way to break it or go around it.
00:13:51.798 - 00:14:11.600, Speaker A: But security aside, do you feel like things are still aligned with the self custody and decentralization piece if everything feels like it's managed by the same code? Is that sort of against the value of centralization or decentralization? How do you kind of think about that?
00:14:12.770 - 00:14:45.654, Speaker B: It's a good question and also not a very linear answer as well because to some extent we are also trusting the protocol code. Like there's some aspect of centralization, like ethereum. If there's some issue on the protocol level we're also fucked in a sense there's that where a good kind of interpretation of centralization is also a standard.
00:14:45.654 - 00:15:09.258, Speaker B: Like if we get safe to be getting so much traction that we say might be even worth putting it on the protocol level because anyways, there's so much value already, or like this becomes a de facto standard, then that would have the benefit of if something breaks, then it's a break against the protocol. It's not a spark contract hack. And this would be able to be handled differently.
00:15:09.258 - 00:15:45.974, Speaker B: Not sure if we ever get there. That's one aspect and the other one is also decentralization could also mean fragmentation because I see a danger with account abstraction where suddenly there's a lot of teams looking into the benefits of smart accounts and a lot of wallets seeing how can we leverage that and provide better security and usability to users. The worst case scenario is if now every wallet is going to build their own smart account because one important property of web free accounts is that they're portable.
00:15:45.974 - 00:16:16.290, Speaker B: So you can create an account in MetaMask and then you can use the same account by ledger or by trust or any other wallet that you want. And this is for me also the power of web free where you're not tied to one solution. And there's this risk, I'm not sure how it's going to play out, but there's this risk that when we have too much fragmentation in smart accounts that then we lose this important property of knowing I can use the same account everywhere and the tooling build around it works for all accounts.
00:16:16.290 - 00:16:58.900, Speaker B: So I would actually advocate for. And that's what Safe is essentially building having a smart account standard as a modular kind of framework where all the wallets can build upon and can use the same secure core which is proven over time but is extensible and can allow wallets to build their own experiences with it, can build their own flavors of Safe. And then we balance this kind of value of having a standard, having a shared layer with the flexibility of still everyone being able to build their own solution on top of that.
00:16:59.670 - 00:17:29.530, Speaker A: This is interesting because my next question would have been do you kind of see yourself more as a product or a protocol? But it seems like you're leaning towards a protocol so it could be both. As I don't want to speak for you, but in what you just said, how is it broken down into these different layers that you're referring to? So Safe as the Safe core, that's just the asset custody piece and everything else is an extension around it or what's a better way of understanding how the protocol is structured?
00:17:30.770 - 00:17:58.086, Speaker B: Definitely, Safe started as a product, no question around this. The smart contracts were one thing that enabled the user interface to leverage multi signature and other features. But then we saw over time where our interface allowed to have certain interactions with the Safe smart account and use it to interact with tabs and such, but it couldn't be optimized for everyone's needs.
00:17:58.086 - 00:18:19.258, Speaker B: And then we had other teams, the first ones were actually Alex Vandersander built unilockin on Safe. And then we had coinshift and parcel as like treasury management solutions being built on Safe. And there were all these different solutions popping up that leverage the underlying smart contracts but built very optimized solutions on top.
00:18:19.258 - 00:18:49.320, Speaker B: And that's where we realized this is much more than just a product. It can be kind of the underlying custody protocol for all kinds of accounts out there. And that's where we started shifting from also pushing our own UI to becoming an ecosystem and figuring out ways how we can support other developers to build on Safe, to build their own smart wallets, to build treasure management solutions, different kinds of experiences on top.
00:18:49.320 - 00:19:29.220, Speaker B: And so we now launched earlier this year SafeCore, which is really the entirety of these developer tooling that we've built over the last years. So that's obviously the contracts, the protocol, and then some infrastructure like an indexer signature collection service that's needed for that and also some SDKs that allow you to take advantage of those. Since then it's clear that the future of Safe is going to be this infrastructure layer being this modular smart account and just supporting others to build on that.
00:19:29.830 - 00:20:07.466, Speaker A: This is super cool because it just also ties in with something you just said, which is around other wallets doing smart accounts or smart contract sort of based approaches to receiving addresses. Did you mean that originally from the context of without the standardization of SafeCore, everybody will have their own implementation and that's when you get inconsistencies across different chains? Or do you think there are other issues? Even if everybody switches from EOAS to a smart account, what's a good way of understanding that better? And how does that tie into what account abstraction is, as most people know it as of recently?
00:20:07.658 - 00:20:35.778, Speaker B: Yeah, it's maybe a good point to clarify also how we see account abstraction in general because it's a term that's thrown a lot in the last months and it's a too technical term because it doesn't mean too much for regular people. But the idea about account abstraction is that we have this big problem in the Web Three ecosystem where most accounts out there are just controlled by a private key. Like you have a seed phrase which controls all your assets on your wallet.
00:20:35.778 - 00:21:07.300, Speaker B: And this is extremely limiting because it's a very binary logic. You have the private key, you can do whatever you want on the account, you don't have the private key, you cannot access your funds or worst case, someone else has the private key and they have access. It's very clear that smart accounts, which is put that logic from the protocol layer to the smart contract layer, where you then have the programmability, everything you can program in solidity can have as the logic behind your account.
00:21:07.300 - 00:21:19.320, Speaker B: This enables so much more flexibility for developers to create more secure accounts, more flexible accounts that have different access control policies and such.
00:21:20.090 - 00:21:24.306, Speaker A: Can you give me a couple of examples of what kind of new features will be enabled with account abstraction?
00:21:24.418 - 00:22:05.746, Speaker B: Yeah, the traditional ones are like recovery systems. So what happens if you lose your private keys? Even if you have multiple private keys as a multisig, chances are that sometimes you might mad news, forget why you have them. And then smart accounts allow to have these fallback mechanisms where you can go, such as social recovery, where you maybe have a group of friends that can give you back access to your account or custodial recovery, where you have trusted third party, be it an insurance, notary bank whoever you trust that can give you access to your account.
00:22:05.746 - 00:22:29.434, Speaker B: And I think this is going to be quite important for mass adoption as well because most people are pretty scared of self custody and there's a few people out there that probably can do the OpSec and can handle keys and everything, that it's not a big problem. But for 99% of people it's super scary. Just saying if you don't have your keys anymore, all your money is gone.
00:22:29.434 - 00:22:59.238, Speaker B: So recovery is a huge thing. Others is sponsored transactions or in general abstracting gas away from the user. Because what you can do with smart accounts is that you have a relayer mechanism that takes a transaction that doesn't pay any transaction fees and the relayer pays for these transaction fees and then you just have maybe some agreement with this relayer or some mechanisms how they actually have the incentive to do so.
00:22:59.238 - 00:23:17.334, Speaker B: And this can enable use cases like Adapt, sponsoring all the transactions that interact with a certain protocol for the user. It enables use cases like not having to pay in the native currency of the blockchain, but in like a stable.
00:23:17.382 - 00:23:18.634, Speaker A: Coin, any token that you have.
00:23:18.672 - 00:23:45.250, Speaker B: For example, also very interesting what Gelato is doing there, where they call it one balance, where you have just one gas tank, can be USDC and then you can pay with that gas tank your transaction fees on any blockchain out there. And there's very nice to have gas abstraction use cases that can be done there. Other things are just new signature schemes.
00:23:45.250 - 00:23:59.882, Speaker B: So going to quantum secure signature schemes, hopefully at some point this requires the smart accounts to have this flexibility. But yeah, I think that's enough to.
00:23:59.936 - 00:24:21.120, Speaker A: Actually see the potential of like you basically get a whole way to interact with a transaction before it gets broadcasted. We've seen account abstraction become really pop in the last six to eight months. Most people know it as ERC 4337.
00:24:21.120 - 00:24:34.260, Speaker A: Does what Safe do for account abstraction. The same thing here? Are we talking about different standards? What's kind of the difference between what you have done or do right now versus what people know what account extraction is?
00:24:35.110 - 00:25:12.478, Speaker B: That's actually quite funny because so many people come to me also nadif global hackathons, and ask me, so now with 457 there's no need for Safe anymore, right? But it's actually quite the opposite because what 457 does is solve one aspect or one issue of account abstraction. So with smart accounts there can be any kind of validation logic, but still the transaction needs to be put on chain. And especially if it's not native account abstraction where the blockchain can accept these smart account transactions, you still need a relaying mechanism to do this.
00:25:12.478 - 00:25:40.470, Speaker B: And what 457 does is just have a specification and a standard around a decentralized relayer mechanisms that enable smart account transactions to be put on chain. So when there's like blog posts or Tweet threads about 457, they always go into detail like what 457 enables with recovery and sponsored transactions and all of that. But the logic of that is still in the smart account.
00:25:40.470 - 00:25:48.442, Speaker B: Like 457 solves the relaying part of it. Right? But these things need to be put together. Every 457 account is a smart account.
00:25:48.442 - 00:25:59.230, Speaker B: So Safe is 457 compatible with the latest version as well, meaning that ideally you use those two synergetically.
00:26:01.490 - 00:26:20.274, Speaker A: And that's helpful. I mean, that's a pretty big point that people need to consider because you're effectively enabling more smart accounts to function with all their full functionality. Another interesting thing you said, which I want to dive into, is you kind of mentioned that it started as a product and now it's more of a protocol.
00:26:20.274 - 00:26:39.500, Speaker A: You've kind of already broken down what the protocol is on different layers of the stack and how things interact with each other? How do you think about sustainability for the growth of Safe and future features or how you think about security as you kind of get bigger or accommodate for more feature requests? What does that world look like and what's kind of your lens on this.
00:26:42.430 - 00:27:30.554, Speaker B: Sustainability? I want Safe to be a project that's around in 50 years, 100 years and how can we achieve that? How can we have this ecosystem that's built around the Safe contracts be thriving and incentivized? And also here I want to make a strong point because if sustainability and these topics, usually the topic of fees comes up and I think what's really critical about Safe is I think there should not be any fees within the Safe Smart accounts itself. So no custody fees or transaction fees, even though a lot of people always say just do like a custody fee. That's how all custodians work.
00:27:30.554 - 00:27:42.154, Speaker B: That's huge potential there to fund the project into the future. But I think this is the wrong way to go. I see the Safe Smart account more as a library, as something open source.
00:27:42.154 - 00:28:06.658, Speaker B: Everyone can use it. It shouldn't have any modernization as part of that. But still, on top of this Smart account there will be like a thriving ecosystem of different stakeholders, of different participants that can range from developers building modules, which I mentioned before, this modularity of the Safe that add additional features to Safe.
00:28:06.658 - 00:28:29.246, Speaker B: It can range from entities providing infrastructure such as indexers or such and especially for modules. I think it's going to be interesting where most people trust the core of the Safe contract with the Lindy effect and everything.
00:28:29.348 - 00:28:30.654, Speaker A: You don't want to mess with that.
00:28:30.772 - 00:29:03.638, Speaker B: Pretty much everyone trusts that. But people don't really trust these plugins, these modules. So how can we incentivize the right parties to bring trust to these modules? How can we provide a protocol that gives security guarantees that incentivize people to look at these modules and give attestations that these are like proper bug free, maybe even have some insurance or some kind of bond behind it or some mechanisms that enable you to have peace of mind using these modules.
00:29:03.638 - 00:29:18.238, Speaker B: And I think this is going to be quite interesting way to keep this ecosystem sustainable by creating these incentives for the different parties involved there. Because it's auditors, it's maybe insurance providers, it's module developers that need to be.
00:29:18.324 - 00:29:51.782, Speaker A: This is an interesting point because you're saying that you want to have a mechanism for the safe ecosystem for these plugins, but without contradicting, or rather taking away the choice of these plugins to Monetize. Even if they chose to do a fee model for their own services. Is that kind of the goal where you kind of do it compatibly? Or is that the intent that I understand how it enables a more robust Safe system, safe plugin ecosystem.
00:29:51.782 - 00:30:03.006, Speaker A: But how does that help with the sustainability of safe because it's easy to understand these plugins help make the plugin sustainable because they have a business model now.
00:30:03.108 - 00:30:05.982, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have the perfect answer.
00:30:06.036 - 00:30:08.366, Speaker A: There, but that's why I was I.
00:30:08.388 - 00:30:47.210, Speaker B: Imagine that there should be a way for users to opt into this secure plugin ecosystem, where they also have the security that if something goes wrong with one of these plugins that there's some automated mechanisms that maybe disables the module or something like this and there's then entities or maybe the user is willing to pay for that. Maybe there's like insurance providers that are willing to provide a package around this that you say if something happens, actually someone else is covering for that. There's many kind of things we're thinking about.
00:30:47.210 - 00:30:59.280, Speaker B: I'm not sure we have the end solution right now, but I think we need to bring trust to these modules because otherwise every module has to start from scratch building up this trust themselves.
00:31:00.050 - 00:31:21.334, Speaker A: The ability to trust the core doesn't benefit anybody because now they have to think about added risk. So no, that's a really good point and I agree in terms of kind of obviously the spin out from also Safe to Safe is quite recent. You're figuring out what it means to kind of grow the community and how you want to think about all these things.
00:31:21.334 - 00:31:29.930, Speaker A: What is kind of your hopes for this ecosystem growth on top of Safe and how can people get involved in the Safe ecosystem?
00:31:34.160 - 00:31:55.360, Speaker B: Yeah, there's definitely the call to all DApps and wallets out there that come talk to us. We want to find ways how we can provide value to you, how safe smart accounts can be a solution. And you don't have to reinvent the wheel and build your own smart account, but maybe more for people that want to just contribute to the ecosystem.
00:31:55.360 - 00:32:17.828, Speaker B: We have a forum which allows you to participate in discussions and governance where this ecosystem is going. But also there's a grants program coming up and what's important there, we don't just want to fund builders building on top of Safe. That's one aspect, one of our three pillars.
00:32:17.828 - 00:32:27.500, Speaker B: But also we want to support people that help us with educating people about the capabilities of smart accounts and general account abstraction.
00:32:28.560 - 00:32:34.128, Speaker A: What are the three pillars you mentioned? There are a few pillars for the grants, specifically for the grants program.
00:32:34.214 - 00:32:55.168, Speaker B: The free ones are build, educate and research. So building obviously for developers, educate more for the marketers out there and research. Then there's a lot of still unsolved issues around smarter cons like 457 partially solved the relaying part, but there's hundreds of other issues that we need to solve.
00:32:55.168 - 00:33:17.836, Speaker B: One particular one is maybe how do smart accounts interact in a MultiChain landscape. Because each of these accounts is a deployed contract on a new chain that creates issues with state being different between these accounts or the addresses potentially being different, which people are used. To their MetaMask account stays same as.
00:33:17.858 - 00:33:19.496, Speaker A: Long as you have the private everywhere.
00:33:19.688 - 00:33:31.280, Speaker B: So that's one thing which definitely we should do some research on. But yeah, again build, educate, research. If you want to contribute in any of these ways, look out for this grants program.
00:33:31.430 - 00:33:40.070, Speaker A: Awesome. My last question to you before we end this. What would you like to see people build on top of Safe that you haven't seen yet?
00:33:44.960 - 00:34:15.270, Speaker B: One for sure is more retail solutions because we need to get rid of this stigma of Safe just being a dow tooling, just being team solution. And there's some solutions out there like nest wallet, like linen wallet, even like World app that targeting more retail individual users. These things will have much more potential probably in the future because the awareness is not there yet too much so there is more growth happening.
00:34:15.270 - 00:34:48.588, Speaker B: And then maybe more specifically when we look at Safe being this modular smart account framework, one of the type of modules you can build, there are guards, these are like hooks that each transaction goes through and checks certain requirements. So can be like allow denialist where you say my account can only interact with these types of contracts. But it can also be something like security checks, you can build the risk.
00:34:48.684 - 00:34:54.220, Speaker A: Checks that talk to things outside the chain. Outside off chain?
00:34:54.300 - 00:35:13.556, Speaker B: Yes, off chain. Like you can have an off chain risk assessment solution that then puts on chain at the stations and says this transaction, it's good, good to go, this is maybe double check it or have another kind of confirmation from the user to put it through. And this obviously a scam block this transaction.
00:35:13.556 - 00:35:34.716, Speaker B: You can do very cool things around that then maybe finally around recovery. I think people always when they hear recovery and maybe this also vitalik is a big fan of social recovery and is pushing this notion of how we end up recovering our accounts. But I think this is going to be one of many solutions.
00:35:34.716 - 00:36:01.556, Speaker B: So think about novel ways to recover your account, whether that's some cool things you could do is like you have multisigs or you have multiple keys, multiple devices that control your account. But over time if there's no interaction with the account, the threshold goes down. So if you lose maybe a few of your keys and you cannot get the threshold anymore, after a month you can get it again or like it kind of gives you this fault.
00:36:01.588 - 00:36:02.596, Speaker A: Really interesting concept.
00:36:02.628 - 00:36:05.850, Speaker B: Yeah, you can do so many cool things around recovery there.
00:36:07.740 - 00:36:18.230, Speaker A: Awesome. Well Lucas, thank you so much for this amazing chat and hopefully we get to see how we can make custody even simpler and better for everybody else in this space. Thank you.
