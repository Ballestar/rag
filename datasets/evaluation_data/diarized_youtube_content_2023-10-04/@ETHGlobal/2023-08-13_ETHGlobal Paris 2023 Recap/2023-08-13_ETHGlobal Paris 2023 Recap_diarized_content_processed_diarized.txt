00:00:02.890 - 00:00:06.510, Speaker A: Is everything electric when you actually enter the hackathon?
00:00:06.930 - 00:00:10.720, Speaker B: Paris is one of my favorite cities, so it's a great match.
00:00:11.330 - 00:00:14.234, Speaker C: This is just one of my favorite events. Crypto.
00:00:14.282 - 00:00:15.774, Speaker A: The hackathon is amazing.
00:00:15.892 - 00:00:19.722, Speaker D: It's my first time in an IRL hackathon here in Global.
00:00:19.786 - 00:00:21.630, Speaker E: Welcome to East Global Paris.
00:00:25.210 - 00:00:26.866, Speaker F: I think the venue is insane pale.
00:00:26.898 - 00:00:31.794, Speaker E: Bonia, really historical venue with lots of history regarding economies.
00:00:31.842 - 00:00:38.726, Speaker B: My definition of a hackathon is like exploration gaming and trying to prototype out that you can present to the people.
00:00:38.908 - 00:00:48.074, Speaker E: Hackers are pretty outgoing here and they engage and actually exchange ideas and try to work together. So it's a pretty amazing event.
00:00:48.192 - 00:00:54.106, Speaker B: There is a lot of things to do, a lot of talk to have also with people that live here since a long of time in this ecosystem.
00:00:54.138 - 00:00:58.190, Speaker G: So I really like these events and this week particularly.
00:00:58.770 - 00:01:14.580, Speaker B: My advice for first time hackers is to just enjoy learning. This is the best place that they can have to learn about so many different technologies, there's so many different people trying to support you in your process of learning and in the process of building.
00:01:15.910 - 00:01:23.110, Speaker H: The people who are here at the hackathons from these companies are here to help you. My job is developer relations. I am here to help.
00:01:23.110 - 00:01:31.322, Speaker H: If you have questions, come by the booth, ask in the discord. We just want to make sure that you have a great time. You feel like you're growing and learning a lot and that you build something cool.
00:01:31.376 - 00:01:33.210, Speaker B: Everyone is really, really friendly.
00:01:33.550 - 00:01:42.886, Speaker F: Make a connection to the sponsors, make connection to teams which are sitting with you because you don't ever know who will be the founder of the next unicorn tomorrow.
00:01:43.078 - 00:02:01.570, Speaker D: You have so little time to build like the MVP of the product and at the same time to pitch it to the churches. So it's quite exciting but at the same time it's so interesting when you're building something as quick as possible with the community. So yeah, been an awesome experience.
00:02:01.720 - 00:02:10.870, Speaker A: Everyone wants to build something actually new and that works for everyone. So it's really nice to see all of this energy from everyone.
00:02:11.020 - 00:02:30.618, Speaker G: Everyone is trying to find a way to integrate something into something and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. But I feel like in the ethereum community people are driven by a mindset, by a goal, by a vision, by a certain idea of a future or a potential future. And this is what makes this community so beautiful.
00:02:30.704 - 00:02:42.366, Speaker C: So it's just a way to meet new people, explore new ideas and build really cool things. And then sometimes what comes out of it is people get really excited about pursuing it. So I've actually also talked to a number of people that just want to keep building on it.
00:02:42.366 - 00:02:45.698, Speaker C: So it's a really great starting point for building in the space.
00:02:45.784 - 00:03:16.650, Speaker E: So what I'm looking for, a project when I'm judging is a combination of factors it can be the quality of the code that they've been writing. The best practices followed while hacking, but also the UX for users and how polished the UI is for the first time user that doesn't know what the project is about. And also the presentation that they gave when pitching the project just to understand in depth what problem they tried to solve and how they addressed it with the technology they had developed.
00:03:19.550 - 00:03:25.770, Speaker G: The hackathon is, as always, incredible. It's not the first. It global hackathon that I'm attending.
00:03:25.770 - 00:03:47.606, Speaker G: And every time I'm thinking, wow, that's perfect, I cannot see it becoming better. And every time, I'm again and again surprised by how well organized everything is, by the locations that are chosen by the team and the communication and the prices and, yeah, every time it gets better and better, and it's incredible. I can't wait to go to the next one.
00:03:47.708 - 00:04:08.454, Speaker I: This community has built some of the most compelling and important infrastructure for humanity broadly. And now that all these primitives are here, you, as builders, get to shape the next big thing, the next important set of components. So it's really up to you.
00:04:08.454 - 00:04:15.920, Speaker I: It's really up to what you want to build it and what you make and what you scale that will define the future. So go make it a good one.
