00:00:07.210 - 00:00:17.678, Speaker A: Hey guys, my name is Jack. I am head of crypto at a payment company called unlimited. And today I'll be going over a little bit of the history of Onram since 2015 until now.
00:00:17.678 - 00:00:33.830, Speaker A: And also I'll tell you a bit more about what we're doing in terms of building a Gen three on and off ramp. The reason why I think not lot of people are going to be here today is because we didn't get the bounty sponsored in time. So usually people come to these things in order to learn more about the API.
00:00:33.830 - 00:00:41.606, Speaker A: But we joined ETH Global late. But it's all good. I still think that we're a really good counterparty to work with.
00:00:41.606 - 00:00:53.734, Speaker A: So I've been in the space myself for the past nine, you know, come to talk to me afterwards if you guys need any help with payments or banking. But yeah, let me just go through this. So unlimited.
00:00:53.734 - 00:01:04.318, Speaker A: As I mentioned is an OG OG Payment company. We are a principal member of Visa and Mastercard and JCB and Union pay and amex and Discover. And also we have our own Swift code because we're principal member Swift as well.
00:01:04.318 - 00:01:43.158, Speaker A: You can think of payment companies as kind of like node providers into web two payment networks because just how like Inferior or Alchemy allows you to read and write into Ethereum or any EVMs a payment company that is a principal member of Visa or Master or being an acquirer and a processor, we basically have read and write access directly into VisaNet. You can think of the VisaNet mempool as a place where the acquirers gets to put in payment requests to the issuers and they'll just give more analytics while it's in this mempool. So that's what a payment company does.
00:01:43.158 - 00:01:59.874, Speaker A: I mean, there's many different types of payment companies. Point being that as an acquirer we're directly at the source, right? It's like the difference between infuria versus gelato or Morales. One is a node infrastructure provider, the other is a higher order API for doing something on top.
00:01:59.874 - 00:02:23.126, Speaker A: So we are more like an Infuria in that sense as like a web two node provider both. And now we are launching an onramp on top of our payment company, the payment stack that we already built up. So imagine if Stripe or Worldpay or checkout launched like MoonPay or Transact or Ramp.
00:02:23.126 - 00:02:43.966, Speaker A: That's what's happening. We have this next generation Fiat on and off Ram that we're building on top of our own payment stack. There's a lot of efficiency gains when you do that because as an acquirer, you already get basically the Best Buy rates and the best bank FX rates, which are savings that we pass on to the users.
00:02:43.966 - 00:03:10.402, Speaker A: So imagine if a user went from let's say BRL to ETH and you're using the merchant record that is Transact or MoonPay that is based in Europe. Well, every time that MoonPay receives a merchant settlement, they'll receive it from BRL to Euro first before they convert the Euro to ETH, right? So it's not about the transaction fee of like 2.9% plus $0.30.
00:03:10.402 - 00:03:20.678, Speaker A: It's about the fact that there's a hidden FX cost in the fiat to fiat and the fiat to crypto conversion that then is put into the spread that is passed down to the user.
00:03:20.774 - 00:03:21.082, Speaker B: Right?
00:03:21.136 - 00:03:37.230, Speaker A: So here we don't have that because we're an acquirer. We basically get bank rates like five bips, ten Bips, as opposed to 300 bips for our cross border FX settlements. These are all savings that we then pass on to the user in the form of better fees.
00:03:37.230 - 00:03:55.062, Speaker A: And as I mentioned at first, as an acquirer, you get to read and write directly into Visa, which means you have better analytics for controlling conversion rates. So you have good conversion rates along with lower fees and just wider coverage. Anyways, that was a little bit about myself and the company, the parent company.
00:03:55.062 - 00:04:21.278, Speaker A: But let's go through today the history of Onramps, as I mentioned, right, where you have Gen One, Gen Two and Gen Three, and what the current kind of typology looks like. So at gen one, we have simplex Back in the days, there was only Simplex and then Gen Two around, like when DFI was born in 2018, we had Wire, MoonPay, Transact, Ramp, and some other local ones. And then over the past couple of years, things have been changing really quickly.
00:04:21.278 - 00:04:52.940, Speaker A: Unfortunately, instead of having, like, a fiat dow with a standard API that allows every onramp to adhere to this API standard, everyone kind of started competing and therefore fighting for the same market share within the space as opposed to having a standard API that allows people, every developer to then just it's like saying if you're using Alchemy or Infuria, you're still using the same RPC API, just changing providers. You don't have that in On Ram space. So I'll go through a little bit about what's going on in the Gen Three or the current landscape for what should happen next.
00:04:52.940 - 00:05:16.438, Speaker A: So here's a form, a long form from Simplex. This is actually from 2023, and that just tells you kind of how much things haven't improved. You see, this very long form UX is kind of clunky, right? I was trying to find a screenshot from 2015 through like, Exodus wallet and BRD wallet, but they don't have it anymore.
00:05:16.438 - 00:05:32.310, Speaker A: They turned it off. Or BRD wallet got bought by Coinbase, and I can't find like a 2015 version of this. But imagine like a longer form that is basically not embeddable and it's completely off chain because you have to copy paste your own address.
00:05:32.310 - 00:05:49.450, Speaker A: There's no wallet sign in, there's no wallet connect. But at the time, it was literally the only option. So let's give them some credit for being the pioneers here in terms of a company that enabled on ramping in 2015, even pre Ethereum.
00:05:49.450 - 00:06:10.690, Speaker A: But there was just a lot of problems, obviously at that time with high fees, super low conversions, huge problems, fraud. At the end of the day, they had to bow down of the race because they could not compete with newer RMS at the gen two level. So they sold to another company called Nuve, which is like a Canadian payment company that bought Simplex.
00:06:10.690 - 00:06:20.054, Speaker A: And yeah, so that's kind of gen one. I would say probably 2014 to 2017 the only option available. There were some other regional ones like BTC Direct that's been around.
00:06:20.054 - 00:06:34.842, Speaker A: But in terms of the B to C model, I would say that Simplex was kind of the pioneer there in what we define as on ramps today. And then around 2018, you had Wire come in. They raised like a series A.
00:06:34.842 - 00:07:01.358, Speaker A: I was first employee at Wire, and we were doing a lot of other stuff before this. We were doing like OTC trading and cross border payments using crypto as a rail. But when DFI was born, we realized that, hey, why don't we take our licenses that we have in the US with money services business or money transmission license, and let's offer that into the DeFi ecosystem with non custodial wallets and DApps to allow users to on and off ramp.
00:07:01.358 - 00:07:32.310, Speaker A: So we kind of like repackaged what we did. Because if you think of what cross border payments using crypto or rail is, it's just like USD to USDC and the USDC to local currency that's like an RM and offram together, right? So if you separate it and you say, okay, well, instead of doing an end to end flow of, like, USD to BTC and BTC to BRL, let's just offer both as like, one is an on ram and one is an off ram. So we kind of repackaged and restructured the company to become an on and off ramp for DFI.
00:07:32.310 - 00:07:37.834, Speaker A: It was very exciting time. At that time, we did have an embeddable widget. We were the first to work with maker.
00:07:37.834 - 00:07:57.140, Speaker A: This was like literally August 2018 when the USD to die rails were turned on. Imagine that, right? We're talking about the first year of DFI. And this was like pre uniswap days in 2018, and we already had USD to die, which was phenomenal, I think.
00:07:57.140 - 00:08:16.218, Speaker A: And we had Apple Pay, if you guys ever use Rainbow Wallets, and Rainbow Wallet has like an Apple Pay checkout feature where it's not like an embeddable widget at all. It's completely white label and literally two clicks and you're done. I still think that's the best flow, even though for some compliance issues, you can actually do that.
00:08:16.218 - 00:08:23.734, Speaker A: But we were breaking things at the time in 2019. Still, there was some problems. Once again, due to compliance.
00:08:23.734 - 00:08:33.250, Speaker A: We didn't know if we can do DFI, for example, fiat to a meta transaction so that you can stake into compound. At the time, we didn't think we can do that. It's like a us.
00:08:33.250 - 00:08:45.026, Speaker A: Money services now, simplex is dead, wire is dead. And you kind of move on to Transact. Transact, I have a lot of respect for what they do.
00:08:45.026 - 00:08:58.120, Speaker A: It's a developer first company that just has really good tooling and they're all devs before they're payment people. And they did build out all the metatransaction stuff. So you can go from fiat to anything.
00:08:58.120 - 00:09:31.230, Speaker A: Literally, user pays in fiat, it goes to Transact hot wallets and then there's like an approved and allowed with a function that basically interacts with any other contract through like a forwarding address that decouples the sender's address from the user's address. So you can it's almost like a Paymaster that allows you to pay on behalf of a user with the ETH that Transact purchases with the user's fiat to then forward it over to the user's wallet. In terms of like a Staking like LP token.
00:09:31.230 - 00:09:42.114, Speaker A: It was ahead of his days. I think in terms of this being done, there's easier ways to do this if we can adopt account abstraction, obviously. But this is all pre account abstraction.
00:09:42.114 - 00:10:06.030, Speaker A: So the medicine is actually stuff was really cool. They were able to add more payment methods as well, working with local payment companies to add more payment methods. But still, I think there was huge issues there because at the end of the day, so far, every single onram has very similar issues in that they are a crypto startup that got into the space.
00:10:06.030 - 00:10:13.242, Speaker A: Very awesome people, every single one of them. But they're not a payment company. So they had to pay higher fees.
00:10:13.242 - 00:10:26.578, Speaker A: They weren't in control of conversions because they received back some read access from the payment company, but they don't really know why. They have no way of analyzing that data beyond they couldn't really fight it.
00:10:26.584 - 00:10:26.706, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:26.728 - 00:10:44.314, Speaker A: So there's ways to fight fraud on the client side, but if you don't have control over the server side because you don't read and write directly into Visa, then you're kind of fighting with one arm behind your back. Yeah. So moving on from the second generation to kind of where we are today, there's a lot of cool stuff.
00:10:44.314 - 00:10:45.338, Speaker A: This is Moon pay right here.
00:10:45.344 - 00:10:45.466, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:45.488 - 00:11:05.950, Speaker A: So Moonpei also iterated a bit more they got a lot of money from the VCs, which arguably kind of screwed the industry because you kind of give them $500 million and they are now trying to become the only one. But that's not how Web Three works, right? Like Web Two is like, oh yeah, let's back the winner. Winner takes all.
00:11:05.950 - 00:11:25.046, Speaker A: Web Three is like, no, we all should collaborate. We should create like a fiat Dow that has local R Rams all across the world as like distributed nodes that can make sure they take care of those countries very well. So I have my beef, I guess, with these Web Two VCs that gives money to Web Three companies and influence how they think.
00:11:25.046 - 00:11:30.810, Speaker A: Now they kind of steal every noncustodial Wallace users by launching their own direct facing app.
00:11:30.880 - 00:11:31.162, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:31.216 - 00:11:43.566, Speaker A: User facing application. So retail application. And yeah, I'm not sure if that's good for the space to do that, but yeah, for what it's worth, they executed very well.
00:11:43.566 - 00:12:13.560, Speaker A: Well deserved, round, and also part of this kind of gen two on ramps between 2018 to 2021, introducing new elements like NFC checkouts, super well funded, obviously pretty strong counterparty in that sense. They're not going to die, I don't think. It's not like Sample or Wire or even Transact arguably only raised 20 mil when they should have raised 50, at least.
00:12:13.560 - 00:12:28.262, Speaker A: Not as strong of a counterparty when you think relying on a partner and provider for the long run, prime Trust died as well. Yeah. So I think MoonPay, for what it's worth, is a strong counterparty.
00:12:28.262 - 00:12:55.646, Speaker A: But they do steal your users and they force exclusivity and at least from what I hear, the support is not very good. And then these other kind of like niche on ramps that are like NFT only, but are super tech first, once again, almost like Transact in 2019, but on the NFT side and just like offering a really awesome UX and easy developer experience. And I think this was very monumental.
00:12:55.646 - 00:13:05.366, Speaker A: This happened like two days ago where Third Web bought paper, right. I think that's super good for the space. You can say that.
00:13:05.366 - 00:13:18.394, Speaker A: Oh, from my own perspective as another onramp, why would I say that's good? Because aren't they competing against me? It's like, no they're not. This is good for the space period. We're not competing, we're trying to go after other users in the world.
00:13:18.394 - 00:13:48.114, Speaker A: If you're only fighting after the current block of users, where there's so much rehypothecation happening, founders making money and stop gigabraining themselves into building new stuff, it's super incestuous and it's a super small fringe space. Do you really want crypto to stay fringe where everyone is just fighting over the same users? Or are you here to change the world and make an impact and actually onboard new users from the world outside of this fringe, like 5% of users, that is us.
00:13:48.152 - 00:13:48.402, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:48.456 - 00:13:56.306, Speaker A: I think there's only 500,000 wallets right now. They're actually active in spite of like MetaMask claiming 30 million wallets. That's like maybe the amount of wallets that's generated.
00:13:56.306 - 00:14:00.634, Speaker A: But in terms of actual users, there's probably only 500,000 or less of us.
00:14:00.752 - 00:14:01.082, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:01.136 - 00:14:27.314, Speaker A: So how do you actually onboard new users? Well, I think Third Web is doing God's work and that they made it super easy from a developer standpoint, everything is now end to end, from standardized smart contracts, to the deployment of It, to the whole checkout process, to the social login wallets. So, yeah, I have a lot of respect for Third Web buying paper. My marketing team made this a little bit wrong.
00:14:27.314 - 00:15:02.966, Speaker A: What I wanted to show here was kind of like the aggregators on one side and then the exchanges and acquirers on top and then the middlemen first movers in the middle and the local ramps and dish ramps in the bottom, right? And what that is trying to show is to say that the current landscape of Onramps is such that it is so fragmented and we can think of it as like top, middle, bottom in the sense that you have. A bunch of super big companies such as Coinbase, Pay and Binance Connect that are launching their own Rams or PayPal and Stripe. And unlimited is not big, but it's still an acquirer.
00:15:02.998 - 00:15:03.158, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:03.184 - 00:15:15.978, Speaker A: It's like the difference between Inferior and Chain stack. Like Inferior does 10 billion API calls a day, like Chainstack does like 1 billion. But Inferior has like ten network connectivities, chain stack has 25.
00:15:15.978 - 00:15:40.322, Speaker A: So as an acquirer, we have a lot of network connectivity, but we're not obviously as big as like Stripe or PayPal. But point being that you have a bunch of payment companies coming into the space that is launching an on ramp such as Stripe, on ramp such as Simplex, with Nubay, such as Unlimited Crypto, and then you have exchanges that's diversifying their portfolio of businesses. They might have an exchange account, but they also have prime and Custody.
00:15:40.322 - 00:16:04.254, Speaker A: They now have an on ramp where you can log into your Coinbase account in order to on ramp. So it's the same kind of B, two B to C SDK that's at the top now. So super well capitalized teams that are exchanges and acquirers on top and then you have your middlemen first movers that got into the game four or five years ago, such as MoonPay, Transact and Ramp that I would say Ramp executed the best.
00:16:04.254 - 00:16:15.726, Speaker A: MoonPay closed second best, but played the VC game very well to raise a lot of money. Trezak, I have a lot of respect, but once again they should have probably raised more. So those are the middlemen.
00:16:15.726 - 00:16:27.190, Speaker A: I don't think they have any more advantage going forward. I think they're all going to get squeezed out in theory because once again, they're not an inquirer. So they don't read and write directly into Visa Master.
00:16:27.190 - 00:16:38.150, Speaker A: They're not super well capitalized. Like MoonPay is burning money again. And it's not about the money, it's not about how much they raise, it's about their positioning, right? They're as middlemen.
00:16:38.150 - 00:17:00.302, Speaker A: They're not a bank, they're not an acquirer. And they really only have a good tech stack that allowed them to integrate with a lot of other DApps initially, because they got into initially, but their positioning, I think, will become weaker and weaker over time. Relatively even weaker than the local Rams.
00:17:00.302 - 00:17:05.250, Speaker A: Because if you think of what a local R ram does, they only serve that country.
00:17:05.320 - 00:17:05.506, Speaker B: Right?
00:17:05.528 - 00:17:12.550, Speaker A: Like Lupipay, they're just in Brazil, they only do picks. They may only have like a team of like 15. Unisop only has a team of 30.
00:17:12.550 - 00:17:25.686, Speaker A: So you only stay a small team of 30. You don't try to scale to like a team of 550. You don't increase your burn rate, you just operate a team of 15 to 30 and all you do is just that regional on ramp.
00:17:25.686 - 00:17:45.914, Speaker A: In that one country. It could be Alchemy pay in APAC, it could be Loopy pay in Brazil, it could be whatever regional on ramp. I'm advising a couple of African on ramps to help them to think through that on how to become like a strong node, right? You can think of this as like social layer nodes because it's a physical jurisdiction, because they have to follow regulation locally.
00:17:45.914 - 00:18:11.958, Speaker A: So it's almost like a distributed social layer node for maintaining these on and off rams locally. And I actually think that that's the best foot forward. There's so many applications there know for FX, for example, if the FX has all these different stablecoin issuers locally that use on and off ramps locally, then you can technically replace a trillion dollar industry with how cross border payments work and how much I think it's like $20 trillion per year.
00:18:11.958 - 00:18:31.082, Speaker A: It's moved across borders, right? And that's always been the dream, but it's never happened. Whether with Ripple or Stellar or what Wire tried to do in the early days with cross border payments, using Bitcoin as a rail. And what people are trying to do today with USDC, combining USDC with on ramps and off ramps locally, it just hasn't worked for a lot of different reasons.
00:18:31.082 - 00:19:15.422, Speaker A: Mainly because there's a double transaction fee and a double FX, right? So if you're paying like 2.9% to onramp and 2.9% to off ramp and you're paying some bips for the USDC to us or USD to USDC and the USDC back to BRL, why would you pay double FX with double transaction fee when you can actually go to a bank like TransferWise or Wise and use less than 1% fees there? Because you can get buy rates, once again, one to five basis points, right? But if you do have stablecoin issuers working with local on and off rams and they're able to both together bring the cost down, basically converting stable coins at one to one and having very low transaction fees, then it does make sense to build such an international venmo soon.
00:19:15.422 - 00:19:43.574, Speaker A: So I'm personally more bullish on local rams doing this and the niche rams too. I think from a developer first standpoint, as long as they stay small and more lean in terms of being a developer first and not undertake all of this regulated payment infrastructure, then great. You're more like a hard hat and a truffle as opposed to like a coinbase and binance, right? So there's space for that too.
00:19:43.574 - 00:19:57.498, Speaker A: And then the aggregators, right? So it's like Exchange acquire, middleman and then local ramp and niche ramps, right? Three layers. And then the aggregator that can take care of all of that. There's value in that.
00:19:57.498 - 00:20:05.134, Speaker A: There's new teams. I didn't put Poco app on here poco is like a team out of YC that recently launched an aggregator. They're really good too.
00:20:05.134 - 00:20:13.634, Speaker A: Onramper is the OG Meld race last year. Pretty good team, I think. They're like from Square Cash and some other web.
00:20:13.634 - 00:20:24.420, Speaker A: Two payment companies. They understand aggregation very well, but Poco is like, really cool too. That's kind of where the landscape is today.
00:20:24.420 - 00:20:37.826, Speaker A: I'm happy to be disagreed with. Definitely come afterward to tell me I'm wrong. Always love to learn, but yeah, so that's kind of where we are today as far as landscape.
00:20:37.826 - 00:20:41.610, Speaker A: I just want to go over a little bit about us again in the context of what we want to build next.
00:20:41.680 - 00:20:41.914, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:41.952 - 00:21:13.938, Speaker A: We're building a next generation Fiat. Onram, I'm taking all my failures at Wire and trying to apply it here at, you know, as a principal member of Visa Master, we definitely have a really good position to do this. You know, some of the things I want to do has more to do with avoiding double sign in, avoiding double KYC because when you have because if you think of what happens with every onram, it's like they all have this email sign in.
00:21:13.938 - 00:21:23.046, Speaker A: And then they all make you do like a KYC. And then they all put you through this form where you have to fetch the quote and put in the source amount, desk amount.
00:21:23.148 - 00:21:23.558, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:23.644 - 00:21:42.346, Speaker A: A lot of that is redundant because if I'm already signed into Web Three Auth or like Magic Link or any other social login, why do I have to sign into the ramp again? That's literally not needed. Or if I'm already signed into my wallet, why can't I already sign in with Ethereum? Basically, why do I have to authenticate into this other app?
00:21:42.448 - 00:21:42.762, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:42.816 - 00:21:46.730, Speaker A: It's almost like an app once again. But it shouldn't be an app. It should be embedded, it should be abstracted.
00:21:46.730 - 00:21:54.982, Speaker A: So that's one module I want to work on in this near future. As head of crypto here, I want to avoid double sign in. Another thing is, like, double KYC.
00:21:54.982 - 00:22:00.734, Speaker A: A lot of apps have KYC already. They're using with Persona, they're using with Sumsup.
00:22:00.782 - 00:22:01.090, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:01.160 - 00:22:05.800, Speaker A: Sumsup has an API for reshare KYC. Banksub did this. It was very awesome build.
00:22:05.800 - 00:22:32.598, Speaker A: If I'm able to basically say, let's have like a multi KYC provider architecture where I can intake like, ten different KYC providers, but the schema still falls under my own compliance regime to make sure that I hold the PII of the end user and it still satisfies my compliance requirements, then great. Then I'm happy to use my partner's KYC vendor as my own KYC vendor.
00:22:32.694 - 00:22:33.340, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:33.970 - 00:22:44.810, Speaker A: And now you can think about the UI where it's like, okay, cool. There's no more sign in page, there's no more KYC page. And you're abstracting away these pages more and more for a better UX.
00:22:44.810 - 00:22:55.326, Speaker A: You do like a fetch quote API instead of like a fetch quote UI. And everything is now gone and all you land on is like a stripe, like payment form. That's kind of the goal.
00:22:55.326 - 00:23:12.282, Speaker A: It's like the fine line between a fully white labelable API versus like an abstractable widget. And that's the line that I'm trying to find for or trying to define for onomic cryptos on an off ramp. I have a quick demo to give of where things are right now, but I think I'm out of time.
00:23:12.282 - 00:23:25.326, Speaker A: Right, so we're maybe two minutes and we can take some questions, I guess. But if you just take a look at this, this is what I mean. Authentication right now is just email four six digit code.
00:23:25.326 - 00:23:34.446, Speaker A: It's BS. I hate it. We're going to replace that with like a multi sign in process, like web three author magic link so that you can avoid double sign in.
00:23:34.446 - 00:23:38.740, Speaker A: Payment methods are already in there. So this is what I mean. I got to slow this down.
00:23:38.740 - 00:24:16.746, Speaker A: Once the authentication page is done, if we're able to save the card token and the user can sign into the payment method, then this is all it should be, is you should just land on the payment form because the KYC is done in the backend, right? This is abstracted away. You didn't see this because it's not there. You went from Auth directly into the payment form, which is literally the easiest flow that you can do because here what happened was the KYC is abstracted because we received it from the partner who sent a KYC token from the provider.
00:24:16.746 - 00:24:27.290, Speaker A: From the KYC provider, right? So that now all you do is land on the confirmation page in the payment form and you're able to finish a purchase flow in 40 seconds.
00:24:27.450 - 00:24:28.206, Speaker B: Right?
00:24:28.388 - 00:24:31.714, Speaker A: And that's what we want to do. We don't want to be in the mix, we just want to get in and get out.
00:24:31.752 - 00:24:31.906, Speaker B: Right?
00:24:31.928 - 00:24:43.814, Speaker A: Like user generates wallets, we help them to fund the wallets. We do the performance, the fraud checks and all that. Three DS two or any other fraud checks that we do on our own back end and you're done.
00:24:43.814 - 00:24:56.554, Speaker A: You can finish the whole flow in literally 40 seconds, right? That's the goal at least. And I think I am done. So happy to take some questions.
00:24:56.554 - 00:24:57.820, Speaker A: See you.
00:25:02.050 - 00:25:05.760, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead. Hi.
00:25:06.450 - 00:25:36.914, Speaker A: How would you relate to this new Gnosis Pay solution? Yeah, for sure. I love gnosis pay. What Gnosis Pay did was they basically took their account abstraction stuff that they have, along with a partner called Monarium, which has like a stable coin called Euroe, right? And then you can basically convert anything, the multi signal approvals and you can convert anything to Euroe.
00:25:36.914 - 00:25:49.322, Speaker A: And then that Euroe becomes euro. And then now you can use that euro on a card. You can think of that as almost like an off ramp, right? Because you're going from crypto to fiat, but you're not off ramping to any bank account around the world.
00:25:49.322 - 00:26:01.022, Speaker A: You're not off ramping to any e wallet or even cash, you're off ramping to a very specific branded card that can only be issued to residents of Europe. It's still valuable. I still think it's a great product.
00:26:01.022 - 00:26:06.818, Speaker A: I think the fact that they are offering it as a service in terms of letting other teams use it is really great.
00:26:06.904 - 00:26:07.298, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:07.384 - 00:26:30.818, Speaker A: Once again, this is the difference between using like Alchemy and Inferior versus Shilotto and Morales. Because if you wanted to, you can go to someone like us who is a pure play Web Two payment company that is an e money institution in Europe, and you can say, hey, alchemy of Web Two, can I get this card issuance that we have a banking and service API. We're able to give you that Fiat only system raw.
00:26:30.914 - 00:26:31.222, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:31.276 - 00:26:45.790, Speaker A: Or if you say, hey, I want to just use Gelato, I don't care about that. I don't want to deal with Fiat systems at all. I just want to only have this developer tooling, then yeah, you would go to Gnosis Pay and just use them to issue any brand of cards.
00:26:45.790 - 00:27:23.344, Speaker A: Well, first of all, thank you for the very informative talk. I just wanted to ask, how do you see the path towards offramp as well as like the asymmetric step here? Because it is a little bit more complicated and sometimes it involves more hurdles. Yeah, I think first and foremost, you need people on the ground in every one of these countries who can work with the local regulators and local partners to just get that Web Two node set up first.
00:27:23.344 - 00:27:46.056, Speaker A: And that's part of the reason why I'm here. I've been in the crypto native space for the past nine years. I decided to come across the chasm into Web Two because in order to win this war, there's two ways to fight this war, right? You fight on the crypto anarchy side, stay in the crypto native space, or you can Trojan Horse in and become like a general and just make sure that the war is going the other side's way.
00:27:46.056 - 00:28:14.400, Speaker A: So I'm putting that on camera, but whatever, I'm not suicidal. But point being that I think those kind of partnerships are important, right? You have to have local payment service providers and banks sponsored banks working with you. First and foremost, once you have that and you know that you can scale to let's say, like $100 million per day in volume and you won't get flagged, that means that that node will run with like five nights.
00:28:14.400 - 00:28:20.788, Speaker A: It won't go down. That's the first thing. I think all the on chain stuff is actually fairly simple.
00:28:20.788 - 00:28:37.208, Speaker A: There's actually so much enterprise level tooling now to use like a one inch API to swap to anything. You can use Leafy and Bridge, anything. Everything comes back to a stablecoin and then use local stablecoin issuers, whether it's Circle, whether it's straight FX, go to DFX Finance and.
00:28:37.208 - 00:29:12.096, Speaker A: Just talk to those guys and they can help with a lot of I mean, the off ramping piece is first and foremost anything back to stablecoin and then stablecoin to that local currency, right? And so I think the on chain modules and the on chain tooling is already there. What's not there are people, I guess, like me, that's crossing the chasm to make sure that you can take care of teams from top down so that those rails are stable. Those nodes, those web two nodes are live for years to come instead of falling one by one.
00:29:12.096 - 00:29:13.500, Speaker A: Like prime trust. Like wire.
00:29:13.580 - 00:29:14.064, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:14.182 - 00:29:14.850, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:15.580 - 00:29:16.360, Speaker B: Yep.
00:29:17.580 - 00:29:18.570, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
