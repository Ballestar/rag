00:00:06.250 - 00:00:14.890, Speaker A: Hello everyone and welcome to the Gnosis Builders workshop building on Gnosis chain. The what, why and where. Joining us today is Olu, who will be taking us through this session.
00:00:14.890 - 00:00:17.920, Speaker A: And with that, I'll pass it over to Olu to get the session started.
00:00:19.570 - 00:00:20.190, Speaker B: Hi guys.
00:00:20.260 - 00:00:39.160, Speaker C: Welcome to the session. Yes, I'll be taking us through this very brief session on building on Nusis chain. What you need to know about Nusis chain, where you need to get information and how you could go about it.
00:00:39.160 - 00:00:57.482, Speaker C: Questions could be typed into the chat and I'll get to them. Thank you. So this is what the talk is all about, the what's, the why and where of building on Gnosis chain.
00:00:57.482 - 00:01:32.240, Speaker C: We're going to talk about what is nosis chain, why you should consider nosis chain, how to build on chain and we are going to talk briefly about Gnosis Builders. So, what is nosis chain? nosis chain is an L one POS based EVM compatible chain. Basically what all this means is that it is compatible with Ethereum and you could build on it same as you could build on Ethereum.
00:01:32.240 - 00:01:53.480, Speaker C: It operates with a dual trucking system. We have one trucking for gas and the order for staking, the Xdai is used for gas at the GN for staking. XDI itself is pegged one to one with the US dollar and it's derived from the die on Ethereum.
00:01:53.480 - 00:02:20.332, Speaker C: What this means is that transactions are very cheap on the sustained. With $100 you could do as many as 100K transactions or even more depending on the type of transactions you're doing. And the reason for having this dual token system is also so that staking can also be done very easily.
00:02:20.332 - 00:02:53.596, Speaker C: As we'll see later on. Nosyschain itself is community powered and developers focused and anyone in the world can become participatory on the chain and it is pretty very easy to do. So, what's the mission of Nasischain? Gnosis Chain aims to be the most decentralized blockchain we have already tools that we use to measure decentralization, as you see later on.
00:02:53.596 - 00:03:05.010, Speaker C: And why Mrs. Chain is most suitable in making this contract. Because currently there are over 115K validators on the Mrs chain and screen.
00:03:05.010 - 00:03:22.608, Speaker C: And the entry to becoming validator is just one GNO. Like I said earlier, this is the reason why we have this two token system. The GNO is used for validators and you need just one of it to become a validator.
00:03:22.608 - 00:03:47.240, Speaker C: Contrast that with Ethereum that requires 32 heads to run a validator. Now I said earlier that the chain is compatible with the EVM. So how do we achieve this one GNO to 32? What happens is your one GNO is converted to something called Mgno and one GNO is 32 Mgno.
00:03:47.240 - 00:04:16.500, Speaker C: So the Mgno is basically what is used for validation and that makes it compatible with a question in chatnosis. Chain also strives to become accessible for all user tribes through straightforward user embody and developer experience. The onboarding for Nosischain is very easy, very straightforward.
00:04:16.500 - 00:04:38.460, Speaker C: Converting your GNU to Mgno and communicator have tools that could help you do that with just a few clicks. You don't need to have any advanced knowledge of how the internet work. We provide tools for you that you could go do a few clicks and become a validator.
00:04:38.460 - 00:05:02.780, Speaker C: So what's the key priorities that Nosischain strives to achieve? One of them is decentralization. Like I said, we want to be the most decentralized chain. We also prioritize validator experience.
00:05:02.780 - 00:05:33.406, Speaker C: We have an intuitive validator experience dashboard that you could use to basically become a validator without having to go through a lot of stress. For example, if you're using stereo net with just a few clicks and in a few minutes you could become a validator and everything is set up very easily for you. User onboarding as well is very seamless and accessible.
00:05:33.406 - 00:05:57.066, Speaker C: And we have a very robust and growing ecosystem. There are a lot of DDA rules and DApps that have already been developed and deployed on chain. So why should you be interested in all of this? Why should you want to build on like I said, decentralization is very key.
00:05:57.066 - 00:06:13.040, Speaker C: With about 315 validators, nosis chain is the second most decentralized chain. Accessibility is also very important. Either you're a developer user getting started on those exchange intuitive, it's affordable, it's easy.
00:06:13.040 - 00:06:23.970, Speaker C: Another thing is speed. Transaction time on those exchange is about 5 seconds, which means you could do lightning fast transactions. It is also cheap.
00:06:23.970 - 00:06:50.330, Speaker C: With 0.1 XDI you'll be able to make hundreds of transactions and it is stable stability. Paying for transaction using Xdai, which is basically one to one with the US dollar means that your transaction fees are predictable and they are not subject to market volatility.
00:06:50.330 - 00:07:09.874, Speaker C: Okay, so this is the current state of Gnosis chain. You could see this info on Gnosismetrics.com. We have about 27,000 active accounts in the last 30 days, about 1.6
00:07:09.874 - 00:07:21.270, Speaker C: million transactions processed. About 3000 XDI paid in fees for those 1.6 million transactions, about 115K validators.
00:07:21.270 - 00:07:51.244, Speaker C: The total value of USD deposited is about 12 million and the current yield for validators is about 15.2%. So all of this info can be seen more if you go to the transactional active accounts gas on Nosysmetrics.com. So what was the short scenario on why you should consider nosis chain? It is user friendly, we have a strong ecosystem.
00:07:51.244 - 00:08:13.032, Speaker C: We also have a grants program so that your prayer that you are building would apply for grants. And there's an ecosystem that works around that and helps to support public good projects. Yeah.
00:08:13.032 - 00:08:42.000, Speaker C: So you could receive support for not just for grant money, you could receive support for marketing, of course, liquidity, you receive support for networking and so much more for the necessity. So where do you start from? First thing first you have to connect your wallet to the chain. You could use the RPC endpoint the chain ID and the currency symbol as displayed.
00:08:42.000 - 00:09:01.428, Speaker C: Alternatively you could just go to the chainlist.org and go to the chain hundred and your wallet should be automatically configured for you. And again, this is all very easy and intuitive and straightforward.
00:09:01.428 - 00:09:20.908, Speaker C: You don't need to have special knowledge or anything to be able to do this. And after you've connected your wallet, like I said, it is 100% EVM compatible. Basically this means that you could use all of the DAP development tools you use on Ethereum on Gnosis chain without changing anything.
00:09:20.908 - 00:09:49.220, Speaker C: You could take a smart contract or a project built for Ethereum and deploy it on nosis chain without much assets. In fact, most of the time you don't have to change anything, just deploy one to one with Hypnosis chain. So what this means is all of the tools that are available on Ethereum can also be used on Gnosis chain easily.
00:09:49.220 - 00:10:11.550, Speaker C: Your remix, your ADATs, your trophy whatever tool you use to develop on Ethereum you could use those same tools on the system. Apart from that, all of the libraries are also 100% compatible. You could use any open zipline library or any other library that you're familiar with on nosis chain as well.
00:10:11.550 - 00:10:28.580, Speaker C: So where are the resources you could get started with? The first place I would recommend to go is Nosy IO. This is the main website. It provides very quick overview of what nosis chain is.
00:10:28.580 - 00:10:48.994, Speaker C: You also provide overview of the grants program and how to get started on that. The next point of call is Docs Nosyschain.com. This is the entry point to all documentations for nurses chain for either your developer validator or you're just reviewing.
00:10:48.994 - 00:11:00.362, Speaker C: This is the best point of call. But if you are a developer and just want to start development right away, you could go to the developersoba. Gnosiswallets.com
00:11:00.362 - 00:11:27.250, Speaker C: is also a good resource. Here you could see all the available wallets that are supported onsischain and you could easily click through and select your preferred parameters. And you get links and documentations and stuff to the wallet that fits your preferred choice.
00:11:27.250 - 00:11:38.674, Speaker C: Access to Faucet is also very important. So we have Gnosisfosset.com where you can get a small amount of XDI that you can use to start building immediately.
00:11:38.674 - 00:11:48.266, Speaker C: Deploying transgender. If the XDI you get from Nosysforce.com is not enough you can also visit Buyxdy.com.
00:11:48.266 - 00:12:15.314, Speaker C: We have a lot of resources there to show where you can get XDA easily. Either you want to buy with credit card, either you want to swap it on chain or you want to bridge it to the Ethereumnosis chain. We have a lot of system for you and with just a few clicks you could get started and if you want GNO, you could just go to the Gnosonbideside.com
00:12:15.314 - 00:12:30.470, Speaker C: and you'll be able to get GNO. Finally we have validatornosis.com. There is also very simple interface to guide you if you are interested in becoming validator on this chain.
00:12:30.470 - 00:12:43.420, Speaker C: Again all of these tools are very easy to use. You don't need a lot of specialized knowledge to use them. Some of them are just click throughs and you get simple is to follow guides on how to do business.
00:12:43.420 - 00:13:04.770, Speaker C: So finally I said we're going to talk briefly about Gnosis Builders. So what is Gnosis Builders? Gnosis Builders is an ecosystem team for Gnosis Chain. We are basically a community that build for Gnosis Chain.
00:13:04.770 - 00:13:20.882, Speaker C: You could visit our website to find all of the various tools I'm talking about and you could use all of these links to get in touch with us as well. We have a developers program. Developers.
00:13:20.882 - 00:13:46.254, Speaker C: We also have a users program. You could check the validators and if you want to see all of the events and the other community that supports, go to the Community Support. So also you could reach us to us if you have a project you want us to collaborate with you on or that you want us to support, you could reach us from Mrsbudas.com.
00:13:46.254 - 00:13:58.602, Speaker C: As. Yeah, we are also on Twitter, we're on Discord, we're on Telegram. You could reach us easily on any of these channels.
00:13:58.602 - 00:14:07.530, Speaker C: And that is it folks. Thank you. Awesome.
00:14:07.600 - 00:14:21.870, Speaker A: Cheers. Thank you Olu. Does anybody have any questions? We had a comment that Gnosis Chain is the only EVM chain compatible with Ethereum at the beacon chain level by Ethan.
00:14:23.970 - 00:14:26.500, Speaker C: Yes. Thanks Ethan. That is very correct.
00:14:30.840 - 00:14:31.156, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:31.178 - 00:14:40.324, Speaker A: If anybody wants to ask a question, feel free to type in the chat or take yourself off mute. Gavin asked. Gnosis has all saved pre.
00:14:40.324 - 00:14:42.390, Speaker A: Compiles then, yeah?
00:14:47.840 - 00:14:53.836, Speaker C: Yes. So like I said, it is 100% EVM compatible. You don't need to do anything.
00:14:53.836 - 00:15:00.770, Speaker C: Whatever it is that you do on Ethereum, you could just take it one to one like that and diplomas exchange without doing anything.
00:15:10.680 - 00:15:11.044, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:11.082 - 00:15:13.060, Speaker A: Can you talk about the hackathon rewards?
00:15:17.480 - 00:15:30.300, Speaker C: I okay, I don't I don't know. Is Ethan here? Ethan from Nurses chain.
00:15:38.140 - 00:15:51.020, Speaker A: I can also try finding stuff from the site in the meantime. Ethan, I can get back to you. Next question was is the Gnosis Safe anyhow related to the Gnosis chain?
00:15:53.600 - 00:16:24.530, Speaker C: Gnosis Safe is a wallet that you could use to do multi signature. So it is not related to Gnosis chain, but it is also a very good resource you could use if you want to do multi signature wallets. Okay.
00:16:24.680 - 00:16:27.410, Speaker A: And is Gnosis compatible with PolyBase?
00:16:28.390 - 00:16:32.180, Speaker C: I'm not sure what PolyBase is, so I can't really ask.
00:16:37.920 - 00:16:47.396, Speaker A: Ceci, I don't know if you want to take yourself off mute and maybe clarify or you can type in the chat as well. In the meantime, if we can move.
00:16:47.418 - 00:16:47.990, Speaker B: On.
00:16:50.920 - 00:16:52.150, Speaker C: I'm not sure.
00:16:54.460 - 00:16:57.240, Speaker A: Is there a rocket pool fork already on Gnosis?
00:16:59.500 - 00:17:00.970, Speaker C: None that I know of.
00:17:04.940 - 00:17:06.010, Speaker A: Let's see.
00:17:07.200 - 00:17:20.210, Speaker B: So yeah, guys, we have a second part if you don't mind, because we have just ten minutes left. We want to present one more product and then we continue with questions. In the end.
00:17:22.340 - 00:17:23.650, Speaker A: That sounds good.
00:17:25.540 - 00:17:31.276, Speaker B: Can I share my screen or although you have my presentation?
00:17:31.388 - 00:17:35.220, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I just stopped sharing.
00:17:38.280 - 00:17:50.164, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Yeah. So I want to introduce Hashi.
00:17:50.164 - 00:18:27.712, Speaker B: So it's a project by Gnosis Guild and in the Gnosis ecosystem in general, this is very new. So I want to introduce these guys to you because there are relevant bounties around that. What is hashi exactly? So Hashi means bridge in Japanese and we aim here to define a standard for cross chain communication with the main difference is that we want to be based on additive security and multiple inputs.
00:18:27.712 - 00:18:44.740, Speaker B: We call them oracles. More on that later. At its core, Hashi is a header Oracle aggregator and the ultimate goal here is to basically distribute trust for bridges.
00:18:44.740 - 00:19:22.820, Speaker B: But on the security mechanism level. Yeah, if I can use just one phrase to describe that, what has is doing is like why would you choose just one bridge security mechanism when you can have all of them? Right? And next one is why Hash was created. So, in 2022 we had more than 2 billion in hacks because of bridge issues and on Rec News leaderboard, all of the top projects, four out of five are related to bridges.
00:19:22.820 - 00:19:41.464, Speaker B: So what is the summary here is like no breed security mechanism is 100% secure. All designs have trade offs. Right? So a couple of principles around Hashi, the way it was designed.
00:19:41.464 - 00:19:53.330, Speaker B: So we want to standardize at the lowest possible level. And this is the block header. It's not like on transaction or on Tokens, but it's on the block header level.
00:19:53.330 - 00:20:10.980, Speaker B: And the goal here is to diversify this cross chain communication by different implementations. So different kind of bridges, right. So we assume here that no bridge design can be considered 100% secure.
00:20:10.980 - 00:20:46.290, Speaker B: So we will basically check multiple bridges for the result they're giving to validate a specific block header from another blockchain, of course, when we maximize security over latency. So here the whole design of the system basically makes it slower, but we have enhanced security. So a couple of main components of this system.
00:20:46.290 - 00:21:12.570, Speaker B: So imagine we have the applications, right? So applications are a Token bridge, a governance bridge, an NFT breeze, any kind of bridge you can imagine. And then we have the blockader Oracles, which are the actual bridges. So here there can be bridges you already know, for example, wormhole or the Gnosis chain Amb or Hope protocol or Connect, any breeze basically.
00:21:12.570 - 00:21:28.140, Speaker B: And then we have the core contracts which I'll present right after. The main one is called Hashi, which is the aggregator Gidi. Giribashi, another Japanese, I don't know if I have any Japanese speakers in the audience.
00:21:28.140 - 00:21:52.020, Speaker B: This basically is taking care of governance, which Oracles will be added and Thresholds and so forth. Then another component is the storage proofs. We need basically a proof on this concept that a specific transaction is included in a specific blockader.
00:21:52.020 - 00:22:21.664, Speaker B: This is done, for example, with a project like Axiom, but there are other alternatives they can explore. And then we have the reporter contracts and the relayers, which are basically helper components that will initiate the message transfers and listen to events cross chain. This is the most important part to understand.
00:22:21.664 - 00:22:46.920, Speaker B: Hashi is an architecture overview so it might look a bit difficult to describe in a couple of minutes but I want to focus here. So mainly let's say we have two chains, we have Ethereum Mainet and we have nosis chain. So these are the two main contracts I just mentioned before, the Hash and the giddy gidibashi.
00:22:46.920 - 00:23:23.684, Speaker B: And these here are the bridges basically, right? So the examples I mentioned before you have Amb. This is the Gnosis Omni bridge, maybe you've heard of it wormhole telepathy. This is a solution by synclubs ZK bridge, any kind of bridge and then we need to build adapters for all these bridges that feed into Hashi, right? And high level what is happening here is that we are asking on the application level.
00:23:23.684 - 00:23:57.768, Speaker B: So here I took as an example a token bridge. We are asking through this helper components here a specific block header from Ethereum mainnet to be transferred by all of these bridges, right? So the Amb will transfer the block header, the Wormhole will transfer the block header and so forth and on the other side Hashi will get the answers from all the bridges and it will compare. This is the giddy.
00:23:57.768 - 00:24:23.350, Speaker B: Bus is about the governance. So you can say okay, if two or three out of five or five out of eight wherever you want to set agree and give me the same answer then I can be very sure that this is correct. And this connects to what I just mentioned in the beginning that here we don't trust any one of them 100%.
00:24:23.350 - 00:25:06.710, Speaker B: We basically ask all of these bridges to give us the same input. We ask them give me a block error from the other side and if one of them is compromised, let's say Telepathy or Amb is compromised and they give a wrong result that is different by the majority then we know these are compromised but our system is still intact. Right? So that's I think the main lesson for Hashi that we want really to create additive security and aggregate all possible bridges and to be as sure as possible that we have the correct result.
00:25:06.710 - 00:25:58.180, Speaker B: Yeah, this part here is what I mentioned before about the storage proofs, right? So this is quite complex, I'll maybe explain a little bit later is we need a component here a contract that basically will check that a specific transaction is included in a specific block header, right? So this will give a block header and here you have to check oh, the transaction that I initiated here, is it included in the block header and then you can say if it is included then you can make sure that this actual token breach transaction on the other side happened. Right, that's basically it. The token can be bridged.
00:25:58.180 - 00:26:28.060, Speaker B: What can you build now with hashi? So now that goes to the hackathon and connects to many of the prizes we have there. You can write an adapter for another bridge so similar to the ones I showed. You can write this contract, this miracle proof that proves that basically specific event or a transaction is included in a specific block header.
00:26:28.060 - 00:26:57.400, Speaker B: Then you can look at the governance contract we have and improve it in any kind of way. At the moment it's very, I wouldn't say simple, but it doesn't have a lot of complex use cases yet. And you can also, of course, I mean, this is quite hard at the moment, but you can try and build end to end application that will make, for example, a token transfer super secure by three, four, five different bridges.
00:26:57.400 - 00:27:14.220, Speaker B: And yeah, to help in that, these are the resources we have so far. So the main one is the repository. You will see there that the ready adapters implemented for three bridges.
00:27:14.220 - 00:27:37.092, Speaker B: You can add more and if you want to play around with or even interact with the contracts we have already on testnet, these are the addresses. So we have on Gurley and Shadow at the moment, which shadow is the testnet of chain. And yeah, I think I'll stop here and maybe we can check.
00:27:37.092 - 00:27:40.470, Speaker B: Is there any questions? Because we have three minutes left.
00:27:47.020 - 00:27:57.180, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a good amount of questions. Sky scrolling back up to the top. See is there a rocket pool fork already on Gnosis?
00:28:00.020 - 00:28:12.608, Speaker B: Rocket pool? I'm not sure about that. By the way, guys, for any questions, I think there should be a channel. Indeed, global.
00:28:12.608 - 00:28:31.976, Speaker B: Yeah, get that link and we'll monitor that because there are different teams, like the hashi team, for example, the builders. And then if you have, for example, hashi related questions, I will jump in for other projects that person will jump in. Wow.
00:28:32.158 - 00:28:36.360, Speaker A: And what are some cool projects on Gnosis?
00:28:40.700 - 00:28:41.450, Speaker B: Cool.
00:28:44.140 - 00:28:52.400, Speaker C: I think I already responded to that. We have quite a number of projects that are on Gnosis chain. I could quickly share my screen to show you a slide.
00:28:52.400 - 00:29:21.818, Speaker C: So these are some of the projects that we're able to put together that are on chain. You can see we have the file, we have we have infrastructure project, we have Davos, NFT games, Note providers. And this list I think, is a bit old.
00:29:21.818 - 00:29:25.260, Speaker C: I'm sure there are other projects that are coming up as we speak.
00:29:31.280 - 00:29:43.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sorry Olu, I just saw that you responded to some of these questions. So just going to ones that haven't been responded, manu asked what are the more important things you were looking for in projects in the hackathon?
00:29:49.010 - 00:30:12.440, Speaker C: I can't really say, but first and first, the project needs to be interesting it needs to solve a particular problem. There needs to be value, some sort of value that has been added to the community or to the chain under the project. So, yes.
00:30:15.710 - 00:30:16.122, Speaker B: Okay.
00:30:16.176 - 00:30:19.390, Speaker A: And wouldn't Hashi be very slow to reach consensus?
00:30:22.450 - 00:30:31.818, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just answering that. So, yeah, it depends. The main point here is that Hash is super modular and configurable.
00:30:31.818 - 00:30:57.030, Speaker B: So it depends. If you want to make it super fast, you can use just two oracles with some two multisig bridges and that will be super fast. But if you want to make it super secure, what we want to make, for example, hasi ideally one implementation that will combine a lot of ZK lite client bridges right, together with multisig bridges, and that will be slower but a lot more secure.
00:31:00.010 - 00:31:03.050, Speaker A: And are the deployed contracts and dogs.
00:31:05.870 - 00:31:18.720, Speaker B: Actually, no, because I think we deployed them yesterday, but I think they're not in the repo. But feel free to ask the questions there and I'll provide you an information you guys need.

00:31:43.150 - 00:32:16.920, Speaker A: I think that's all the questions right now. And yeah, if people have more questions and I posted the discord link there to Gnosis, so I posted again here, please feel free to reach out to them at any point and they'll be able to answer anybody from the team will be able to answer any other questions that you may have. But if there are no other questions, just say, thank the team for the great presentation and thank you all for being here today.
