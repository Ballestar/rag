00:00:08.010 - 00:00:31.800, Speaker A: All right, next up is our first product announcement and demo for the day. I'd like to invite Masa up on stage to talk about secured finance, how they got started, what they've been working on and what you can do with the DAP. So, without further ado, please welcome Masa. I'll have you grab that mic on there and off to presenting. Welcome.
00:00:32.250 - 00:01:01.066, Speaker B: All right. Hi, I'm Masa Kiguji. I'm a founder of Second Finance. I'm so proud to be here as a speaker at Pragma. So I'm going to talk about accelerating decentralized finance. We are DeFi project and we are building interbank grade peer to peer capital markets for digital assets. Our mission is basically bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto finance.
00:01:01.066 - 00:02:04.398, Speaker B: And we are leading decentralized finance platform built on Ethereum blockchain and that is interoperable with traditional banking. I'm a scientist and also TradFi people and we're backed by some of the brightest people from top tier of an institutional finance. And we enable long term investment vehicles based on a reliable yield curve. And our interbank market system bridges a gap between phi and DeFi. And we unlock possibilities of disrupted leisure technologies, distributed leisure technologies to democratize this market and we bring trillions to crypto economy. Today I'm going to talk about our origin and our concept of our market and I'm going to talk about problem and solution and going to show some of our products and demo and show some traction and share future plans. So we are born through hackathon.
00:02:04.398 - 00:02:48.974, Speaker B: Thank you. Ethereum is global and we joined Hackfs Hackathon. It's co hosted by Protocol Labs and it's global and we won a couple of awards and that allowed me to join Takyon accelerator and that's how we started a couple of history. So we got some awards. Top DeFi prize from Protocol Labs and also best east 2.0 and Lipidop projects from Eastern Foundation. Then we joined Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator run by takian by Consensus and we raised $4 million, collided by Protocol Apps and luckily we returned to Hack FS sponsor.
00:02:48.974 - 00:03:34.622, Speaker B: And now we have been designing fixed term loan markets. And today I'm going to announce that we went launch for our product. So, speaking about a concept and I want to build interbank grade peer to peer capital markets. So looking back when I was working for traditional bank, interbank market is actually decentralized already and it is peer to peer. There's no central, there's a central cloud party. But basically if you look at the architecture, it is peer to peer already. But they're using their own databases, own systems, that is not interoperable.
00:03:34.622 - 00:04:37.750, Speaker B: So the idea is basically use blockchain to replace middle office, back office with blockchain. So in that way we can reduce the cost dramatically and we can open up this interbank grade market accessible for everyone. So if you look at the size of the market, OTC derivatives is by far the largest market. It is $632,000,000,000,000 market and on the other hand there's exchange traded not OTC market which is $79 trillion. So you can see how big the market size is. So world GDP is $80 trillion. So you can see how OTC derivatives market is large and if you can take a look at it closely, out of 632 interest rates market is $502,000,000,000,000.
00:04:37.750 - 00:05:49.622, Speaker B: So about 80% of the OTC market is interest rate markets and that is the market we are going to build. So this is huge business opportunity but we don't see this market happening in the DeFi space yet and I'm going to explain why it is so difficult. So now a lot of DeFi projects are successful in making money market. We call it money market for less than one year and for the more than one year space we call it capital market. Right now it looks like DeFi is successful and come to some kind of maturity but people are so excited about basically spot exchange, buy or sell cryptocurrencies and do some yield farming but it's more like less than one year space and we are missing this huge part of the capital markets. So who is usually building this? It's actually the people treat cryptocurrency right now as cash or equity. But it's not cash or equity.
00:05:49.622 - 00:06:54.690, Speaker B: It is currency that comes with banking level solutions like bonds and swaps and derivatives and hedging. Yeah, but I believe JP. Morgan, Goldman Sachs has to build it, but it seems too early for them. And this is a huge problem, and I'm going to share this problem. So there's an international regulatory framework called Barzo three. If banks need to hold crypto assets in their balance sheets the risk rate is 1250% which is really high and also they have to pay extra compliance cost that is so expensive. That is the reason why they don't want to provide a full range of financial services for crypto and maybe Custodian is okay but they don't want to provide full scale of financial services and that is why we decided to build this level of market as a decentralized financial protocol.
00:06:54.690 - 00:08:08.162, Speaker B: So right now DeFi is like finance baby. It looks successful but it's just a few billion dollar scale but from traditional finance scale it is a trillion dollar scale. So this is the scale we want to bring into this crypto and so we're more like try to become Solomon Brothers or Goldman Sachs of decentralized finance and we're basically industry experts. So we hired traders from Goldman Sachs and a quantity engineer from HSBC and a digital strategist from Morgan Sterling and Goldman Sachs and that's how we build it. And our approach is to build yield curve in the first place by providing loan market. So the loan market is the first product and then we're going to expand the product range to FX forward and then going to build derivatives market. So talking about the yield curve, it is so crucial to build the interest rates market but it's not really the pool based AMM based interest rates.
00:08:08.162 - 00:09:01.910, Speaker B: It is a local interest rate. But on the other hand, our solution is to have an orderbook system which is universal interest rate so it can be used as a reference rate to build a derivative market. So our interest rate quality is universal as opposed to the Amb based local interest rates. So once we establish yield curve and from low markets, we can expand our ecosystem to swaps forwards and hedging and options markets. So this is the ecosystem we want to expand. So our first product is low market which is decentralized lending and borrowing four currencies. Our features we design our plain vanilla as a zero coupon loan market so you don't need to think about coupon calculations.
00:09:01.910 - 00:09:50.842, Speaker B: And we are order book based fair price discovery and we have smart contract clearing counterparty. So this solves the problem of secondary market liquidity and we also have automatic redemption with mid price rolling which is so effective for large scale investors. And today I'm going to make announcement that we went live, finally went live after two years of development. Thank you very much. On goalie testnet. So we opened up 32 markets for four currencies. Each currency has eight markets, basically three months, six months, nine months, twelve up to two years.
00:09:50.842 - 00:10:38.220, Speaker B: So you can choose one of 32 markets and you can take a look at our yield curve and see the trading opportunities or arbitrage opportunities. So let's play our 1 minute quick video. Oh, sorry, how can I play? Let me click. All right, so I'm going to share with you later. This is basically the 1 minute but you can go to our website and you can jump onto the website. So, along with our product launch in March, we're quite busy. We coordinated our launch, so we released white paper and concept paper.
00:10:38.220 - 00:11:43.226, Speaker B: It took a bit about 15 minutes to read but we released on March 14 and we also released our landing page and a web app and also it comes with Oat on chain achievement token campaign. We are running Test Palo check in campaign and also we published seven articles, basically step by step guides, how to connect wallets, how to set up a MetaMask, et cetera. This is kind of a barrier we need to remove so you can go through our documents. So our go to market strategy is three steps from retail to institutional. First step, important step is to serve like a borrow lend demand for the filecoin storage providers, they're paying more than 20%. So it's really attractive investment opportunity for investors. And then we provide Bitcoin instrument USDC curve that is you can arbitrage, you can carry trade.
00:11:43.226 - 00:12:35.726, Speaker B: So this is super interesting. And then the third step is actually we build a forward market and provide an opportunity for the structuring products such as the dual currency deposit and we see a tremendous growth in terms of active users. So we already achieved 48.9. Twitters and discord. As of today we have forty nine K and Guild also thirty eight K and Galaxy we compiled 112k. So we are so humbled to becoming a top DeFi. If you look at the Discord community size, we surpass mega dow yield one inch yarn curve and as of today we have 49K.
00:12:35.726 - 00:13:07.538, Speaker B: So our community is as big as Abe already. So thank you very much. And we are running a weekly basis community call. On average we have more than 33,000 attendees. So I'm so excited to have this super engaging community. So this is a connected wallet addresses. Since we launched our product, our unique like a connected addresses keeps increasing having over 7000 unique addresses.
00:13:07.538 - 00:13:54.114, Speaker B: So we are so excited to keep improving. And another announcement here is we're in the middle of the test pilot V One training program. So basically you can go through our training program, you don't need to know any of the finance knowledge, you can just go through our user guides. So you get used to how to trade on an interbank market and to become expert traders. Institutional investors are coming, but you can compete with them. I'm sure that you will become a top trader in the world. And finally, as a Japanese founder, I want to invite you to come to the Web Three world and also come to Japan.
00:13:54.114 - 00:14:16.960, Speaker B: Japan is fully committed shifting gear towards Web three and so we are changing a lot of laws and attacks, rules, et cetera. So we are so excited that Japan is leading the Web Three and yeah, thank you very much. So I hope you can come to our hackathon. We are hosting hackathon. So thank you very much.
00:14:21.570 - 00:14:54.340, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much. I'm not sure if you all caught that, but this project came out of ETH Global Hackathon about two years ago. And just the incredible amount of progress they've made to kind of get here just shows you how dedicated not only Masa and their team is, but the opportunity here to build something really interesting that takes in from all the principles that you know, in traditional finance. So give a big round of applause to secured finance team one more time and thank you for their continued support.
