00:00:00.490 - 00:00:24.720, Speaker A: We had, I think 1304 hundred people apply for for this event and we could only then 200 people. So every single person in here I know has a strong opinion and the goal is to let it be heard. So don't be shy, please. Otherwise I'll start calling on people that I know are in here and you might be a little bit on the spot. So okay, with that said Ankit, please take it away.
00:00:25.210 - 00:00:47.420, Speaker B: Hi. Hello everyone. I'm Ankit. I'm head of research at Frontier. We have a packed house today to start. This is the first panel that we have designing decks in 2023. I would just let everyone go by order and introduce themselves and tell us what they're working on right now and then we can take things from there.
00:00:47.870 - 00:01:10.340, Speaker C: Yeah. Hi everyone. Sit on good. My name is Max Resnick. I'm the head of research at Special Mechanisms Group. And we design mechanisms primarily we're focused on mev and specifically on mev on ethereum for now. I think you'll hear a lot more about what we think about LVR today.
00:01:12.710 - 00:01:36.620, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Andre Canidio. I am a senior research economist at Cowswap Cow Protocol. And yeah, so I also spend a lot of time thinking and designing mechanism. And in particular we've been working recently at Cow Protocol on thinking about how you would design an AMM or a Dex when all the trades are batched because obviously that's what we do and I think we're going to discuss it a bit later.
00:01:37.870 - 00:01:49.230, Speaker E: Doug Colkett, a founder at Ambient or some of you might know us as Crocswap. We're primarily focused on building an AMM where the economics are sustainable for passive LPs.
00:01:49.890 - 00:01:50.542, Speaker D: Hi, everyone.
00:01:50.596 - 00:01:59.460, Speaker F: I'm Shin. I'm a researcher at Uniswap Labs, and I'm working on all things uniswap. But most recently, Uniswap X and Uniswap V Four.
00:01:59.990 - 00:02:07.990, Speaker G: Hi everybody, I'm Eugene, I work at Ellipsis Labs. We are building a fully on chain limit order book dex on Salana.
00:02:09.850 - 00:02:18.140, Speaker B: I think I can just start by maybe Eugene can start and we can start by them. You guys should tell us what are your spiciest opinions on AMM design?
00:02:20.030 - 00:03:21.312, Speaker G: Spiciest opinions on AMM Design. I don't know if it's spicy in 2023, but I think it's pretty clear at this point that AMM LPs on average in expectation, tend to not make money. Who are the remaining LPs? Why do they still do it is not super clear to me. It seems like there is still plenty of room to innovate on the AMM design space. But at the end of the day it does seem like kind of the goal of an AMM is to mimic to some degree what a professional liquidity provider where they would want to place liquidity perhaps on like a centralized limit order book exchange. So our opinion at Ellipsis is probably can't do it with twelve second block times, probably can't do it with 30 million gas per block. So we're giving it a go on.
00:03:21.366 - 00:03:48.830, Speaker A: Salana, do we have anyone in the room who's like a passive LP on AMMS? Genuinely in size, like you put for profit or just for fun? For fun. Okay. We have one over here only on assets that have a peg. Okay, so what does that mean? Just like, only a curve, stable pools or what?
00:03:52.560 - 00:03:56.190, Speaker H: Assets where you don't have to worry about impermanent loss over.
00:04:01.050 - 00:04:27.514, Speaker A: Debt. Is it assets that are also traded on centralized exchanges or only assets that are not liquid on centralized exchanges? Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, cool. There's only one LP. He's the only LP on all of uniswap everyone. You can go talk to him afterwards.
00:04:27.514 - 00:04:30.640, Speaker A: He'll be in the lobby. Okay, carry on.
00:04:31.510 - 00:04:32.242, Speaker F: Should I go?
00:04:32.296 - 00:04:32.610, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:32.680 - 00:05:07.260, Speaker F: Okay. I think my spices take might not be dex related. I think dex related wise, I'm pretty mid curve, but I think in terms of mev solutions, I think the best ones are always going to be kind of scenario dependent and custom to each application rather than this one catch all solution. But I think that's probably going to cause some controversy. But that's kind of my opinion for now.
00:05:09.950 - 00:05:42.486, Speaker E: Yeah. I guess my spacious opinion would be I think the industry in general is going the wrong direction, moving towards professional liquidity. I don't think can really have decentralized markets if there's six trading firms that you require to provide liquidity. That's just not decentralized, in my opinion. I also think retail has a much lower cost of capital than professional liquidity. I don't think Citadel is getting out of bed for anything less than 100% expected returns, whereas your average retail participant is happy with six, seven, 8%. So right.
00:05:42.486 - 00:05:54.490, Speaker E: The big problem with AMMS is toxic flow just isn't segmented, and LPs eat all the toxic flow, but I think there are ways that you can fix that and keep liquidity fully decentralized and fully.
00:05:57.390 - 00:05:57.898, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:57.984 - 00:05:58.620, Speaker B: So.
00:06:00.430 - 00:06:54.250, Speaker D: As we know the problem from LP viewpoint that can be framed in terms of asymmetric information that they may be trading against arbitrageur that are better informed than them and therefore exploit them, this is toxic flow, and I think that a lot of the solutions have been proposed are to some extent missing the point. And I'll explain this via an example. Suppose that you've inherited a piece of antique from your grandma and you have no idea how much is worth it and you don't like it, you want to sell it. Now, if someone shows up and this person is a super expert in antiques, you know he's going to screw you. Okay. He's going to tell you a price that is just convenient to him. On the other side, if someone shows up and you know this person doesn't know anything about antiques, he's just tell you a price that corresponds to his own, how much he likes it, then, okay, statistically, you may get a good price or a bad price, but it's non systematic.
00:06:54.250 - 00:07:44.350, Speaker D: Now when you see it this way you immediately have like I'm sure you can think of a solution to the problem because if there are multiple experts out there you can play them against each other and still get a good price even if you do not know anything. And so I think to some extent a lot of the discussion about Am design has been about how do I know the correct price? For example, feeding the price of an oracle through in an AMM or how do I distinguish between the informed guys and the uninformed guy? The informed guy wear fancy dresses and speaks with a French accent and the guy who is not informed is more scrappy or similar things. But the idea of in fact we like the toxic flow provided that we can play the informed players against each other has somewhat escaped and this is a bit like the work that we've been doing recently.
00:07:46.450 - 00:08:42.654, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I mostly agree with this. I think what other people have said is that toxic flow is the problem that long block times accentuate it, which I think is true. But I think maybe one thing that isn't discussed is that the proposer and their role in the system on chain where there's one person who gets to write to the chain, who gets to decide all the order of all the transactions is contributing to the problem as well. And it makes it really difficult to pit all of the training firms against each other and give users good prices. So we have a paper that's about how it's difficult to hold auctions quickly on chain which is kind of what you need to do if you want to solve this problem is you need to hold auctions quickly. We know that we can capture some of the LVR. Like if you go look at the PBS auction the PBS auction is redirecting a ton of LVR to the proposer of the block because they're like the only person who can do it.
00:08:42.654 - 00:08:53.730, Speaker C: So I think if we could figure out somehow how to run an auction in a market system where the proposer wasn't a monopolist then we could push more revenue back to the LPs.
00:08:55.190 - 00:09:19.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard a lot about toxic nontoxic flow how to differentiate how traditional finance does something on it. Does anyone want to take on how do some of these firms differentiate between toxic non toxic order flow? Do you think there is venue that we can even do something like that on chain? Maybe Andres, you can take.
00:09:22.370 - 00:10:17.866, Speaker D: Mean in the theoretical literature the difference will be between informed and uninformed traders. Uninformed traders will be someone who is paying attention to the prices everywhere, say the binance price if that's where the price discovery is done and as soon as you observe a deviation from your local decks from that price we'll trade. So to exploit this. So the difference is that of information and instead non toxic flow will be people that kind of want to trade at a reasonable price. So for example, at Cowswap we receive intention to trade, we aggregate them in a batch and then there is a mechanism to look for the best execution. Now we claim that we have a non toxic flow precisely because the batch imposes a delay. And it's also unclear then from the trader point of view how the batch will be executed.
00:10:17.866 - 00:10:43.960, Speaker D: There is a kind of a competition that will determine afterward. So it's very unlikely that an arbitrator can exploit differences in batches in the various prices through our batch. So we think that our flow is nontoxic, but instead arbitrageure that go directly on a decks and compete to have their transaction included earlier in the block precisely to be the one that rebalances will be the one that are the.
00:10:48.970 - 00:11:30.658, Speaker E: First approximation. Toxic flow right now is just the price of binance. The reality is price discovery happens at binance. And if you look at stat arbon chain, it's pretty much just check the price against binance and go there, right? So arbitrage wars need to exist, they're important. So it's not necessarily getting rid of toxic flow, just making it pay enough. So if the price of finance gaps 50 bips and the Stadarb mevbot is paying five bips to trade on the AMM pool, it's just not sustainable. So it's not necessarily about getting rid of toxic flow, it's just about making toxic flow pay to the LPs a fair share of the actual economic rents.
00:11:30.658 - 00:11:57.418, Speaker E: And right now those rents go to ethereum. So it's great if you're an ethereum holder, juices the burn, raises staking yields, but sucks for LPs. So a lot of what we focused on is, okay, how can we move that layer, keep it decentralized, but probably ethereum itself isn't sufficient to do that. So we're really excited right now about coprocessors. We think you can do a lot of really complex stuff in coprocessors off chain.
00:11:57.514 - 00:11:58.634, Speaker B: What do you mean by coprocessor?
00:11:58.682 - 00:12:44.670, Speaker E: Oh yeah, coprocessor is basically some decentralized way to do compute off chain and then post a proof that the compute is accurate. So ZK would be an example, but depending on what the security risks are, even something like the enclave might be fine, right? And you can pump into SGX or something and you can make reasonable assertions and if it's not fully secure, maybe someone gets to swap. They hack SGX swap at one basis point instead of 50 basis points, and that's fine occasionally. So we think there's a lot of room to do computation off chain, but still in a decentralized way, still in a fully trustless way or near trustless, and move that logic off chain and then have basically the chain and the AMM be the settlement layer.
00:12:47.420 - 00:13:51.672, Speaker C: I think one of the ways that they deal with this in traditional finance is actually payment for order flow. So like citadel wants to distinguish between the toxic flow and the non toxic flow. So they buy all of the non toxic flow from Robinhood and then they give them pretty good prices because they're not know it's debatable whether those prices are very good. The Citadel people would say they are, but I think that's something that's very clearly coming down the pipe in crypto. And the question is whether the people who are able to pay for the toxic flow will end up being LPs somehow, in which case they'll be able to kind of price discriminate, give good prices to uninformed traders because they know they're not getting screwed in your example of the antiques assessor right. And then give much worse prices to the toxic flow. I think what's going to happen, though, is that the Citadels of our world are going to be able to pay more than the LPs for the non toxic flow, and then what's going to be left over is only the toxic waste, and that's what's going to be for the LPs.
00:13:51.672 - 00:14:01.520, Speaker C: So even though I think private order flow has the potential to alleviate this, it may actually make it worse depending on who kind of wins the auctions for the order flow.
00:14:03.060 - 00:14:11.492, Speaker B: I think Uniswap X also launched recently, which is also very similar to doing some compute off chain. Jin, you want to take some of this question as well?
00:14:11.626 - 00:15:44.960, Speaker F: Yeah, so I guess I can first talk about the lever question a little bit and then we can talk about Unisoft X. So I think with the thinking around returning lever to LPs in general, unisoft has always taken a market oriented approach to solving pretty much anything, and specifically for designing pools with custom functions and encourage people to innovate. Is this thing called hooks, which basically allows each pool to have its own sort of custom logic and more or less arbitrary logic that can be executed while the pool is executing certain functions. And people have been discussing on Twitter, oh, what we can do with these hooks. And those ideas that my panelists just mentioned have all kind of come up before, which I think are promising ways to solve this problem. You can auction out the ability to, for example, trade in a pool in a block and that essentially just passes on some of the kind of willingness to arbitrage from the arbitrager to the LPs. It's unclear to me at this point whether the details are going to actually work out, but I think these are promising research directions and I think Unisoft X is just tackling a separate problem, which is the routing problem.
00:15:44.960 - 00:16:33.200, Speaker F: Like when swappers are swapping, especially with Uniswap V Four, you will see a ton of pools and it will be almost impossible for you to kind of find the best routes yourself without having this beefy machine and complex math and all that. So Uniswap X is really a product with the swappers in mind and say again, outsource routing and execution to the market and say whoever gives me best execution can have the trade. So we're kind of saying these are two orthogonal problems that can be solved better if they're decoupled instead of putting them together. Yeah, that's kind of my take on it.
00:16:33.270 - 00:16:55.640, Speaker B: Got it. So it looks like a lot of these newer versions of AMM designs are trying to split into two types of users toxic and non toxic type of users. Does anyone in the audience have any opinions on this direction that AMM design is taking? Spicier the better. Yes. Can we throw?
00:16:57.020 - 00:18:01.460, Speaker H: So one of the interesting things about the Uniswap RFQ system is that Uniswap is unique in that system. When they have the most toxic flow, like the stuff that none of their market makers want to fill, they pass it on to other exchanges. For instance, like the one inch RFQ system, if there's something that one inch market makers don't want to fill, it might go on to Uniswap or Dodo or some other entity. But Uniswap is unique in that when there's some flow that the market makers don't want, it would then transition on towards the uniswap liquidity providers. And it seems to me like you guys are the only ones that are sort of like at a conflict with yourselves, so to speak. And I was curious, I don't know, it just seems like a really socially complicated governance. I'm curious how you guys are handling that from a variety of different angles.
00:18:01.620 - 00:18:33.830, Speaker F: Sure, I can't answer it. I think it's a bit of a nuanced topic, I would say. I would agree with you on the fact that it is a hard trade off to balance because we do have two type of users, we have swappers and LPs and we're trying to optimize for both. But sometimes they are kind of in this position where you have to make a decision on where you want to be on the spectrum. But it's not true that.
00:18:35.640 - 00:18:36.116, Speaker D: All the.
00:18:36.138 - 00:18:38.336, Speaker F: Residual flow has to be routed to Uniswap.
00:18:38.368 - 00:18:38.516, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:38.538 - 00:19:06.830, Speaker F: For example, if I'm operating a statar shop, I'm very well positioned to route everything to any exchange. It doesn't have to be on chain. In fact, it might be cheaper to just hedge your position in Binance as can just I can win the order first and if I don't want to internalize, I can just route it to Binance. So it really depends on the situation, I would say, and not exactly clear.
00:19:07.280 - 00:19:11.500, Speaker E: Well, I fully support the Uniswap front end routing to ambient. Personally.
00:19:13.760 - 00:19:27.652, Speaker H: I think there's a distinction to make here between not necessarily routing all of the bad flow to your LPs versus making sure that they never get any of the good flow, which I think is the current problem because all of the good flow would get filled by the RFQ system.
00:19:27.786 - 00:20:24.896, Speaker G: Yeah. Under this sort of RFQ system, you turn the passive LPs essentially into this liquidity of last resort, where the RFQ liquidity providers, who are probably going to be these professional firms, they're going to take a look at the flow that is coming in, decide if they want to fill it at a better price than the passive LPs will fill it at. So, on Balance, ignoring anything that V four might change, it's probably going to reduce the amount of nontoxic flow that hits the passive LPs. There's definitely a trade off between the swapper welfare and the LP welfare, although it's definitely not this purely zero sum game because right now there's a ton of loss external to the system. So I do support the general framing that you kind of want to reduce this loss to arbitrage. I think it's super, super clear right now that AMM LPs pay, like, way too much. Because you see some of the folks in this room here bidding, like, ten Ether to be able to build a block where they get to make the first trades.
00:20:24.896 - 00:20:32.360, Speaker G: And that is getting just lost from the AMM system entirely. Just going to the Ethereum holders.
00:20:35.060 - 00:20:49.188, Speaker A: Let's do a test of honesty. Who in this room would consider themselves to be toxic flow? Can you put your hand up? All right, we have a few people in here.
00:20:49.354 - 00:21:01.130, Speaker C: Yeah. Another show of hands. Would any of you want to be makers on only the orders that Citadel and Jump and Jane Street and everybody who just raised their hand didn't want?
00:21:09.040 - 00:21:52.132, Speaker D: Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, cool. So we've worked recently with Balancer at Cowswap on an integration. It's still experimental, so it touches on certain pools, not all of them, but essentially the idea is that our solvers that are the one that executes the batch so the orders in the batch can access those pools at 80% discount on the fees. So this is to say that the logic there is rather that even some of those orders may be matched by private liquidity. Because we have a batch, some of these orders may be matched peer to peer, so within the batch with coincidence of wants. And what is left, however, is still considered non toxic.
00:21:52.132 - 00:22:37.640, Speaker D: So much so that Balancer is willing to give a very large discount or is experimenting with this idea of giving large discount to the flow coming from Cowswap. In this sense, I will tend to agree with the idea that what is left doesn't need to be toxic necessarily, but definitely we act in the interest of our traders, period. We do not have the LP side. So this is kind of an initiative that we started that seems beneficial to both of us, but ultimately we are working in the interest of the traders.
00:22:39.260 - 00:22:56.030, Speaker B: I think a lot of LP leaking value is due to price discovery happening on off chain venues like Binance or other faster exchanges. What is this panel's opinion on how can price discovery, especially for the most liquid assets can happen on chain? Maybe, Eugene, you can take this question.
00:22:56.580 - 00:22:57.088, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:22:57.174 - 00:24:04.464, Speaker G: So at least at Ellipsis, our opinion is there's all of these really sophisticated liquidity providers that exist in traditional finance. They've been playing on these electronic markets, they've invested tens of billions of dollars in r D and infrastructure into getting really, really good at providing liquidity and sort of the result of this competition. And there are a bunch of, like, zero sum or negative sum aspects of it. But the end result really is that on these centralized exchanges, there are really, really competitive prices, really, really deep liquidity, because the way you compete as a liquidity provider is by providing better prices or by providing at the same price with more size. So in contrast with the AMM approach, which is sort of taking this very prescriptive view on what liquidity ought to look like with limit order book, you sort of let these liquidity providers put the liquidity wherever they want to put it in a way where you're, again allowing them to compete on price. You're allowing them to compete on size. And the result of this game, which might be zero sum or negative sum between them, is better prices for the non toxic flow, for the swappers.
00:24:04.464 - 00:24:46.876, Speaker G: And in this world, yeah, there's probably very little role for the passive AMM LP, and I would argue that that's okay. I don't think there's any reason that passive capital necessarily should be able to make a return or be providing better prices than a citadel or a jump trading, who, again, has spent so much resources into getting really good at this particular task. And if we're able to put all of this on chain, then maybe you're still never going to be quite as efficient as binance, but you can approximate something that's more likely to facilitate some of the price discovery happening on chain.
00:24:47.068 - 00:25:39.488, Speaker E: So I'll disagree with that a little bit. So, yeah, you're right in a TradFi, right, market makers compete. The problem is they don't necessarily compete on price. A lot of times, to be honest, they compete on who gets first position in the queue. If you ask any HFT market maker, would you rather have the best alphas in the world or would you rather always get first queue position on new level formation, nine out of ten of them are going to tell you, we just want the best queue position. So the reality is, traditional markets and order books or even professional liquidity always turns into this PvP game. So if citadel and Jane Street are competing for order flow, even if that order flow is non toxic, it becomes toxic because they're both bidding against and therefore they don't bid as aggressively as they could, right? Because if citadel outbids Jane Street, right, they're implicitly eating Jane Street's alphas, right, like taking the other side of that.
00:25:39.488 - 00:26:12.024, Speaker E: So anytime you introduce a PvP dynamic, you introduce this adverse selection problem which inherently raises the cost of liquidity. So one thing that I think is really interesting about AMMS is you basically take away the PvP game. One reason I think AMMS actually can beat professional liquidity and can provide better prices is without the PvP games, you can provide really aggressive pricing than you can when you don't have these professional liquidity providers competing against each other and holding back because they don't want to eat each other's.
00:26:12.072 - 00:27:32.916, Speaker F: Alphas I would add to that, in fact, there was a paper doing exact this analysis. So they take, I think central limit order book data from Canadian Stock Exchange or somewhere and they sort of compute the counterfactual liquidity assuming the priority is parata instead of price time priority. And then you do see that better risk sharing among LPs would marginally improve liquidity given some assumption on risk preference. The other question I would have for Eugene is, as far as I know, that the reason that we have this thesis that AMM liquidity providers are kind of picked against is because long block times and latency compared to centralized exchanges, which it would be reduced somewhat if block times are shorter. But fundamentally even Solana block times are like 100 years compared to binance, right? So does building central limit order book on a blockchain really solve it for professional market makers? If that's a dynamic that's always going.
00:27:32.938 - 00:28:47.608, Speaker G: To play out, yeah, that's a good question. I think the actual answer is we will just have to see in practice as the participants in the market become more and more sophisticated. Long block times definitely still a problem for Solana, although not to the same degree as they are on ethereum. I think the main difference here between the active liquidity and the passive liquidity is the passive liquidity is effectively paying the arbitrager some amount of money to move the price to the quote unquote correct price, which maybe we will just agree for now is whatever the price is on binance and the liquidity is following some curve. So there's some amount of some size trade that needs to happen and then there's some loss inherent in there with a active liquidity provider. Kind of the hope is they can move their prices before someone is going to toxically pick them off, essentially like moving the prices for them. And there's a bunch of nuance here as well, for example, like you're playing these top of block games, but there's, I think, a lot of room for innovation here in the same way that there's a lot of room for experimentation with the microstructure of the AMM.
00:28:47.608 - 00:29:09.188, Speaker G: I think one of the most exciting things about working in the DeFi space is we have this opportunity to really play around and experiment with different microstructures and have conversations like this one. Whereas if you're the Nizy and you want to implement even like a new order type, this is a process that's going to take like three years. We can sort of just roll it out tomorrow and see what happens in a live market.
00:29:09.354 - 00:29:20.264, Speaker E: I'll just add actually, we actually just completed some research on this block times, and we're actually working with blocksroute on this about kind of an instant inclusion type hook. So I'd see.
00:29:20.302 - 00:29:20.504, Speaker G: Okay.
00:29:20.542 - 00:29:42.480, Speaker E: If you can actually guarantee sequencing when things arrive, how much less is the toxic order flow? And it's pretty substantial when you go from 12 seconds down to I think we found, like, diminishing returns are you pretty much hit diminishing returns at like 100 milliseconds, 50 milliseconds. So I think that's kind of the sweet spot, at least based on the Ethsdc pools and the order flow.
00:29:43.060 - 00:29:44.896, Speaker B: Uri has a question. Uri has a question.
00:29:44.998 - 00:30:08.760, Speaker I: So I want to ask actually, Doug, on what you just I was surprised that what you said about that AMMS could by not having toxic order flow, could actually potentially give gradually better. But does mev, as the guy who's against mev auctions, the existence of mev auctions, does that make it a PvP setup in which puts it back to users to getting the worst price or not?
00:30:08.910 - 00:30:36.032, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, that's definitely the case. If you do have an auction, right, there's still going to be some competition. You can play around with it, though, and you can say, okay, maybe instead of an auction every block, you auction off the right for the next, whatever, 12 hours, or something like that. That's basically what Citadel does. That's why retail order flow, you don't compete on every single order flow coming through. Right. Citadel comes up with a contract because they don't want to compete on every single order that comes in from Robin Hood with Jane Street or whatever.
00:30:36.032 - 00:31:12.190, Speaker E: Right. They bid, but they bid at a larger granularity where it's less of an issue. So the cool thing, again, going back coprocessors are really cool because now everything's on chain we can make assertions about, okay, you've held this position, have you met certain criteria? You're eligible to participate, you're not eligible to participate. Again, it's on chain, so we can all agree, like, what the results are. So I think we'll have to experiment in terms of how do we do those mev auctions. But, yeah, I do believe kind of auctioning off larger granularities reduces the adverse selection problem.
00:31:13.680 - 00:31:45.972, Speaker I: Follow up on that is that you all kind of say, well, you know, really price discovery happening on Binance, which is we all know what Binance is doing right now, or how it's doing. But from my perspective, if, you know, being tagged behind CFI, it's always going to be like a sidecard. It's not going to be the real thing. It's just like where the arbitrage happened and a bit other. Do you guys think price discovery can happen on DeFi? And is it important or not? Like, I think it's important, but you might disagree.
00:31:46.036 - 00:32:17.932, Speaker E: The big thing. That's really missing right now, to be honest, is perps. You just have so much more liquidity and volume on perps, on centralized exchanges, and that's where price discovery happens. And unfortunately, perps are kind of a hairy issue because of the regulatory stuff around it. Fingers crossed it won't be soon and maybe some of the AMMS or DEXes in the room would like to support perps. No promises, but yeah, I think you need something that's kind of more capital efficient for price discovery to happen and I think kind of perps make more sense even in equities.
00:32:17.996 - 00:32:18.224, Speaker H: Right.
00:32:18.262 - 00:32:21.940, Speaker E: Most price discovery happens on the index futures, to be honest.
00:32:22.010 - 00:33:01.164, Speaker D: Yeah, on this point. And then I wanted to say something about active and passive liquidity provision. So I don't think it's particularly important where the price is determined, at least for the point of view of an LP that is afraid of being exploited, LVR and so on and so forth, because you could have a very large location on chain where this is where the price is determined. And if you are some other AMM, you still have worried that you may get exploited. And even if you have two equally large location on chain, when one goes off sync, some Arbitrator will come in and try to rebalance the two location, but by doing that can create LVR.
00:33:01.212 - 00:33:01.856, Speaker F: In both of them.
00:33:01.878 - 00:33:41.196, Speaker D: So in some sense it might be important for other reasons, but I don't think it's particularly important for the point of view of Arbitrage. So exploiting LPs now. And also just one thought on the passive versus active liquidity provision. This is very much, in my view, a debate that is the artifact of certain design that don't protect the LP against Arbitrage coming into rebalance. And so then it becomes very important that you manage your liquidity so that you always maximize the amount of revenue you get from noise traders to compensate from the fed that the design exposes you to. This comes. Okay.
00:33:41.196 - 00:34:12.836, Speaker D: In universal V three, you have the kind of where you want to place your liquidity. And in general there is this research showing that more volatile token pairs people provide less liquidity because they are more exploited by Arbitra. And by providing less liquidity, the amount of fees from noise traders that are generated are distributed on fewer, so they earn more from those revenues. But if you have a design that somewhat limits or eliminates LVR, then I don't think the issue of passive versus active liquidity provision arises anymore.
00:34:12.948 - 00:34:13.608, Speaker H: Got it.
00:34:13.694 - 00:34:14.088, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:34:14.174 - 00:34:15.816, Speaker F: Just want to add one more point.
00:34:15.918 - 00:34:17.972, Speaker B: Which is after that we'll have to open the floor.
00:34:18.036 - 00:34:18.650, Speaker D: Sure.
00:34:19.580 - 00:34:20.810, Speaker B: Not even questions.
00:34:22.860 - 00:34:35.820, Speaker A: You mean? Those weren't questions? All right, now we're going to wrap it up and then move on to the next panel. But we have a lot to talk about order flow in the next panel as well. So if you guys are still in the room, you can still participate informally from the seats.
00:34:36.740 - 00:35:15.310, Speaker F: Should I say it? Okay, one last point, which is maybe obvious fact that people often miss when we talk about more high frequency stuff of things is on the 200,000 tokens that's being traded on Uniswap, you have like, maybe 200 that's on all the exchange combined. Right. So you do see 99.99% of the tokens have price discovery on this permissionless system, which is why we're building it. And you don't have to get listing department of any of these exchange to approve. So that's definitely one upside that we should pay attention to.
00:35:17.440 - 00:35:22.040, Speaker A: All right, I'll wrap this up here. Thank you so much. To the panelists. Give it a round. Round of applause.
