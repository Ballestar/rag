00:00:01.450 - 00:00:19.946, Speaker A: I want to introduce our moderator for this panel. This is Rajiv. He recently joined the Frontier team. And, I mean, this is going to be a really packed panel. I think we'll have a lot of spicy debate about the future of blockbuilding. So without further ado, I'll just hand it over to you, Rajiv.
00:00:20.058 - 00:00:27.990, Speaker B: Yeah, it's nice to see everyone today. Thanks for coming out. I want to talk content, so we'll just do really quick intros, starting with Matt.
00:00:28.570 - 00:00:40.890, Speaker C: Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Matt Cutler. I'm founder and CEO of Block Native. We're a Ethereum relay block builder, gas Estimator, mempool specialist. And hopefully many of you here have used our tools.
00:00:42.670 - 00:00:50.990, Speaker A: I'm Nathan. Bit of a background as a searcher, but I'm currently leading the adventure at Frontier the Builder.
00:00:52.050 - 00:00:58.510, Speaker D: Hey. Kubi. Co founder of Gatica, the team that operates the Titan Block Builder.
00:00:59.330 - 00:01:02.218, Speaker E: I'm Tom. I work on async builder.
00:01:02.394 - 00:01:13.890, Speaker F: Hi, everyone. Uri from blocksroute. We're an infrastructure provider, a block builder, a relay. If you're doing anything in DeFi and mev probably use us or know us also for everyone.
00:01:13.960 - 00:01:17.590, Speaker B: Could you each say if you're a searcher builder or not for the audience?
00:01:18.330 - 00:01:22.070, Speaker C: So block. Native operates builders, not searchers.
00:01:22.810 - 00:01:27.190, Speaker A: Yeah, we are not a searcher builder at the moment. Completely neutral.
00:01:28.010 - 00:01:29.990, Speaker D: We're also a neutral builder.
00:01:31.290 - 00:01:32.470, Speaker E: No comment.
00:01:36.350 - 00:01:48.080, Speaker F: We run a builder, but in general, because we're a service provider, we don't do actual search. Or maybe we work with other partners who do it, but we ourselves don't do it. Cool.
00:01:48.690 - 00:02:07.090, Speaker B: When I think about block building, there's, like, three key ways to kind of differentiate to win blocks. You can have better access to order flow. You can be better at bundle merging. You can have better infrastructure. I'd love for everyone to stack rank what you think is more important for winning more blocks?
00:02:09.190 - 00:02:18.620, Speaker A: I think order flow is king at the moment. We would hope that in the future, merging would matter more, but just right now, it doesn't matter anywhere near as much as ORderflow does.
00:02:20.750 - 00:02:46.530, Speaker D: Pretty much agree. I think there's a threshold of certain order flow that is not exclusive today that most builders can have access to. So in the short term, though, technology and being better at merging an infrastructure will give you an advantage. But without the order flow, in general, you don't have the building blocks to build blocks.
00:02:48.710 - 00:03:04.726, Speaker E: Yeah, I think same thing. Order flow is most important. I guess if you have a really shit pipeline, then you're not going to win any blocks. But you still need the order flow. Right.
00:03:04.908 - 00:03:49.414, Speaker F: Okay. Spicy take to the different direction, and I'm not sure I believe everybody sitting in a panel here. Block building is in the domain of those who can do CFI DFI arbitrage. As Frontier showed, 60% of all mev comes from CFI DeFi arbitrage. And the amount that's being paid to the validator is not the 95%, but somewhere between 37 and 77. So average 50% so maybe you do need order flow because without it, then you're at a disadvantage, but it's done by the CFI DFI arbitrager if maybe they're all very good. So it's not a big differentiator between them, but between them and everybody else.
00:03:49.414 - 00:04:01.146, Speaker F: What makes them the kings, not the king among them, but really at the top is CFI DeFi arbitrage, a lot of capital and the ability to do that, willing to get pushback against it.
00:04:01.328 - 00:04:03.500, Speaker E: You just said order flow in a different way.
00:04:04.110 - 00:04:07.226, Speaker B: It's just order flow that certain people might be generating themselves.
00:04:07.328 - 00:04:22.800, Speaker F: Right. That's exclusive. Okay, I took order flow as okay, the transaction on chain out there, et cetera. Well, in reality, okay, these are counter trades to CFI trades. I want yours. Say it, Tom.
00:04:25.010 - 00:04:35.026, Speaker E: I mean, it's the same, right? It's just order flow. It's like bundle flow, whatever. If you don't have these transactions to include in your block, you can't build a block. Right. It's the same thing.
00:04:35.128 - 00:05:15.726, Speaker A: I think you also have to make a distinction here between the amount of blocks that you have and the value of those blocks. Yes, if you're talking about block space value, consume, then probably CFI DeFi is kind of king. But if you're just talking about raw inclusion, then I think that just general order flow matters a lot more. The CFI DeFi trading alone won't get you all of the smaller blocks where there's not the large mev opportunities. I feel as if it's the case in which it's more so. When you're referring to HFT trading, I feel as if you can sort of group it into, let's see, I would call it exclusivity of order flow. So more so both external order flow, but also the order flow that you create internally from HFT trading as well.
00:05:15.828 - 00:05:40.470, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm going to build a spicy take on top of URI's spicy take, which in the supply chain that we have, you can abstract it down to three classes of actors. There's a trader class actor, there's a validator class actor, and there's a sucker class actor. So you can go through and you can say user. Which one of the three are they? Oh, really? Right. What about, I don't know, relay operators?
00:05:41.630 - 00:05:42.186, Speaker F: Oh, right.
00:05:42.208 - 00:05:57.360, Speaker C: So it's like literally just go through and you can say, well, either you're a trader different type of trade, there are various types, or you're a validator or you're a sucker. And this, I think, is super dangerous for the long term health of the network. And we should be talking about that.
00:06:01.490 - 00:06:07.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good point. Do we want to build systems where the customer is a sucker or do.
00:06:07.384 - 00:06:11.090, Speaker C: They all involve in trading? Like either you trade or you're a sucker.
00:06:11.510 - 00:06:26.200, Speaker B: So going to the trading side, it seems like the only people really making money on building are the people who are also trading. So how do people think about just making money in building generally considering that for any of us to continue at this long term, presumably have to make money at some point.
00:06:28.910 - 00:07:18.938, Speaker D: So I think in the short term, there is non significant amount of revenue that can be made if you are a top builder without trading, just by having edge on the things that we already discussed. So the nature of the auction is such that over time and it's already happening, the margins on those are going to be compressed. And so then there are two paths for it. So one, are you going to be an integrated searcher builder? So trade make more revenue that way, or do you create additional value and generate revenue that way? That's also part of our thesis. There is significant amount of revenue that you can unlock as a neutral builder, and that's what we're going for.
00:07:19.024 - 00:07:23.222, Speaker A: Do you have some examples of things that might unlock additional value as a neutral builder?
00:07:23.366 - 00:07:51.346, Speaker D: Sure. So in the short term, if you think specifically about services that are targeted at the most sophisticated consumers of block space today, which are traders, and so services that facilitate or almost put traders that are not vertically integrated on par with vertically integrated builders, that is value add and you can charge for that.
00:07:51.448 - 00:08:00.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I take the same view that building in general, you're operating an inclusion service for searches primarily. What can you do for them as a customer?
00:08:01.210 - 00:08:26.346, Speaker F: Do you feel you can give it to all? Like you could either vertically integrate or you're saying, well, you could offer this as a service, but there's a lot of trust and nuance there. Do you consider these? Well, builders could offer it to their users in general, or is this okay? I can pick one or two or three customers and give them access to is it very exclusive?
00:08:26.538 - 00:08:44.660, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's not exclusive. It's very similar to, let's say, blocksroot offering mempool streaming services, low latency distribution. So it's almost about commoditizing the edge that an integrated builder has today and then giving everyone the same access.
00:08:47.530 - 00:08:49.990, Speaker F: So why don't we have more builders?
00:08:51.530 - 00:09:11.820, Speaker D: So block building itself is a very hard job. And so I think in order to be relevant as a builder, you first need to control enough block space so you're interesting enough for other players to take you serious, which is a hard problem to solve. So a high barrier to entry and once you are there, start innovating and using the leverage you have.
00:09:16.590 - 00:09:19.022, Speaker F: I disagree, but I'm going to push it about in a second.
00:09:19.156 - 00:09:31.940, Speaker C: So it is interesting to contemplate sort of how much of the Ethereum network is on the stage right now. I mean, just between the relays in Urian and block native, it's like 40% or so, give or take. And then among the builders, I would guess it's about the same. Is that fair?
00:09:34.230 - 00:09:35.518, Speaker F: I hope it's stable.
00:09:35.614 - 00:09:37.746, Speaker A: There's well over 80% in the room.
00:09:37.928 - 00:10:25.910, Speaker C: If you want to count it's probably 95, 99% in the room as well. I think one of the interesting opportunities around this space, while the building may ultimately be some flavor of trading or some latency games, there are a lot of opportunities potentially surrounding it, like around observability. As we think about the complexity of the ethereum roadmap, one of the general vectors is more mempools. Mempools have really poor observability properties and that is the why of why everything happens. And so if you think about mempools as the root of mev, then observability becomes really important and entities like us and obviously like boxroad as well, add a lot of value to the ecosystem. And so we're looking for opportunities sort of on the edges and surrounding to add economic value and to receive. The key is adding economic value and receiving economic rewards as a result.
00:10:25.910 - 00:10:32.470, Speaker C: Because today this current structure is that receipts of economic rewards is highly asymmetric.
00:10:33.290 - 00:11:00.766, Speaker F: Pushing against what Kubi from Titan said. Are block builders entrenched? Because as you all agreed, order flow is king. And if somebody is a big block builder, if I'm building 30% of the blocks, then everybody who has a bundle, all the searchers will send me bundles. They can't decide, well, I don't trust Titan, so I don't know.
00:11:00.788 - 00:11:02.366, Speaker B: You will trust because otherwise you give.
00:11:02.388 - 00:11:09.918, Speaker F: Up on 30% of your revenue opportunities. So if you're a big block builder, are you entrenched to remain a big blocker?
00:11:10.014 - 00:11:27.142, Speaker A: Yeah, order flow begets order flow to a large degree. You have a position in the market, you become more trusted. It's sort of like a self reinforcing cycle and there's barriers to entry. Like most of the builders have to pay you for a subscription. Right. It's like quite expensive. So there's these fixed costs that you have to incur to even be in the game.
00:11:27.196 - 00:11:28.680, Speaker F: But that's a good thing though.
00:11:29.610 - 00:11:55.598, Speaker B: It's also like we've seen this with new builders in the market. Some searchers find that their bundle inclusion rate with certain builders just isn't up to par. And as a result, they either consider building or potentially send their order flow to other places. So order flow is important, clearly. Does anyone pay for order flow today? Would you be willing to pay for order flow today if you could? And do you think you will end up paying for order flow in the future?
00:11:55.684 - 00:12:03.038, Speaker A: I think everyone pays for order flow. Like if you set up nodes, you're paying for order flow. No matter how you get it, you're basically paying for order flow.
00:12:03.134 - 00:12:04.206, Speaker B: Exclusive order flow?
00:12:04.238 - 00:12:04.386, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:12:04.408 - 00:12:20.570, Speaker A: I guess the question is like mechanisms around that and I guess does it always need to be exclusive? Sometimes you might just want it faster. So I think the design space for this is complicated, but yeah, exclusive order flow is really important and it could end up being a kingmaker for builders.
00:12:22.510 - 00:12:23.900, Speaker D: Do you pay for it?
00:12:25.230 - 00:12:27.740, Speaker A: Well, we pay blocks throughout right?
00:12:28.510 - 00:12:31.770, Speaker F: I don't buy order flow, I sell order flow.
00:12:33.490 - 00:12:44.260, Speaker B: Quick question. I guess not everybody here was necessarily building sort of right around the merge or just shortly after the merge. Some people were there much faster than others. Why did everybody start building?
00:12:46.550 - 00:12:50.290, Speaker A: It's just fun. It's like a mev strategy that combines.
00:12:51.750 - 00:12:53.554, Speaker F: Sorry, I just had a quick question.
00:12:53.592 - 00:13:35.666, Speaker G: For QB on essentially having a neutral builder and kind of making that profitable, right? You can effectively create an intent layer and allow people to communicate their intent and optimally execute on that. But how would you then incentivize and monetize that by taking a portion of the profit? If Rsync or I mean more concerningly Beaver builder could do the exact same thing, not monetize it, because they have the advantage of getting that additional order flow, but on top of that, they can then pick off the 20 univ three LP pools and profit off that. So they don't really have to monetize that side.
00:13:35.768 - 00:13:36.226, Speaker F: Right.
00:13:36.328 - 00:13:43.362, Speaker G: How do you then compete in that world? Because they don't depend on the suboptimal execution of transactions like Sandwich Searchers do.
00:13:43.416 - 00:13:44.500, Speaker A: They don't really care.
00:13:45.450 - 00:13:46.920, Speaker G: How do you solve that?
00:13:47.850 - 00:14:28.494, Speaker D: Well, good question. I think in general they don't control 100% of the block space. Even though there are few players that dominate certain short tail strategies like Beaver and others, there is still an interesting enough amount of block space that is open for neutral builders. Also the reason why we are building out these services for other trading firms that actually compete with these larger trading firms but are not vertically integrated, they still generate valuable enough flow. And so that is the position or the value add over.
00:14:28.532 - 00:14:39.750, Speaker A: New, I think you also said something really interesting earlier about identifying what are the benefits that other builders are getting for this vertical integration? How can we turn that into a product and how can we offer it to searches?
00:14:40.970 - 00:15:23.294, Speaker C: Is Max Resnick still here? Where's Max? Oh, there he is. So talk to Max. So Max has some great research that says the sextex arbitragers win blocks when there's high degrees of volatility on Binance, right? So they don't need to win every block, they just need to win the blocks that they need to win. Right. And again, this is these negative cycles that you can have, these external forces that exert pressure on the network because of the monolithic block. And my view of this is steady state. We need to move to partial block building so that the guys at Beaver who are doing sex arbitrage hypothetically can win that piece of the block and then others who have other applications.
00:15:23.294 - 00:15:30.440, Speaker C: Because again, I think we want to build an ethereum for everyone and everything, but it's increasingly an ethereum for a very elite group of traders and that's not great.
00:15:31.850 - 00:15:46.810, Speaker B: So I know those sextex arbitragers are looking for low latency with the node operators to get it in last possible second before the block is proposed. I'm wondering if relays pay for colocation with node operators to get lower latency.
00:15:48.750 - 00:17:00.526, Speaker F: I don't think anybody pays for colocation with nodes. We don't, and I don't know of others that do. We invest heavily in propagating information at the speed of light around the world. So because nodes could be anywhere, it's not like, well, you have eight centralized exchanges around the world right next to which you can co locate if you're in TradFi, but here it's much bigger, it could be in all sorts of data centers around the world. So for us it's a big investment in infrastructure and speed of light propagation. And Justin came up with the idea of like, okay, optimistic relaying, that reducing shaving off milliseconds and whatnot, et cetera, in order to be ready at the last possible moment, but using that as an opportunity to say latency games still very much exist, whether you like it or not, they're just really at the last moment. So you could imagine that CFI DeFi, Arbitragers, who are the strongest actors out there, will have the lowest risk, the closest they are to the execution.
00:17:00.526 - 00:17:23.946, Speaker F: Like, what's the chances of that happening? I know exactly what the prices are. They make the act and really wait till the last possible moment. If you can shave a millisecond, then it's slightly less risky and you make slightly more money. So these games still very much exist at the last moment of building blocks and trying to improve them. Don't know if any of the builders here have something to add.
00:17:24.048 - 00:17:45.940, Speaker A: I don't think latency games are necessarily a bad thing because they are primary value drivers to end users. It's just a question of can you encourage the benefits of latency with appropriate guardrails for users? Can you give them guarantees around decentralization and censorship or whatever? I think that's a better approach than saying decentralization at all costs and we'll solve customer problems later.
00:17:47.430 - 00:18:10.422, Speaker F: I strongly agree with that. I would also say we actually like Arbitragers. Like, if you're here, definitely you like yourself, but Arbitragers doing a good thing and we want Arbitragers to correct the price at the fastest possible. Like, it is a good thing. A lot of people say, well, latency games, that's TradFi, that's bad. I strongly disagree with that. There's a lot of good things about latency.
00:18:10.422 - 00:18:26.190, Speaker F: There are bad stuff, there are people getting sandwiched, which is a bad thing, like there are users bleeding money, that's what we should try to solve for. But latency by itself is a good thing. We want DeFi to compete with CFI, we want it fast, we want it effective, we want it good and valuable.
00:18:27.170 - 00:19:07.740, Speaker C: On the subject of colocation, to URI's point, the validator proposal can be anywhere in the world, so it's hard to colocate, but there's a pretty small number of relays, like seven that matter, and colocation from builders to relays is a big deal. It's not, I think, a big money deal but everybody asks where you are because they want to have lowest latency and one of the areas that we at Block Native are working very hard on is basically distributed relaying. So we cannot have one relay in one geography but many relays all over the world. The great thing about this is it's really fucking expensive and the other great thing about this is we don't get paid anything for it. So it's awesome that we get to finance the operations of Lido and other folks because that's super sustainable and we're excited about it.
00:19:12.670 - 00:19:19.754, Speaker F: Joke, joke. Why do you say it subsidizes Lido? Why Lido?
00:19:19.882 - 00:19:22.766, Speaker C: Well, who's an example of Lido we work with?
00:19:22.788 - 00:19:26.480, Speaker F: We like it easy. We love you, but don't disconnect validators in.
00:19:27.570 - 00:20:25.362, Speaker C: Sorry, sorry. So Lido is just the biggest. So if you look at rate, there's many dashboards out here on what we do. And if you look at rated network, it says quite clearly that the value of an Mev boost block on average is between 300 and 400% of an illa block. So the primary beneficiaries of the supply chain are the validators who get a higher return for block validated and therefore offer a better APY, which is great, we all know that, right? The challenge, of course, is that there's a whole bunch of layers in the stack that have nice names but ultimately are suckers because the economics that the value flows downhill in the supply chain and that therefore, you have many actors who don't have great economic incentives and therefore you don't have high degrees of participation and therefore you have counterincentives and therefore you have centralization. So anyone who's in the relay world knows is tired of me hearing about this. But today we have seven relays that matter.
00:20:25.362 - 00:20:48.794, Speaker C: It's not a stable equilibrium. And so tomorrow we're either going to have two relays that matter or we're going to have 25 relays that matter. Right? And which version of that future do we think is better for the health of the network? And what incentives are we putting in place to encourage that version? And the current incentives today are no incentives and therefore why would anyone stand up a new relay? Because they're just going to lose money.
00:20:48.992 - 00:20:59.546, Speaker A: I guess there's some benefits of synergy with vertical integration, right? You'd expect there to be lower latency between builders and relays and that would benefit the relay but that doesn't seem like a good business model to encourage.
00:20:59.658 - 00:21:05.694, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean if it's not profitable, right? Like everybody could just stop running relays and people will find the right incentives.
00:21:05.742 - 00:21:31.898, Speaker F: To potentially don't say it out loud, don't give us relays. But no, the entire point of the relay is to sit between the block builder and the proposer. If we remove that relay, if we say, well, we can vertical integrate with the builder, we like our builders, then it's okay then there's nobody in between them. That's part of the flashbot mev boost design is to have an entity so one doesn't screw the other, and a.
00:21:31.904 - 00:21:53.162, Speaker C: Wise man who's in this room called that mev Dystopia. The whole point was to avoid this vertically integrated stack to recreating the existing CFI model, and yet we have incentive schemes which seem to be trending in that direction. And so my argument, as many have heard, is let's start to introduce some changes to the incentive schemes to try to increase participation at more layers of the stack.
00:21:53.306 - 00:22:05.670, Speaker A: Did you miss my presentation earlier? Out with the old Maybe supply chain doesn't exist anymore? I was going to say my vision for a relay would be they get paid for providing guarantees on builder behavior.
00:22:07.690 - 00:22:08.440, Speaker D: Ho.
00:22:12.490 - 00:22:17.894, Speaker A: The optimistic relay is a good example, right? Like you bond with the relay and they'll slash you if you do something.
00:22:17.932 - 00:22:36.622, Speaker F: And I want to throw a question out there. Do you feel that in the current setup there is still a strong vertical integration pressure between searchers and builders and really across the stack? Not even really we just talked about, but elsewhere as well.
00:22:36.676 - 00:22:58.166, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a very strong vertical integration pressure between builders and searchers building is a searching strategy to some degree, and they're just using searches for the things that they can't fill the gaps in their in house trading if you're a vertically integrated builder. So there's very strong pressure there, as you can see from beaver build and how much of the market they control.
00:22:58.348 - 00:23:02.978, Speaker F: So should we expect all builders to become builder searchers, in your opinion?
00:23:03.074 - 00:23:24.720, Speaker A: It's a difficult question just because you would think if you're an order flow provider, then ultimately you probably want to go with a more neutral builder. But that's not playing out in practice today. But I think some of this is a question of things like Dex design and things on the app layer which will control more of what the future of this looks like. I would hope that neutral builders are more the future.
00:23:25.650 - 00:24:07.414, Speaker F: My thinking and I'm curious to hear the builder's thinking is that if you are the builder and you created two bundles or there are two opportunities and each one of them is worth a dollar, then if you are a searcher then you can say, okay, this one could pay anywhere between zero and one. And this one could pay anywhere between zero and one. But if you're the builder, you can take both of them and decide between zero and two. So we have a lot more flexibility. It's not like one or the other. So I would expect builders to be more profitable surgeries and for that to be the reason for vertical integration, because they have more flexibility, not just within a bundle, but across everything. So I know you're really curious to hear your take on the counterparts.
00:24:07.462 - 00:24:47.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I think in general, in practice, it is not realistic for one entity to be super competitive in terms of all the different kinds of strategies that exist. And so even in terms of Beaver specifically, not on the stage, but they're killing it. Let's say on the CX Dex front, there are a lot of other value extracting strategies that you can run within a lock, right? And so if you were to say I would generate all of that in a house, you wouldn't be able to compete with the aggregate value overall in the ecosystem. That's my thesis.
00:24:47.762 - 00:24:50.330, Speaker A: Do you think Jared from Subway should run a builder?
00:24:51.790 - 00:25:02.974, Speaker D: I think if you are a sandwicher, it is much harder to have value that is unique to the entire block itself.
00:25:03.092 - 00:25:09.950, Speaker A: I guess he's competitive on block space consumption with even CFI DeFi traders. Like theoretically he could run a profitable builder.
00:25:10.850 - 00:25:11.600, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:13.890 - 00:25:53.440, Speaker C: To Kubi's point though, you don't need to be good at everything all the time. You just need to be good at one thing and then certain times that becomes the most important thing. So during periods of high degrees of asset volatility on certain centralized exchanges, certain strategies basically dominate everything else. And so if you happen to want to do something like an NFT trade at the same time, the universe of potential avenues to get on chain shrinks to potentially just one. And so that 1 may cycle around, but there's still only one or two actors in many situations that effectively control inclusion, exclusion and ordering. And that's not great.
00:25:55.730 - 00:26:36.746, Speaker F: So asking a question about is this a good outcome? I was just speaking yesterday at the PBS salon and somebody was presenting don't remember his name, about like, okay, how good is it? How decentralized is it? What's the risk here? And I was thinking that the existence of builders and especially a small group of them is potentially dangerous. Because if I am a very big and strong builder, what's the cost for me to dominate everything? It's kind of like, well, I don't always build the best block, but what would be the cost for me, the marginal cost? I build a good block, not the best block. If I wanted to win 90%, how costly would that be?
00:26:36.848 - 00:26:39.834, Speaker B: Definitely less than like 100 E a day in low volatile times.
00:26:39.872 - 00:27:06.200, Speaker F: And can I way less than 100 E to build 99% of wallets? Can it be profitable? So if I know I'm going to win this next box, I'm going to outpay anybody else, can I make better CFI DFI trades or something with a lower risk? Could it actually be a potential profit to as a builder subsidize and capitalize? How costly or even profitable would it be? I don't know the answer I'm curious for takes.
00:27:07.370 - 00:27:25.980, Speaker D: My take would be that the total value that you can extract, like being very good at, let's say a very short tail strategy in aggregate would not be high enough to control 100% of the block space.
00:27:26.350 - 00:27:28.378, Speaker A: We see subsidies today. Right?
00:27:28.544 - 00:27:59.030, Speaker D: Yes, it's a good point because most subsidies actually are very tactical in nature. Exactly. You're not actually bleeding. Most billers at least don't bleed a large amount of their profits into subsidies. And that's just the dynamics today. And if you use all the profits that you make from, let's say, CX trading to then get 100% of the block space, what's the point of CX trading?
00:28:00.730 - 00:28:20.300, Speaker F: I'm actually more worried about censorship, resistance. I'm not doing it to make a profit, but does it make ethereum more fragile that I could take that route and it won't cost me a gazillion ETH to stake and capture it by holding a lot of people? Can I capture it by controlling block building?
00:28:23.070 - 00:28:25.358, Speaker E: What do you think the motivation is to do this?
00:28:25.444 - 00:28:31.422, Speaker F: I am very evil. I want to censor all transactions who are sent by people whose address start with one.
00:28:31.476 - 00:28:31.854, Speaker C: Right, sure.
00:28:31.892 - 00:28:37.246, Speaker E: But if I'm doing this, I just bleed money and then I just go bankrupt.
00:28:37.278 - 00:28:37.860, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:38.230 - 00:28:59.100, Speaker F: What's the point, really? Not thinking as a trader, thinking as a state actor. Like resistance and antifragility off ethereum. Does block building make it worse? Because the difference is kind of like yes, it pays a lot of money, but the marginal difference between blocks might not be that big. So the cost.
00:29:03.950 - 00:29:19.918, Speaker A: Yeah, I just don't think it's a sustainable, long run strategy. Like you're just going to burn your ETH, you're not going to make any profit from it. Blockchains align rational economic actors. I think that's a highly irrational thing to do. I just don't see it playing out. Maybe it's a good marketing spend for.
00:29:19.924 - 00:29:21.120, Speaker C: An Alt l one.
00:29:23.170 - 00:29:23.920, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:29:24.790 - 00:30:21.380, Speaker C: I had a question before it's been mentioned monolithic block building and the idea of getting away from it. So what are ideas to do? So would like a system of recursive auction work. Could you be able to import part of the technical research from PBS and adapt it down in the MAV food chain for builder searcher relations? One of the areas I think of interesting research would be sort of searcher builder communication before blocks to basically allow negotiation between various actors and move stuff around. A budy of mine is doing a business called Primev that's basically trying to build exactly this. And one of the things we hear from talking to other searchers is the lack of information that they have to deal with creates a lot of inefficiency. So theoretically, with better information sharing, which again has its own risks associated with it, you could get more efficient use of block space.
00:30:23.430 - 00:30:27.810, Speaker E: Do you think searchers would be happy for you to sell their data to other searchers?
00:30:29.930 - 00:30:55.974, Speaker C: That's the trick now, isn't it, is the sharing of what information you have, what block you have. But a very simple example would be we have a block that's worth one ETH in our relay or in our builder. And Uri has a block that's worth 1.5. ETH. We know we're going to lose the block, but we have transactions that we want to make sure get in. So we say, hey Uri, can you include these for us? Right. And there could be a negotiation about that relatively rapidly.
00:30:55.974 - 00:31:14.580, Speaker C: So he still wins the block that he was going to win and we can still offer certain guarantees, for instance. Right. And I'm not saying this is something we are likely to do, I'm just saying that that seems like a useful model where the sort of pre consensus the network can agree on, well, they're probably going to win the block. So then that's all worked together to make sure it's the most efficient use of block space.
00:31:15.110 - 00:31:24.630, Speaker A: Do you think that would like drive builders towards order flow parity possibly, where I guess you compete on merging as the next edge.
00:31:25.850 - 00:31:31.834, Speaker E: Why wouldn't searchers just do this themselves? I don't care who executes between these.
00:31:31.872 - 00:31:57.106, Speaker C: People because any one searcher doesn't have again, this is not me, I'm just something I'm aware of, any one searcher doesn't have sufficient information to decision appropriately. Right. It's a collective information problem. And so the problem is by participating you reveal some information, but in return you can be much more efficient. And so there's a frontier here that you could go through. So NetNet is this feels to me at least like partial block building is a pretty interesting avenue to go down. And Max has something to say about.
00:31:57.208 - 00:32:11.000, Speaker H: I just wanted to jump in on this subsidization point. I think it's really a question of degree. So I'd actually like to ask everybody on the panel, could you guys put your hand up if your builder has ever subsidized blocks or plans to subsidize blocks in the.
00:32:13.050 - 00:32:15.494, Speaker F: Build? I didn't raise my hand about it. I didn't hear the question.
00:32:15.532 - 00:32:18.550, Speaker C: So that doesn't have you ever subsidized a block?
00:32:19.690 - 00:32:57.138, Speaker H: So you guys are all doing it, just question of whether you will do it to a degree that's potentially really harmful to the network. And I think just to touch on Yuri's point, censorship resistance is not just about a state actor coming in. It's not about keeping Al Qaeda from trading on chain. It can be about stopping an option from being executed or something like that. So it can really be about stopping bids from coming in in an auction as well. And so if you had a lot of control, 60% or even 100% for like a 1 hour period, you could use that to really manipulate certain financial markets and make a lot of money from it.
00:32:57.224 - 00:33:07.190, Speaker A: In practice, most subsidization occurs in an environment where the order flow is relatively equal. So all the builders have the same order flow and they're just like competing to pay the most to get the block, essentially.
00:33:08.590 - 00:33:21.550, Speaker E: If you were to do something malicious and profit from it, why would you call that the subsidy and not like the gas? You are willing to pay for this transaction.
00:33:26.210 - 00:34:01.154, Speaker H: Through my phone, I would say you might just subsidize, right. Just so that you can kind of control that marginal transaction getting in. And then because you're subsidizing already, it's not an additional cost that you're paying. And also, I think subsidization, the reason you guys probably do it is because it helps you get order flow, right. If you were the only block builder for a day, that would give you a lot of order flow. Like, say you're some random builder, doesn't build any blocks, then all of a sudden you want to do a marketing stunt, build every block for the whole day. All of a sudden you're on the radar.
00:34:01.154 - 00:34:02.730, Speaker H: You're going to get a lot of order flow.
00:34:04.030 - 00:34:20.640, Speaker A: If we were building all the blocks for one day, though, I imagine that we would still be including all the transactions that we get. We'd just be like paying over the top to get all the blocks. Otherwise it's going to cost hundreds of not I guess I'd argue that we still wouldn't be censoring anyone.
00:34:28.280 - 00:34:37.704, Speaker B: So right now, most sex dex arbitrage on chain is simple arbitrage, right? Not complex. But like, say Citadel starts trading on chain a lot.
00:34:37.742 - 00:34:37.944, Speaker E: Right.
00:34:37.982 - 00:34:53.440, Speaker B: Citadel has proprietary alphas. They spend a ton of money on them, closely guarded. They don't even want people seeing them. Right. Because that might influence sex trading as well. Is there any reason Citadel would use neutral block builders instead of just using Citadel builder?
00:34:54.500 - 00:35:30.190, Speaker D: Yeah, my thinking would be it is much harder to bootstrap like a block builder, and it's getting much harder as the market matures. So it's not simply just whipping up some infrastructure, even if you have the highest performing, like technology HFT, whatever you actually need to bootstrap a marketplace. And with the way that the market is developing and the additional things that builders are going to have to do in order to stay relevant, that's just becoming harder and harder. So it's becoming more of a platform than just like a technology end piece that you just run.
00:35:31.920 - 00:35:34.110, Speaker C: If I were a citadel, I'd just buy somebody.
00:35:35.680 - 00:35:37.100, Speaker F: Are you offering?
00:35:38.480 - 00:36:05.830, Speaker C: We had this conversation yesterday at PBS salon, but I think this is a risk we should consider. It's like you have outside people who have deep pockets and no expertise. You have poor economics, but a whole bunch of folks here. And these entities are not just going to roll under a rock and go away. They're going to try to sell their assets. And so, again, I think at the end of the day, the nature of the incentives should be healthy or it creates negative outcomes. And so I think we have work to do here.
00:36:06.440 - 00:36:11.370, Speaker B: Building has changed a lot since the merge. Where do you guys think it'll be a year from now?
00:36:15.340 - 00:36:26.700, Speaker A: My prediction and hope is that merging will become a more important edge and that a lot of these games around order flow and exclusivity will become less relevant. We can compete on things that are actually driving efficiency.
00:36:28.720 - 00:36:53.990, Speaker D: Yeah. My take would also be, like I've said already, that builders will have to do a lot more things than just block building, especially if you're neutral. Also with things like intense account abstraction, running a bundler, solving lots of other things that builders are well positioned for. And I think most builders that are going to survive long term will have to do that.
00:36:55.720 - 00:37:37.170, Speaker F: I think additional pieces in the landscape will shape out. Thing I'm working on, and I've totally random, just heard that somebody else is working on something similar like additional services, pre confirmation, instant pre confirmation. These are stuff that don't exist in the Mev auction, but it's kind of okay comes with it. If you think about partial block building, you could imagine a proposer like selling instant confirmation or something like that. Also censorship, resistance. But I think more than anything, things will also shape around block. Not only new services from block builder, but also different pieces being added to the system around it.
00:37:37.780 - 00:38:05.500, Speaker C: I think builder reputation will matter a lot. I mean, we had the survey before about what percentage of transactions will be private and I think the room sort of said approaching 50%. Well, private transactions, you got to select who you send to it's. An area that we are working actually quite hard on is simplifying all of this. But at the end of the day, those entities that have access to private transactions will be more competitive and you have increasing complexity and increasing privacy. It's technically gnarly is, I think, the proper term.
00:38:07.280 - 00:38:28.880, Speaker E: I kind of think there'll be more like maybe not like everyone will be a searcher builder, but I think there'll be a lot more actors in the space who have leverage, who have some economy of scale and they'll kind of try to do more things themselves. I think it'll probably be a little bit more diverse than just searches, but I think it's like the trend.
00:38:29.040 - 00:38:36.230, Speaker C: It would also be professionalized where if you don't have deep pockets, you can't build. And that's, again, another thing to consider.
00:38:36.840 - 00:39:00.750, Speaker A: I think we have one more question from the audience and we'll have to move to the next panel. Thank you for the extremely interesting conversation. I wonder, how do you guys see the builder discovery process evolving in the next one and five years compared to today's ad hoc discovery based on reputation or dashboards and so on?
00:39:03.460 - 00:39:11.010, Speaker D: I don't think it's going to change. I think reputation is going to matter even more. And so it's branding almost.
00:39:12.500 - 00:39:23.540, Speaker C: We talk a lot about the relevancy bar. If you're above relevant, you get order flow and then you can be competitive. And if you're below relevant, then you can't be. I think the question is where is that bar and how hard is that bar to achieve?
00:39:24.680 - 00:39:31.624, Speaker F: I agree. Nothing to add on that maybe a bonus question. Make it good.
00:39:31.822 - 00:39:39.352, Speaker A: So as builders, you are incentivized. Let's say two builders each have an edge. You are incentivized to collaborate.
00:39:39.416 - 00:39:39.884, Speaker F: Right.
00:39:40.002 - 00:40:02.770, Speaker A: So how do you think a collaboration between builders could work whilst keeping the system decentralized and keeping your profit to each other? Yeah, I think it'd be good to have an approach like that where people have a comparative advantage in one thing and they work together. I think that's a great approach. Have you guys considered paying less in base fee just for fun?
00:40:05.960 - 00:40:09.316, Speaker F: But now that you say it, I.
00:40:09.338 - 00:40:28.410, Speaker E: Think it's also kind of a risky thing to think about because at the end of the day, this is probably some form of market manipulation, and you don't really want to step in that direction. Like in a market, you can't collude with other people in the market.
00:40:29.500 - 00:41:08.340, Speaker F: As somebody who doesn't do CFI DeFi arbitrage, when people ask me about that specifically about like, well, manipulating the base fee seems a good way to make money. I think that because CFI DeFi arbitrage keep a lot of the money to themselves and it doesn't reach to the validator, the current business is good enough, let's not shake the boat kind of thing. It's kind of like, do we want to if they weren't making money CFI DeFi arbitrage in general, then we would see more of that. They probably have a good enough business. So it's kind of like, okay, let's not change anything. It's working right now. Similar to how validators make a lot of money.
00:41:08.340 - 00:41:12.312, Speaker F: Okay, this works. It pays a lot of money. Let's keep it as is.
00:41:12.366 - 00:41:19.000, Speaker A: How do you think the builder landscape changes once profits from C are internalized to LPs?
00:41:21.100 - 00:41:21.992, Speaker F: Are they?
00:41:22.126 - 00:41:26.776, Speaker A: I'm saying in the future, if they are. Yeah, if they are, how does that change the builder landscape?
00:41:26.808 - 00:41:45.190, Speaker F: So that goes to the question of kind of like, okay, there's money on the table. Then Mev came around. Okay, obviously validator take all the money. And now well, no, now users auction. Okay, we're going to try to capture some of the money. So now it's this tug of war being pulled in all directions. I don't even know what to do.
00:41:45.190 - 00:41:58.230, Speaker F: I'd rather not be in the sucker group all of a sudden. Yes, all the pieces try to figure out where they extract value, and it will be somewhat depending on their power, I think.
00:41:59.320 - 00:42:03.188, Speaker A: All right, unfortunately, we got to wrap up the panel here, so thank you so much.
00:42:03.194 - 00:42:04.260, Speaker E: To the panelists.
