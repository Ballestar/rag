00:00:15.250 - 00:00:31.280, Speaker A: How long do we make sure I don't overrun? Right. Yeah, this is dark side as well. Yeah, this is supposed to be the more dystopian side of things.
00:00:34.690 - 00:00:36.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:00:43.490 - 00:01:10.390, Speaker A: All right, we have about 30 minutes. To be very brief. My phone. All right. Hello, everyone. This is the searchers and market makers panel. I hope you're very excited about it.
00:01:10.390 - 00:01:32.030, Speaker A: We have a few exciting speakers with us. They represent, like, a wide range of searchers. I would say from the more traditional side of searchers and traders to the more crypto native. So I'll ask them to introduce themselves briefly, and then we'll get started with some questions. This is only 30 minutes, so we'll pace it well and try to go over several topics that are hopefully interesting.
00:01:33.040 - 00:01:34.232, Speaker C: My name is Nathan.
00:01:34.296 - 00:01:41.696, Speaker A: Wait, tap on it. No. Maybe could Nathan mic be turned on?
00:01:41.718 - 00:01:42.320, Speaker C: This is working.
00:01:42.390 - 00:01:43.136, Speaker A: All right. Yeah.
00:01:43.238 - 00:01:47.940, Speaker C: My name is Nathan. I run a mev firm, and we operate on a number of blockchains.
00:01:48.520 - 00:01:49.270, Speaker A: Nice.
00:01:51.000 - 00:02:00.760, Speaker D: I'm Dean. I am the co founder of a fund called Dialectic. And internally, we also run a prop shop that focuses mainly on mev.
00:02:01.900 - 00:02:06.410, Speaker B: Hey, guys, I'm JHL, and I'm formerly from Alameda Research.
00:02:07.660 - 00:02:13.980, Speaker E: Hey, I'm tarun. I found a gauntlet and also used to be in trading.
00:02:15.120 - 00:02:56.904, Speaker A: All right, I'll expand briefly on what I meant by the background here. So Tarun used to be a more traditional quant firm. J, alameda is kind of this middle ground where they trade on more, like, centralized exchanges, or you used to be at Alameda, traded on centralized exchanges, and then Dean and Nathan are like, fully crypto native, maybe do some stuff on centralized exchanges. But the point is we have this wide spectrum. Great. All right, first thing I'd like to talk about is whether you have any limits as to what your activities are. I mean, by this, ethical limits, as well as what you decide you don't want to do and how you think about these things.
00:02:56.904 - 00:03:11.820, Speaker A: Also, as a side question, how do you think about your competition that might not have the same limit as you and how you think about that? If anyone wants to take the question, you don't all have to answer. Nathan, maybe. Or Dean.
00:03:12.320 - 00:03:37.830, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess my philosophy is just not to engage in any kind of extraction which is hurting the user experience of the blockchain. After all, without users, there will be no mev in the future to extract. So it's kind of like a forward looking proposition how I would react to other people doing that kind of negative value extraction. I guess when they go low, we go high, so it wouldn't really change our outlook. The users always come first on any blockchain that we're on.
00:03:38.780 - 00:03:42.010, Speaker A: What's an example of things you don't want to do?
00:03:42.380 - 00:03:44.308, Speaker C: I'm anti sandwiching.
00:03:44.484 - 00:03:45.210, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:45.900 - 00:04:21.220, Speaker D: Dean we kind of have the same view. We don't touch things that we think is going to hurt in the long run. Like for example, if we're doing Sandwiching, we think about, is this going to stop users from using uniswap? If it does, it means that we can't do Arbitrage anymore and things like that and so we won't do certain things like that. We don't really care what our competition does. We don't really look at our competition. I think we're better than our competition anyways, and so I don't really care what other people are doing. We play in our own little ballpark.
00:04:22.200 - 00:04:27.670, Speaker B: Yeah, elementary research is very similar as well. No sandwiching or front runs or anything like that.
00:04:30.060 - 00:04:41.320, Speaker E: I haven't done anything since 2021, so I don't know if I have any very good answers other than no multi block mev.
00:04:41.900 - 00:04:42.650, Speaker A: Why?
00:04:43.580 - 00:05:13.270, Speaker E: I actually think multi block attack, multi block extraction actually is the most deleterious to user users in the long run. It kind of like completely changes the UX. Also, from the perspective of the protocol's operation, you tend to see a lot more like high value extraction that kind of can kill some protocols. I think the inverse finance thing was a great example of that.
00:05:15.080 - 00:05:39.950, Speaker A: Okay, so maybe one follow up question on this for you is even though Nathan and Dean, you kind of say when others go low, we go high. Isn't there this dynamic over time that the searchers that are more or less ethical or share a different type of ethic that somehow makes them more money, they can just reinvest that money in their resources and just grow bigger than you over time?
00:05:41.440 - 00:06:04.820, Speaker C: I think there is some benefits to being like value adding to the ecosystem and that searches who are engaging in these negative externality activities often face some kind of repercussions. So maybe the blockchain itself is hard fork to sort of cease their activities or maybe they have trouble networking, they can't get sort of the relationships that they need. So I think that these things are sort of like short term profit maximizing, but not long term profit maximizing.
00:06:05.640 - 00:06:45.520, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Thank you. So maybe to follow up on that, I feel like this question was more directed to the crypto native searchers because I think in the more traditional game, even in centralized exchanges, I think you're somehow bound by regulation more than you are in crypto. And so switching back to more of you guys so again, Turin is not trading currently, but was part of a trading firm before. I want to make that clear. Again, how do you think about mev in the centralized world? So, Jay, we briefly talked about this and you mentioned sorry, go ahead. All right.
00:06:45.520 - 00:07:19.020, Speaker A: You mentioned that you kind of looked at mev as a particular set of extraction strategies that were, for example, related to gas optimizations. And then I had argued briefly that actually doing market making is also a type of mev activity. So how do you think about mev and centralized systems? One, two, should it be democratized the same way that the same kind of discourse that we have for decentralized systems. Should that apply to how mev instantiates in centralized exchanges?
00:07:20.160 - 00:08:09.260, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So yeah, I think we had a pretty interesting conversation about this. A lot of it stems from the fact that I think that more centralized blockchains and even centralized exchanges can affect the mev landscape on the more decentralized blockchains as well. So one example of this is, for example, on Solana, whenever a leader is selected in the leader rotation schedule, they're given like four blocks, and oftentimes due to centralization of stake, they're given like eight blocks or twelve blocks. And so this creates a window of time in which no state updates occur other than those selected by the leader. And so this allows them to do like atomic arbitrage against even more decentralized venues. And so the centralization of stake, for example, places like Salana maybe can affect these other venues.
00:08:09.260 - 00:09:16.870, Speaker B: And this can also be seen with centralized exchanges as well, right? So you can perform a kind of weird atomic arbitrage between centralized exchanges and a venue like Solana where you submit on, for example, FTX. And then if you get a hit there, then you can perform the other Lego arbitrage on Solana, assuming you're in one of these windows. So yeah, I think from my perspective there's definitely some negative externalities of these other more centralized venues on the decentralized blockchains. And so first of all, I think it exists in terms of the second part of your question on how we can democratize. And also I think it should be democratized as to not centralize these other blockchains in terms of how we can democratize them. That's one thing that I'm not super sure about. Maybe the more crypto native people can chime in here, but definitely it's something that Alameda research thinks a lot about and we're interested in opening up the conversation about this.
00:09:18.840 - 00:10:13.270, Speaker E: One thing I think that's actually kind of interesting in the centralized world is the rebate mechanisms basically dominate a lot of arbitrage. So for instance, FTT is the greatest example, right, in order to really earn rebates on trades FTX, you stake FTT, and if you're actually a big maker, you definitely have a huge economy of scale, kind of not so dissimilar to the stake concentration in layer one proof of stake type of thing. I think democratizing mevzac for these proof of stake networks seems incredibly hard compared to proof of work. It's just you don't have any secret leader election that actually can work in prod yet, and so I feel like we're still like five years away from that. So proof of stake networks definitely will have way more extractable value.
00:10:13.960 - 00:10:19.896, Speaker A: Can you expand on that? Why is knowing the leaders in advance a source of centralization of value?
00:10:19.998 - 00:11:04.672, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think it's much easier to do off chain agreements if you have any advanced notice of future blocks and a lot of the leader selection algorithms either A, have some weak grinding affinity. So if there's sort of more than a certain amount of concentration, the way the distribution sampling goes has some bias based on the choice of epoch length or sort of what the minimum stake quantities are. And it's just easier to do these kind of like side agreements when you actually have some advanced notice kind of to your point on solana blocks.
00:11:04.816 - 00:11:19.336, Speaker A: Okay, so what I'm hearing from both of you is one you're saying before even caring about democratizing mev in centralized places, democratizing it in proof of stake networks is already very difficult to do anyway.
00:11:19.518 - 00:11:20.250, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:22.720 - 00:11:50.370, Speaker A: Okay. And what I'm hearing from you is that decentralization of one chain can impact the decentralization of another chain and you can expand that concept to centralized exchanges and their centralization and their ordering rules influencing the decentralization of ethereum, for example. So is there any way we can mitigate that, that second question?
00:11:54.200 - 00:12:27.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a fairly hard thing to do and probably it can't be done just through sort of like mechanisms know? For example, I think firms like Alameda Research and other protocol designers and blockchain designers can sort of work together and figure out how to sort of on a social level, sort of move the space into being more democratized. But in terms of on the actual blockchain itself and the mechanics and the protocols, I'm not too sure there although maybe other people have ideas.
00:12:28.360 - 00:12:49.128, Speaker A: So this is a question for the three of you actually. How do you wrestle with internally democratization of value versus concentration, which is what you're doing by accumulating value by trading it's? Like the dilemma is that as a crypto investor you're like concentrating value and then at the same time you're like.
00:12:49.294 - 00:13:32.296, Speaker D: I like to look at everything from an accelerationist standpoint, which is that I'm going to extract as much value as possible because it motivates really smart people to figure out how to democratize this thing. It's an incredibly hard problem to solve. And ironically, I think some of the UX decisions that we're making with proof of stake networks motivate more centralization for concentration of value. Right. Like Lido and east who are essentially a toxic relationship. When you add in Flashbots and the fact that Flashbots and Lido have the exact same investor, it's kind of like weirdly incestuous and probably doesn't motivate greatest relationship for the network itself.
00:13:32.398 - 00:13:33.770, Speaker A: Can you expand on that?
00:13:35.020 - 00:14:05.728, Speaker D: Yeah. When you have an investor or when you have a group of people that is incentivized to ensure that something like Flashbots is used and then also is an investor in a portfolio company that controls a significant amount of the stake on Ethereum, there's probably going to be the chance that the software that is used to extract value on the chain is also run on all those validators that the same party has invested in. Right.
00:14:05.814 - 00:14:09.808, Speaker A: Okay. Because there's a party invested in both and they have like shared incentives.
00:14:09.984 - 00:14:14.356, Speaker D: You incentivize cross pollination between your portfolio companies. We do that all the time.
00:14:14.378 - 00:14:18.360, Speaker A: Right, so how do you deal with that dialectics for your investments?
00:14:19.420 - 00:14:50.960, Speaker D: Good question. I look at this as an acceleration. Okay, yeah, I wouldn't know how to answer that question. I think it's one of those do I think that paradigm would do something evil in that aspect? Probably not. It's just something to consider. Right. I think a lot of us crypto native investors have different incentives than, for example, the more web two traditional investors.
00:14:50.960 - 00:15:17.704, Speaker D: I think a lot of us see the value of ensuring that the network lives and lives healthily in a way where, as we said before, users aren't being squeezed out. But I don't think other parties have the same beliefs. And so it's more about being careful about some of those other parties coming into this space and maybe having different moral and ethical compasses than the ones that we have.
00:15:17.902 - 00:16:09.112, Speaker A: Okay, this is perfect. It's a great segue to my next question, which is in traditional quant markets, usually you have new niches that are created and you have smaller players that capture these niches. And it's not interesting for larger players to come in because they have other low hanging fruits that they look at first. Ultimately that niche grows though, or some of the time, and as it grows, the challenge for that smaller player is you have to grow and develop your moat such that by the time the big guns arrive, you can somehow compete with them. Otherwise you just get obliterated. Right. And so we're not seeing this in DeFi that much, but we saw this in centralized crypto, right, where you have more traditional players that came in Alameda being like a more like native crypto player, but SPF himself back in Alameda came from Jane Street, right.
00:16:09.112 - 00:16:59.930, Speaker A: We have people from Jane Street in the crowd. We have people from Hudson River trading in the crowd and I assume some others that are now trading and market making actively on centralized crypto exchanges that are thinking about going into DeFi. And as to your point, they might not see eye to eye with the ideals that crypto native individuals have. They might have a different time horizon with what they consider like the health of the network, or they might not care at all. They might say, let it all burn, we'll just make as much money as possible and then we'll move on to the next interesting markets that will pop up with a lot of inefficiencies. So how do you think about these new players coming in you as the competition that comes in to the game that you're playing? And generally how do we make sure that they align with the values that we want to preserve in that system?
00:17:01.580 - 00:17:44.116, Speaker D: For number two, I don't think we can. There's no way to thrust your values upon some other party, especially when you have no idea who the fuck the party is. Right. The beauty of mev is that or the beauty of this blockchain thing is that the people I'm competing with I don't know who I'm competing with. It's also really hard to tell, even we do a lot of analytics on the chain as well. It's sometimes really hard to tell what is actually going on. How do I feel about competition coming into this space? Emmy? What's interesting about blockchain and all this stuff is that the playing field is relatively, or I would say it's more level than high frequency trading.
00:17:44.116 - 00:17:55.400, Speaker D: Right. In high frequency trading, essentially what you're competing for at this point is to get as close to Wall Street as possible, to get the shortest cable as possible, so you have the lowest latency to do some trade.
00:17:55.480 - 00:18:03.184, Speaker E: I would disagree with this for one reason, which is people are colocating with Validators now. Yeah, it's the same shit we're doing.
00:18:03.222 - 00:18:20.688, Speaker D: That we are doing that. But you can do that in smarter ways than you can by just like we found out where Validators are without actually paying for any solution to find out where Validators are other than setting up a shit ton of our own nodes.
00:18:20.784 - 00:18:32.868, Speaker E: Don't forget the CME moving to AWS will basically do the same thing. It's more this game of know, spraying a bunch of relay orders, looking at latency distribution.
00:18:33.044 - 00:18:38.596, Speaker D: But anyone could do that. Yeah, and it's a lot cheaper than getting a cable close to Wall Street.
00:18:38.628 - 00:18:50.444, Speaker E: True, but all the regulated lit exchanges are actually moving to cloud type exchanges. Stocks and crypto are going to look the same in like five years.
00:18:50.642 - 00:18:52.060, Speaker D: That's probably true. Yeah.
00:18:52.130 - 00:18:59.148, Speaker C: I mean, in cloud computing it's still trivial to identify the rack that a Validator is on. It's just a process of trial and error.
00:18:59.244 - 00:19:04.960, Speaker D: Yeah, it's sending transactions and seeing which one lands faster on the network.
00:19:05.940 - 00:20:16.072, Speaker B: One comment that I have on this is that I think given the pace at which crypto sort of evolves and the various protocols and blockchains that sort of spawn over time, I think it's actually pretty hard for some. Of the bigger players to keep up just because they have sort of like internal risk departments and things like that that oftentimes gate them from moving as quickly as the more crypto native players in the space. And so even at Alameda Research, we've sort of seen this on maybe a bigger scale where maybe Alameda Research was more dominant in the centralized exchange space than when some of the bigger players came in. And then sort of Alameda Research is now more sort of dominant in the DeFi landscape, whether it's sort of optimizing yield, farming and liquidity providing or things like that. And so maybe those firms will then kind of move into that. And on the flip side, ahead of us are the teams that are optimizing EVM bytecode and things like that, which Alameda doesn't do yet. So I think there's kind of just like this shift that happens over time and the bigger the firm, it's just harder to keep up.
00:20:16.072 - 00:20:22.204, Speaker B: And because crypto evolves so quickly, I think there's a possibility that this dynamic stays in play for a while.
00:20:22.322 - 00:20:46.172, Speaker E: Another thing I want to say that is true, that the bigger firms have a lot of trouble with, I'm talking about Jump, D, Shaw, et cetera, is that anyone who works there, who works on DeFi trading realizes they can just leave on their own and go do it on their own. No one stays. If you actually look, you can basically see there's no reason to stay at a big firm.
00:20:46.236 - 00:20:49.956, Speaker A: SBF is an example of that, right? He left Jane Street, but that was.
00:20:49.978 - 00:21:17.020, Speaker E: At a different era. I think this is much more systematic now where basically it's like, oh, you work at HRT and on doing some bytecode optimization. Literally everyone who worked on that went on their own and started their own fund. So I think the capital costs in DeFi are just so low that it's actually really hard for big firms to keep talent more than anything else. That's like the number one thing I think you can see across the board.
00:21:17.170 - 00:21:58.856, Speaker D: Incentives are incredibly hard, which is why, for example, at Dialectic we started, the Mev team that we started is a new company, which is 85% owned by the team. And so all the profits essentially get paid out to the team. And so the thing we did there is you can do it by yourself, which Mev is very fucking stressful. It's constantly drinking from the fire hose. You're up 24 hours a day because you tweak your strategy a little bit, and the guy who's competing with you found out what you were tweaked and has now done the same edit to their strategy. And so you're constantly changing things. And so I think everyone who's worked in Mev long enough has burned out.
00:21:58.856 - 00:22:27.600, Speaker D: And so with the right incentives, you can motivate people to work on a team. Because it's like, okay, you can make a million dollars a year by yourself, but be up 24 hours a day, or you can make maybe $10 million a month and get 18 hours a day where you have to be up rather than the 24 hours. Incentivizing is incredibly hard and we pay a lot because of it.
00:22:27.750 - 00:22:37.088, Speaker C: Yeah, in my experience, a lot of people in Tradfire are almost begging to leave. They're underappreciated, they're underpaid, they'll get a lot more rewards and a lot more satisfaction being an Mev.
00:22:37.264 - 00:22:40.708, Speaker E: Yeah, very few people stay who end up on the crypto team.
00:22:40.794 - 00:23:08.928, Speaker A: Okay, so maybe argument to that the capital efficiency you're talking about in crypto currently, as we move to this Asynchronous world right, there's like higher capital requirements needed to have this market making like, activity. So isn't that a force towards more concentration where as a single player, you now need maybe ten, maybe 100, maybe 500 million in order to trade properly? So how do we feel about that?
00:23:09.094 - 00:23:46.684, Speaker E: I think every time there's a new electronic market, it takes like five to ten years before you actually can actually get to the scale where you're deploying 500 million to a billion. Just think about how hard it is for Doe to buy $10 billion of bitcoin. There's no fucking way you're deploying 500 million very easily right now. And we're just not at the scale that institutional markets look like. Anyone who's joining now is trying to basically put their stake in the ground in case it does get to that size and then they have enough of a capital base to do it themselves.
00:23:46.802 - 00:23:56.770, Speaker A: It depends on your strategy, though, right? Like, if you're market making, you want to have some liquidity pools in different places and they should be large enough to be able to maximize the opportunity.
00:23:57.140 - 00:24:12.470, Speaker E: I feel like the only places in DeFi you can really deploy that size capital, and obviously you can speak more to this is farming. I just don't think market making is like it's not that capital intensive in crypto compared to everywhere else.
00:24:13.320 - 00:24:17.116, Speaker D: I don't even think you can do it to that large of a scale in farming.
00:24:17.168 - 00:24:17.336, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:17.358 - 00:24:58.384, Speaker D: Like, farming is really so at dialectic, we also run a yield farming fund which we call our delta neutral stable income fund. I can't say how much we have deployed there, but even there we're getting to a scale where we need to start looking at different strategies, because all of the interesting farms, which are the ones which return high profits, the amount you're making goes down drastically with every dollar that you put in there. Right. You can farm with $500 and make a few thousand APY, but the second you put in ten hundred million in there, it's like back to 2% APY.
00:24:58.432 - 00:24:58.884, Speaker E: Right.
00:24:59.002 - 00:25:05.190, Speaker D: So there's not really anywhere in crypto where you can deploy that much because the other side isn't taking out that much.
00:25:06.120 - 00:25:50.980, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And yeah, again, I think elementary research is definitely kind of seeing the same thing. Right? There's definitely limits to all this. But one other thing is I think different firms sort of have different sensitivities to what the return profile of a strategy is. I think in TradFi, maybe they're more comfortable with sort of like, lower returns than maybe in crypto, or there's so many opportunities that they need higher returns to justify doing something. So in that respect, maybe once those bigger players come in, they're willing to put in a lot more size because they have the appetite for that lower return profile.
00:25:52.200 - 00:26:22.700, Speaker A: All right, thank you. We have, like, seven minutes left and I have a lot more questions. Well, a few more questions, but maybe just to continue on that topic to some extent and the topic of competition to some extent, but also of capacity. You mentioned at some point you have like, diminishing returns. When would you and this is more for the two of you, Dean and Nathan, when would you decide to turn off your bots, if that makes sense.
00:26:22.770 - 00:26:31.632, Speaker C: We'll fight for a long time before that happens. I mean, it's competitive by nature, right? You're fighting for every dollar that you get. And it would have to be really not fun for us to actually leave a market.
00:26:31.766 - 00:26:39.348, Speaker A: So, I mean, maybe let me rephrase the question. At what point? And maybe you're still active on ethereum. You don't have to say yes or no.
00:26:39.514 - 00:26:40.870, Speaker C: I'm not allowed to.
00:26:42.200 - 00:27:10.312, Speaker A: All right, all right. I was going to ask, given the profits being given to miners more and more, as was shown in Barnabas'presentation before, and the numbers from Flashbots, there is a point where the margin that you make becomes smaller, right? So there's like this choice of, hey, you have limited bandwidth and time to work on your bots and you have to decide when to turn them off on a particular chain or when the returns are just not exciting enough at that scale. You don't have to answer that question, though.
00:27:10.366 - 00:27:25.010, Speaker C: Well, it's more about the opportunity costs. Should I be spending my time on this or should I be spending my time on that? If the opportunity cost of spending your time on something else is higher, that's just where you're going to naturally go. But there's not like a particular reason you would just leave a chain unless you just were making more money somewhere else.
00:27:26.360 - 00:28:27.030, Speaker D: So we've never turned a bot off because the issues which we faced where profits have gone lower have been an infrastructure problem rather than an issue with the strategy, meaning that someone figured out how to do one small thing in the process a little faster than we did. And usually that fix is relatively easy and we can be competitive again within the next three to 6 hours of discovering what they might have done. And so most of our bots become relatively low maintenance over time. So we have, I think, right now around three or four strategies that are up and running in prod and we maintain them maybe once a week. And so if they become uncompetitive at that point, we do the changes required. We haven't had to turn anything off. I think under some dollar threshold I'd probably turn it off.
00:28:27.030 - 00:28:40.830, Speaker D: If the dollar threshold per hour is less even after a change than what it costs to maintain for those six or 7 hours that we have to every week, I'd probably turn it off.
00:28:42.080 - 00:29:32.692, Speaker A: Cool, thank you. All right, we have five minutes left, so maybe I'll get to that last question I'll ask all of you, given what you know about. So, I mean, what's interesting about High Performance Searchers is that they know the intricacies of the blockchains. They trade on very well, just like high performance traders on centralized exchanges know the fee tiers very well and the rebates they can get and how the queue works and sometimes what's not written in the documentation of the exchange. And so given that, you know, these intricacies, what are the chains that you wouldn't use as a user? Because, you know, users are getting bad deals by trading there, or what are the chains you wouldn't bet on for the long term?
00:29:32.756 - 00:29:38.056, Speaker C: There's like a distinction between me as a user and me as a trader. As a trader, I'm a pragmatist. I'll trade. Where the profit?
00:29:38.088 - 00:29:39.432, Speaker A: So now I'm asking as a user.
00:29:39.496 - 00:29:52.610, Speaker C: As a user, I heavily favor decentralization. So I like to sort of vote with my feet if a chain is exhibiting, like, a large amount of decentralization. That's what I believe in from an idealistic perspective, and that's where I'm investing and putting my personal money.
00:29:53.140 - 00:30:08.320, Speaker D: Yeah, same. And it's ironic because the chains where we make the most profit are the least decentralized. And I don't use any of those chains personally, or the chains that we are making the most profit on, I have never interacted with.
00:30:08.490 - 00:30:11.480, Speaker A: So, in a way, are you accelerating their demise?
00:30:12.460 - 00:30:17.476, Speaker D: As said previously, I look at all of these things from an accelerationist standpoint.
00:30:17.668 - 00:30:25.032, Speaker C: I think yeah, Dean's onto something really valuable there, that there is a value to accelerationism and that you highlighting problems with the chain. It will lead to solutions.
00:30:25.096 - 00:30:25.276, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:25.298 - 00:30:41.890, Speaker A: But to some extent, the chains have to iterate on their design to achieve some level of decentralization. So, for example, at what point do you disclose some inefficiency you found so that it can be patched in a way that it can make the chain more decentralized? Or do you even have that mandate of disclosure after some amount of time.
00:30:42.740 - 00:31:00.970, Speaker D: We disclose bugs that we find disclosure of the chain being completely centralized because you have 21 validators, and they cost $400 million to become a validator. Right. Now, I don't know if I really need to disclose that. That seems like blatantly obvious public information.
00:31:02.060 - 00:31:02.520, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:02.590 - 00:31:30.610, Speaker E: And one thing to add to that is the point of these chains is that this is public. You can go analyze and decide to disclose or like, someone the chain themselves could actually do that. But for instance, the chain Dean is referring to has had some very funny GitHub issues with their developers quitting at different times. Those ones are don't. Yeah. Let's just say I think people are very frustrated there.
00:31:31.460 - 00:31:47.636, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think Alameda is happy to participate on any chain where it thinks that there's a good opportunity to do so. But in terms of general outlook on projects that we want to support and partner with, I think very much so. Aligned on all those fronts, I will.
00:31:47.658 - 00:31:49.540, Speaker E: Never use Waves or Tron.
00:31:51.960 - 00:32:10.488, Speaker A: Okay. All right. We're at time where there's 1 minute. Left, but I want to leave time for the next panel to come in. I don't think we have time for questions. I'm sorry. I saw someone raising their hand, but maybe you can go talk to any of the panelists here, if they're okay with you talking to them.
00:32:10.494 - 00:32:10.964, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:32:11.012 - 00:32:12.912, Speaker A: Okay. I'm approachable. Great.
00:32:13.046 - 00:32:13.680, Speaker B: For sure.
00:32:13.750 - 00:32:31.630, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much for listening. Thank you to the panelists for coming close.
