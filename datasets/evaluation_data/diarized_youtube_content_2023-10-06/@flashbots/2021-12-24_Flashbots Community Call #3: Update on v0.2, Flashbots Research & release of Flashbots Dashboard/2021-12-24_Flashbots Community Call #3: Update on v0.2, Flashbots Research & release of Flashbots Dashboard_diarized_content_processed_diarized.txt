00:00:06.830 - 00:00:08.370, Speaker A: All right, shall we resume?
00:00:11.910 - 00:00:15.860, Speaker B: Yes, let's do it. Should we maybe start from the beginning, or would you just like to continue?
00:00:16.550 - 00:00:18.420, Speaker A: I think we can go ahead.
00:00:20.710 - 00:00:57.650, Speaker C: Great. Sorry for the interruption, everybody, but I hope that today's show of the dashboard is worth it. So again, this is the overall activity of the Flashbots network. I'm going to try and go a little bit quicker to save time, but we have a little bit over 2000 unique searchers that have used Flashbots. And these are the folks that are sending transactions to the Flashbots network. We quantify someone as a unique searcher if they've sent over 20 unique bundles to the network. And this is measuring signing keys in the relay.
00:00:57.650 - 00:01:51.970, Speaker C: Around $45 million in minor profit has been made by miners that are receiving Flashbots bundles and running mev gath, and that is profit after opportunity. Cost is taken away, which amounts to about a 5.2% increase in minor revenue per flashbots block that a miner is running. And we've had just over 90,000, about 91,000 different flash blocks, which we call blocks included with flashbots bundles included in them. We have around 84% of hash rate. That accounts for the miners which are running am, evgeth and receiving Flashbots bundles. We can see here a couple of statistics on bundles submitted versus forwarded.
00:01:51.970 - 00:03:03.580, Speaker C: The interesting thing about this is over time, at the very beginning, it seemed like the rate at which bundles are forwarded to miners was fairly high. The reason why we wouldn't forward a bundle in Flashbots relay is if it failed a simulation, if it had reverts, or if it was not profitable for a minor to include it in a block. And so over time, this started out pretty high, and then since then has oscillated between 20 and 40% is on the uptrend. Over time and on a week to week basis, we're getting a little bit over 3 million different bundles from flashbot searchers. It's pretty cool. Of that 3 million a week, something around 14 to 15,000 end up landing on chain. And in the last 10,000 ethereum blocks, we can observe roughly 35% or so of those last 10,000 blocks have Flashbots bundles included in them.
00:03:03.580 - 00:04:05.870, Speaker C: And we're using up just over 2% of the total ethereum block space in the blocks where Flashbots bundles are included. So if you take the gas limit of a block and you look at just particularly what part a bundle is capturing, that's about 2% trending down over time, but a little bit of an increase. Recently, if we look at searchers, you can see that the number of unique searchers that have landed on Chain has been increasing month to month pretty drastically. Last month we had rapid adoption from searchers. So we've gone up from 44 different unique searchers in the relay to a little bit over 600. That's about a 14 or 15 x increase, slightly less from contracts and EOAS that have landed on Chain. But still a pretty drastic multiplier here.
00:04:05.870 - 00:04:49.402, Speaker C: And these are specifically looking at searchers that have landed bundles on chain. The numbers are even higher if they haven't had bundles included on chain. And you can see that split over time on a week to week basis here on the right. And it's interesting is it sort of looks like the searchers who are not having bundles included on chain are getting weeded out because the percentage of searchers that are getting bundles included on chain is increasing over time. So searchers seem to be getting better. This also does correlate in some way with our hash rate too. You can see the distribution of bundle gas prices here.
00:04:49.402 - 00:06:15.302, Speaker C: So this is looking at the gray line is the tail gas price of a block. So the least profitable transactions within a block and then the other colored lines are green, yellow, blue and red are different parts of the distribution of gas prices within flashbots bundles. So the very top of flashbots bundles distribution, the 75th percentile or higher is this blue line, the median is the yellow line and the lower end is the red line here and the very minimum is the green. And you can see pretty consistently that bundles are priced way higher than the tail gas price here, which ends up in profit for the miner. And this is another way of looking at the distribution of gas prices. Instead of looking at the variance where the 75th percentile and 25th percentile is, this looks at the particular numbers and the frequency within particular days. So the big red chunk here you see is the percentage of bundles that are over 300 GWe gas price which is about 46% and then a couple of other I encourage you to go to this chart and hover over the colors and look at it for yourself.
00:06:15.302 - 00:07:07.320, Speaker C: It's pretty cool. And over time, our average gas price of mind bundles is 671 with a median of 316. This is pretty cool. Oh, I'm going to change the date really quick. We have leaderboards that look at the total amount that different searchers have paid over time to miners. It's very difficult to quantify the profit that a searcher has made because that implies that you can look at many transactions in a scalable way and figure out how much they're making and then how much they're paying to a minor. And this is especially difficult if there are multiple different transactions in a bundle where a searcher makes profit.
00:07:07.320 - 00:07:53.196, Speaker C: So we think that we have a scalable way to do this, but it's not quite done yet. And in the meantime, since we don't have the searcher profit, we are using the amount that a searcher has paid to miners as a proxy for that. You can see here on the left the top searcher EOAS measured by the USD that they paid to miners. A couple EOAS are getting up into the millions of dollars paid to miners. And the average minor payment is on the left. So some of these EOAS are paying over $70,000 on average to miners to have a single bundle included, which is pretty wild contracts. The numbers are even higher, which makes sense.
00:07:53.196 - 00:08:43.070, Speaker C: Searchers will use multiple EOAS for one contract. And our top searcher here, measured by the amount of USD they've paid to miners, has paid over $7 million to have their bundles included over time to the miner, to miners. And there are, I think, eleven different contracts that have paid over a million dollars. So pretty interesting numbers. These are different graphs that show sort of the distribution. You can look, just kind of eyeball and see out of the top 25 EOAS, what percentage of this pie are they capturing versus everybody else? It's pretty top heavy. So the best searchers are really good disproportionately so compared to others.
00:08:43.070 - 00:09:32.010, Speaker C: And you can see that compared to the minor rewards that they capture, EOAS consume relatively less gas than everybody else does. So this 41% here is only 34%, which implies that the top UAS are much more gas efficient. And I won't go through each of these, but I do encourage you to take these transaction hashes and plug them into ether scan because they're super interesting. These are the top bundles of all time, measured by the payment to miners. So we have a bunch of different bundles that have paid around $200,000 and a bunch over 100,000 as well. I'm getting a red screen. I don't know what that is.
00:09:32.010 - 00:09:35.290, Speaker C: Can you all see my screen still?
00:09:36.700 - 00:09:38.008, Speaker B: It's red for me, too.
00:09:38.094 - 00:09:45.410, Speaker C: Oh, I'm going to reshare. Sorry about that, everybody.
00:09:45.780 - 00:09:47.824, Speaker B: Yeah, it's working now.
00:09:48.022 - 00:10:32.528, Speaker C: Thanks, Alex. And then you can also see bundles with the largest number of transactions in them, which is pretty interesting, too. A couple of searchers have gotten over 20 transactions included in their bundles. So lastly, we have some really interesting metrics on miners as well. First, looking at the total profit that miners have made from Flashbots, again around 45 million, which you saw on the network page, of which 35 million has taken place in the last 30 days. And it was the most profitable day for miners on Flashbots yesterday. And miners profited $3.3
00:10:32.528 - 00:11:28.716, Speaker C: million from Flashbots bundles in the last 24 hours, which is pretty insane. This works out over time to about a 5.5% increase in minor revenue. You can see here we were a little bit under half a percent for a while until March with an uptick in searcher activity which has been steadily increasing over time, and we're oscillating between 6% and 5.5% or so. Now, it's another way to look at the profit over time, but a cumulative graph, the total amount that we've paid, it's pretty cool seeing the slope change and go up over time. And also the average minor profit in USD per flashbots block.
00:11:28.716 - 00:11:31.970, Speaker C: Looked at the daily average here.
00:11:34.360 - 00:11:34.724, Speaker D: Last.
00:11:34.762 - 00:12:27.260, Speaker C: Month, we paid out $22 million in profits to miners. And already in 13 days in May, there's been $20 million worth of profit from flashbots to miners. So obviously, you're going to crush this number. And here is the daily minor profit that miners are making from flashbots bundles. You can even go so far as to dig into the individual miners. So if we look at yesterday spark pool profited, about a million dollars from flashbots yesterday alone, and you can look at individual pools beyond that too, yesterday, this is again a little bit over $3.3 million and digging into the distribution of USD profit of flashbot's blocks.
00:12:27.260 - 00:13:20.368, Speaker C: So about the way that you would interpret the chart is 57% of blocks pay out a minor profit of between $252.5 thousand to the miner. And if I didn't mention it already, you can click this button at the top and get all of these graphs in either ETH or USD, depending on your preference. We have gas prices here. This looks at the gas price with the red line of flashbots bundles and then the gas price of the transactions that are displaced by flashbaths bundles. So the tail gas prices. And this is a logarithmic chart, and it's very clear here that the red line is much higher than the yellow line.
00:13:20.368 - 00:14:26.870, Speaker C: So miners are making more profit by including these red line flashpots bundles than they are than they would be by including the least profitable transactions in their block which are being displaced to include flashbots bundles and transactions. If you smooth that out and look at the medians over time, this is how that graph looks. So again, the purple line is clearly dominating over the blue line. Blue line is the transactions that are displaced, the tail gas price, and then the purple is flashbots bundles. These were pretty tightly coupled until March with an uptick in searcher activity, and then they diverged and over time have been diverging even more. It is very interesting because we see that this purple line reacts much more than the blue does to increases in gas price. So gas prices increased yesterday and you can see that the purple line just shot up far more than the blue line did.
00:14:26.870 - 00:15:18.804, Speaker C: And the difference between these two is one of the inputs into the function of minor profits. You look at the different miners that are mining flashbots bundles today and the percentage of hash rate that they account for, I won't dwell on that. And then the number of blocks that individual miners have mined, which is pretty cool. This is per 10,000 blocks. You saw this on the network page two. But this is the percentage of 10,000 blocks that have flashbots bundles included in them. So in the last 10,000 blocks, there have been 33% of those had flashbots bundles included.
00:15:18.804 - 00:16:22.392, Speaker C: So about 3300 of those last 10,000 blocks, and again, like many of our other charts, starts pretty flat in an exponential increase around the time of March. Now we're sitting around 30% to 35%. Lastly, you can look at the top flashbots miners, measured by the total ETH that they've earned. So Spark Pool, who has a lot of hash rate, has been paid around $20.4 million, and many miners have made over a million over time, and the average minor profit per block as well. Last thing that I'll mention is if you're interested in the definitions and some of the caveats in this data, the data coverage, our data sources, that is cataloged within the Data and Metrics page. So now I will take a second to check out the chat.
00:16:22.392 - 00:16:29.020, Speaker C: I don't know if we have time to take questions right now or what your schedule was.
00:16:29.090 - 00:16:35.970, Speaker A: Tina, feel free to take the question in the chat, and then we'll move on to V 0.2.
00:16:36.820 - 00:17:35.552, Speaker C: Okay, so Nas writes, is it possible to see what languages searchers use, whether it is in Go, JS or Python or maybe something else? And no, Nas, it's not possible to see this from on chain data. But I will say that the searchers channel in our discord is very leaky. People love to talk about the work that they're doing, and if you just ask, people will probably tell you what languages they're using. So join our discord and yas. I think that's how you pronounce your name. You say, Why do we consider a searcher account unique if it includes 20 bundles minimum? The reason for that is we identify searchers using a private key that they sign their bundles with before they send them to the relay. And it's very easy to generate a new private key.
00:17:35.552 - 00:18:25.740, Speaker C: It's trivial. You could do it in moments if you wanted to. So a searcher could be generating a new private key for every single bundle and signing those bundles if they wanted to. But if the searcher is consistently sending bundles with the same unique key over time, it's probably the same person, or at least there's a higher likelihood that it is the same searcher. So this 20 bundle minimum is a threshold that we set to try to get at unique searchers instead of just searchers using random signing keys for all of their bundles. Any other questions?
00:18:31.970 - 00:18:35.760, Speaker A: Well, maybe answer the question from Nath and then we'll move on.
00:18:36.690 - 00:19:08.686, Speaker C: Yes. Anath says, Wouldn't searchers want to use the same key? That way they are more likely to get included. You are right. In spirit, we want to introduce some form of reputation to the system to encourage that kind of behavior of people using the same key over time. In practice today, we don't have that implemented. So we're still working on what the right mechanisms are for reputation, and right now, that's not in our system. Yep.
00:19:08.686 - 00:19:13.674, Speaker C: Thank you for your questions, Tina. I will hand it back to you.
00:19:13.872 - 00:20:04.474, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks for everyone's question. This is V zero of the flashbots transparency dashboard. We hope that this will eventually phase out our Transparency Report, which was also just released. I shared a Twitter thread and the last tweet is the Transparency Report, so feel free to ask us any questions. And as you can see, there are certain things such as identity, such as reputation, are the things that we would love to get community suggestion on. What is the best approach in digesting, in defining these metrics that can make it useful for all of us. However, let's move on from this exciting new dashboard release to our upcoming Flashbots Core V 0.2
00:20:04.474 - 00:20:16.430, Speaker A: release. And I would like to invite Stefan to share a bit about the changes that has gone into this version. Sorry that I just clicked.
00:20:17.330 - 00:20:18.080, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:20:21.400 - 00:21:16.980, Speaker E: Sure, yeah, happy to go over it. So, B 0.2 is our latest release of the Flashbust Core infrastructure that we've been working on. It aims to provide mainly bundle merging and introduce that to the system such that it increases mining profitability, but also provides searchers with a higher hit rate, which allows for multiple searchers to compete for different opportunities within the same block. We've been working on this for a little while now and we are nearing the completion date. We decide to remove a couple of features from the release which we received feedback from the community on. So the proxy payment contract, which aim to provide a more reliable accounting.
00:21:19.000 - 00:21:19.412, Speaker D: For.
00:21:19.466 - 00:22:20.232, Speaker E: Payments, as well as introduce a method for future additions to the feature set. So basically allow us to modify the smart contract and introduce a way to smooth payments over time. But the community felt there was still some designing and exploration that should be done, so we decided to remove that from this release. The other thing we removed was the ability to submit full blocks from a relay to the Miner. The reason why we wanted to release this one is because of the complexity of the changes on the Miner's node, which could cause some consensus errors. And so it was sort of a high risk feature which we felt we needed more time to test before releasing, so we removed that too. But we're keeping bundle merging, we're keeping better connections over WebSockets and some of the other goodies in here.
00:22:20.232 - 00:23:52.304, Speaker E: So, strict Pot profit switching, which is optional, and test infrastructure, as well as sharing and getting feedback on the Fair market principles. If we have searchers in the chat here, you'll be aware that we've started the searcher upgrade phase, which is going to go on until May 24, and then on May 17 is when the miners will start their upgrade. So on May 17, we'll code freeze the Mev GEF and relay code base, publish a formal specification for all the miners to start to implement, and then over a period of two weeks, they'll sort of do a rolling upgrade. The goal is to get to May 31, having upgraded all the switchers and all the miners to the V 0.2 architecture. So this sort of covers a bit more about the step by step. So for the searchers, what you need to do to upgrade is pretty simple.
00:23:52.304 - 00:24:46.528, Speaker E: All you need to do is change the interface through which you're communicating with the relay. And that can be done by upgrading the libraries that you're using. If you're using the Ethers Library or the Web three Pi Library. If you're just sending raw RPC calls, then you'll want to look at the new RPC parameters format on our documentation to make sure that your submission is up to date. Deadline for searchers to upgrade is May 24, but we encourage you to upgrade as soon as possible since there's no downside to upgrading early. And then on the minor side, we have a bit more of a stage release. So on May 17, when we do the code freeze, this is when miners receive the code and they can start implementing it, reviewing it.
00:24:46.528 - 00:25:33.452, Speaker E: We ask the miners to set up a parallel deployment so that they have both V 0.1 and V 0.2 deployed on different machines with different IPS and to provide us with the IPS of the V 0.2 nodes. The reason we want to do that is have a clean way to fall back if the miner experiences any issues without causing downtime for the minor. So these parallel deployments will start coming online from May 17 all the way to May 31, but we won't send V 0.2 bundle flow to miners until May 24.
00:25:33.452 - 00:27:23.460, Speaker E: So as a searcher, if you are sort of expecting to see your bundles start to be included with other bundles in the block, or you have some conditional logic based on the pricing functions change, you'll see that those will change on May 24 is when we do the cutover. And then between May 24 and May 31, it'll just be about making sure the system is running smoothly, also having the V 0.1 backup. And then on May 31 we'll tell the miners, hey, everything's great, you can now shut down your V 0.1 node and just move forward with V 0.2. So, one of the things we've been working on is the Fair Market Principles, which are a set of guidelines and best practices for both Flashbots as well as anyone participating in the Flashbots infrastructure, including the miners and mining pools on how to maintain a healthy ecosystem for mev extraction. And so the principles cover correctness of how the system is implemented, fairness of treating all sort of participants equally, finality, so not doing some kind of funny stuff with uncles and reorgs to try to maximize profit, but instead to maximize chain stability and privacy around making sure that the bundle content remains private.
00:27:23.460 - 00:28:33.560, Speaker E: And then some of the best practices are more around. How do we make sure that we have high system reliability and in the case of bugs or critical failures, what is the response path? And then penalty and remediation is basically, if some of these are not being followed by the miners, we may disable temporarily their bundle flow just to make sure that the system isn't compromised until we are reasonably certain that they are back online and implemented correctly. So this is sort of our approach to maintaining a healthy ecosystem within the early stages of our releases. So as many of you are aware, I'm sure V 0.2 is still part of our alpha. So the alpha is all the V zero point series and these include incomplete trust guarantees. So slowly, over time, we want to replace all of these guidelines with hard crypto economic or cryptographic guarantees.
00:28:33.560 - 00:28:52.560, Speaker E: And so we are on the second step of our roadmap towards achieving the full set of guarantees that we've set out to achieve. So there's definitely some more upgrades to be seen in the future that will iteratively improve these guarantees.
00:28:58.150 - 00:29:29.600, Speaker A: Great. Thank you, stefan, any questions here for what we are about to release in full force? And feel free to continue to drop your questions if they come up in the site chat and we should move on to the research update. Alejo, would you mind give us a TLDR on the priorities and what we've been working on?
00:29:31.490 - 00:30:30.470, Speaker D: Sure. So we've done a lot of work, especially on e two and the changes that are coming in Ethereum. This was work by Alex and Thomas and collaborators. So the first item there was a presentation Thomas and Alex gave in the global event. So what Mev looks like or will look like after the merge and how validator rewards will be impacted by Mev extraction, I encourage you to check that out. Then there's a coming post, extended post by Alex that he has been working on for some time now on Mev. And it's too this is upcoming, soon to be released, where all the content on that presentation is expanded upon it's.
00:30:30.470 - 00:31:17.710, Speaker D: Super interesting topic, TLDR of that. Is that actually validators? Can expect to get much more rewards if they extract mev. The second item there is a hackathon in which we participated as a team and Thomas and Edgar from flashboards, people from Nethermind and people from Lido working together on Liquid Staking. They actually won the hackathon or were among the finalists, but there was some condition that meant that they won. So we're super happy about that. And yeah, I encourage you to check the prototype demo. There's a video online where they explain their work.
00:31:17.710 - 00:32:07.710, Speaker D: Essentially it's the very early proof of concept of how the Mev landscape would look like and will be extracted by connecting the Nethermind node with the flashboard system and using Lido staking for if two. So, super interesting work and very impressive. They put it up in no time. Finally we had an Mev roast also and as you see, as I said, most of the topics were around e two. So this past roast we had was around scaling ethereum. So not only E two, but also L two S and what the mev landscape looks like there super interesting. There were several talks there two panels.
00:32:07.710 - 00:32:39.878, Speaker D: If you haven't participated in that roast, do check the video. And if you're only coming to the community events, I encourage you to also check our roast. They're super interesting events. They're more technical. They go into the wits of all these problems. Our future challenges we face as an organization and with our auction system. I now will talk a little bit about the flashpot research priorities.
00:32:39.878 - 00:33:31.638, Speaker D: So we're undergoing a little bit of a revamp of our GitHub research repository where we keep the list of topics we work on. And we have the process for grant issuing that we do. We shoot grants for external collaborators to work on some of the topics. I won't go through the entire list here, but some of the highlights there is. First, the auction design. So Surya, an external collaborator, has been working on surveying the work around all the auction literature and how that would apply or not to our. So we essentially the core of Flashbots is an auction system to match the searchers with the miners.
00:33:31.638 - 00:34:19.366, Speaker D: So there's lots of super interesting design questions there, in particular, what guarantees we can give to the miners, what guarantees we can give to the searchers. So there's really interesting problems there. There's even problems to be defined. So I encourage you to check the research repo for more details on what the questions around auction design are. Second topic is cryptographic privacy. As it was mentioned before, one of the approaches to try to deal with privacy. So right now we're running a flashboards relay that's necessary because the bundles searchers send are not private.
00:34:19.366 - 00:35:14.042, Speaker D: So we ultimately want to remove that and ensure a privacy. A. We have issued a grant to Hashclook, the Hashcloth team who is working already on trying to tackle this problem. How can we provide some cryptographic guarantees? Can you go back some cryptographic guarantees to ensure privacy of surgeries? Cryptographic privacy? I don't know why the mev SCX is under this item. So currently the way we're working towards doing guaranteeing privacy is using secure hardware. So that's through an implementation of the auction system that's semi VSGX. We have an ETH research post coming up on describing the prototype system we want to build.
00:35:14.042 - 00:36:00.966, Speaker D: Next steps will be to start the implementation of that and check for feasibility in terms of lag and the delays the sex module inserts in the system. So we want to make sure that that's not an issue. And if that's not an issue, we will go ahead and start building an auction system depending on secure hardware. And so that's upcoming for people to provide more concrete feedback. But we will soon also begin with implementing that. As I said before, there's other ways around the problem of privacy. So Mev STX is one, but we don't want to be fully reliant on secure hardware.
00:36:00.966 - 00:36:52.502, Speaker D: So we're also exploring crypto economic alternatives to it. And that's a much earlier question in the research process. So again, I encourage you to check the research repo for that if you're interested in this problem. In particular, this interacts a lot with the E Two scenario. Some ideas around whether we can use validator keys to ensure privacy so that bundles are sent signed with the validator keys so only the validators that will propose the target blocks for the opportunities can decrypt these bundles. So yeah, that's one alternative. And validators already have bonds, so they will be slashed if they fail to behave as expected.
00:36:52.502 - 00:37:45.046, Speaker D: So there's many questions on how this can be done and whether the If Two setting where we already have bonds can be leveraged to actually do MV extraction and ensure privacy without the secure hardware. As I said before, lots of work on l two. And if two? There's a research post coming up by Alex on E Two. More work needed on l Two. And finally, first sequencing that will be the topic of our next workshop or Roast. As you know, some people have been saying that flashroad, we're enabling thieves by making the auction more efficient. So we've responded to those critiques.
00:37:45.046 - 00:38:31.462, Speaker D: But we do think that first sequence is a valid alternative for exploration. So we want to try to pursue what the limits are of first sequencing. I encourage you to read Phil's post on mev. What do it's? A recent post tackles this question TLDR it's very hard to say what's fair, so whenever you say fair, there's a person saying defining fair. It's hard to try to build a fair system if you don't have an unbiased definition of fair. I don't know, that didn't work. That's the research update in a nutshell.
00:38:31.462 - 00:38:51.154, Speaker D: Again, if you find more or less there's other topics I haven't covered here, but feel free to go to our research repo and check out and ask questions in our Discord research channel as well. I don't know if there's questions in the chat. If you have any questions, otherwise I'll give it back to you.
00:38:51.192 - 00:40:46.028, Speaker A: Tina, thank you, Alejo. I think a lot of I definitely see quite a few researchers here, so I would love to hear some of your questions on research and on a lot of the things that we just presented for every single community. Call it's always been such an exciting but almost felt like information dump because so much has transpired and we just don't have enough time. So yeah, any questions that particularly around our learnings, a lot of learnings around East Two or on essentially the upcoming engineering updates as well as engineering Roadmap or the questions around Dashboard. Wow, quiet day maybe, I think. Let me ask a couple of questions before we yes, it's all about the dogs, so I think a couple of things that are very. Interesting we could share a bit is one is insights on prototyping the mev on East Two with Staking, essentially with Staking contracts.
00:40:46.028 - 00:41:10.020, Speaker A: And second is to share kind of alex, would you be able to share a bit of insights on our discussion on East Two? And second question will be for actually Robert, to share more insights on recent bot activities that you've witnessed. Could be fun to kind of share with some of the searchers and researchers.
00:41:12.220 - 00:41:12.970, Speaker D: Sure.
00:41:13.980 - 00:41:55.350, Speaker B: On e two. So we've given two presentations, one with Tomas who is representing Nethermind but is also working closely with us, and one's the week later at the mev roast that we ran at ETH Global. And so we've shared some of our initial findings there, which are quite interesting. Especially, it seems, that running a system like flashboards in E Two is very doable and it would rely on the same software. And by this I mean the ETH One client would still be used. And so something like Mev GEF could still be used in these two contexts. So that's been quite interesting.
00:41:55.350 - 00:42:26.464, Speaker B: And then further to this kind of exploratory research, tomas Edgar from our team and individuals from the Nethermine and Lido team have kind of prototyped at the ETH Global hackathon or the Rayonism hackathon on the ETH One E Two testnet that was set up, what that would look like. And so we got some insights there that were interesting as well of the.
00:42:26.502 - 00:42:29.424, Speaker A: Specific insights, alex right.
00:42:29.462 - 00:44:02.750, Speaker B: So, I mean, while theoretically it's relatively simple, there are more players to think about when you think about how the mev rewards are split as well as ultimately the block proposal is changed from the miner to the validator. And so the block is, while it's still an ETH One block, it's still proposed on E Two and included as part of an E Two block or beacon chain block. And so there are complexities there in how the mechanism interacts, the kind of mev flow and the tip flow mechanism works. Further to that, I think there's a lot more interesting questions to ask around how resilient the system is and how resistant could it be to potential collusion or malicious behavior. And so I believe the Hackathon team is presenting now at the final and their work is shared publicly. And then in addition, Elejo mentioned there will be a post soon outlining a lot of that research in more details. As well as expanding on some of the interesting topics that have come up from that research, not only from the implementation side, but also from other aspects of what mev and E Two might look like and how the landscape might change.
00:44:04.240 - 00:44:32.948, Speaker A: Cool. Well, thanks Alex. I think there's so much happened in that it's very hard to kind of digest all of it in five minutes. So I think check out our post when they come out and continue to follow us on Discord. And if you're a searcher or a minor. Please pay close attention to our release channel. I think that's a great way to end today's call.
00:44:32.948 - 00:44:40.950, Speaker A: And thanks everyone for staying with us despite the Zoom bombing event happen.
00:44:42.520 - 00:44:43.288, Speaker C: Bye.
00:44:43.424 - 00:44:45.580, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone. Thank you for joining.
00:44:46.240 - 00:44:47.390, Speaker C: Thank you, everyone.
00:44:48.640 - 00:44:49.400, Speaker A: Thanks. Bye.
