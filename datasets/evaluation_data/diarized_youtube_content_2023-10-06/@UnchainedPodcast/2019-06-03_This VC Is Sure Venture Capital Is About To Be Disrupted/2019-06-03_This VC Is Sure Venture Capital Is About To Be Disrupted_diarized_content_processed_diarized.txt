I have two guests Brock Pierce, co founder and managing partner of venture firm Blockchain Capital, and Stan Moroshnik, CEO of the Argon Group, an investment bank for the emerging cryptocurrency and token based capital markets.
00:01:37.334 - 00:02:23.506, Speaker A: The two collaborated on the recent crowd sale of Blockchain Capital's BCAP Tokens, which represent shares in the firm's third fund, which is called the Blockchain Capital Three Digital Liquid Venture Fund. The crowd sale, or initial coin offering, as they're often called, raised $10 million for that fund. And the BCAP Tokens resolve a long standing headache of venture capital the fact that the investors, usually called limited partners or LPs, typically have to lock up their capital for five to ten years before they see any returns. In contrast, BCAP Token investors will be able to sell their shares on a secondary market. After 40 days for international investors and after one year for US. Investors, it looks like people were eager to participate in this new form of venture capital, as the BCAP Token sold out within 6 hours. Welcome, Brock and Stan.
00:02:23.618 - 00:02:25.450, Speaker B: Thanks, Laura. Thank you for having us.
00:02:25.600 - 00:03:01.538, Speaker A: Before we dive into the meat of the discussion, I thought our listeners would be interested in hearing that one of the most exciting interviews I've ever had in cryptocurrency was when I walked into Blockchain Capital's offices right as Brock's phone number was being hijacked. And for those of you who don't know about this, this was kind of a big trend. It's still going on trend is actually the wrong word. It's a phenomenon where people's phone numbers are being stolen by hackers to the hacker's own devices, and then they're using those phone numbers to get access to cryptocurrency. Brock, have you ever had such a dramatic interview with a journalist?
00:03:01.714 - 00:03:32.890, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the timing was interesting. And I have to thank you. I had a good resolution, far better than almost everybody else, thanks to you. Yeah. So my phone was not working well, and sometimes the reception in my office is a little less than perfect. And so right as you're coming into the office, I asked my partner, Brad, I'm like, Call my cell phone and it rings and I hear it go straight to a voicemail for a magic jack. I go, well, that's not my carrier.
00:03:32.890 - 00:04:11.162, Speaker C: And I'm obviously very familiar with this issue. And I've been warning people in a lot of my public know the importance of two factor authentication and that we're really going to need something like three factor authentication. You need the separate device because it's so easy to steal people's phone numbers. But my phone number wasn't in my name, so I felt I was pretty secure from this phone sort of porting social engineering hack. But when my phone was taken yeah, you would happen to be popping into the office right then and there. Fortunately, things worked out well for me. I was able to contact the exchanges and have my accounts frozen across the board.
00:04:11.162 - 00:04:47.782, Speaker C: The hackers got absolutely nothing from me. I was able to remove my phone number from more or less all of my important accounts in a matter of minutes. I caught it quickly, but normally it takes at least at that point, months before you get your phone number back. I was actually very fortunate to have you in the office. You reached out to T Mobile for a quote, which got my situation escalated to the office of the CEO and president, and T Mobile bent over backwards to get me my phone number. They worked with Sprint and things were resolved. And my phone number is now held by the president and CEO's office.
00:04:47.782 - 00:05:00.490, Speaker C: So if you walk into a T Mobile store and you ask about my phone number, I don't even show up. The regular customer service people can't see me. So thanks to you, I've got, like, this incredible service and I got some gifts from T Mobile.
00:05:00.910 - 00:05:11.146, Speaker A: Well, we have a lot to cover today, especially around the BCAP token news. So, Brock, can you begin by telling us how you heard about Bitcoin and ended up co founding Blockchain Capital?
00:05:11.338 - 00:06:07.166, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I've been call it in the digital currency or virtual currency space since the late 90s. It started out with video games, a game called Sanctum, which was like Magic the Gathering or Pokemon meets Chess. And they sold virtual packs of cards, and you would trade these cards with other players in the same way that you would in a baseball card shop or a comic book store. And it was very clear in that instance to see that this intangible object had value. And the insight being that the intangibility of the object didn't make it any less valuable. Its utility was just as much as it had been if it were physical, and in some ways arguably better, because you could play with people all over the world versus just those in your local town. And so I contacted the game company and said, I'd like to buy your virtual packs of cards in bulk, and I'd like to basically run a single store.
00:06:07.166 - 00:06:55.822, Speaker C: I want to replicate what exists in the analog world digitally. And they're like, yeah, that makes sense. And so I started that business up in the late ninety s, and then with things like ultima online and EverQuest and world of warcraft and second life, I jumped into that business. And I was kind of the world's largest market maker for all of these virtual economies. I built up a supply chain of 400,000 people in China that were playing video games professionally to mine digital currency again in games like world of warcraft or second life. And I've done tens of billions of dollars of business in that category, and so it was only natural that bitcoin was on my radar from more or less the beginning. But it wasn't until 2012 where I saw sort of critical mass forming, momentum building, and I finally actually fully appreciated the novelty of the technology in a way that I didn't in the earlier years.
00:06:55.822 - 00:07:26.474, Speaker C: But that's when I said, okay, I was asked by people, what do you think of bitcoin? And I said, well, that, or something like it is the future. I just don't know if the future is now or 25 years from now. And so it was in 2012 where I said, okay, clearly the future is now. Time to drop what I'm doing. And I've been working full time in the space since started a bunch of companies, done a lot of stuff in mining, done things kind of all over the place. But yeah, the principal thing that I do is we built a fund, a leading fund in the space, and we've been having a lot of fun with it.
00:07:26.672 - 00:07:43.790, Speaker A: So actually I wanted to go back to what you were saying about these gaming tokens. You said that you also had people mining those, like in China. What does that mean? Because of course I know what mining means in bitcoin, but I don't know what it means when it comes to a video game currency.
00:07:44.210 - 00:08:20.122, Speaker C: Well, yeah, I mean, we're the original miners. When we talk about proof of work and video games, it has a whole new meaning or an original meaning. And that is that the virtual currency, the swords, the shields, the horses, the castles, these sorts of things inside of these gaming environments had value. And essentially, I was making a market for time. There were people that had too much inventory on their hands and they wanted to pay rent or buy beer. Right? And then you had people that lacked discretionary time but had expendable income. And in essence, I was a market maker between those two groups of people.
00:08:20.122 - 00:08:48.094, Speaker C: And so the people in shop well, the problem is I had more buyers than I had sellers. And so I eventually had to look at the world and say, okay, where is the biggest population of people that have a high propensity to game? And it was pretty obvious to me that it was China. And so I just jumped on a plane and moved to China, not having any contacts. Opened up the Yellow Pages and got an office and hired a recruiter and actually built up a few thousand employees there between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
00:08:48.222 - 00:09:03.450, Speaker A: You were paying people to play video games to collect these shields and horses and swords and et cetera. And then you were selling them to people who didn't have time to play the game, to collect them so that way they could purchase them to employ in the game. Is that what I'm understanding?
00:09:03.790 - 00:09:31.380, Speaker C: I employed hundreds of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of individual people to play these games, to do that, to meet tens of billions of dollars of global market demand. I managed what looked like an altcoin market of hundreds of currencies across hundreds of servers and different games. My main investor was Goldman Sachs. Principal strategy their Prop desk. I think I was their first private investment because they looked at their currency trading desk and they said, wow, I'm managing more markets than they do.
00:09:32.870 - 00:09:34.034, Speaker A: That's really interesting.
00:09:34.152 - 00:09:39.240, Speaker C: And I find that I was, like, 2021 22. I was a very young guy back then.
00:09:40.410 - 00:10:12.126, Speaker A: Yeah, I really like that story, and I like kind of some of the parallels to the way the market is. I guess Burgeoning, or evolving now in Cryptocurrency. And actually then one thing that you sort of alluded to, but I think in that story that you were telling about how you decided in 2012 to get more serious about it is that when you founded Blockchain Capital, and if so, well, I think also Brad and Bart are your co founders. Brad and Bart Stevens? How did you hook up with them?
00:10:12.308 - 00:10:51.962, Speaker C: Well, so Bart and Brad. I didn't start with Blockchain Capital. The first thing I was doing was mining because I was very concerned about regulatory risks. And is the government going to try and shut this down? And I know orange is the new black and all, but I've just never thought that was my color striped jumpsuits don't work on me either. And so the first stuff I was doing is a lot of things around mining. I Had, I Think, 10% Of The Batch One Avalons. And Most Of What I Was Doing was Pretty Stealthy In The Beginning until I Got Kind Of Comfortable With The Idea that, let's Say, The US.
00:10:51.962 - 00:11:34.954, Speaker C: Government Disliked Bitcoin. The world's a big place and its market opportunity is really in the developing world. So if you're smart and you're careful and you're well advised in terms of legal counsel, you can do really innovative things in this space and you can sleep at night. And in part that's what our ICO is attempting to do, is hopefully provide some better guidance for people in the future. But the first thing I did is I'm an entrepreneur by background, so I've built a lot of companies, I've run a lot of companies, kind of call it early stage CEO kind of founder type role. And when I was looking at this industry, I couldn't figure out what company to build. I could build one of the MeToo sort of basic infrastructure plays or something different.
00:11:34.954 - 00:12:17.942, Speaker C: And I saw so many interesting opportunities, I didn't know what to do with myself. So I decided to start incubating companies and I was building a new company every two months. I started Tether and GoCoin and Blade and buying Mount Gox and a bunch of different sort of businesses that I was kicking off. I was starting a company every six to eight weeks, and then I got up to running 810 companies simultaneously. And I kind of call it executive chairman type capacity. And I realized this isn't going to scale either. And there were still more things that I wanted to participate in, more exposure that I wanted, and I could have evolved into more of an accelerator that looks like boost or I decided that the best way to get exposure to the overall ecosystem was as a fund.
00:12:17.942 - 00:13:11.270, Speaker C: And so Bart, Brad and myself started this and I got to know them going back to my video game days. So Bart and Brad were running a 700 million dollar hedge fund when we started Blockchain Capital. They shut that down to do this full time with me, but they were also, for the last decade prior to that, the biggest investors in the video game industry in terms of public companies, they were the main investor in Tencent when they went public and all sorts of interesting gaming companies around the world. And so they were playing World of Warcraft. And I'm going to try and tell the story the way they do, but they were playing World of Warcraft and they were like, wow, we're paying Lizard $15 a month each for our accounts, but we're paying this company, Ige and these other businesses hundreds of dollars a month to buy virtual gold and things. They're like, this is kind of an interesting business. I think this company might be bigger than Blizzard.
00:13:11.270 - 00:13:46.478, Speaker C: They're like, let's go figure out what this industry is, who does it? And they went and found the five or ten biggest, most popular websites to buy World of Warcraft gold. And then they started making a research project of it and looking up who owns these companies, looking at domain registrations and things. And what they figured out is I owned all of them, and I'd already rolled up the entire industry. And so they actually cold called me, like, 14 years ago, and they're like, all right, we think what you're doing is awesome. We want to meet you. And they came down and they offered me a $20 million investment in my company. I'm like, thank that's a sweet offer, but no thank you.
00:13:46.478 - 00:14:28.846, Speaker C: I can do a lot better. And they're like, what? And then I closed an $80 million financing a few months later, led by Goldman Sachs under substantially better terms, but they ended up investing in that round, and my partner, Brad Stevens, was on my board. And so in 2012, I went to my board of directors for what was one of the remaining businesses. I sold my media business to Ten cent. I've had a number of exits in that space, but we had our main Korean business left, where we were doing a little over a billion dollars a year. I had about 700 employees in that remaining business, which is one of the last assets left of that kind of era of my life. And Brad was on the board along with Goldman Sachs and Oak investment partners.
00:14:28.846 - 00:15:05.722, Speaker C: And I said, hey, guys, we're in Korea. We've got 90% market share. The industry is flattening out, and there's not really a lot of room left for growth. So we got to either expand into other territories and start making that kind of expansion move, or we have to start getting into other product verticals. I said, I want to get us into bitcoin and Goldman Sachs and my whole board, including my partners in the case of Brad, everybody laughed at me. Like, Bitcoin? Are you kidding? I'm like, no, I'm actually very serious that I think that there's a big thing happening here, and we need growth. And I think bitcoin is potentially that big market for us.
00:15:05.722 - 00:15:36.710, Speaker C: I said, I want to buy Mount Gox. And they're like, Why? I go, well, Mark Corpellis and the management team is maybe the worst there is, and their technology is horrible, but they have all the market share. We have the management team, and we've got the technology, so let's go buy this thing. And they're like, okay, this is a joke. And basically didn't entertain the conversation. I made an argument and said, hey, I'm going to send you guys some research about what's going on in the bitcoin market and why I think that there's potentially a big future here. And in our next board meeting, I want us to reevaluate because I want to have an informed conversation.
00:15:36.710 - 00:16:13.810, Speaker C: You're taking this as a bit of a joke, and it's a very serious conversation. So three months later, we come know board meeting starts, and I'm like, okay, I want to buy Mount Gox and they still laugh at me again. I'm like, did anyone read the research that I sent you? Did anyone read any of the and the response essentially was no. Well, the person from Oak then went on and led the Circle investment and a lot of interesting things coming to Goldman, but I got a hold of my partners, Bart and Brad. I'm like, you run hedge funds. You invested in virtual currency video game companies. You're kind of Silicon Valley royalty.
00:16:13.810 - 00:17:05.060, Speaker C: How is it that and you're young that you didn't review any of the stuff I sent you and you're still dismissing this idea? I go, It's okay to disagree with me and think that Bitcoin is stupid and that buying Mount Gox is a bad idea, but it's not okay to dismiss my idea when you've done no work to actually understand the market opportunity I'm presenting to you. I'm really disappointed, guys. I can understand Goldman Sachs'response, but you guys know better. You should know better. I'm disappointed. And they actually were so affected by this conversation, they dropped what they were doing and they started contacting every economist, cryptographer, computer scientist, and they went into a deep dive because I basically said, what's wrong with you? And their deep dive into Bitcoin came back with, Brock, we want to shut down our hedge fund and come build a venture fund with you. Full.
00:17:06.870 - 00:17:08.226, Speaker A: Indication for you.
00:17:08.328 - 00:17:31.274, Speaker C: I don't tell this story very often, but that is the origins of how the firm got started. And then I went to Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee and Matt Rozak and a bunch of friends of mine in the space. This was in 2013. I said, hey, I'm going to pass the hat around and let's just start throwing money into all of the cool deals and let's see what happens from there. And now here we are five years later.
00:17:31.472 - 00:18:06.902, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah. Well, I'm glad that you mentioned Bobby and Matt because they are both people who were previously on the podcast. And my next question actually was about these companies that you guys have invested in. I'm sure as you kind of mentioned in the beginning, there were a lot of companies that maybe were a little bit less legitimate or just not really good investments. But several of your portfolio companies have now become some of the top firms in the space, like Coinbase, Chain, Zappo, Ripple, Bitfury, BTCC, BitGo. I mean, there's just a long list.
00:18:06.902 - 00:18:13.850, Speaker A: So how did you guys discern what would be good investments when it came to vetting the different startups in this industry?
00:18:14.510 - 00:18:49.094, Speaker C: Well, the main thing I think as a venture capitalist, from our perspective at least, I can speak for myself and I think my partners, the most important thing that we look for is ultimately the founders. It's the management team. You're investing in people first and foremost. Ideas and everything else are secondary. And in the list of companies that you've named. The founders of every one of those companies are extraordinary people doing amazing things. And the sort of person that you look at, you talk to and you say, I think you might change the world.
00:18:49.094 - 00:19:05.420, Speaker C: And those are the people that you're trying to support and back. And I think we've done a pretty good job of picking the best possible people in the industry. And there's a few deals I'd like that we would be in that we're not in. But I think in terms of overall portfolio, we backed the best people in the business.
00:19:06.110 - 00:19:27.386, Speaker A: Okay, so I also want to hear a little bit more about what it was like investing in these startups during this period up until you had this idea for the BCAP token. So what kinds of trends did you start to notice in terms of what entrepreneurs or developers were doing and also how that might affect the venture capital industry?
00:19:27.578 - 00:20:16.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, between each fund or period, you essentially have a vintage. And the 2013 and 2014 and 2015, each of these years had a different trend. And so blockchain capital was the first venture fund in the world set up to invest in this area exclusively. And in the beginning, it was a lot of bitcoin companies because that's all there was, right? In 2013, the term blockchain wasn't even used very often other than in the case of the blockchain wallet, blockchain info. It was mostly early on, bitcoin companies, the basic infrastructure. In the same way, the internet wasn't very useful until you had an internet browser and an email client and a search engine and content and things to read and ecommerce and things to buy, you needed all that. They call it the bridges, the roads, the tunnels, the basic infrastructure for it to be useful.
00:20:16.398 - 00:21:26.834, Speaker C: And so most of the early investments were in these kind of now iconic bitcoin companies. I'd say that was the sort of first phase. And then it became, how do we use bitcoin technology? Sort of the blockchain, the enabling technology to rearchitect the financial world and the chains and those types of companies that emerged. And then the sort of next wave is, well, what else can you do with this technology outside of financial services and starting to look at media and all of the things that we're doing today, and we still invest across all of them. I mean, bitcoin and cryptocurrency, the digital currency side of the business, was in a bear market for a couple of years, and so we stopped investing in new companies in that area because I didn't know how long the market would bear. Obviously, we're in a phenomenal bull market right now, but in that bear market as a VC, we had a lot of companies, and those could all end up being starving babies. And you stop trying to take on new companies that may need money, because between DCG and pantera and Fenbushi and all of us that invest in this area collectively, we don't have that big a pool of capital.
00:21:26.834 - 00:22:07.090, Speaker C: We do not have enough money to support these portfolio companies. We rely in a large part, historically, on the later stage, generalist VCs and the VC market said, hey, okay, I've got a bitcoin or a blockchain bet. I've got one or two. I haven't seen any exits. I'm not seeing massive revenues being generated in some cases, markets a little bit flat. We were in a tough time, and so we were focusing on kind of the most emerging of things, and we invest across all of it now and then obviously with ICOs. I was a founding board member of the first ICO mastercoin, which was the project that architected what has become ICOs.
00:22:07.090 - 00:22:41.742, Speaker C: And I've been a major investor in a lot of the most important ICOs. I think we owned like 10% of Made Safe when it went live. We put 500 bitcoin into ethereum's crowd sale and owned almost called a million ether at day one. And I've been doing the ICOs, but in our first two funds, we had some large LPs, kind of big family office types that said we've got bitcoin exposure. So I don't want the fund buying things like bitcoin and ethereum. And I said, that's fine. I would never actually buy those types of things.
00:22:41.742 - 00:23:00.950, Speaker C: Well, at the time bitcoin with my fund, I don't need to charge you a fee to buy bitcoin. I'll show you how. Let's start by taking you to coinbase. You want to buy more and you want to secure more. I'll show you how to use BitGo. And I don't need to make money off your buying a bitcoin that you can do on your own. I don't feel justified in charging you for that.
00:23:00.950 - 00:23:38.866, Speaker C: But unfortunately, in fund two, we were prohibited in our docs from buying crypto. I remember just pulling my hair out when ethereum was at a dollar. And I'm like, I'd like to make the largest bet of our firms ever made in ethereum at a buck. I want us to go buy I said, I want us to buy a million dollars worth. And we couldn't get the legal approval to do it. And I probably should have gone and got waivers from everybody, but that would have been a 40 or 50 x return in a pretty short period of time and fully liquid the IRRs on this venture fund would start to look like Chris Saka's. Unfortunately, we did just fine, and I made that money myself.
00:23:38.866 - 00:24:06.074, Speaker C: But I'm really excited by our new fund's ability to invest in ICOs, and I'm kind of bummed out that I wasn't able to do this on behalf of my limited partners. My job as a fiduciary is to get up every day and make money for people, and it's really disappointing when I'm prohibited from doing so because of a term that was intended to prevent me from buying bitcoin, not other things like Ethereum. But we fixed that with the third fund.
00:24:06.272 - 00:24:16.750, Speaker A: This takes us up to this time of the BCAP token. So let's actually turn to Stan now. Stan, can you tell us your background and how you learned about and became interested in cryptocurrency?
00:24:17.650 - 00:25:24.786, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So most of my background is in investment banking and capital markets. And so I spent most of my career, started Morgan Stanley and then worked across New York and London and Moscow and saw the emerging markets develop and become very active overnight. I followed bitcoin sort of on and off since about 2012 and even played around with miners at home. And kind of the nerd in me likes to tinker with this stuff, but never really seriously considered it because I saw how quickly complexity was growing, how quickly miners were evolving, and always thought it was something that's sort of a world away. But then early last year, I started paying attention to what's become known as the ICO market. But I saw early stage companies engage in really interesting capital markets activity that you normally don't see.
00:25:24.786 - 00:26:50.062, Speaker B: And I saw all of those dynamics playing out. And to me, what are some examples? Well, watching ethereum earlier than watching the dow and watching how much interest and garnered and how unique of an instrument it was and the depth of the market for a compelling asset like that. So an ability to raise 150,000,000 in a market that at that time was less than 15 billion in terms of both bitcoin and everything else, that was pretty meaningful. And the willingness of the community to invest from the grassroots and support a project like that, not only through kind of open source participation and participation in the development, but also with their dollars, that's pretty compelling. And so as we saw more and more products coming to market, more and more ICOs happening, what was clear to me is that you kind of needed an institutional player to bridge this market, right? You had very deep technical teams taking effectively a break from their product roadmap for three, four, five months to dig into securities law to try to understand what jurisdictions can I do this in? Can I not do I need to set up a foundation? Do I do this in Switzerland? I'm sitting in the US. Can I do this in the US. And does the SEC have jurisdiction? And each one of these companies was doing this over and over.
00:26:50.062 - 00:28:47.174, Speaker B: In addition to each of them individually trying to find investors, each individually trying to find and build a platform for the distribution of the SEO, each individually writing their own smart contracts. And it was obvious to me, just from the traditional capital markets, that what you need is an institutional grade service provider that helps these companies bridge the gap between issuers and investors, helps them run a clean process that starts with. Diligence starts with a clear story for the coin how investors benefit, how the company benefits, how the community gets to participate, how you think about the governance going forward. What are the implications for the company 1824 months from now when they go to look for new financing and then engage directly with investors, both those that are smaller tick investors but also kind of the bleeding edge family offices, high net worth individuals, folks that are already holding some bitcoin and are thinking about this asset class. And so last year around this time we started the Argon Group which is our vision for a digital investment bank, focused on this new tokenized cryptocurrency capital market. And I had the fortune of meeting Brock in the fall of last year as we were kind of experimenting with various legal structures and how to create a clean, clear, compliant and legal path for an ICO for a company that wants to do it as a true equity security or a true security versus doing it as a use coin or a more traditional structure. So we're based in La and Brock spends a lot of time in La.
00:28:47.174 - 00:29:52.886, Speaker B: And so as you talk to the La community and talk to folks in San Francisco, in the Valley, when the conversation turns to cryptocurrency and bitcoin it always comes back to Brock. So he is at kind of the epicenter of this ecosystem and so I met him through a friend. He came over to the office and I think we spent a couple hours together and his insight and vision for this space was so compelling that I thought we kind of have to work together. And so sometime later he asked me to come up and meet Bart and Brad and we had a really interesting conversation about doing a first tokenized venture fund. Part of that thesis is about the Keple market in general. Look, the market is large, a lot of people are holding core positions in bitcoin and Ethereum and some of these other coins but it's really a market that's starved for product and a lot of the holders don't actually want to exit crypto in any way. They don't want to go back to Fiat.
00:29:52.886 - 00:30:39.558, Speaker B: They want a product offered inside the crypto market. That's a compelling idea on one side. On the other side the fund isn't purely focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency. And so it makes perfect sense for them to lead the innovation in this space, disrupt themselves and offer a product to their constituency. Because if you were a part of the broader cryptocurrency community or just in general, if you're trying to make a bet on blockchain now there's almost no way to do it right. There's no public companies, there's no comparables. You can't get access to the elite venture funds that typically invest in this stuff.
00:30:39.558 - 00:30:51.222, Speaker B: And so there's really not a mechanism for someone even in the community to really participate in a traditional sense and so creating this product, as we talked about it made lots and lots of sense.
00:30:51.296 - 00:30:53.200, Speaker A: And so what is your business model?
00:30:54.530 - 00:31:17.058, Speaker B: So our business model is kind of a very traditional investment bank. As we build it, we help issuers issue shares, we help investors invest in tokens. We're building a platform for distribution of tokens, very much like sort of a traditional online brokerage type platform where you have investors. But what I mean is come in.
00:31:17.144 - 00:31:26.600, Speaker A: Do you take fees from both the group that's doing the crowd sale as well as the investors in the crowd sale, or are you charging only on one side?
00:31:27.370 - 00:31:32.940, Speaker B: We're charging only on one side. Which is it's on the issuer side.
00:31:33.390 - 00:31:34.042, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:34.176 - 00:32:06.218, Speaker B: But the vision for the business is much broader. It's about building products that help you invest in this space. So what we did with BCAP, and we'll talk about that in a little bit, is it's offered as a security. And so to purchase a security, especially if you're in the US. You need to go through an email and KYC process and you need to be accredited. And so you need to have a pathway and a platform for people to do that. And so creating these other tools and products to help this investment ecosystem is part of sort of the broader vision.
00:32:06.334 - 00:32:46.618, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, and I just want to clarify for people who may not know these terms, AML KYC, it's money laundering and know your customer rules and regulations. So let's take this moment to have a short break for an important word from our sponsor, Onramp. And afterward we will discuss the BCAP Token, the best companies in the world obsess about branding.

You can learn more and see examples of its work@thinkonramp.com. I'm speaking with Brock Pierce of Blockchain Capital and Stan Moroshnik of the Argon Group. Brock, so tell me how Blockchain Capital came up with the idea for the BCAP Token.
00:33:15.070 - 00:33:59.942, Speaker C: Well, again, I was a founding board member of Mastercoin, which was the first ICO. So I've been very much in the ICO market since call it day zero and watching it closely and through 20 13, 20 14, 20 15. It wasn't that exciting. I mean, it was interesting, but it wasn't like a trend. The model and the idea was out there for everybody to imitate. But venture capital was still the main model. And what happened is the money plateaued in terms of generalist venture capital coming into the sector in 2015, 2016, but the number of entrepreneurs coming into the market continued to accelerate.
00:33:59.942 - 00:34:27.198, Speaker C: And so there was this dynamic of a lack of capital to support all of the incredible entrepreneurs and things that were happening. But where there's a problem and where there's a will, there's a way. And so last year we had 64 ICOs raising over $100 million. And that happened, I think more out of necessity. In retrospect, it's easy to look at why this happened and how the trend emerged. It was out of a need. There was a void that needed to be filled.
00:34:27.198 - 00:35:28.174, Speaker C: And the quality of the ICOs and my desire to invest in them was such that it was very important that our next fund was going to be investing in tokens. And I was also concerned about the structure of a lot of the ICOs. Some of them I felt, were using very convoluted structures for the purposes of creating used coins to circumvent securities law. And I wasn't comfortable with it. My view is that this can be done a better way. And so I'd already been selling my partners and toying with the idea for quite a while to do something like this. And when I met Stan and saw that this was a team of Wall Street deep bench sort of bankers that had the right securities and legal backgrounds and I said, okay, this is a group of people that I can get comfortable with doing something that's pushing the boundaries of what can be done.
00:35:28.174 - 00:35:55.790, Speaker C: And so it was already on my plan to do it. And I said, Stan, well, I'd like to be your first deal. I said, I want to do this. It's something I've been thinking about doing, and you seem like the right people to do it with, so let's go. It required obviously a lot of time on our part and obviously a tremendous amount of legal resources to get comfortable that we've architected a model that hopefully we've standardized and that now others can copy.
00:35:56.290 - 00:36:03.870, Speaker A: And will the fund invest both in startups and in coins? If so, then what's the breakdown?
00:36:04.850 - 00:36:49.198, Speaker C: The answer is yes. Right now, I'm not a fan of most of the ICOs. I think we're in a bit of an ICO bubble and I think that the deals are raising capital at too early a stage. I don't think a white paper in most cases is sufficient. And I think there's still a role for VCs and firms like ours for the near term to basically provide for seed funding, precede seed, maybe even in some cases Series A. But what's really happening is blockchain technology is making it much more efficient for companies to essentially go public. And instead of going out and raising later stage venture capital for A Series B and A, Series C and A Series D, it's my view that now companies will be going public at a Series A and Series B level using this technology.
00:36:49.198 - 00:37:02.370, Speaker C: And it's of course going to start with our endemic community. But I think as investors, you want to see at least a minimally viable product get past proof of concept, demonstrate that the management team can execute before, I think, giving it to call it the crowd.
00:37:02.870 - 00:37:47.458, Speaker A: So let's talk about this language that you're using about them going public at an earlier stage. This is exactly the kind of language that I hear a lot of the entrepreneurs in this space are trying to shy away from. They're trying to deemphasize this idea that what they're offering is a security. So let's both talk about that as well. As you mentioned earlier that there were all these different things that you needed to do in terms of legal and regulatory issues that you needed to resolve. So can you describe what things you did in order to get past those hurdles in setting up the BCAP token and make sure that you weren't running afoul of any SEC rules or anything like Mean?
00:37:47.544 - 00:38:36.062, Speaker C: The main thing is just looking at the world differently. Instead of trying to avoid being a security, instead of trying to avoid characterizing yourself that way, you have to ask yourself the question is called, can I do it differently? Can we look at the regulatory framework? And there's the Jobs Act and all these wonderful innovations that have been happening to lower the bar for people to be compliant in the sale of securities. So this is a trend that's been underway. It's very easy to imitate what's been done before. So with Mastercoin, we created a foundation and the ICO capital went into the foundation, the foundation that was responsible for financing the development. And Ethereum and everybody else were more or less copied to our model. And most people didn't spend the time do the work, didn't hire the lawyers to spend serious money.
00:38:36.062 - 00:38:48.966, Speaker C: Ethereum did. And they were very late in launching and Vitalik was very smart to do it along with the rest of the team the way that they did. They said, we're not going to rush this. We're going to make sure we've got proper attorneys and we've been well advised and we're going to do it right, not fast.
00:38:49.148 - 00:39:00.906, Speaker A: So Brock, can you just describe for me about launching this foundation and then having the ICO money going to the foundation? Describe for me why those seemed like the right choices to make from a.
00:39:00.928 - 00:39:39.570, Speaker C: Regulatory perspective back then as the sort of founding board and whatnot, we didn't even get compensated. No one got $1. We all had to invest under the same terms as everybody else so that we were probably the most conservative of anyone. And I still felt very uncomfortable after the fact. This structure is definitely bleeding edge and we won't know. And if I look at an ICO on an individual basis, some of them. I would be very nervous if I were involved as a principal in any of those projects because they look too much like securities.
00:39:39.730 - 00:39:42.230, Speaker A: Is that what you're nervous about?
00:39:42.380 - 00:39:42.886, Speaker C: Yes.
00:39:42.988 - 00:39:50.970, Speaker A: Okay, but then if you structure it where you're a foundation, then why is it that that is deemed to be safer?
00:39:51.550 - 00:40:45.962, Speaker C: Oh, I'm not sure that makes it any safer. The foundation structure is just saying that the money is going into an entity to support the development of the open source software. So I mean, that doesn't provide for, I think, a regulatory sort of comfort that doesn't provide for that. You have the Howie test, which is the main thing that people try to analyze. Is it a security or is it an app coin or a used coin? And you're looking at those sorts of things and in some cases you have to look at each of them individually. But the main thing that we did differently is we said instead of trying to circumvent securities law, is it possible to acknowledge that you're a security? Can you do this differently? Instead of trying to dance around it, what if you just walk through that door? And the answer is you can. The Jobs Act and the things that have been going on here in the United States to lower the bar for these types of things to occur has happened.
00:40:45.962 - 00:41:07.358, Speaker C: And that's what crowdfunding is. Crowdfunding is the first major step in the democratization of venture capital. Things like Angelist, what we're doing and what the blockchain is able to provide here. And this overall just ecosystem of participants is an environment where we can take it ten times further. And in our case, we used Regulation S and D exemptions.
00:41:07.534 - 00:41:08.626, Speaker A: What are those?
00:41:08.808 - 00:41:47.834, Speaker C: Well, these are two exemptions under the SEC, regulation S allows you to do things internationally and allows for us to raise money from international investors. Regulation D allows for us to raise money from us investors, but we're limited to accredited only and we're capped at 99. So the big limitations, what we found out is we can do this, but the downside is you have to do KYC. No one had done an ICO where you KYC'd every investor. We had thousands of people sign up to participate in our crowd sale. And clearly the evidence is in, the precedent's been set. You can do KYC.
00:41:47.834 - 00:42:08.962, Speaker C: And I would advise everyone doing an ICO at this point, everyone to do that. Most of the mistakes that I think are being made is taking money from the wrong places or the wrong people and running afoul of rules in that area. And KYC your users gives you an ability to basically not take money from people you shouldn't.
00:42:09.106 - 00:42:10.774, Speaker A: And how many investors did you have.
00:42:10.812 - 00:42:42.240, Speaker C: Total, I think in the ICO? Stan can correct me. We had roughly 1000 investors in the deal, and I think we had for probably 5000. But unfortunately, we did a very small raise. And we kept a cap in place because we were breaking, I think, a lot of new ground. And the idea was not to maximize I think if the Dow had said, we're going to cap this at 10 million, the ethereum ecosystem would be better for it. Just because you can raise more money doesn't mean you should.
00:42:42.690 - 00:42:43.150, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:43.220 - 00:42:52.210, Speaker C: And so we know this is an experiment. We know we're trying to pioneer a bunch of new things, and the idea was to do something modest.
00:42:52.550 - 00:43:38.670, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And you covered these things so long ago. But just for listeners who aren't familiar with them, I wanted to flag that the Howey test, which Brock mentioned, was covered extensively in a podcast I did with Jerry Britto and Peter Van Balkenberg of Coin Center. I will refer to that in the show notes. But essentially it's a case, the Howie something, versus I don't remember the full name of this case, but essentially it is used often to determine whether or not an offering is a security. And there's four prongs to this, and then sort of a fifth I guess this wasn't a part of the case, as far as I understand, but it's just a fifth test for whether something's a security, which Brock has referred to a few times, and that's whether or not something has utility.
00:43:38.670 - 00:44:54.070, Speaker A: So, for instance, if you purchase a membership in a golf club before the golf club launches, that's not considered a security because presumably you're purchasing it not because you think the membership's value will rise after it opens, but because you want to use the golf course. So anyway, there's a number of these different prongs for the Howie test, which Peter and Jerry went over in depth in that podcast. And the other thing that he mentioned was the Jobs Act, which some of you may know. It's what is enabling regular investors, regular, everyday investors to participate in crowd sales and not have to be what's called accredited investors, where they make a certain level of income, which is 200,000 and above, or have a net worth of $1 million or above. All right, so there's so much background that people need to understand to know all the reasons for these different regulations and how that affects the way that these tokens will play out. But anyway, so I want to talk more about the BCAP token. I know that you registered the token issuing entity in Singapore.
00:44:54.070 - 00:44:57.690, Speaker A: Can you guys describe for me what benefits Singapore offers?
00:44:58.350 - 00:45:20.862, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Singapore is one of the few places in the world where there's been a ruling that said that tokens are not securities, they're specifically assets. And so by registering the issuing company in Singapore, it allows us to sort of achieve local compliance in a very token friendly jurisdiction.
00:45:20.926 - 00:45:24.238, Speaker A: And what is that distinction between securities versus assets?
00:45:24.414 - 00:46:03.230, Speaker B: It essentially allows you to avoid all of the regulation. Not avoid, but that regulation isn't applicable to you in the context of selling securities. So everything that's typically in place in terms of disclosure and registration and filings, et cetera, all of that applies to securities, but it doesn't apply to essentially assets. And assets is essentially things like real estate or hard goods. And so by explicitly saying this is not a security, singapore has removed a lot of legal overhang and legal complexity and executional complexity from executing a token.
00:46:03.810 - 00:46:14.450, Speaker A: I'm just a little confused because during this conversation, I thought that you and Brock were saying that, why don't we be upfront about the fact that these are securities? And then now you're telling me that actually they're not securities.
00:46:14.950 - 00:46:48.398, Speaker B: Well, it's a complicated legal. So the nuance of doing it in Singapore is it's the one place that's so far ahead of other places in the world that it's done the work and it's now experimenting with these new tools. And so what we then do is because the fund is in the US. And we're in the US. And a lot of the investments are going to be in the US. And investors we're addressing partly in the US. Too, we then take that security and offer it in the US.
00:46:48.398 - 00:47:13.794, Speaker B: As Brock mentioned, using the two existing exemptions under the securities act. And so he mentioned Regulation D that's been changed by the Jobs Act over the last five years. And that allows now things like General Solicitation, where you can advertise and talk about the security that you're selling in a public. And so that's been a big change, and that's a path of offering it to US. Investors.
00:47:13.922 - 00:47:29.658, Speaker A: Are you saying that the BCAP token, in a sense is defined different legally depending on the jurisdiction? So in the US. According to Regd, you've offered it as a security, but then in Singapore, with the way the regulations are there, it's defined as an asset. Is that what you mean?
00:47:29.744 - 00:47:31.094, Speaker B: That's exactly right, yes.
00:47:31.232 - 00:47:56.920, Speaker A: Okay. Oh, interesting. So I actually also wanted to go back to ask about the investors. I know you guys were limited to 99 investors and they had to be accredited investors in the US. First of all, can you explain why that was and then tell me about who the overseas investors were? Because if you had, it sounds like 901. I'm curious to know. Kind of like where they came from.
00:47:58.330 - 00:48:56.326, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So the 99 rule is actually specific to offering a fund, right? So there's another layer to BCAP specifically. Unlike a traditional company, because it's a fund, it needs to exist under an exemption to the Investment Companies Act of 1940. And so to be compliant with that framework, you have to offer it to less than 100 people in the US. To not have to register as an investment company or a mutual fund or something along those lines. And so that's the exemption framework that most of the professional investment firms use, like private equity or venture capital or hedge funds. And so the 99 limitation came from that piece of the law and then the accredited piece that you described so well earlier came from the regulation D 506 C provisions of the law.
00:48:56.326 - 00:49:22.378, Speaker B: And so the interplay of those two is what created the US dynamic. Now shifting to the second part of your question in terms of where the investors are coming from, we had a really broad participation so it's equally spread through Europe, through Asia, Latin America, we had some African investors. And so it was really kind of fascinating how global this market is.
00:49:22.484 - 00:49:29.140, Speaker A: Were there any particular countries where it was more popular and maybe even that surprised you.
00:49:32.790 - 00:50:00.090, Speaker B: So there's actually native interest from Singapore, there was some interest from the UK, there was a lot of interest from China. And we kind of knew this going in because we saw where the traffic was coming from to a lot of our materials and landing pages broader Asia and interest from so I think how interesting this is to an Asian audience was really compelling.
00:50:01.250 - 00:50:22.930, Speaker A: That is interesting. So Brock, I've often heard you refer to this step that you're taking with the BCAP Tokens as blockchain capital eating its own dog food. And I want to hear you kind of explain what you mean by that and also give me your thoughts on what changes you think this BCAP Token could unleash in the industry.
00:50:23.590 - 00:51:14.866, Speaker C: Well I mean we're going to be investing in ICOs, we believe in sort of the ICO market and so might as well walk the walk right and do something. The goal of a lot of what this industry from my perspective the goal is to democratize the financial system as one aspect of what we're doing and to enable equal access for everyone, complete and total financial inclusion across all of its areas. It's part of the reason I was an early adopter of crowdfunding. I think I still have, I think the largest personal syndicate in Southern California on angel list. We've syndicated a lot of deals. I believe philosophically crowdfunding and Blockchain and Bitcoin are all working toward call it the same macro outcome. So this is just the next sort of big leap in it.
00:51:14.866 - 00:52:29.866, Speaker C: And then venture capital as a whole VCs invest in innovation and disruption, but how often do they innovate themselves? I mean the venture capital industry has benefited greatly from technology and the internet but their model hasn't changed at all. So I see how the venture capital industry is going to get disintermediated decentralized disrupted and so I can sit around and wait for some I can wait for someone to come along and disrupt us or we can choose to disrupt ourselves and cannibalize ourselves. And my partner Bart Stevens after graduating from Princeton was at ETrade back in the mid ninety s and running corp dev and Biz Dove reporting to the CEO and the ETrade Scott trade sort of story of how the brokerage business in the 90s. Changed is always a very interesting one to me because you had a dominant big brokerage firm called Charles Schwab and they saw these new emerging firms that were going to lower the fees in a big way and they very smartly decided to cannibalize their entire business. They put themselves out of business but as a result of having done that, the way that they danced through the innovators dilemma is they still exist today as a result of that. And so I think I see how the venture capital industry is going to be disrupted by this technology and I'd rather do it to myself.
00:52:30.048 - 00:52:34.494, Speaker A: And didn't you say a lot of VCs have been calling you asking how they can do the same thing?
00:52:34.692 - 00:53:35.566, Speaker C: Oh yeah, phone's pretty much been ringing off the hook by private equity people, real estate funds, anyone with a general lack of liquidity. I have so many people coming to me now saying can I do this in my industry? And I think the answer is it's going to happen to this is not a bitcoin or blockchain specific trend, this is going to affect everyone, the whole fund business, anything where there's an illiquid asset. And so it's starting naturally with the endemic sort of industry and it's going to be a fund like ours. But in a matter of, I think six to twelve months you'll start to see other things where on a Ven diagram you have overlap amongst these communities, video game related stuff, really advanced technologies, intentional communities, you'll start to see these waves. But we're the beginning of what will be a trend that I think is going to disrupt all venture, all private equity. I think this is the beginning of a long story but ultimately one that ends in this business never look forever being changed.
00:53:35.758 - 00:54:00.306, Speaker A: And so both of you are pretty familiar now with the different regulations in terms of both crowdfunding and know, not wanting to run afoul of the different securities laws and things like that. So are there any particular ways in which you would like to see US regulations evolve so that they're clearer for entrepreneurs and developers and also then on the other side the investors in these different crypto assets?
00:54:00.498 - 00:54:42.342, Speaker C: Yeah, no I think more regulatory clarity. I mean the Jobs Act obviously was a good step in the right direction and all of the crowdfunding companies are helping to make progress here. Unfortunately most ICOs today, the advice I would give is to follow basically the model that we did, which is unfortunate because it basically excludes most Americans. We're limited to 99 and they have to be accredited. So the reality is the American investor base is the one that is disadvantaged because of regulations that could probably be improved. Always they can be improved and hopefully they do in most cases. We're talking about the 1940 act.
00:54:42.342 - 00:54:55.100, Speaker C: Most of the laws we're referring to were things designed nearly 100 years ago. So, yes, I think we could probably benefit from improved and more modern regulation. And this is the process.
00:54:55.470 - 00:55:26.114, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure from the side of the regulator, they think that they're protecting the investors, because we certainly know that there are a few coins that have been launched that have been outright scams that the SEC has gone after, and then there are others that fall kind of into more of a gray area. So whether or not us Investors are at a disadvantage probably depends on where you stand on this. Well, so where can people learn more about you and your work and get in touch with you both?
00:55:26.312 - 00:55:54.062, Speaker C: Well, go to Blockchain Capital or Blockchaincapital.com. Both of them will get you there, and you can learn more about the firm and get in touch with us. I'm pretty accessible everywhere. I'm around the world pretty much constantly, so I'm all over the world and always happy to meet anyone in this space. That's part of this movement of changing the world and I think for the better. But you can find me on Twitter at brockpearce. I'm on most social media.
00:55:54.062 - 00:56:10.754, Speaker C: I use every sort of messaging app. I try to be as accessible as I possibly can be, and we want to invest in every great company.
