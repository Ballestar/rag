00:00:00.090 - 00:00:32.086, Speaker A: So Binance is organizing a consortium to try to rebuild trust in crypto. Good luck. I do wonder what inspired Binance to do this. Besides, you know everything. When I hear about a consortium to rebuild trust in crypto, I think what I imagine is that scene in Mean Girls in the Gym where they all apologize to each other and then do trust balls into one another. I'm picturing SBF on stage, sobbing about how he's innocent, and then he turns around, falls back, and everyone steps away. And SBF just I don't know, maybe Vitalik would try to catch him.
00:00:32.086 - 00:00:53.580, Speaker A: He does seem really nice. A consortium seems like exactly what people who lost their money because of the collapse of FTX want. Well, a consortium or their money back. Binance isn't gonna run the organization. Actually, nobody will. It's a decentralized organization, which might be an oxymoron. Advocate calling it Desensen crypto's decentralized center.
