00:00:00.250 - 00:00:58.730, Speaker A: Is it going to all stop altogether? Probably not. But will it be harder? Yeah, in some respects. I think that removing this crutch of we're going to have all these banks help us out, disintermediate them is a good thing, because then people focus on what we're actually here to do, which is build a financial system that is parallel, not in conjunction with that system. And so the stablecoin ecosystem needs some changes. There's nothing particularly I find wrong with the fact of a Tether a Circle BUSD. It's just that we have these things that people rely on to trade, and yet these things must have a banking partner to hold the dollars. And so you're saying, hey, I'm going to issue this token that completely destroys your global transaction banking and FX businesses because it moves twenty four seven and essentially for free, versus your nine to five Monday to Friday thing that you can charge egregious.
