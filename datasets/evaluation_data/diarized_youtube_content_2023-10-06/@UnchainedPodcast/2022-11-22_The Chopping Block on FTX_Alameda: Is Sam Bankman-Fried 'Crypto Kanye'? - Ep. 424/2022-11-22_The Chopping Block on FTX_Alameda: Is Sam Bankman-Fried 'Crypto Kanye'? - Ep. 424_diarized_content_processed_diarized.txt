00:00:25.172 - 00:00:27.442, Speaker B: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:27.506 - 00:00:30.162, Speaker A: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:30.226 - 00:00:32.578, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:32.674 - 00:00:35.570, Speaker A: Some unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:35.650 - 00:00:38.706, Speaker B: Alec ETH is the ultimate DeFi protocols.
00:00:38.738 - 00:00:40.840, Speaker D: Are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:42.350 - 00:00:59.722, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First up we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next up we've got Robert, crypto connoisseur and captain of Compound. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet.
00:00:59.722 - 00:01:16.482, Speaker A: And finally we've got myself. I'm haseeb the head Hype man at Dragonfly. All four of us are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat. Nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Robert, Tarun, you guys are at a brick wall. I take it. You guys are trying to hide your trying to hide your look, I think.
00:01:16.536 - 00:01:20.326, Speaker C: They'Re in the same elementary school gymnasium. That's where they're going live from right now.
00:01:20.428 - 00:01:23.640, Speaker D: This is a metaphor about the state of the industry is what it is.
00:01:24.250 - 00:01:58.654, Speaker A: That is true. It's been a pretty dark and depressing couple of weeks. Normally we run the show every couple of weeks. We're doing another show on basically one week after we did our previous show. Just because the amount of news and craziness was going on with this FTX fallout has been just absolutely incredible. Let me go ahead and get into it and kind of walk through what's happened since last Monday. If you recall, last Monday, FTX had already entered into bankruptcy proceedings on that Friday night before last, know Friday before last, there was this midnight massacre when FTX got hacked.
00:01:58.654 - 00:02:43.198, Speaker A: And we've learned much more about each of these things to understand exactly what took place in this quote, unquote, unauthorized access to FTX accounts. So the first and most important thing that happened was that there was an affidavit released by the new CEO, John Ray, who's basically the liquidator who liquidated Enron. And he essentially described the absolute pandemonium that was the books and records and corporate controls at FTX. And so what he stated in the filing, and it's an absolutely incredible filing, I recommend you read it. It's pretty light reading if you can skim through like kind of the perfunctory stuff. But there's a choice. Quote, at the beginning of this filing, he says, never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.
00:02:43.198 - 00:03:44.878, Speaker A: From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated, and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented. So there's all these revelations that we're now getting of just how horribly managed and horribly run FTX was to having all of the private keys in one shared Google spreadsheet that apparently everybody in the core team had access to private loans being given from the company to Sam personally, as well as to buy Bahamian property for employees. Almost negative accounting, like just absolutely incredible oversights in just understanding where the money was going and keeping things running. Of course, I think we alluded last time to the Mickey Mouse accounting firm that actually did their audits for 2021, and John Ray basically stated in the affidavit, like, look, I do not believe that these audits should be considered to be reliable because these auditors are just not serious people.
00:03:44.984 - 00:04:28.500, Speaker B: I don't know, the way he called them out was pretty, um he was like, FTX US was audited by Know, a firm I have heard of. FTX International was audited by, whatever the name of that firm was, a firm I've never heard of, and whose only claim to fame is to have opened the first CPA in the Metaverse. That was like, amazing. That line was there were so many Zingers that were like, I've read some pretty stayed and boring bankruptcy filings, but that one had a lot of character in it. And bankruptcy filings aren't exactly where you're like, wow, the great American novel was written, but that one actually could be.
00:04:28.870 - 00:04:57.062, Speaker A: There was a lot more in there as well. So beyond the self dealing that was taking place on the balance sheet of FTX, it was also revealed in there that Alameda was explicitly exempted from liquidations within their risk engine. So confirming what many people had suspected, that there was an enshrined special relationship between Alameda and FTX. And now, again, we don't know the extent of it, but at the very least they had a different status in the risk engine compared to any other market maker.
00:04:57.126 - 00:05:34.150, Speaker B: All I have to say is, if you followed any Dgen Anon trading accounts since 2019, you would have already known that there was tons of evidence and analysis. I don't know how investors who invested in it did not look into that because that was like pretty public knowledge. In fact, actually, Alex Pack, who used to work with you, actually talked about his experience investing in or not investing in Alameda in 2019. And I feel like a lot of the stuff there should have been stood out as diligence for any future investor, but somehow everyone just kind of ignored it.
00:05:34.300 - 00:06:28.130, Speaker A: Well, so my assumption was that that was obviously true in the early days, right? I mean, it was explicitly part of the strategy of FTX in the early days was that Alameda was going to be the kind of point market maker, but the idea was that they cleaned up their act over time, right? And that if guinea was on OD Lots, the founder of Winchemute, and he said explicitly, like, yeah, we kind of assumed that they had cleaned things up. Same thing that Kyle Davy said is that the reason why Three Arrows was trading on FTX, that they assumed that there were just corporate controls in place that prevented this after they went big. So it's one thing to have this as a bootstrapping mechanism when you're a small Hong Kong exchange and you're kind of trying to get something up and running. It's another thing when you're a $40 billion company. You've got all these stalwarts investing on the cap table. I would not be surprised if there were, again, misrepresentations that were made to investors about this because almost certainly it's one of the most obvious things investors would have asked for. And it's also almost certainly the case that they did not turn over source code to investors for Diligence.
00:06:28.130 - 00:06:45.200, Speaker A: You can tell from all the stuff that we're hearing now about how Diligence went that it was gun to the head. It was very like, look, you've got to commit now, you've got to put money in now these audits and this data room is all you're getting. And if you're not in, then we're going to go to the next guy, and there's many next guys that are lined up ready to put checks in.
00:06:45.650 - 00:07:36.378, Speaker C: I think this is this narrative battle going on right now between, I guess, Sam and everyone else as to whether this was incompetence or whether there was malice in FTX. And I think from this Voxdn leak that happened with Sam, I think he's still trying to lean into and tell the story around, oh, we got way over levered, we made some mistakes around how we were marking our books, and ultimately, I didn't intend to be in this situation, but I want to make it whole. But the more details that come out, it seems very premeditated. There were explicit actions taken to grant Alameda these benefits, obviously using customer or FTX funds to go purchase this real estate. It seems like it was very methodically planned and done versus being an accident of having bad collateral and having some bad liquidations and then ending up with a hole on your balance sheet.
00:07:36.474 - 00:08:34.960, Speaker A: Yeah. So this Vox interview was absolutely incredible. So is Kelsey Piper, who she's a journalist at Vox Works on this segment called Future Perfect, which is actually very EA aligned portion of Vox. They have like this little corner that does a lot of effective altruist reporting and investigative journalism. Apparently she was close with SBF, or just somebody who SBF trusted, and they started DMing on Twitter and one of the few people who was actually getting responses from SBF, and she ended up publishing the entire Twitter DM exchange. Very clearly something that Sam was not expecting to be reported on, unlike his correspondence with The New York Times and in those DMs, basically, it's just like The Joker kind of taking the mask off. It's very, very striking the way he's communicating with Kelsey, where basically he's like, yes, it was all an are.
00:08:34.960 - 00:09:03.926, Speaker A: It's not really about morality. It's just about winning and losing. It was just so incredibly machiavellian, the way that he was describing all of his intentions through his time at FTX. And basically, he says a couple of choice things in there. One, he says that it was a mistake to file for bankruptcy, and now that I filed for bankruptcy, I've lost control of the company. I can no longer go and raise money to save the company. And Kelsey was like, what? Do you really think you can raise money at this point? Like, the hole is massive.
00:09:03.926 - 00:09:27.242, Speaker A: And he's like, look, up until three days ago, I was one of the best fundraisers in the world. I must be at least pretty good at this point. I mean, look, maybe I'm not where I was, but there are a lot of people who are willing to take a bet on somebody who's gone through a catastrophe because they might have been through it themselves. And so he still believes that he can raise enough money to pull FTX out of the grave.
00:09:27.386 - 00:09:53.670, Speaker B: The grandeurs of delusion here are kind of you know, when you think of people who in financial history who have been able to repeatedly raise money post losing lots of like the poster child of that is John Merriweather, who founded Long Term Capital Management, and after that blew up, he's, like, continued to be able to raise these billion dollar funds. The difference is he doesn't just go raise them immediately.
00:09:53.750 - 00:09:54.042, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:54.096 - 00:10:20.180, Speaker B: It's not like he raised the fund, like, 2 seconds after LTCM blew up. He's like, hey, double or nothing right now. And I think the lack of self awareness that that's not possible, even if it was, like, a better scenario, suggests, I don't think he's totally been able to realize what's happened. If anything, it feels like he's living in some totally delusional world.
00:10:20.630 - 00:10:20.994, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:21.032 - 00:11:06.180, Speaker D: I'm not a psychologist, so I can't say this with any medical certainty, but just reading that interview, he came across as delusional, sociopathic, and just in denial about the entire situation where he just didn't even believe the reality of what was happening around him. I think that's part of what it takes to create a multi $10 billion fraud. I think I think all the ingredients that have to be there. I don't think you accidentally misplaced $10 billion. I don't think anyone could accidentally misplace $10 billion unless you have all of those traits, like running at the same time. He did not strike me as like a normal person.
00:11:06.710 - 00:11:42.150, Speaker A: Yeah. It's hard to tell if the shock of the last week has just untethered him and he just has lost all frame of reference of what the hell is actually going on, or if that everything up till now has been very self consciously orchestrated to kind of make it seem as though he hasn't lost the plot. But perhaps he has from the beginning. I don't know. It's really hard to tell, right? Because it's kind of like, look, you cannot have gotten this far without having some grounding in what is and is not possible and how the world is perceiving you, but it seems like you're absolutely right. He's stuck in this delusion of grander.
00:11:42.230 - 00:11:57.700, Speaker B: I do think he lived in a world of sycophants. It's a little bit like Kanye, right? Like, everyone was kind of like, yo, you're the best, you're the best, you're the best, enabling it. And SBS is just crypto Kanye right now. I feel like that's the most you can say.
00:11:58.070 - 00:12:01.490, Speaker D: He's crypto Kanye mixed with crypto Bernie Madoff.
00:12:01.910 - 00:12:09.554, Speaker B: Yeah, well, crypto Kanye by definition, got to be a Ponzi schemer, right? I feel like the two of those.
00:12:09.592 - 00:12:58.914, Speaker A: Together sounds like well, here's the thing. The thing with Madoff is that when Madoff turned himself in, right? First of all, the Feds never caught Madoff, right? Madoff turned himself in admitting that it was a Ponzi, and that basically it was over. Sam is still claiming to the people around him that it was an accounting mistake. He's not claiming in any way that there was anything untoward that took place with respect to basically funneling customer money into his affiliated market maker. It seems like he's basically setting up now his criminal defense, which is going to be that this was an error, it was a mistake. He probably perceives that his biggest exposure is that it's going to be very hard to prove that it was intentional that he moved money to FDX, and he's going to keep spinning this web that it was not intentional to take customer funds and move them to Alameda. His primary exposure is going to be on public statements, right.
00:12:58.914 - 00:13:05.494, Speaker A: Statements that he made to investors and statements that he made to customer depositors. And I think that's probably where most of his criminal liability is.
00:13:05.612 - 00:13:22.160, Speaker B: He also admitted so much stuff on Twitter and these articles. The public trail for this is very different than Madoff. Madoff, you probably actually had to get some audited statements here. It's like, actually just read all of the Twitter posts, right? Half of them, basically.
00:13:23.410 - 00:14:13.078, Speaker A: So I just tweeted about this. Elizabeth Holmes was just finally sentenced after six years. After theranos finally after theranos the fraud at theranos was first uncovered, she was sentenced to eleven years, and her charges were basically on defrauding investors, not defrauding users of her products, but on defrauding investors. It's much harder to prove fraud with respect to the users of your products because, okay, well, it was a business failure. Like, who knows? It was an honest attempt at trying to build this stuff. Other people should have done their due diligence, blah, blah, blah. I think it's likely that if there is a criminal prosecution, and I'm not a lawyer, so this is totally talking out of my ass, but I would guess that the easiest thing to get Sam on would be lying to investors, lying to customers, lying to counterparties, as opposed to actually moving funds from proving that it wasn't a blah blah.
00:14:13.078 - 00:14:16.862, Speaker A: You know, their books and records are so bad that obviously it's hard to prove anything.
00:14:16.996 - 00:14:19.230, Speaker B: What about the fact that a lawyer dropped him?
00:14:19.380 - 00:14:58.506, Speaker D: I don't think you can read into that. I mean, again, not a lawyer. I think the most obvious, glaring issue for him is one of the things we haven't talked about yet, which is the bank fraud. So when you wired money into and out of FTX, you weren't actually wiring money to FTX as advertised. You were actually wiring money directly to Alameda's bank account and receiving wires and ACHS directly from Alameda's bank account. This was, at least for me, over the last week. The most shocking revelation was that and this is like hiding in plain sight for years now, that FTX didn't have a bank account.
00:14:58.506 - 00:15:25.570, Speaker D: They just never had one in the first place. And they used Alameda's bank account as the back end for the exchange, which is what created this $8 billion incorrectly labeled account. This is the incorrectly labeled account itself, is the fact that they were using Alameda as the on and off ramp to FTX. And so you wonder how Alameda got $8 billion. All the wires went directly to Alameda.
00:15:25.990 - 00:15:31.462, Speaker A: But how would banks not know this? Right? Like, that is not what a market maker's banking patterns look like.
00:15:31.596 - 00:15:42.138, Speaker B: People did go ask their banks for ACH confirmation, and ACH confirmations did say Almeta, just as no one checked. They just kind of, like, were like, oh, maybe it was fine. Which is crazy also.
00:15:42.304 - 00:15:42.634, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:42.672 - 00:15:54.630, Speaker D: The root cause of how did $8 billion go missing and what is the $8 billion incorrectly labeled account is the fact that Alameda was the on and off ramp to the exchange.
00:15:54.790 - 00:16:19.830, Speaker A: Well, so that explains why the notice that explains why the fiat accounts were commingled from the beginning. Right. But we've gotten confirmation now from Caroline's own admissions that there was a loan of customer funds that took place this year from FTX to Alameda. Right. So Alameda was potentially for a long time I don't know. I didn't follow all the details, but definitely Alameda was one of the fiat funnels for FTX from US. Depositors.
00:16:19.830 - 00:16:33.050, Speaker A: The $8 billion hole seems like it was a recent phenomenon. Right. It took place this year as a result of that loan that took place. But that explains why their assets were commingled for a very long time.
00:16:33.200 - 00:16:55.250, Speaker D: I mean, my read of it was that there was a net $8 billion of assets transferred into FTX all through Alameda. And that's how the if you looked at his spreadsheet, the balance sheet, the one that everyone made fun of and Matt Levine made fun of, I think that was the $8 billion mislabeled fiat account, in that the fiat account was funds that should have been in an FTX account, but instead were at Alameda the whole time.
00:16:55.400 - 00:16:56.418, Speaker A: I see.
00:16:56.584 - 00:17:08.078, Speaker D: So like, if I wired $10,000 into FTX, FTX's portal would say, oh, you have $10,000 with FTX, but the money was still sitting at Alameda.
00:17:08.254 - 00:17:09.602, Speaker A: Right. I see.
00:17:09.736 - 00:17:10.966, Speaker D: That was my read, and I could.
00:17:10.988 - 00:17:27.866, Speaker A: Be incorrect, but that was yeah, it's hard to get a good sense of it. I mean, Sam personally pulled out so much money out of FTX as well. I mean, he took out a 300 million dollar private loan. It was also revealed that in the, what was it? The $420,000,000 billion dollar private loan, and.
00:17:27.888 - 00:17:30.250, Speaker B: Then $300 million out of the funding round.
00:17:30.670 - 00:18:46.794, Speaker A: I'm sorry, there's a billion dollar loan from Alameda to Sam, and then there was a 300 million dollar cash out from FTX equity that Sam did in the $420,000,000 round. And so Sam was pulling tons and tons of cash out of this whole combined entity. And the other thing that's going on that's also very strange is that there's this jurisdictional battle between the Bahamas and the US. So John Ray, he originally filed for bankruptcy in the US. And in the Bahamas, the Bahaman SEC basically fired back and said, hey, this entity is in the Bahamas, therefore this is subject to Bahaman bankruptcy. And later it was revealed that supposedly, and again, this is still very unclear exactly what happened, but supposedly the Bahaman government instructed Sam to actually take the digital assets left in FTX and move them under Bahaman custody for the Bahaman government for some reason, and it's all very vague. Did this actually happen? How did this happen? Is that the FTX unauthorized access FTX hacker that we were talking about on Friday night? If so, what the hell were they doing? Why were they selling off all the altcoins to get access to put everything into ETH and die? And so it's very strange pattern of behavior.
00:18:46.942 - 00:18:55.314, Speaker B: Well, they were also doing it on one inch and curve. Right, exactly. I don't know how many regulators actually know how to use curve.
00:18:55.442 - 00:19:12.230, Speaker A: Well, the suggestion is that they instructed Sam to do this. And so it was Sam who was actually going on chain and dumping these assets. And so the story at least makes sense. Like the pattern of behavior does look like, okay, this is somebody who's sophisticated about DeFi, who's doing a lot of this liquidating.
00:19:12.390 - 00:19:47.938, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I've kind of come around on like I think there's something else going on there, because I agree, if it's just a matter of moving the assets into their custody, that's one thing. But we also saw them basically eating a bunch of slippage on these on chain swaps and then moving them into censorship resistant assets. And then I think recently they cashed out some of their ren BTC for BTC and so they'll probably shove that through a mixer. And so I think this might actually just be a vanilla hack and maybe the bohemian jurisdictional battle and custody battle is like a different thing that we haven't yet seen. But I think the hack was maybe just an actual hack.
00:19:48.114 - 00:20:07.040, Speaker A: And that seems to be what Sam was implying in his DMs with Kelsey Piper, which is that this was either a straight up hack or it wasn't disgruntled employee who I guess had access to the Google sheet where they had all the private keys. It's hard to tell at this point.
00:20:08.290 - 00:20:11.386, Speaker B: They did everything in a Google shared.
00:20:11.418 - 00:20:27.010, Speaker D: Good mean that's yeah, it's such bad OpSec for like how did they not get hacked already? Right. For managing a small amount of money, let alone a large amount of money. It's just preposterous. Like, no one in crypto is that dumb.
00:20:27.090 - 00:20:36.710, Speaker A: Besides yeah, everything that we're learning about what was happening inside of FTX, it just belies. So much amateurishness.
00:20:37.290 - 00:20:42.810, Speaker D: Everyone listening to this stream right now is smarter than that. That is so stupid.
00:20:44.350 - 00:21:43.766, Speaker A: The other thing. So as the fallout from FTX has continued, we're getting more and more people kind of speaking out and more and more revelations of people who either worked at FTX or worked at Alameda. And one of the things that we're now seeing over and over again is that Alameda was not some brilliant kind of n dimensional, chess next level market making firm. In reality, they were making some money doing some pretty basic arbitrage in 2018, 2019, but basically when the bull market came, they kind of just became altcoin punters and they started going long a bunch of crazy alts and kind of basically trading on future listings. The idea is that their alpha started eroding after 2019 when a lot of the bigger trading firms started getting into crypto. And basically their whole strategy was like, okay, let's just go long a bunch of shitcoins and farm and dump stuff with really bad OpSec. And they basically kept doing that through 2022.
00:21:43.766 - 00:22:59.218, Speaker A: The story that's now being spun as a speculation, let's say, about how Alameda lost so much money was that because they were in this privileged position on FTX, they were very often the market maker that was going to kind of take liquidations. OTC one of the most toxic liquidations you could be stuck with was Luna. And FTX was very, very deeply intertwined with Luna and UST. They had enormous amount of trading volume and the thickest order books for those two assets were on FTX. And so when this mass liquidation spiral was taking place in Luna and in UST, supposedly the story is that automatically this stuff was getting sold off to Alameda and Alameda was just stuck with so much toxic flow from the bank run on Terra that that may be why it lost so much money. And so theory now increasingly is that actually before we thought that maybe what's happening is that Alameda is monetizing FTX not through FTX having trading fees, but rather Alameda being able to front run, being able to buy things. Before they get listed, do all this stuff to profit from their position on this exchange and potentially be able to trade on God mode, stop out positions like do all this crazy stuff.
00:22:59.218 - 00:23:29.230, Speaker A: But it seems now, actually it was the opposite. That okay in a bull market, sure, that's what it looks like in a bear market. Really what's happening was that all of the liquidity, like the abnormally high level of liquidity on FTX was a result of Alameda getting just poured tons and tons of toxic flow through all of the crashes that we saw this year. And that is perhaps what ultimately ended up to Alameda getting destroyed. What do you guys think of this theory? It seems like more and more people seem to be advocating that this is what happened.
00:23:29.380 - 00:24:12.720, Speaker B: So I would say I'm like 80 20 on it being true. I'm sure a lot of the losses came from that. There is certainly a clear sense in which Alameda was always sort of a subsidy for FTX and vice versa. It's like ironic, right? Like in the beginning, FTX was actually created to bail out Alameda because they have this huge $10 million loss in Korea or whatever. And then FTX kind of grew and then became like the place Alameda made money. But I think sort of like the numbers do add up for that. But the one thing I do think is weird is that FTX did delist Luna way before Binance did.
00:24:12.720 - 00:24:49.238, Speaker B: In particular, I remember Binance was very aggressive on the relisting, on when the chain went back up before it cracked, you know, how validator shut off the chain, then it went back online. And Binance was extremely aggressive in that. And that was probably a huge loss if you had to take the other side of the restart. The restart was like incredible. I could believe it. But if we just do the back of the envelope numbers, let's just say you lost $5 billion doing that. That means if we look at the total Luna market cap drop was like 20 billion.
00:24:49.238 - 00:25:17.470, Speaker B: I guess it was already down somewhat. So you have to basically buy $20 billion of Luna and be unable to sell 5 billion. That seems sort of reasonable. But I can't really square away the fact that they turned off their engine matching engines earlier than Binance with their ability to realize the entire loss of market cap. That's sort of the one thing that I can't square with this theory.
00:25:17.910 - 00:26:03.566, Speaker A: I mean, it's clear that Luna was not the only thing that ended up comparing Alameda. Right? So, I mean, in addition to that, there was all the venture investing. I mean, that's what when Caroline stood up and gave her speech about what exactly went wrong, one of the things that she specifically called out was all the venture investments that they made that were highly liquid. Right? But the other thing too is that as serum and FTT were declining in value, basically, what's happening, potentially one explanation of what's happening is that the most toxic assets from FTX liquidations are getting gradually transferred from traders on FTX to Alameda. And of course, the most toxic of those assets are serum FTT. And so as these things are getting unwound, you can just see them accumulating more and more of it on their balance sheet. And so that's in a way, another explanation.
00:26:03.566 - 00:26:38.570, Speaker A: I don't know if this is correct, but you can imagine some portion of the losses that ended up coming into elementa basically may have been that traders were basically selling out of their positions in toxic assets at abnormally high prices. And so where did the money go is one of the questions people keep asking. And some of it, okay, some of it's Sam, some of it is like these venture investments, but some of it might be traders that were getting abnormally good prices because liquidity on FTX was too good because it was getting stuck on Alameda's balance sheet at the expense of actual other depositors.
00:26:38.910 - 00:27:01.538, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree with this. Actually. If you sold this stuff at a massively inflated valuation to Alameda, you made money, right? You were the one selling them Ft and SRM, and that's kind of where the money went. It's not like they have some big offshore account where they're holding $8 billion. They just started to become underwater in this levered position and you're kind of stuck in it.
00:27:01.704 - 00:27:33.702, Speaker A: Yeah. So, ultimately, ironically, the people who invested into FTT or invested into Samcoins, who got liquidity, they're where the money went because there was basically a net transfer of the cash, the bitcoin, the ether, the USDC or whatever it was trading against that went to the people who originally invested in those assets and sold a big part of their portion to Alameda. Alameda got the FTT, Alameda got the serum, and the other people ended up with the cash. That's at least a partial explanation. But of course there's a lot more that was missing than can be explained with just those assets alone.
00:27:33.846 - 00:28:01.126, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it went to a lot of places. As you said, the forensic accounting on all this stuff is going to be years, probably. But we do know some went into real estate. We do know it went into a lot of venture capital. We do know it likely was huge trading losses. Because the irony is Alameda's privileged position as the liquidator on the exchange. And being immune to liquidation meant themselves never got liquidated and they picked up all of the toxic flow from their customers.
00:28:01.126 - 00:28:05.400, Speaker D: It went to a lot of places, but this is probably one of the larger ones.
00:28:05.770 - 00:28:55.910, Speaker A: So we've started to see some of the regulatory responses coming into all this and it seems like it's pretty clear a lot of people lost face from this. A lot of lawmakers are calling for there to be an expedited bill to address crypto regulation and kind of some of what's gone on here. I've actually been surprised that things don't seem quite as shrill as I was expecting them to. I was expecting people to be pitchforks out, extremely angry at the industry and trying to shut this whole thing down. It doesn't seem like that's the predominant response we're seeing from regulators or from lawmakers, at least not right now. Robert, among the four of us, you're the closest to this. What has been the temperature that you've been hearing from lawmakers regulators about kind of the post FTX saga?
00:28:56.410 - 00:29:02.726, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the first thing that's happening that's on the schedule is multiple hearings have been scheduled.
00:29:02.758 - 00:29:02.954, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:02.992 - 00:30:27.922, Speaker D: And I think the first step, besides what is going to go through the bankruptcy process of what actually went down in FTX from a technical and financial perspective, there's also the I think the first step for legislators and regulators is partially hearings, right? It's what went down and having them hear it in their own words, having experts provide testimony allowing them to hear from SBF and CZ, multiple hearings are being scheduled. And I think that's the first step. And I don't think anyone's going to rush a solution or legislation until after everyone feels like they have a grasp on what went down and how to prevent it. Again, in the immediate aftermath, people were talking about trying to pass the Sam legislation Vccpa, but I think that very quickly lost steam because why pass the legislation promoted by the perpetrator of a horrific you know, I think in the next section of Congress. There'll probably be after hearings, after everyone's heard from the industry, from those directly involved, like what led to know they'll be able to start to craft some hopefully, you know, the right message gets through. And the right message, I think, is that this was financial fraud perpetrated by someone that previously had a good reputation. The scope of it is massive, but it's not a failure of crypto.
00:30:27.922 - 00:30:48.730, Speaker D: It's a failure of the system that allowed him to commit this $10 billion fraud. And so we'll see what the correct steps are to address this. But it wasn't a failure of crypto, it wasn't a failure of a blockchain, it wasn't a failure of DeFi, it wasn't a failure of our industry. It was a crime committed by a sociopath.
00:30:49.150 - 00:31:26.760, Speaker B: Granted, though, I do think the investors at some level probably, hopefully should somehow I feel like they probably should take more responsibility than they have. If we're going to be honest, some of the ways I've been talking are a little bit tone deaf of like I actually thought, ironically, the best investor update about FTX was Tomasek, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, because they owned up to it. They're like, yeah, we fucked up, and we actually and I kind of feel like that day of reckoning is still to come. No one wants to own up to this, and I think there will be tons of stuff that comes out that forces people to.
00:31:27.630 - 00:31:52.960, Speaker C: Yeah, the Tomasek letter and weirdly enough, JP. Morgan's statement on this were both actually very optimistic and sort of doubling down on this fact that this was specifically FTX abusing this technology. But they're still overall optimistic about decentralized finance and sort of the solutions that we're sort of working towards. So it's sort of like isolating out these two components to the FTX story is kind of important.
00:31:53.570 - 00:32:23.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been surprised at how much that's resonating. I sort of assumed that, okay, that's what crypto people are going to say. There was a great tweet by somebody, I retweeted I can't remember their name, but it was basically, I think, what they said was, it's funny how FTX confirms whatever you already believed about crypto. And so if you're a crypto person, you're like, oh, this just proves decentralization is so important, and that's why centralized custodians or exchanges are terrible. And if you're anti crypto, you're like, oh, that proves all crypto is a fraud and you can't trust any of this stuff. I've been surprised, to be honest. I thought that it was going to get lost in the noise.
00:32:23.378 - 00:33:01.506, Speaker A: This idea that, look, well, this is not an indictment of crypto. This is an indictment of a centralized company doing things Wall Street style in an accountable, overseas kind of shady operation. Like, yes, okay, that's what should be indicted, not the idea of decentralized permissionless, self executing, autonomous, transparent blockchains. Clearly nothing about that. That is not what's to blame for what happened at FTX. And if anything, the fact that we had clear forensics and we had the ability to go on chain and actually see what was going on helped us to uncover this much faster than the mainstream press said. Okay, well, speaking of the mainstream press, that's been another angle of the story, which has been just so bizarre.
00:33:01.506 - 00:33:56.166, Speaker A: To see the coverage that came out of the New York times and came out of Washington post, which was almost just like a bizarro world depiction of Sam as being this humble entrepreneur who flew too close to the sun. He was trying to do such great things for pandemic prevention and climate change and democratic causes, and he's sort of like a temporarily disgraced billionaire, but it's like, oh, he's going to get back on his feet and he's going to try again. And that's what happens when you try too hard and doesn't work out. And it was just so striking that there was no sense of, okay, this person almost certainly committed fraud right at this point. Even, you've know, John Ray, you've got the freaking liquidator from Enron basically saying this is the worst, most catastrophic situation he's ever found himself in, and The New York Times is basically praising him. It's just absolutely bizarre to see. Now, not every mainstream publication did this.
00:33:56.166 - 00:34:18.126, Speaker A: Most of them were very, very clear that, okay, this is like an absolute catastrophe. The Wall Street Journal in Bloomberg have been on point at giving the play by play and breaking a lot of news about what's been going on in the saga. But The New York Times in particular has just been just strikingly tone deaf. Not just tone deaf, but almost like seemingly I don't even know what the word is for, like it's just bizarre to see.
00:34:18.308 - 00:35:07.914, Speaker B: I think the more interesting thing to me is some of the publications he invested in and I guess Rugged, because some of them didn't get all their money have actually had some very good stuff like Semaphore, which is new online publication. I feel like had a really good takedown of both the actual some of the lawyer stuff of like they were the first ones to report that Paul Weiss dropped Sam and also McCaskill's moral lapses, which I'm always here to lap up. But they actually had some very good reporting on that and also on the early Alameda crash, which led to them trying to fundraise from you guys a long time ago or your predecessors a long time ago. So I think that's been interesting to see. All these small publications have way bigger scoops and then The New York Times can't tell the difference between investment loss and fraud.
00:35:08.042 - 00:36:39.766, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's just shocking to me because the situation is being handled with very soft gloves, whereas they've never given that privilege to really anyone else in tech? Anyone else in crypto? Anyone else ever? The spin on this is just perplexing, especially when it's like to see how aggressively they excoriated Kraken and coinbase over internal employee issues relative to this is just like, it's perplexing. And at the end of the day, I think people's gut on this is pretty much correct, which is it's because SBF and FTX were winning the game, which and SBF admitted over text messages that this was a game, right? And this was a strategy that SBF had won. The strategy of spraying money to media organizations, spraying money to progressive causes, spraying money into politics, and buying a lot of favor and essentially reputation laundering before the reputation was know, he had invested hundreds of millions of dollars into buying friends in the media in Washington. I think it's hard for folks to admit that they've been know. I think it's only now really starting to come out. But it makes sense that the very first reaction from the media in Washington was like, hold know this is a collapse. We know it's a collapse, but it's.
00:36:39.798 - 00:37:23.818, Speaker B: Not because do you think we'll end up with something that looks more like Enron? Where I guess the executive team was sort of like friends with the President at that time. And then, because it was such a big thing, the president had to throw them into the fireplace because otherwise it would make him look bad. Much worse. He had to cut off the arm because it was too close. Or do you think it'll be like Mark Rich who got pardoned on Clinton's last day? Because I actually feel like there's a non trivial possibility of that very similar story. It's like some weird securities that people didn't really understand, got a ton of leverage on them, blew up. I mean, Glencore still exists, and then there was some bribing of governments and stuff, right.
00:37:23.818 - 00:37:31.578, Speaker B: But he got this very last minute pardon, and I wouldn't be surprised if something of that in mind.
00:37:31.744 - 00:38:04.934, Speaker D: Well, the only reason that I don't think that will happen is because the public outcry will be so great. And I think at the end of the know, politicians are just trying to get reelected and they do what the people want them to do. And I think this is a very clear case of the people en masse don't like SBF. Mark Rich, I don't think the average person had heard of or cared about. Like, Mark Rich didn't personally screw them. They might have, but like, you know, Mark Rich did some commodities trade that no one has ever heard of.
00:38:04.972 - 00:38:05.510, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:05.660 - 00:38:07.654, Speaker B: SBF enron though, too.
00:38:07.692 - 00:38:08.422, Speaker C: Right? To be honest.
00:38:08.476 - 00:38:08.658, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:08.684 - 00:38:12.022, Speaker B: They both did these kind of, like esoteric commodities trades that took advantage.
00:38:12.086 - 00:38:36.050, Speaker D: Totally. But SBF wrecked the lives of 1 million individuals. Okay, that is so much more direct than yeah, Enron or some commodities thing that whatever. A lot of individual people, a lot of trading firms, a lot of people we know have gotten completely wrecked by this in a way that no one ever felt like wrecked by Mark Rich or Enron.
00:38:37.030 - 00:39:00.618, Speaker A: It's also true, not just for retail, but also for institutions. Right. I mean, FTX was very institution heavy exchange. And so I think there will be a lot of calls for blood, not just from individuals and voters, but from people who also have kind of other influence in how these things get decided. So I would tend to agree. I think SBF is not going to find a way to snake out of this at this point.
00:39:00.784 - 00:39:02.138, Speaker D: Although he'll try.
00:39:02.304 - 00:39:09.514, Speaker A: He will try. Yeah. At this point, he's so unmoored that I just don't know that he will understand how to try at this point.
00:39:09.712 - 00:39:30.962, Speaker B: I think my favorite text in that Vox thing was the thing where he was like the ethics stuff was all ALARP. And he said that, right. Like, that was unreal. I was you really you just admitted to being kind, like, as haseeb said, machiavellian character so directly that it's impossible to find an ounce of sympathy at that point.
00:39:31.016 - 00:40:14.240, Speaker A: It's impossible to unsee that now. Right? Like, no matter what he says, from now until the end of time, it's very difficult not to have that unveiling kind of burn into your memory. And actually there's another element. So there was a piece that was written by Arthur Hayes, the co founder of BitMEX, where he linked a lot of what was going on with Sam and why, you know, put on such a pedestal is a lot. To do with and not just race, but also his status, his, you know, born to these Stanford professors kind of having basically being like American aristocracy from when he was born, and kind of pattern matching. A lot of things that people wanted to see in somebody who was going to be kind of the hero of this crypto generation. I don't know how much explanatory power that has, but it's certainly true.
00:40:14.240 - 00:41:02.446, Speaker A: Know, both Sam and Arthur were overseas unregulated Exchange founders who, like Arthur, remember Arthur faced a criminal trial for basically a few Americans. They knowingly allowed a few Americans to trade derivatives overseas. Right. That was what they got caught for criminal charges on, as far as I recall, basically not implementing an AML program. And relative to what Sam did, it seems just like so just so tiny of an indiscretion to, okay, we didn't have a good enough AML program in 2019. Relative to that. The New York Times is writing puff pieces about Sam when Arthur is this dangerous criminal who's like and a large part of this one has to assume a large part of this is just what they look like.
00:41:02.628 - 00:41:03.520, Speaker D: I agree.
00:41:03.970 - 00:41:06.530, Speaker B: I did like Arthur's pieces of writing.
00:41:07.270 - 00:41:28.200, Speaker C: It was very good. But let us know. Whitewash history. Arthur was going on Twitter and taunting regulators and really playing up sort of this entire narrative around himself, whereas SBF was doing the exact opposite. So it's also not just who you are, but literally how you're presenting yourself that I think, sort of goes into this bit.
00:41:29.310 - 00:41:46.830, Speaker A: That's 100% true. I don't want to claim that Arthur didn't bring some amount of pain onto himself, but the actual crime of which he is accused is of such incredibly paltry consequence relative to the crime that Sam is being accused of.
00:41:46.980 - 00:41:47.934, Speaker C: Totally agree.
00:41:48.052 - 00:41:51.342, Speaker B: Technically, Sam hasn't been accused of a crime yet. Right.
00:41:51.396 - 00:41:53.662, Speaker D: Legally that's true.
00:41:53.796 - 00:41:56.074, Speaker B: He has not been that's another important.
00:41:56.132 - 00:41:59.682, Speaker A: Part to point out. To be clear, he has been accused of a crime by many people.
00:41:59.816 - 00:42:04.050, Speaker B: Not by but not not as a criminal case.
00:42:04.120 - 00:42:14.694, Speaker A: Not by a governmental body. Yes, there is no governmental body, as far as we know, that has charged him with anything. Although there were reports that the DOJ was preparing charges, but we don't know if those are confirmed or know.
00:42:14.732 - 00:42:28.460, Speaker B: Yeah, this is actually one thing I've been wondering if he's really going to go speak at Congress in this hearing that's supposed to be in two weeks or three weeks there, won't he just get know if they do file something? Seems like the right time.
00:42:28.910 - 00:43:10.194, Speaker D: The block wrote an incredible article about these hearings with some incredibly choice quotes in them. To your point, Tarun. So one of them was that Brad Sherman, who's unbelievably anti crypto, said, I assume that SBF is on a private submarine headed to Dubai. So I think it's going to be hard to get him unless Maxine has some depth charges, referring to Maxine Waters, who also hates crypto, but they assume he's not coming. And they actually reference the fact that they assume that in his place will be the SEC or somebody else on the investigative side to speak in his place. So he probably won't show up. I don't think there's going to be some scene where they arrest him at the airport when he flies in from the Bahamas to go testify to Congress.
00:43:10.194 - 00:43:14.538, Speaker D: I think they're going to invite him to speak knowing that the ODS of him showing up are zero.
00:43:14.704 - 00:43:17.546, Speaker A: You can't just video in. Is that not a thing?
00:43:17.728 - 00:43:18.810, Speaker D: That's a great question.
00:43:18.880 - 00:43:21.366, Speaker A: They don't do zoom in congressional hearings.
00:43:21.558 - 00:43:24.702, Speaker B: I mean, they had to have in 2020, but I don't know now.
00:43:24.756 - 00:43:26.560, Speaker A: Yeah, okay.
00:43:27.250 - 00:43:33.582, Speaker D: I know there have been some other issues with other committee hearings where people refuse to show up and they threaten them.
00:43:33.636 - 00:43:44.194, Speaker C: Well, I mean, also Bahamas has extradition treaty with the US. Right? So it doesn't seem like there's any additional risk in him coming in. Like if he actually is going to get charged with something and placed under.
00:43:44.232 - 00:43:49.830, Speaker D: Arrest, I mean, that's going to be a circus either way. I feel bad for everyone involved.
00:43:50.330 - 00:44:31.118, Speaker A: Yeah, well, all right, let's move on a bit from FTX. So after FTX going down, there's been a lot of fears about other contagion. Right? So FTX is dead, Alameda is dead. What else is getting caught up in the cyclone of disaster? And so there was a lot of fingers being pointed at the lenders initially, and the lenders early on basically kind of all in lockstep said, no, we're fine. We've lost a little bit of money from what we held in deposits at FTX, but other than that, we're totally okay. So Genesis, for those who don't know, they're the largest lender in crypto owned by DCG Digital Currency Group, which is their parent company. So Genesis, you can sort of think of them, they are like the bank of crypto.
00:44:31.118 - 00:44:49.026, Speaker A: They announced that they'd lost $7 million liquidating Alameda, which is a very small amount of money. So basically not significant. They were like, yeah, we have no exposure to Alameda. Then when FTX went under, they confirmed that they had 175,000,000 in trading balance that was stuck on FTX that was basically now obviously impaired from their trading.
00:44:49.058 - 00:44:51.218, Speaker D: Arm from their trading from their trading.
00:44:51.234 - 00:45:22.130, Speaker A: Arm, from the trading arm, not on their lending arm. And so they said, look, we're business as usual. But I think it was Friday before last a bunch of people started really getting afraid. A bunch of rumors were circulating that Genesis was insolvent and Genesis decided that, okay, we got to do something about this. They got DCG, the parent company, to do $130,000,000 infusion of capital into Genesis to basically bring them back up and running, right? And so after that they're like, look, we got the 130,000,000 back in store. We're now solvent. Everything is okay, business as usual.
00:45:22.130 - 00:45:49.878, Speaker A: But over the weekend and going into Monday, more and more withdrawals kept coming through Genesis. Basically people kind of pulling back their balances or recalling loans. And Genesis basically started facing effectively, a bank run. By Monday and Tuesday they were trying to calm the markets. Apparently they were in the market trying to raise a billion dollars, seemingly unsuccessfully. And then on Wednesday, Genesis announced that they were freezing withdrawals. So no more withdrawals from Genesis.
00:45:49.878 - 00:46:24.790, Speaker A: If you have an account at Genesis Lending, you cannot get any money out anymore. And so basically stemming the bank run. And they're now, as far as we understand, according to reports, they are now looking for an injection of capital and trying to raise money. Now if Genesis blows, dies or has to file for bankruptcy, this is going to be really bad. There are a lot of people who are tied up with Genesis. So almost every other big lender in crypto has big relationships with Genesis. A lot of downstream products depend on Genesis as being basically where they get yield from.
00:46:24.790 - 00:46:51.406, Speaker A: So they lend them onto Genesis and Genesis or lends them onto somebody else. If you can't rely on Genesis, a lot of things die off. And so the first, an obvious example was Gemini Earn, which is Gemini's yield bearing product. But a bunch of other yield products use Genesis on the back end. And so this is going to cause massive, massive ripple effects if Genesis does die. It doesn't seem to me like that's what markets are pricing in. I think markets seem to think that Genesis is going to get recapitalized, but it's going to take some time.
00:46:51.406 - 00:46:59.230, Speaker A: That would be my guess because otherwise I feel like there'd be much, much worse carnage in the markets when people perceive that Genesis is frozen.
00:46:59.570 - 00:47:14.902, Speaker B: I would say like Sam trying to raise $8 billion has zero probability. Barry Silver trying to raise a billion dollars probably 75% to 80%. At least that's my guess.
00:47:15.036 - 00:47:59.302, Speaker C: Yeah. I think our understanding is a large percentage of this debt is really like a duration mismatch issue where, as you see, you were saying, a lot of these sort of consumer facing yield products like Circle Earn, Gemini Earn, they basically just route out those stablecoins to Genesis on the back end who then issues the loans. And of course, those are not dated. Users can just deposit withdraw whenever they want, and usually there's enough float or unallocated capital that they can do that. But the loans that they then issue to trading firms or market makers are fixed date. And so obviously, even if those loans are still good and they have appropriate collateral, they can't just recall them before the loan is over. And so debt seems to be a large percentage of the issue.
00:47:59.302 - 00:48:02.870, Speaker C: Not that there's a bunch of bad debt, bad loans on the balance sheet.
00:48:03.850 - 00:48:47.654, Speaker D: Yeah. In full disclosure, I have assets that I can't withdraw from Genesis Capital. So I might have slight bias in this conversation, but I think it is potentially a liquidity issue, not a solvency issue, if their statements around liquidating Alameda and closing those positions is accurate. I do think it's like a traditional liquidity issue. Now, other things like FTX or a solvency issue, there's negative equity, all the money's gone. Ha ha. Like they screwed everybody versus something like Gemini where people hear that they have a relationship with FTX and all the analome and people start withdrawing from Gemini earn and they start withdrawing from Circle Lend or whatever that product was called that's also built on top of it.
00:48:47.654 - 00:49:33.940, Speaker D: I feel like there's a classic bank run scenario where everybody withdrew whatever liquidity they could and Genesis no longer has the money on hand. I mean, most of their addresses are extremely public. You can go on ether scan and see how many stablecoins they hold. I mean, they ran out of stable coins and so they have to suspend withdrawals. It's possible that if they do enter bankruptcy, they have a relatively fast and simple restructuring where they just say, okay, we're going to wait for everyone to repay what they naturally owe. The whole book closes organically over a period of a year and then a year they haven't lost anyone's money, they can distribute everything again. But we'll see it's very clearly a situation where I don't think they have any dollar liquidity available.
00:49:34.630 - 00:50:10.606, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is not a situation where you would think, okay, there's fraud, or that Genesis is like that people who have money with Genesis are going to be getting pennies on the dollar. It's very clearly liquidity and duration mismatch. The problem though, is that so many things are dependent on Genesis that it freezes up so many things downstream. Right. What other market makers, what other know? How does this end up cascading if this continues on for very long or they have to go through a restructuring? I think I agree with Taru. There's a good chance that they can raise enough capital to unfreeze this whole system because everyone needs it. Right.
00:50:10.606 - 00:50:21.474, Speaker A: Like a lot of their counterparties would honestly be if you could do some kind of dominance assurance contract type thing with all your counterparties, say, look, if everybody puts in 10 million, we can get this thing coming again and everything's good.
00:50:21.592 - 00:50:51.402, Speaker B: Definitely mutually assured destruction here. But I do think the one thing is the GBTC stuff. No one really knows how much they lent against GBTC. They obviously took GBTC collateral a long time ago. That's like how faros grew from a $10 million fund to hundreds, whatever. First, and clearly those loans are I mean, those are not clear. And they did do some very silly things.
00:50:51.402 - 00:51:02.240, Speaker B: I feel like being like, oh yeah, we're going to do security via obscurity and not prove to you how much bitcoin we have. And I feel like their PR on this has been kind of whimsically bad.
00:51:02.850 - 00:51:53.726, Speaker A: Yeah. So just to sketch out here, because I think for a lot of people, the details are hard to follow. So DCG, the parent company of Genesis, also owns Grayscale, which is an asset management firm that runs GBTC, and EThe, which are these giant trusts, exchange traded products that you can buy out of a brokerage account. Now, GBTC and EThe, as we covered when we were talking about the Three Arrow saga, they are now trading at significant discounts to NAV. So there's more BTC in there, in the trust in GBTC than you would think from the underlying asset value for GBTC the trust. Now, this discount has widened by a significant margin over the last week and a half. And a lot of people now are starting to get afraid that the reason why the discount is widening is because there's some monkey business going on underneath the surface that perhaps there's not as much BTC in there as it originally claimed because blah, blah, blah, something, something.
00:51:53.726 - 00:52:25.426, Speaker A: So there's a lot of conspiracy theories flying around right now. Grayscale, in response to this, posted a Tweet thread where they basically said, look, all of the money is there. This is just business as usual for us. However, we are not going to do proof of reserves because that's just not we're about. But coinbase is the custodian. They've always verified that the assets are all there and correctly accounted for but for security. And did they just say security reasons? What was the reason why they said they wouldn't do proof of reserves? Just security reasons.
00:52:25.426 - 00:53:15.450, Speaker A: Okay, so for security reasons, we are not going to do proof of reserves. And this caused crypto Twitter to freak out even more and say, oh, what's the security reason? That doesn't make sense. If all the exchanges can do it, why can't you do it? And so now all these people seem to be afraid that GBTC is going to have some kind of meltdown or there's fraud or there's something else ridiculous going on which doesn't seem likely to, you know, to be honest, after this whole thing with FTX, I'm now downweighting all the things that, like, very confident on. But I still think it's very unlikely that there's any funny business going on here. Just that Grayscale is just kind of a Wall Street style firm and they're kind of secretive and maybe they have other agreements with counterparties that require them not to disclose the on chain addresses. So it's hard to say exactly why they're not disclosing. But if Coinbase is the custodian for this thing, I'm fairly confident, and it's an exchange rated product, I'm fairly confident.
00:53:16.190 - 00:53:28.880, Speaker B: The custody of the actual Grayscale shares, BTC is the problem. I think the problem is how big are the loans against GPTC shares they have. And that is not at all clear.
00:53:30.850 - 00:54:00.966, Speaker C: I agree, but I think that should be isolated to Genesis of those of the issues. Right. That the very popular trade in 2020, 2021 was Genesis would lend Bitcoin or ETH to funds to then go mint GBTC or ETH eShares. While they were trading at a premium and then they could sell on the market. And so you're basically getting this free spread. Obviously that has moved against most of those funds over the past year, which was a large part of the reason why someone like Three Arrows sort of ended up going underwater. But that's Genesis doing those loans against GPTC.
00:54:00.966 - 00:54:04.730, Speaker C: It's not like grayscale. The product is somewhat in distress.
00:54:06.270 - 00:54:34.290, Speaker A: Yeah. The other thing too is with liquidity locked up like this, markets are extremely illiquid and so it's going to be a lot harder for Genesis to liquidate people or to unwind a lot of these loans with liquidity being so impaired. And of course, the fact that Genesis itself is frozen is part of what's contributing to that impairment of liquidity because the market makers have no money. Credit has basically completely stopped flowing through crypto right now. This is worse than what it was during the Three Arrows crisis. Yes.
00:54:34.360 - 00:55:28.142, Speaker D: It all goes back to the origins of crypto, which I feel like have led to this crisis, which is an extremely complex web of CFI has been built around digital assets. And the whole reason we have crypto is so that you wouldn't get these crazy C Five financial disasters. And FTX and Genesis and so many different knock on effects. And GPTC are all intertwined crises of finance, not of crypto, but of finance. And it just goes all the way back full circle to like I think right now in this moment, people see not your keys, not your crypto. If you don't have the assets and they're tied up in some financial structure, they're not yours, they're someone else's. And you're going to have to wait for finance to unwind.
00:55:28.142 - 00:55:56.926, Speaker D: And that's what's happening. And I kind of think this whole thing is this chancellor on brink of the second bailout moment for crypto, which is like the Chancellor is on the brink of the third bailout, and it's one where we built finance too deeply around crypto assets. And I'm saddened by this and I hate that the system is seizing up, but it's a really complex system that replicates the system. We were meant to fix.
00:55:57.108 - 00:56:52.400, Speaker B: But long term, I think the death of centralized lenders and the perils of starting one hopefully will just migrate assets to higher collateralization ratios, way better, sort of like monitoring of the stuff. I mean, most of this comes from arguably incompetence from Genesis's underwriting, right? They didn't really do much underwriting. They were just like, oh, if you're using GBTC because there's the premium, we're always going to give you a loan to value of one. And obviously the market makers abuse that, then they abuse themselves, then they cause this. Now the biggest irony of this whole thing, and someone had this on Twitter, is that CoinDesk, which is owned by DCG, broke the story that caused FTX to fail, which then caused Genesis to have this liquidity crunch. And so it's sort of like DCG cause was the beginning and the end of their own.
00:56:54.290 - 00:57:54.558, Speaker A: Well. So, okay, this is an interesting philosophical question of like how mean you were harping on this in our last episode and you brought it up again, this idea that the lenders were really at fault. The lenders kind of had such poor underwriting standards that they kind of brought this on themselves and were it not for their bad behavior, perhaps all this could have been avoided. I kind of take a more fatalistic view, is that in a market economy there is basically no way to avoid. What you're describing is a credit cycle, right, where credit gets cheaper and cheaper and because of competition for deposits, people have to start loosening underwriting standards in order to just compete, otherwise they're going to die. And I kind of think like, look, you could look at sort of the idiosyncratic individual like, oh, well, should you really have taken FTT at this collateral ratio or not? Like, not every lender did it, but the broader thing that was happening in the overall market, whether you were lending against GBTC or FTT or not, right. This loosening of credit standards, I think it's like inevitable market dynamic.
00:57:54.654 - 00:58:50.600, Speaker B: I'll push back on this in one particular way, which is I now have talked to enough people who worked at centralized lenders in the last few weeks to basically have learned that 90% of loans never got liquidated, even when they were deep in default, because everyone wanted to keep they have the same eight customers. There's no other borrowers. So they were like, okay, yeah, we're just going to never liquidate you. That is not the way a loan should work, right? Like a loan should get liquidated when it's in default. If you believe that tenant, then these CFI lenders were stupid as shit. They should have actually tried to preserve themselves in some ways, right? They had no inclination to do that because they wanted to basically they wanted their customers to not die themselves, but then they killed themselves by supporting those. It's like an anti symbiotic relationship.
00:58:50.600 - 00:59:38.690, Speaker B: And I think this is one of the best arguments for why DeFi actually works is like you're getting liquidated no matter, so just take it. And the liquidation thing has been the number one thing we brought up, whether it was starting with FTX being forced to buy bad liquidations, whether it was these centralized lenders being dumb as shit and not being able to compute a loan to value other than less than one, or being able to liquidate anyone. There's just so much incompetence that I think you don't even see in normal finance. This just shows that you had too many idiotic cowboys running these organizations. And yeah, sure, I agree, there's some tendency for capital costs to be in a crunch, but some of the negligence and malfeasance of these centralized lenders is ridiculous.
00:59:39.110 - 01:00:24.706, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's well said, and I do agree with you there. I don't know how much of it is market structure and how much of it is just incompetence and greed. And maybe a part of this is also the fact that VCs were backing all this stuff and looking for this meteoric growth, and the only way to give it to them was to continue relying on, like you said, the eight people who actually were able to pay yield. So what's clear now, though? We haven't seen the end of this. There's more contagion that needs to work its way through the system and we don't know if Genesis is going to be the end of it and when they're going to recover, but there's a lot yet to follow. I really appreciate you guys jumping on and trying to continue doing the play by play and help people understand what's going on with FTX, but, yeah, there's more coming. And so we'll be back again soon to keep I hope not.
01:00:24.728 - 01:00:26.020, Speaker D: I hope there's no more coming.
01:00:28.550 - 01:00:43.510, Speaker A: There's one thing we've learned is that it took six months from Luna for this to happen. I think very recently. The six month anniversary of Luna just a few days ago. So there's definitely more coming, if there was any indication from Luna. But it might take a while for us to understand exactly where it pops up.
01:00:43.660 - 01:00:45.030, Speaker B: Happy Thanksgiving.
01:00:45.370 - 01:00:58.090, Speaker A: Happy Thanksgiving, everybody, and best of luck in explaining to your family what the hell was going on. Hopefully this podcast can be a little help to you at the Thanksgiving dinner. So that's it. Thanks, everybody. Yep.
