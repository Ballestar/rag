00:00:00.330 - 00:00:29.750, Speaker A: You basically what it does is it adds this layer around your protocol through which all funds flow. And what this allows you to do is that before any assets leave the protocol, it gives you some time to basically evaluate evaluate that withdrawal, essentially, from the protocol, and basically do some added analysis on it, whether it's malicious or not. So this can be done on chain or off chain, but basically it gives you time to intervene in case you realize that the code allowed somebody to maliciously withdraw some amount.
00:00:29.900 - 00:00:47.522, Speaker B: So I saw in the proposal that it would limit the withdrawals by these time periods, like you mentioned, as was done on the traditional exchange. So if that were to happen, then who would get notified in the event of this large withdrawal that trips the circuit breaker?
00:00:47.666 - 00:00:55.530, Speaker A: Yeah. So it would be the team in charge, charge of essentially controlling and monitoring the protocol. So this would likely be the devs and the core team of the protocol.
