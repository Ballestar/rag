00:00:00.170 - 00:00:58.890, Speaker A: Of consumer apps have the empty room problem that's really commonly known in the startup world. Metaverses have an empty world problem. It's even worse because now you require all these humans to coordinate, to meet in a metaverse all at the same time across all time zones, and hopefully you'll have a great conversation, but that doesn't really happen, right? So our thinking is that, well, if we can't coordinate all these humans to be in these spaces, what else can we do? In the gaming world since the 80s, you have the new Zelda game that came out. Imagine playing Zelda where there's no creatures and there's no characters to talk to. You're just walking aimlessly in this beautiful world, but what are you doing in this world? And so in this same context, we need to populate these empty worlds, these metaverses, these autonomous world with NPCs that can talk, have personality, can perform on chain action. That's what gives the liveliness of these worlds. It makes it alive.
