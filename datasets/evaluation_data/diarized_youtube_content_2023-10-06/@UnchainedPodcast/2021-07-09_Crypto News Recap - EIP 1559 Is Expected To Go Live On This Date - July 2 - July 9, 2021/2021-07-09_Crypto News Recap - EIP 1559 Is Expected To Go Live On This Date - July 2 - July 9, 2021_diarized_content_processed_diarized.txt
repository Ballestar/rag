First Headline UK bank customers are being blocked from Binance On Monday, Barclays announced that its customers would no longer be able to use credit or debit cards to make payments to Binance. The UK based bank sent a notice saying, quote as you've made a payment to Binance this year, we wanted to let you know that we're stopping payments made by credit debit card to them until further notice. This is to help keep your money safe. On Thursday, Spanish banking giant Banco Santander announced a similar move by blocking payments to Binance for UK customers. A spokesperson explained, quote in recent months, we have seen a large increase in UK customers becoming the victims of cryptocurrency fraud. Keeping our customers safe is a top priority.

The EU's Payment Network. Finance, described the suspension as, quote, beyond our control and said it is, quote, working hard to find a solution with our partners. The company expects to have Sepa payments live within seven days. For now, customers in 36 countries cannot use this system to deposit cash on a Binance, though withdrawals are still allowed. Finance's regulatory struggles come after a June announcement from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, which said Binance should not be allowed to operate within the UK, likely as the result of numerous actions adverse to Binance across several jurisdictions. On Thursday, CEO Changpang Zhao published a blog outlining the company's plan for regulation and development as the crypto industry grows.
00:01:41.058 - 00:02:33.418, Speaker A: Zhao called for clear regulations and expressed plans to grow Binance's international compliance team, expand compliance partnerships with companies like CipherTrace, which Disclosure is a former sponsor of My Shows and to localize business operations.

00:03:59.820 - 00:05:13.774, Speaker A: The company is going public just as its stablecoin USDC is at an all time high of market cap of $26 billion.

Next headline ethereum's london Hard Fork set for August 4 ethereum's much anticipated London Hard Fork is expected to launch on August 4 at block number 12,965,000. London features five Ethereum improvement proposals that aim to make the blockchain more efficient while preparing the network for Ethereum 20, which will replace proof of work with proof of stake. Notably, London introduces EIP 1559, which introduces a new fee structure for transactions on unchained. As I recently discussed with Taylor Monahan and Tim Baco, EIP 1559 should make gas prices easier to determine and could potentially make Ether a deflationary asset, since part of every fee on ethereum will be burned.
00:05:13.774 - 00:06:37.398, Speaker A: EIP 3554 is also highly anticipated, as it effectively freezes Ethereum's mining difficulty until the blockchain is ready to shift to proof of stake. Next Headline The Bitcoin Mining Council claims half of bitcoin's electricity usage is sustainable According to a statement from the Bitcoin Mining Council, 56% of the electricity used to mine bitcoin came from sustainable sources during quarter two of 2021. The statistics stem from a voluntary survey of the bitcoin network, which the BMC plans to initiate and publish every quarter. The BMC claims to have collected information from 32% of the current bitcoin network. Survey participants say they currently use a 67% sustainable power mix, and the council estimates that this means the global industry's sustainable energy mix is at 56%. However, as the block's Larry Cermac debated the merits of the survey, asking on Twitter How can any conclusions be made from the survey if more than 50% of hash rate went offline and is relocating at the moment, which can easily take months? Speaking of hash rate, on Saturday, bitcoin's mining difficulty dove 28% at block 689471, marking the largest decrease in mining difficulty ever. The adjustment is the third straight decline in mining difficulty which has not occurred since 2018.
00:06:37.398 - 00:07:16.562, Speaker A: With mining difficulty plunging mining profitability should increase and already has in some cases. As metrics from Bituda, a digital asset financial services platform, show revenue has potentially almost doubled accordingly. June results from Marathon Digital, a Las Vegas based mining firm, show the miner produced 17% more bitcoin than in May, bringing in 256.6 bitcoins. Marathon's q two haul of 654 bitcoins is more than three times its production from Q One. Next headline. Tesla could face $100 million in bitcoin impairment, according to CNBC's.

00:08:01.990 - 00:08:47.346, Speaker A: Did Tesla sell any bitcoin in the quarter to make up for some of those losses? Per SEC guidelines, Tesla could not mark up the value of its bitcoin. Of course.
