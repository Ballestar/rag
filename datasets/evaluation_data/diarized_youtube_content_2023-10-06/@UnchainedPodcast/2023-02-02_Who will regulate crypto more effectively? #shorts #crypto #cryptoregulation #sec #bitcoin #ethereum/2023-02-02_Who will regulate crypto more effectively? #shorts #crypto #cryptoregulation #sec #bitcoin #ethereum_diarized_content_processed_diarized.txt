00:00:09.098 - 00:00:20.414, Speaker B: Implementation is a few months, if not a couple of years away, unfortunately. But be it as it may, this can in any event only be the first step.

So we're expecting to see a lot of activity at the state level while we ah potential federal gridlock in Congress.
