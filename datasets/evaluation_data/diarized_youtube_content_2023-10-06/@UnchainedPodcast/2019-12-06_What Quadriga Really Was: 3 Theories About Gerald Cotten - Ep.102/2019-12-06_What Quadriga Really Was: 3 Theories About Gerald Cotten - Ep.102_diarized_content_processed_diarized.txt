My team and I got creative with one of the t shirt designs and came up with an image of a crypto rabbit falling down a hole. Swirling into the hole with the rabbit are playing cards showing some of the coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero, as well as a Dow card ripped in half. There is a Guy Fox mask, DeFi cake, a lambo, and a teapot that says Hodl, as well as teacups showing the reddit and Twitter logos. There's even a shitcoin the rabbit is wearing a big bitcoin key on a keychain, a unicorn and rainbow t shirt, and of course, is listening to Unchained.

00:01:53.598 - 00:01:57.214, Speaker A: Today's guest is writer Nathaniel rich. Welcome, Nathaniel.
00:01:57.342 - 00:01:58.562, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:58.696 - 00:02:03.410, Speaker A: You wrote an excellent article on the is it quadriga or quadriga?
00:02:05.190 - 00:02:10.358, Speaker C: I say quadriga, though in truth, it depends, I think, who you're talking to.
00:02:10.524 - 00:02:17.510, Speaker A: Okay. Because I used to say quadriga, and then when I read it was like, for the Roman chariots, I was like, oh, it should be like quadriga.
00:02:18.490 - 00:02:28.778, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I studied Latin, and I still am not sure. I think in Canada I heard quadriga more often, but I can't bring myself to pronounce it.
00:02:28.784 - 00:02:36.302, Speaker A: That oh, okay. Because I think that's more like an English pronunciation. And then quadriga is more like Italian, but anyway okay.
00:02:36.356 - 00:02:38.320, Speaker C: Oh, maybe that's why I go there. Yeah.
00:02:39.250 - 00:03:24.890, Speaker A: So you wrote this great article on we'll just say quadrica. They called Quadrica exchange for Vanity Fair, and I think most of my listeners will know this exchange as being the Canadian exchange that closed after the owner, Gerald Cotton, mysteriously died in India. And because he was the only one with the private keys, that meant that the $250,000,000 owned by the 75,000 users of Quadriga was not accessible. However, there were a number of clues, such as the fact that he created his will shortly before his death, that he knew that an exchange needed to have backups of private keys, et cetera, that this may not have actually been an error. So what did you find out about Gerald Cotton and his background?
00:03:26.190 - 00:04:31.300, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I mean, that's a good account of what the original story was that he had lost the attention was on this idea that he had lost his keys to the wallets, the cold wallets, that all the funds were on. But it quickly was determined, really by people anonymous accounts online, commenting on Reddit and Twitter and the like, that those wallets were, in fact, probably empty or that a lot of money had already moved out of them. And that was indeed borne out once Ernst Young, the accounting firm that was tasked with tracking down all of the money by a court, had access to some of these internal accounts and files, although there wasn't very good bookkeeping going on. But they basically figured that out as well. And so then attention started to turn to Cotton himself, who he was, who his business partners were, and what kind of business Quadrigo was, exactly.
00:04:31.990 - 00:04:35.278, Speaker A: Yeah. And so what did you find out about him?
00:04:35.464 - 00:06:13.570, Speaker C: I think the main thing to understand about him, the main turn in the investigation and public reception of the case, is that he wasn't really this persona that he projected, which is this bright, young bitcoin enthusiast who was very excited about the possibilities of virtual currency in a kind of utopian sense, and that he was a kind of can do businessman who was trying to make it easier to spread, to propagate this technology. He really was, first and foremost, a Ponzi schemer. His experience with running Ponzi schemes went back to his early high school years, when he was 14 or 15. There are records of his involvement in these very crazy, labyrinthine websites devoted to this online Ponzi scheme world, about which I knew very little before investigating, before reporting the piece. But that was really where he lived. And it was only when he was in his mid to late 20s, after running a series of rackets for years, for more than a decade, that he turned to the idea of a cryptocurrency exchange. And once you go pretty deep into his history, you start to realize that I started to realize that Quadriga bore much more in common with these other schemes he had run in the past than with the Bitcoin ideology.
00:06:15.350 - 00:06:55.010, Speaker A: Why don't we actually just dive into a couple of these, just briefly, because one of them, the one that yes, he did while he was in high school, that one blew my mind. He was 15, and he started something called SNS Investments, which was a pyramid scheme. The other one was Midas Gold, which I believe people in the crypto space probably should have heard of. And he did that with a partner that he had met in these forums devoted to these so called high yield investment programs or HYIPs. Can you talk a little bit about who Michael was, what these HYIPs were, and a little bit more about their history and like Midas Gold?
00:06:55.510 - 00:07:44.834, Speaker C: Yeah. So the real turn came when the scrutiny turned from Cotton himself to his co founder Michael Petron, who, it was known, know it varied depending on what community you're in, but basically people in the bitcoin world in Canada for the most part knew who he was, knew him personally. It's not a huge world at the time. He was someone who had a shady past which, which didn't necessarily distinguish him greatly. There were a lot of people in this sphere then, and I'm talking about the early days of Quadriga 20, 13, 20, 14, 20, 15 around there. There were a lot of people who had maybe a checkered past who were drawn to this technology. It doesn't mean they were all operating with ill intent, but he was certainly one of them.
00:07:44.834 - 00:09:05.580, Speaker C: He had a record, a criminal record. He'd served time in a federal penitentiary in the US. For his part in an earlier money laundering scheme. And he had been associated with a number of sort of online, essentially money laundering operations, which, depending on how one the level of illegality kind of depended on how you looked at it and what level of suspension of disbelief you wanted to ascribe to it. But Midas Gold was one of the most popular and it was used to transfer funds, money fiat into Liberty Reserve, sort of a predecessor to kind of cryptocurrency. He was a middleman in that process. And one thing that was revealed early on was that not only did Patron and Cotton have a relationship that went back to when Cotton was 14 and 15 and haunting these online forums about HYIPs, but they had worked together on just about every number of enterprises over the years.
00:09:05.580 - 00:10:03.440, Speaker C: Usually Patron was more in the kind of financial services area, so operations like Midas Gold were transferring funds from one type of fiat into some other kind of currency. And Cotton tended to do the more sort of outright investment programs, which were basically Ponzi schemes where he would say, give me $100 and I'll give you back $150 tomorrow, that kind of thing, with varying degrees of sophistication. And one of the big breaks was that it was discovered that Midas Gold, in its online registration documents, used Jerry Cotton's contact information. And that was sort of the first glimpse of collaboration, professional collaboration that had been going on before Quadriga and really all the way back to Cotton's teenage years.
00:10:04.130 - 00:10:29.670, Speaker A: Yeah. And one other piece of this was that Michael Patron is actually not Michael Patron. His name is Omar Donati. So there's like a whole nother thing about that. But I actually just want to move on to what was actually going on at Quadriga. You wrote, quote, we now know that cotton began no later than 2015 to steal his clients funds. He also created dozens of false trading accounts to stimulate trading volume on the platform.
00:10:29.670 - 00:11:19.106, Speaker A: In fact, he even disclosed in the 2015 filings this was to go public. He neglected to disclose, however, that he filled those fake accounts with invented funds trading counterfeit Bitcoin for real Bitcoin and Canadian and American dollars. By the time of his death, cotton's Sham trading accounts, which had names like R PO spelled not the way that they sound, but anyway, you can read it in the article had conducted approximately 300,000 trades. So you also mentioned other shady things like that he dealt in cash, which is obviously very weird for a crypto exchange. And you also mentioned though, that these business irregularities appear to have begun before Patron and the other board members left. So do you think they knew it's.
00:11:19.138 - 00:11:54.846, Speaker C: So hard to unravel, it's scams on top of scams and sort of crimes on top of crimes that it's hard to unravel at a certain point. And that's how I wrote the piece. Essentially. There's different theories of the case. By one theory of the case, I think it's impossible to believe that he started Quadriga out of some kind of for the reasons, I guess, that he spoke about it publicly, it seemed pretty clear. Meaning?
00:11:54.878 - 00:11:55.570, Speaker A: Michael.
00:11:56.310 - 00:12:31.994, Speaker C: Sorry, meaning cotton. With Michael founded Quadriga and Cotton was the public facing representative. He's the one who gave interviews and boosted it for the most part. And of course, he spoke about the glories of cryptocurrency and how it was really difficult to trade if you were just a normal person without technical expertise. And this was a platform that would make it easy, it seems, by under any interpretation that was not his motivation. It seemed to have started as some kind of a scheme. The question then is what kind of scheme was it?
00:12:32.192 - 00:12:45.234, Speaker A: Okay, you know what? Let's do this. So let's take our ad break right now. So in a moment we're going to discuss your three main theories for what actually happened. But first, we'll have this quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:12:45.352 - 00:13:35.754, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean. And that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

00:14:30.830 - 00:14:44.770, Speaker A: The first being that quadragar was a scam. The second you dubbed the royal fuck up. And then the third was what you called the mastermind theory. So why don't you just start with the first one? Like, what are the events or what's the evidence that you have for the scam theory?
00:14:44.850 - 00:15:34.502, Speaker C: Right. Well, I should say in all three, they start as a scam. I think there's no other possible interpretation. True, but what kind of scam is it? I think that under the first theory, it was a scam in the mold of all the other scams he had basically wrong to that point, which is he was trying to lure a lot of people onto the platform, get them to deposit money. He was taking a percentage. But it seems that the real way to make money was once you have a lot of people's money locked up on the account to pull the plug, give people excuses, excuses after excuses, and essentially run away with a lot of the money and blame third parties banks who are uncooperative or software glitches and so on. And that stuff started to happen.
00:15:34.502 - 00:16:41.520, Speaker C: Indeed, there was a software glitch that seems to have actually been real, where they lost $14 million in a single one fell swoop. There were third party payment processors who had to service the platform's intermediary with Canadian banks because of the regulations in Canada. And a bunch of those businesses, which were pretty shady enterprises to begin with, also appeared to have stolen money and charged huge transaction fees and so on. And however, there's the possibility that at a certain point he started to become convinced. He started to drink the Kool Aid and started to become convinced that this business actually could be very profitable as a legitimate business. And that starts to happen once the price of Bitcoin goes on this stratospheric rise. And so there is a possibility that around 2016, when he made efforts to take the company public, that he actually thought, okay, I don't need to rob these people.
00:16:41.520 - 00:17:18.258, Speaker C: Simply the volume of trading going on in the exchange was significant enough that I could just make a fortune in this legitimate way. And he was, he was making a lot of money at that time. At one point quadriga was processing a billion dollars of trades a year and he was getting a cut of every single one. So that's kind of the best case. The most virtuous theory is that he started off somewhat corrupt and then tried to do good, and then it just didn't work out and then things started to fall apart.
00:17:18.434 - 00:17:20.966, Speaker A: So is this now the royal fuck up theory?
00:17:21.158 - 00:18:07.570, Speaker C: Well, no. Under this first theory, the virtuous theory, then people did steal from him. These third party payment processors stole from him. They lost money. And in an effort to try to make back his clients funds, he started to conduct some questionable trades, moving money out of the exchange, which we know he did, and making bets on pretty high risk bets on fairly obscure forms of cryptocurrency in an effort to recoup the losses that were legitimate. And we know for a fact he was making these bets and the bets spiraled and he basically kept doubling down and kept losing. So that's sort of the most virtuous best case scenario.
00:18:07.570 - 00:18:33.166, Speaker C: And then, of course, we should say then he goes on this honeymoon in India as things are spiraling and the price of bitcoin is falling and people are trying to pull their money out of the exchange and there's not enough money in the exchange, and he gets essentially food poisoning. He has Crohn's disease and he dies of complications from Crohn's disease in India on his honeymoon. Now, the second theory, which I think is the most I should ask, are.
00:18:33.188 - 00:18:34.510, Speaker A: You ready for the second theory?
00:18:35.750 - 00:18:37.666, Speaker C: The second theory, which I think is.
00:18:37.768 - 00:18:39.650, Speaker A: Probably sitting on the edge of my seat.
00:18:42.070 - 00:19:47.318, Speaker C: The kind of Occam's razor theory, the one that makes the most sense, although it's not airtight, is that yes, he started it as a scam. He started doing once once the money started flowing in because the market took off, he started basically doing all these other scams on top of it, some of which included just stealing funds from his clients. He started to just splash cash around Canada. He bought $12 million in real estate properties. He bought a yacht, an airplane, and he was on taking foreign vacations, it seems like almost every other week with his wife or to be wife. And under this theory he basically was like a small time scammer who lucked out beyond his wildest imagination and came into a ton of money and lost total control. Was not able to keep it up at the scale required of a major business and combination of frittered it away.
00:19:47.318 - 00:20:45.900, Speaker C: Had money no oversight, had a lot of money stolen from him. And then we still have the same kind of ending, which is as people start to pull out money and there's not enough money to pay out angry customers, he starts to panic and he starts to do these crazy trades and loses even more. And again he goes to India and he dies. That's like the theory that I think most people who follow it very closely and there is a very large community of folks who have obsessively followed every aspect of it, including some of the more baroque technical aspects of the case. That one, I think at this stage, I'd say is about that's sort of the 70% theory, if you ask most people. Okay, but what was shocking to me and that was my theory going into the reporting, once I'd done sort of my original reading about the piece, I assumed that's what had happened, some version of that had happened. I would have said 99% chance that's what happened.
00:20:47.230 - 00:20:57.150, Speaker A: So I'm going to let you do the third theory. But we need to also then after this, address the death, whether that was accidental. But anyway okay, so third theory.
00:20:57.730 - 00:21:47.934, Speaker C: So what was shocking to me about the reporting was that I went from say, 99.9% sure that the fuck up theory as I laid out, was what had happened to more like 70%. Because everybody I spoke to the people with the greatest authority, the people who had both investigated it the most and the lawyers on the case. At this Bay Street law firm, miller Thompson, which is representing the class of defrauded the creditor class. All that 75,000 plus people who've lost money on the exchange and even talking to people. Of course, the FBI and the RCMP in Canada wouldn't talk to me. But those who've been interviewed by them and both of those organizations are conducting their own criminal investigation as we speak.
00:21:48.132 - 00:21:51.306, Speaker A: The RCMP is the Royal Canadian something police.
00:21:51.338 - 00:22:14.310, Speaker C: I forget the Mounties. Yeah. And they're essentially the Canadian FBI, although much dangerously underresourced and from what I've understood from this reporting, totally over its head, in over its head with this case. Very weak understanding of cryptocurrency.
00:22:14.810 - 00:22:18.182, Speaker A: Okay, but anyway, you were saying people interviewed by them say what?
00:22:18.236 - 00:23:48.466, Speaker C: So, yeah, the people who've been interviewed by them also have the sense that they have great suspicions about whether Cotton is really dead. And so that leads us to the mastermind theory which is that Cotton is not some amateur fuck up who got in over his head but instead that this was very well plotted and that the whole thing is a cover up, basically. And that he, very carefully, over the years was able to move money off of the exchange in a controlled way to accounts that he controlled and that it was, in fact, an exit scheme that was designed as designed from the beginning but it was an exit scheme that he executed. And that the final step was when things became started to get risky, dangerous for him. When basically the public started to become aware that Quadrigo was running fractionally, which means they didn't have enough money to pay back their investors, that there were lawsuits, that there was increasing scrutiny, that he pulled the plug and went to India and faked his own death and is now sitting on an island somewhere, perhaps with a new face and new identification and all the rest. Perhaps with his own personal plane. He has a pilot's license and a boat.
00:23:48.466 - 00:24:24.850, Speaker C: He has his boating license, and, of course, the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars that he's stolen. And so in the piece, I lay out exactly how that might have happened. And it is plausible. Again, it's not the most likely scenario. But of course, for an exit scheme to work, especially one on this scale, it has to appear implausible to the public. Otherwise, he would never get away with it. The public has to believe that he's dead.
00:24:24.850 - 00:24:46.082, Speaker C: And at this point, that's the case. Most people do, except for the people closest to it who have, as I said, some great suspicions about the narrative and think that he could have very well have taken the money off and that he hasn't.
00:24:46.226 - 00:25:22.174, Speaker A: And the reasons, as far as I recall, or not the reasons, but some of the evidence that supports this theory are that there was a safe that he talked about that was bolted to the rafters in his attic, which had been removed before his death. And then there was another one, you said, that employees remembered or I don't remember if it was employees, but even maybe acquaintances remembered seeing him in various international airports carrying, like, $50,000 of cash and stuff like that. So you were saying that there might have been times when he was moving money offshore.
00:25:22.222 - 00:26:43.854, Speaker C: Essentially, in theory, he wouldn't have had to do it that way necessarily. I think the most interesting possibility is, and this is something I know the FBI is investigating, because they've asked experts that I've interviewed about it was that we know he was conducting these somewhat ludicrously high risk margin trades on obscure forms of cryptocurrency on other exchanges. So, in other words, he took a bunch of money off of quadriga that should have been pooled money from his people who were trading on the platform, moved it into a personal account on another exchange or several other exchanges, and made on those exchanges, used the money to make these bets. And what we know is that we know some of those trades, and they're crazy trades, basically, real long shot trades. So one argument is, well, he was desperate, and he was trying to get himself out of a hole. That's sort of in the fuck up theory. But another is that they were such high risk trades and they were such exotic trades that they could have been designed in such a way that the person that he was trading with on the platform could have been someone who controlled an account, someone known to him.
00:26:43.854 - 00:27:28.874, Speaker C: It could have been him. And essentially, there's this idea that he could have been laundering money through these high risk trades on another platform. Now, it's risky because on these platforms, when you're trading funds. Anybody on the platform can trade with you, depending on the platform. It's usually pretty public when you're trading a lot of currency at one time. And yet there's a way from speaking with experts in currency exchange and cryptocurrency exchange in particular, they say it is possible that that could have happened. So that would have probably been the most likely way.
00:27:28.874 - 00:28:24.974, Speaker C: He would have got huge amounts of money off of quadriga and into anonymous accounts that he controlled some other way. So that's sort of the best going theory of how it happened. Although, yes, we know he had tons of cash. I've seen photographs of his kitchen where he just has piles of cash on the kitchen table, maybe a million dollars or so in one photograph. And so he did have a lot of cash. There's also reason to believe he had a lot of ether. This is something I didn't have space to write about in the article, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that he had a ton of ether in his private, that it was privately held by him and that he didn't disclose in his will or in his other certainly not in any tax returns or anything like that.
00:28:24.974 - 00:29:02.140, Speaker C: So there's enough there that makes this idea plausible or possible, and it can't really be tested unless you dig up the body. In some ways, the biggest obstacle to this theory is the fact that there was a body that was transferred from India to Canada and was buried in a cemetery outside of in Halifax. So you could, in theory, dig up the body. And that's what a lot of observers want Canadian authorities to do. But to this point the RCMP has shown no inclination to do that.
00:29:02.670 - 00:29:20.350, Speaker A: That's interesting. Yeah. So we're overtime. But just quickly, before we know, there were a number of theories online about the circumstances surrounding his death. Do you think that he is actually dead? And also, this is two questions and one, what is your sense of what's happening with law enforcement?
00:29:21.490 - 00:30:27.826, Speaker C: Like I said, I think he's probably dead. I'm somewhere around 80% myself, I would say. I think in some ways the hardest yeah, when you the the most difficult thing to overcome with the mastermind theory is the fact is his wife's wool in it. And it's hard to imagine that if he had faked his death that she wouldn't have been in on it because basically you're asking her to. She witnessed his last 24 hours in the hospital when he was very sick and she flew back with the body. So assuming that if he did fake his own death, then you'd have to assume that she was in on it, which then begs the question, well, why would he fake his death in such a way that his wife had to keep up the act and come back to Canada and keep up the act? For many, that's that's sort of the trickiest part of know there are arguments for how that might have happened. There are theories about it, but that's sort of the most outlandish aspect of it in terms of the investigations.
00:30:27.826 - 00:31:24.390, Speaker C: My sense is that the FBI investigation is serious and thorough and that they have a lot of information that nobody else does, including information from a lot of these other exchanges that Cotton had moved quadriga funds to. Those exchanges have not, as far as I was able to gather, have not spoken to the RCMP or any other investigative body. And so it's very possible that the FBI will come out with some kind of findings that are more substantial or change the narrative in some way. But it's also very possible that they basically essentially uncover the same information but in greater detail, and therefore we don't get any farther in our understanding of the case. And I guess at a certain point, the question will be whether the FBI asks the RCMP to authorize digging up the yeah.
00:31:24.540 - 00:31:41.340, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the part that's confusing for me is if he did unbolt the safe, then that kind of lends credence to the idea that something about this was premeditated. Right? Because if you accidentally die, you're not going to be like, oh, I need to take these funds. Do you know what I mean?
00:31:42.930 - 00:32:42.110, Speaker C: Yeah. The whole thing with not having the wallet, keys to the wallet, or that he was the only one who had that doesn't add up. We have podcast interviews with him from a year before he died where he talks about how important it is to never to have plans for what to do if somebody what to do with your keys. It's sort of Crypto 101 as I understand it. And so that was the most outlandish part of the original version of the case to folks who knew him and in the community. They thought it was inconceivable that he would not have a backup plan, not only for his death, but even if he's kidnapped or incapacitated in some way. And he did, in fact, tell people, his friends and family, that there was a kill switch, that if something had happened to him, that these codes would go out to his friends and family.
00:32:42.110 - 00:33:16.220, Speaker C: And so that part of it is very mysterious and sort of doesn't make sense, although, to be honest, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. And that's what's fascinating about the case, is that there's no theory of the three ones that I laid out, I think there's none that totally works. There are flaws in each of them and inconsistencies. And so it allows one to entertain every possibility, basically.
00:33:16.830 - 00:33:28.586, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'm sure my listeners will keep Noodling on this. We are well over time, but this was just so fascinating. I'm so glad that you came on the show. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.

00:34:18.830 - 00:35:19.662, Speaker A: The biggest news this week was that Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith was arrested at Lax on Thanksgiving for assisting North Korea in evading sanctions. Afterward, many crypto people made comments on Twitter like that what Virgil did could help North Koreans break their dependence on the state, or saying that it goes too far to say diplomacy with the North Korean government could never help the North Korean people, or that what he did could bring out peace between the two Koreas. And other comments that indicated that people in the crypto community don't seem to know much about North Korea. This created a lot of cognitive dissonance for those of us who do have a fair amount of knowledge about North Korea. This was not that long after we saw everybody up in arms about censorship by Americans to appease the Chinese government. So to see the same people were now saying, wait a minute. Let's not pass judgment on the guy who helped the most censorial dictatorship on the planet, which doesn't even let its country on the internet at all, and doesn't let its citizens leave, doesn't let its citizens travel within the country without approval.
00:35:19.662 - 00:36:30.780, Speaker A: And the country that will also lock you, your family, in two generations after you in a prison camp if you do something it perceives to be against it. That was just like, wait, so if you're fighting for censorship resistance, why are you justifying the behavior of somebody who was helping the number one biggest censor in the world? And it was also especially jarring to see this from the unicorns and rainbows crowd. So I ended up tweeting what I believe may be my first tweet storm ever, which states some facts about North Korea. Just to make it clear what words like peace and public mean in the North Korean context. So, for instance, public in our countries sounds innocuous because it indicates everything's out in the open. What is there to hide? But North Korea public means it's approved by the dictatorship, meaning it's something that does not, at the very least, does not hurt Kim Jong UN's ability to continue oppressing the 25 million people under his rule. So using the word public as it pertains to North Korea actually doesn't have the same innocuous connotation or the concept of peace between North Korea and the south, or between North Korea and the US.
00:36:30.780 - 00:37:24.326, Speaker A: Again, that sounds so nice. But in the North Korean context, it just has a super twisted meaning, because that implies that the Kim regime survives, which then again means that it continues oppressing 25 million people living there, which doesn't sound like peace to me. It's like being like, oh, we'll let that guy keep all the hostages and we'll call it peace. So I was surprised by the reaction to my tweetstorm because I still wasn't sure if people didn't actually know these things, because I was not saying anything even remotely new. But actually somebody tweeted back at me, asking me what the everyday North Koreans access is to the Internet. And I realized, whoa, okay, so that is so basic to me, it didn't even occur to me to tweet. It like when I said that they cannot know information about the outside world without exposing the Kim regime's lies and getting them in trouble.
00:37:24.326 - 00:38:19.500, Speaker A: That meant, of course, that everyday North Korean people are prohibited from accessing the Internet. I'm not even sure how many of them will even know what the Internet is. So, yes, while in theory getting cryptocurrency to people in oppressive regimes could very well be helpful in the case of North Korea, how do you even do that if they don't have a way to connect to the Internet, and if they, in attempting to do so, can risk their lives? So I think some people took my Tweet storm as stating some opinion on Virgil. Like, I saw some stories saying that I was criticizing him, but actually the Tweet storm really didn't have that much to do with Virgil. I was just trying to explain that to people know when they were saying these things that that wasn't exactly what they like. I wanted them to know those words don't have the same meanings that you think they do when you use them applied to Korea. Like, this is what it means on the ground when you say those things.
00:38:19.500 - 00:39:05.686, Speaker A: What I did say about Virgil is that I have no idea what was in his head. But given the facts about the whole thing, my best guesses are that either he did not know how things work in North Korea, or that if he did, he doesn't really care. So Lee Quinn of CoinDesk had the best story, just kind of summarizing the whole thing. Reuters reported that Virgil had thought it would be cool if North Korea mined ether. And just to show you, North Korea definitely has an interest in cryptocurrency. Bleeping Computer had a story about a fake cryptocurrency trading site that was ridden with malware that is believed to be created by a North Korean hacking group. So now, moving on from the censor who won't let his people on the Internet at all to the sensor that won't let its people onto certain websites on the Internet.
00:39:05.686 - 00:40:39.494, Speaker A: Second headline chinese Internet Firewall blocks Etherscan. Wolfi Zhao of CoinDesk, who was a recent guest on Unconfirmed, reported that the Chinese firewall has blocked Ethereum Block Explorer Etherscan since at least October 30. He writes, quote this is likely the first known case of a blockchain Explorer becoming an Internet firewall target and puts Etherscan IO in the company of such blocked information and social media sites as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. Third headline could DeFi lending compromise security on proof of stake chains haseeb Qureshi of Dragonfly Capital had a fascinating and worrying analysis about how attractive rates for DeFi lending could lower the amount of staking on a proof of stake chain, thereby harming the security of the network. Even worse, once that flywheel gets turning, people will want to short ETH, which then increases the demand for borrowing, which then drives the interest rate for lending even higher. So his analysis was based on a paper by Tarun Chitra, who also tweeted some of the detail the technical details about this for those of you who want to look at those, Eric Connor of Gnosis ETH Hub and into the Ether podcast, put some numbers to this and show that such an attack would be quite expensive. Next headline China Exchange watch Binance getting the cold shoulder Matthew Graham of Sino Global Capital tweeted that Huobi and Okx are getting some level of approval in China while binance and international exchanges are getting what he called iced out.
00:40:39.494 - 00:41:42.406, Speaker A: A Twitter account related to the Spartan Group stated that they think finance will still do better over the long term. Next headline MNA and crypto Barbarians on the blockchain Token Data published a report on activity in MNA in the crypto space showing that such deals peaked in 2018 at $2.3 billion and are coming in at around $700 million in 2019. They segment this activity out, with one subset being, quote The MNA barbarians trading is crypto's first killer app, providing big exchanges with cash and networks to engage in acquisitions. Unsurprisingly Coinbase 16 deals leads a pack and engages in all types of deals industry consolidation, regulatory plays, talent and some other categories of this activity include pay to play and regulatory m A. It's worth checking out the full report or at least the tweetstorm on it. Finally are Hong Kong protests driving adoption of crypto? A dive into the numbers LongHash had a great article exploring whether or not the protests in Hong Kong have spurred adoption of crypto.
00:41:42.406 - 00:42:27.882, Speaker A: The short answer is no, but it is worth looking at the charts and graphs in the article to see how they arrive at this conclusion and why that might be. Finally, fun bits Coin jazeera hit it out of the park with a hilarious recap of the Virgil incident. The headline Ethereum's real use case finally discovered helping North Korea. I'll just read a bit. Griffith was warned by everyone not to go to North Korea and be so overt about pitching Ethereum's first and only real use case. Everyone from Vitalik Buterin his friends on Facebook, followers on Twitter, his parents to even Stevie Wonder himself claimed he was retarded, saying, even my blind ass can see that's a dumb idea. Our reporters have learned that even libertarian hero Ross Ulbrecht wrote him a letter on his best toilet paper to call him dumb for going.
00:42:27.882 - 00:43:10.934, Speaker A: None of this would deter the brave and foolish Griffith from attempting to liberate the North Korean people by teaching their benevolent leader how to launder money. The Ethereum Foundation reluctantly accepted this daring pivot into helping oppressive regimes. They rationalized that as long as Virgil didn't get caught, everything would be fine. Of course, as attention loving nerds often do, griffith posted about his federal crime on Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist and random billboards overlooking the highway. This is actually, most of it is a true fact. He even went so far as to alert the FBI themselves as to what he was doing because they seemed so supportive of good decision making and wanted to learn everything they could to help. All right, that is it for this week's news.
