Here to discuss are Willie Wu, an on chain bitcoin analyst and writer of the bitcoin forecast, a market intelligence newsletter, and Raphael Schultz Kraft, co founder and CTO of Glassnode. Welcome, Willie and Raphael.
00:01:51.490 - 00:01:53.630, Speaker A: Hey, Laura. Great to be back.
00:01:53.780 - 00:01:58.718, Speaker D: Hey, Laura. Thanks for having me. Five years of the podcast. I didn't know. Congrats.
00:01:58.814 - 00:02:46.350, Speaker B: Thank you. The market has been in the doldrums recently with bitcoin as of the time of this recording, which is Thursday morning eastern, the day before the official start of the BTC Miami conference, trading in the high 30,000 as opposed to 30,000 range, as opposed to the $64,000 that it was at in April. And bitcoin recently saw a big sell off on May 19, which featured the largest daily candle in bitcoin history, which showed an intraday price range of $11,500. It was also the date in which an all time high of $4.53 billion in losses was hit, and that's the all time high by quite a hefty margin. So for Raphael and Willie, what do you two think is the reason for this drop?
00:02:46.510 - 00:02:47.474, Speaker D: You want to go first?
00:02:47.512 - 00:02:49.940, Speaker B: Yeah. Willie, how about you? Go.
00:02:52.710 - 00:04:04.758, Speaker A: Obviously, a lot of people have seen from the news that elon Musk tweeted out that they were no longer taking payments for their Tesla sales. And they cited reasons that bitcoin was very fossil fuel heavy in its network. And so, in that view, finally, there was someone who was relatively respected in Mark's technology, actually validating a lot of one of these FUD points that the mainstream media have been throwing at Bitcoin, which I don't think is actually valid, but nevertheless, it sent a shockwave affair through the market. The price started plummeting within seconds to minutes of that Tweet. And the market set up at that point was already quite soft. It was making a light recovery, it was tentative, and it was starting to move upwards. And that's also from a fundamental lens when you look at what was happening on the investment activity on the blockchain.
00:04:04.758 - 00:04:58.230, Speaker A: And then when that Tweet came out, it instigated severe amounts of selling, not only on derivative markets and spot markets. We actually saw significant sell off as coins started to flow into exchanges. So real coins got moved, and they were moving from wallets that were quite young. The coins held between one to six months of age. So, Ralph's newcomers to bitcoin is what I can tell. And I think a lot of them saw a lot of really nice rises in Bitcoin from the 20,000 up to the 60 to 60 range. And they probably took the opportunity to take profit.
00:04:58.230 - 00:05:52.090, Speaker A: And so we saw this huge, I just call it tidal waves of coins moving into the exchanges. And ultimately the whole derivatives market started to unwind anyone who was long got liquidated. So that added further selling pressure. And so just we had this cascade of complete unwinding and sell off. And I think it went down to 30 or 29,000 when the final dust had cleared and it bounced up and then it was recovering. And then China announced that they were banning Bitcoin miners and reiterated their stance on no trading for their nationals. And that's a big thing because miners are heavily located in China.
00:05:52.090 - 00:06:12.180, Speaker A: So that sent another wave of fear and price sold down. So we're now in this situation where Bitcoin's heavily discounted below fundamentals and the markets attempting a recovery. It's going sideways, up ish now.
00:06:12.630 - 00:06:14.260, Speaker B: Rafael, what do you think?
00:06:14.630 - 00:07:19.638, Speaker D: Yeah, I second most of what Willie said. I think there is, from my perspective, two major driving forces here. I don't remember when's the last time when I saw the market react so much to news, to actual FUD or to Tweets. I think I saw this much more happening in 2017. So with Elon Musk, with the news from China mine shutting down, china banning mining, and so on and so forth. On the one hand, that and what we saw on chain is that most of those reactions were more new market entrants, very short term holders that sold at losses or actually panic sold eventually. And the second thing I think is that the market was just highly over leveraged.
00:07:19.638 - 00:07:53.860, Speaker D: Right? And I think that what Willie mentioned, this cascade of margin calls and liquidations investors aiming to buy the dip, when in fact the sell off wasn't over yet. And so sort of like cascaded down and we saw that huge drop of over 50% down to 29K. So that combination, I think, is what really made all this price action happen.
00:07:54.710 - 00:08:34.820, Speaker B: I totally get that the market is not rational. And yet, for the Tesla news, it's not like a huge percentage of Bitcoin transactions were being used to buy Teslas, and Tesla kept all the bitcoin on its balance sheet other than what it had sold previously to Tesla liquidity in the market, which I think was just them trying to do fancy accounting tricks. But anyway, so in that sense, the reaction to sell based on the news doesn't make sense. And is it just that that's what it is. These are newbies and what they're doing doesn't make sense? Is that why that tweet had such an effect?
00:08:35.990 - 00:09:36.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's very much that case. Like, we've got some new entrants they've only been holding for less than six months, and then you've enjoyed a lot of price gains, and then something comes along and it validates. So called Mr. The iron man guy that has space rockets and Tesla cars says, no, this is solid. It's going to be a big contributor to the world carbon emissions. So it's just the guy saying it is very well respected. And for sure, it obviously did change the views of people that came in recently saying, oh, maybe this is something that's not going to work in the long run, and they emptied their bags and sold off.
00:09:36.970 - 00:10:26.100, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the simple reach of a personality like Elon Musk is something that we hadn't seen before. Right. And I can very well imagine that it wasn't just the inability of many investors to see the nuances of those messages, such as, hey, we're not accepting these anymore because of x and y reasons, but actually we haven't sold and we don't plan to sell any of those. And other investors that I bet we're betting probably on an irrational market reacting to this and saw the opportunity and started selling there.
00:10:26.470 - 00:11:16.370, Speaker B: Well, so here's one area where I actually disagree with you, Willie, where you said you don't think the environmental issue is such a problem for bitcoin, or not even just bitcoin, but proof of work chains in general. Granted, I used to cover the environment as a reporter, so maybe I'm kind of tuned into that segment of the world a little bit more than the average person, and perhaps in that regard give them more weight than they have. But I feel like their concern is only just growing because obviously the more time we let lapse without doing anything about it, the worse the problem will be and the harder it will be to fix. So in that regard, I actually feel like that could be quite a concern for bitcoin going forward. But you seem to really not think it is merited.
00:11:16.530 - 00:12:23.462, Speaker A: Yeah, look, my training as a mechanical engineer, we studied renewables. And the thing is the cost economics of renewables is still in its rollout stage and it's very marginal. And so what bitcoin does is it makes something that's marginal cost competitive. And so in some regards you might see an old coal powered station that's going to be shut down, but along comes a bitcoin minuses we can mop up that energy and make it hang on for longer. But there's so many places in the world where renewable energies is deploying and a mining setup can make that marginal deployment come about much sooner as the cost of renewables start to drop. And we're on this arc where renewables are becoming cheaper and cheaper. So eventually this whole infrastructure of energy that the planet's on will eventually move to renewables.
00:12:23.462 - 00:12:59.590, Speaker A: Like the age of fossil fuels is coming to an end. And so what I see is that you've got this tool here that's making things that are marginal, mainly renewables and it's going to accelerate that. So that's the argument. And people see these smokestacks and go, oh, that's bad, but they don't see this increase in acceleration of renewables that's facilitated by these new economics. And not to mention that the efficiency of the bitcoin network gets better as it gets bigger per capita.
00:13:00.410 - 00:13:32.990, Speaker B: Yeah. And now that China is cracking down on mining, we could see the switch to renewables for mining bitcoin accelerate. And so that obviously would also be good. And I think what you're referencing too, when you talk about renewable energy generation and combining it with bitcoin mining, are you referring to the Arc square paper that they put out talking about how the economics of that could make renewables stronger?
00:13:34.550 - 00:13:56.070, Speaker A: I haven't actually read their work. I think they talk about it as maybe like in the home or something, but I'm not sure this is just from first principle thinking as an engineer and seeing the like. Yeah, I used to be a renewables geek too, so I did a lot of the calculations.
00:13:57.290 - 00:13:59.270, Speaker B: You, me and Chris Berniski.
00:13:59.610 - 00:14:04.550, Speaker A: Yeah, chris too. Yeah, but I have done the calculations.
00:14:06.270 - 00:14:22.080, Speaker B: Okay. One other thing that I wanted to ask you too about who was selling at the time was Willie, I think it was Tweeted or you wrote about this in your newsletter that you also saw some institutional selling. Can you talk about that a little bit?
00:14:26.370 - 00:15:59.840, Speaker A: We saw, I wouldn't say institutional, I'd say technically they were whale selling holders over 1000 bitcoins. So that's either very large holders that are personal and private or institutional, but their holdings dropped and they were dropping slightly before the crash. And so, yeah, that dropped. And unlike normally what we see is when what we have seen in past months is whenever the institution or whales dropped their holdings the next tier below, which is like 100 to 1000 bitcoins and holdings, they would gain almost a mirror image and they were soaking up those coins. And in this case, the next tier below, what we call the dolphins and sharks, they were pretty steady. And so all of those coins that were being unloaded by the whales just had to be absorbed by the smaller buyers, which they couldn't maintain the price at that point, despite the interesting thing was that as this whole thing started to cave and the price dropped and crypto Twitter, the world was going, oh, Bitcoin is going into a bear market. We don't see 50% drops like this without a beer market.
00:15:59.840 - 00:16:44.750, Speaker A: That was completely different. That view was completely different. On chain. We saw a whole lot of new entrants come in for the very first time to buy their Bitcoins and holders of one bitcoin or less. So 50,000, $30,000 investment, those numbers started skyrocketing and so smaller players came in to buy that dip. And so the actual user count on the network increased as this thing was selling down. And it's just that the buying power by a sea of smaller retail was not sufficient to counteract the sell off coming from Wales.
00:16:45.410 - 00:16:55.506, Speaker B: And Rafael Glassnode recently wrote a blog post also talking about a potential slowing in institutional demand. How are you all determining that?
00:16:55.688 - 00:18:34.580, Speaker D: Yeah, so what we see is one is maybe the institutional products, right, the GVTC, the ETFs that have been trading at a discount for quite a bit now, which they seem to recover slowly. We'll see how that plays out within the next couple of weeks and months. But what we saw is that going into the end of 2020 and early 21, we saw this huge, unprecedented spike of number of whales in the network on chain, right? And that started cooling off in February, even in March. So that kind of shows that distribution of potential institutional or whale buying into smaller hands. And I think ultimately this led to what Willie says. Although we see this huge entrance of new network participants of new users coming into the network, they were simply not able to sustain the price because because of the buying power as compared to this institutional rise or whale rise that we saw towards the end of the year and beginning of this year.
00:18:35.270 - 00:18:52.870, Speaker B: And you guys parse out the chain metrics in so many different ways. And I know both of you have also seen some trends when it comes to the movement to and from exchanges. What are you seeing there and what does it say about where the market is headed?
00:18:53.370 - 00:20:20.414, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so. What we saw, the trend that we started seeing since essentially a bit over a year, since Black Thursday, was this general depletion of supply and exchanges that of course leads to some sort of liquidity squeeze. There's not enough, essentially to be bought up. And so this reduces substantially the selling pressure with the rise to new all time highs and before and now after and during this drop we saw some increased supply on exchanges, right, that is now cooling off again. And so these coin movements really tell you story about investor behavior on chain and the liquidity and potential sell pressure that you see there. It's a bit more nuanced than people usually put it because it really depends on the exchange. And we've seen recently this sort of like this geographical difference between increasing supply on Asian exchanges, decreasing supply on US exchanges.
00:20:20.414 - 00:20:40.426, Speaker D: Right. So there might be some geographical things in play as well. But generally you can see this recent cool off that it seems like investors are essentially done with the sell off.
00:20:40.528 - 00:20:56.030, Speaker B: Well actually in order to kind of paint a broader picture, the three exchanges that you were talking about that are picking up coins are binance, bitfinex and bittrex is bittrex. I thought that was an American exchange.
00:20:56.370 - 00:21:10.180, Speaker D: Or I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but I thought or at least that they were operating there maybe, but I don't want to get ahead of myself.
00:21:11.510 - 00:22:04.610, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure it's American, but it's not a very large by volume exchange. The big 800 pound gorilla is finance. And that's interesting because I'm seeing even in the chart analysis and looking at the way in which the price action is analyzed, the selling comes from binance and the buying comes from coinbase and there's a net shift in coins. And I don't know if it's some intricate arbitrage thing that's happening or whether or not it is actually the Chinese selling their coins. Now that we've seen the banning mining, I don't know what's causing that, but it definitely looks like the west is buying and the east is divesting.
00:22:05.350 - 00:22:33.470, Speaker B: So I don't remember what the exact wording was in the blog post where it talked about that, but I feel like it hinted at people essentially trying to move their coins offshore, maybe to avoid certain regulation or something, capital flight. But will you feel like it's simply that Asians are selling or the Asian market is selling and that the western market is buying?
00:22:34.450 - 00:23:50.946, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just guessing at theories. I have no real information. I'd probably have to figure out what's really happening in the industry by talking to people rather than just looking at the sheer numbers on charts back to this point of the supply on these exchanges. The interesting thing for me is that we've been in an era with such strong institutional and high net worth buying that on chain has become very dominant in the first half of this year because those guys move their coins off the exchanges and put it into cold storage. But now we're in this phase where retail is really ramping up and they're coming in to buy this dip and typically the second half of these one in year bull markets that go crazy vertical. The tail end of it is very dominated by retail, and I think the picture might be a little bit harder to read, mainly because there might be a lot of buying from retail, but they don't withdraw from exchanges as much as an institution would. They're quite happy to leave their coins on their Coinbase wallet.
00:23:50.946 - 00:24:19.680, Speaker A: And so you'll see potentially the supply on these exchanges increase and increase because they're in long term holdings by retail and it looks like coins are being sold in, but in actual fact, they're in long term hold by retail who are just using the exchange wallet. So I think the second part of this year will be quite interesting and I think we need to know that effect is happening.
00:24:20.850 - 00:25:24.414, Speaker D: And maybe to add to this, I think one of the major depletions that we've seen is actually Coinbase, right? Which we all know they have custody service also for institutionals. And actually, we're currently doing some research on identifying some of these larger clusters on chain that seem to be very closely related to the Coinbase wallets that we see. Whether it's Coinbase custody or something else, hard to say, but at least it's something that interacts very closely with them. And so, as Willie says, much of that could be related to institutional buying versus retail. On the other hand, potentially more on binance and so on, that just come in and leave their coins on exchanges in order to keep trading.
00:25:24.542 - 00:25:59.470, Speaker B: So I do want to ask another question about institutional, but before we get to that, just to continue on this binance thread, one of the glass node posts talked about how it could also be that people are moving. Coins to exchanges not simply to sell, but also because they either want to rotate into ETH or they want to trade on chains like Binance. Smart chain. So do you think that that's also influenced the sell off in the Bitcoin price? And would that also account for this movement we're seeing of coins going on to Binance?
00:26:00.690 - 00:27:02.820, Speaker D: I think so. I mean, I don't know what the extent really, of how much influence it really has, but we've seen those rotations, right, and we often see this. I mean, this is something typical for bull markets as well, where people start moving into different altcoins, into other assets, most recently then potentially also into Binance smart chain, which didn't exist in 2017. And so I think that those are things that come into play as well and something that we're observing closely in terms of how does this look like now that we've seen this immense dip? Is it coming back into bitcoin right, in order to rebalance potential portfolios again and see what kind of effect that this has on the bitcoin price itself as well.
00:27:03.430 - 00:27:22.220, Speaker B: And so to just wrap up this institutional conversation, I did also want to ask about GBTC, because the story around that has shifted quite a bit in the last several months from what it really had been for years. Can you tell us what changes we've seen there and what that says about this current market?
00:27:23.070 - 00:28:04.722, Speaker D: Sure. I think I saw this, too, and I was actually a bit surprised, to be honest, to see this huge flip in the last couple of months, because that narrative was a big one. Right. And this was essentially the front page of, hey, institutions are here. The holdings of GBTC were going up for months. People were comparing it that there were scooping up more coins than actually coins were being mined. This was naturally seen as something very bullish.
00:28:04.722 - 00:28:54.262, Speaker D: And then that changed and that change happened, actually coincided with the introduction of the Canadian purpose ETF. Right. And so people were speculating whether investors might be reallocating and going into the ETF rather than GBTC, just because of the structure of how these funds are, the trust is being set. So the GBTC premium dropped and flipped, actually into a discount. And for me, this was actually going to be something that people must be arbitraging this. Right. So it's just going to be a very short period of time, and it will flip positive again very quickly.
00:28:54.262 - 00:29:30.626, Speaker D: But this has now sustained for, what, two months or so? I don't even know for very long. I think much of that has to do with the structure of the trust itself, but I'm not too deep into that. So I cannot say whether this is true and whether because it seems like it's a one way road. Right. You can sort of put things into there, but it takes a lot of time to recover them. It seems like that discount has cooled up a bit. I mean, it's still negative, right.
00:29:30.626 - 00:29:45.880, Speaker D: But it's going sideways. I'm super curious to see how that plays out specifically, because the ETF itself is also trading at a discount currently. But maybe Willie has more insights on that as well.
00:29:46.970 - 00:29:59.782, Speaker A: Yeah, I found it interesting that the arbitrage was not closed. We didn't see buyers buying bitcoin at, what was it? Over 10% discount at one point. You don't want to buy exposure.
00:29:59.846 - 00:30:01.100, Speaker D: 20 at one point.
00:30:01.550 - 00:30:53.806, Speaker A: Okay, 20% discount. You can either buy bitcoins on coinbase or you can buy the ETF at 20% discount. I found it phenomenal that, sure, if no one could arbitrage it because of the structure of that fund, surely investors would seize that opportunity and bring it back up and maybe reduce their buying on standard exchanges. But it never did. And I don't know, it was always a mystery to me. But I have seen in this start to the dive, flip or change directory, and now the premium is starting to become less negative. So that's a positive sign that's saying people are starting to buy this ETF, so there's more demand coming from that side.
00:30:53.806 - 00:31:45.386, Speaker A: But I think overall, that was a warning sign in hindsight. Kind of this hidden warning sign that there was market selling in the ETF the ETF holds, I think. Is it like 3% of all bitcoin supply? Something like that? Not sure. So that was being sold down and then it wasn't reflected into the main market because the way that ETF is structured is that it's kind of like Hotel California. Those bitcoins go in and they cannot. So, like, the coins weren't being emptied out of that trust to be sold onto the market to track bitcoin. It just meant the premium dropped.
00:31:45.386 - 00:31:52.640, Speaker A: It was heavily discounted. So, yeah, it's an interesting one, that one.
00:31:54.690 - 00:32:07.858, Speaker D: Willie, you seem to have very nice analogies to the music industry. Rick Astley. This is great.
00:32:08.024 - 00:32:10.520, Speaker A: They're always on point, the classics, right?
00:32:11.690 - 00:32:26.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I have to agree. I was just going to comment on the same thing. All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk about other areas of the market and what they say about the bitcoin price and where it's going.

00:34:17.970 - 00:34:34.770, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Willie Wu and Raphael Schultzcraft. So we touched on this briefly, but we could probably talk about a little bit more. What have you seen in derivatives trading and how has that played a role in the bitcoin price as of late?
00:34:37.690 - 00:35:44.170, Speaker A: Derivatives is like it really was an invention by BitMEX in 2017 and that got to phenomenal volumes by 2018. And so when I look at the bitcoin price, I go, oh, look at those sheer walls. Of fear as derivatives get unwound. And I look at the chart going back to Taylor 2018, I see 350 percent drops of sheer walls of terror and everyone screaming with blood on the streets. And that is the impact of derivatives as people get completely liquidated on these derivative markets with their 100 x leverage. I think Finance published that they do the largest volume and they published 60% do 20 x or more leverage on these things. So the price volatility of bitcoin has made market jumps upwards since drifter markets have been out in force.
00:35:44.170 - 00:37:08.174, Speaker A: And yeah, I think that a lot of people are trading these things and I don't know, it's a little bit like crack cocaine when you're on 100 x leverage and it's fun if you can make something. And then we've got now a generation of bitcoin traders that are experiencing this. On the one hand, they're learning how markets work, how you can push price around, you can buy things, you can liquidate other people. It's like this full on game. And then the other side you get this crazy kind of whipsaw in the bitcoin price which deters long term investors because the volatility does some pretty crazy things and no different from what we just saw now with this almost 50% drop. And in COVID also, and to put this in perspective, I think the last metric I had, I didn't read how many people got liquidated in this last crash, but one of the unwinds from the low sixty s, that was a derivatives unwind. And it happened when I think the miners tripped over the power cord in China and the hash rate dropped on the network.
00:37:08.174 - 00:37:43.034, Speaker A: People sold off derivatives, went into a cascade of liquidations and it was 1 million traders that got liquidated. So there's only about 150,000,000 holders of bitcoin in the world and 1 million of them are trading derivatives. And whoa, that's like a generation that is learning how to trade markets. I think this is a new thing, this is a new phenomena. When we look back on the history books, this is like a generation learning.
00:37:43.092 - 00:37:50.980, Speaker B: How to all right, let's raphael, do you want to add anything we can talk about stablecoins. There's quite a lot to cover when it comes to.
00:37:54.310 - 00:37:55.410, Speaker D: Stablecoins.
00:37:56.230 - 00:38:11.500, Speaker B: I did see that one of the glass node posts also talked about how in the months leading up to the coinbase direct listing, demand for stablecoins was so high that Tether, USDC and Dai all traded above the peg for a month. So why is that? Can you explain?
00:38:11.950 - 00:38:52.678, Speaker D: Yeah, I think people might have just been looking for liquidity to exit right in the end. I feel like as we see this, the price of a stable coin, even if it's packed to the dollar, is susceptible to just market forces. And if there's huge demand for those, potentially for people because they're wanting to exit right, and to move into those coins. We saw that the peg for USDT, USDC and Dai just was for over a month just slightly above the dollar peg. Right.
00:38:52.764 - 00:39:13.260, Speaker B: Wait, but can you break this down for me? Because I don't know if I fully understand because obviously the Coinbase direct know in the traditional stock market that's like a totally separate financial system, and then you're saying people might want to exit their I just I don't feel like I really understand the.
00:39:15.630 - 00:40:04.458, Speaker D: Mean that's that's one of the interpretation of what we saw, right. Because it was rather constant over a period of a month just before the dip. Right. This is looking at those packs and how they deviate from the actual underlying value is something that essentially by chance, we saw. And we're currently looking a bit more into doing some more systematic analysis on how that really changes over time and if that actually means anything at all or what it does, because we just saw it across multiple stablecoins over that period.
00:40:04.554 - 00:40:18.370, Speaker B: But what would the trade be? It's that they maybe themselves don't own Coinbase stock? Or is it for the people that do? Like, I didn't get who it was. Was it the people who have Coinbase stock or the people who don't?
00:40:19.750 - 00:40:49.034, Speaker D: I think that's speculative. I couldn't say. Right. It's something that is I wouldn't go as far as to bring in that interpretation. I'm leaning more towards, you know, the sole sort of like, you know, data driven, you know, observation of what the pack and what the price say. I wouldn't want to go ahead of myself. There too much.
00:40:49.034 - 00:41:28.890, Speaker D: Right. So that's one part of what we've seen with respect to stablecoins. The other thing is that the supply has increased quite a bit. Right. And we've seen this actually accelerating during the drop as well. Right. So what this means is essentially that we believe that there's a lot of gunpowder out there that can be used essentially in these markets to buy up bitcoin and essentially increase the price.
00:41:28.890 - 00:42:18.680, Speaker D: So one of the metrics that we look at is the stablecoin supply ratio that essentially compares the supply of the stablecoins to bitcoin. And actually, Willie had a very nice modification of that, adjusting for the downtrend over the last couple of months. And that actually shows that we're historically at the low end of it, which could indicate that there is essentially comparing it historically as looking at this oscillator a lot of dry powder to start moving into bitcoin again.
00:42:19.470 - 00:42:29.930, Speaker B: So people are essentially buying a lot of stablecoins, kind of waiting for kind of a type of bottom in the market to deploy. Is that what that indicates? Okay.
00:42:30.080 - 00:43:11.370, Speaker A: Yeah. Because if you're selling out of your bitcoin and ethereum and whatever cryptos you have, you're going to sell to US dollars. And you've got a choice, right? You can either sell to US dollars and withdraw it to your bank, or the other choice is to sell it to a stable coin and keep it in digital form. That is the advantage of you can just move it straight back into crypto very quickly and effectively. So what we've seen is a lot of the value go out of crypto and into stablecoins sitting there on the sidelines, just ready to flow back in once the picture of price action starts to move. Bullish. So it's a good picture.
00:43:11.370 - 00:43:54.310, Speaker A: If it was bearish, I would say people would want to exit their stable coins and move it to stocks or something, or gold or something traditional where you wire the money out. And we're in these historic kind of all time highs of stablecoins when once you take out the skew in the picture. So I think it's very positive for the longer term price that we're kind of in regions where we've overextended in overselling. That's my interpretation of the data. And we've got a lot of upside, and the downside is quite limited at this stage.
00:43:55.610 - 00:44:08.620, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, let's talk about some of the metrics that show that. Willie, obviously you're well known for the NVT ratio. Why don't you remind the listeners how you define that and tell us what it's currently.
00:44:10.510 - 00:44:51.702, Speaker A: So, you know, most people are familiar with price earnings ratio and stocks, and bitcoin doesn't really have it's not a company, it doesn't have earnings. What it does have is it's a pure store of value network. So what it does have is volumes of bitcoin moving between investors. So you can measure the value moving between investors as how active that network is as an investment network. And you can run a ratio to its network value, the market cap, and that's essentially MVT ratio. It's the price earnings for bitcoin. It's a fundamental equation.
00:44:51.702 - 00:45:48.950, Speaker A: You can put it down in first principles, and you can show that price earnings of bitcoin, which is MVT multiplied by the volume, that oscillates. That gives you an evaluation for bitcoin. Just like you might say, this company has a forex multiplier from its price earnings, this category of company. And so you can go, okay, let's see what earnings it does. And okay, the valuation is four times. So that is essentially what you can do with NVT and NVT is that pure ratio, like a price earnings, you can multiply it by the volume and the long standing volume, like the median, and you can map it back to the price domain. So it gives you us a very nice kind of trace of where the value should be based on the investment volume going through the network between individual investors.
00:45:48.950 - 00:46:37.100, Speaker A: And currently that sits at $55,000, even though we were not long ago in the low 30s. It's in a historic band of undervaluation. And I notice plan b's pretty well known stock to flow ratio, another fundamental based on the scarcity dynamics of the network that's currently at $65,000. So those two are pretty much in the higher agreement of between 55 and $65,000. And also if you look at how far the price has currently deviated from that metric, it's also in a band where it's all time undervaluation when you look back on the history.
00:46:38.430 - 00:47:11.720, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, something that confuses me a little is if we're at this moment where bitcoin is quite well undervalued historically, and yet at the same time we're at this moment where there's this huge amount sitting in stablecoins, then why aren't we starting to see kind of the beginnings of a more bullish market? Or maybe we are. I'm just not aware that that's what you're thinking.
00:47:13.210 - 00:48:39.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually think that we're in a post capitulation reaccumulation of coins, so, so many whales dumped out and it'll take a bit of time for those coins to be reaccumulated. And I think once the price action starts to tip properly, bullish, so maybe a little bit of sideways and the price action starts to look good, I think a lot of those stable coins will come back in. And all these metrics are telling me is like, we are very overextended in the sell down and historically, when we are below these fundamentals, the recovery is quite quick. The only times where the recovery is slow tends to be when the price was way above fundamentals and it's taken a long time for the price to come back down and recover. So I think a lot of this is telling me the time to recovery is going to be faster than maybe what we saw in 2019 took months after that 6000 to 3000 drop. And I think it'll be a lot like the COVID White swan crash in 2020. We dropped below fundamentals there and we recovered in a matter of about eight weeks, I think.
00:48:40.550 - 00:49:07.020, Speaker B: Yeah, this actually reminds me of something I wanted to touch on at the very beginning, because one thing that surprised me was that neither of you mentioned that the May 19 sell off was kind of like right around the time that taxes were due here in the US. And I did wonder, because I did see other people saying that could be a contributing factor. Do you guys both think that that could have been as well?
00:49:07.870 - 00:50:06.320, Speaker D: I actually don't know too much about tax behavior in the US. I'm not a resident there. I mean, if it is, and people often point to that when spring is here, that it does have an effect. And always when we see those dips around that period on a yearly basis, essentially it's being pointed out as one potential factor for the corrections, for the dips and for those price drops. From my perspective, though, this year, the Black Thursday last year and so on, they definitely go beyond that. Right. And I think there's these more obvious factors that led to those more extreme corrections than they usually happen.
00:50:06.320 - 00:50:28.290, Speaker D: But overall, it seems like there is some effect due to tax season in the US. On the price. From my perspective, I wouldn't overestimate it too much, but it probably plays some role.
00:50:28.870 - 00:50:32.534, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm just realizing I asked two non Americans this question.
00:50:32.732 - 00:50:40.342, Speaker A: Yeah, but that is that thing walk away in May, I think. Now I know it's maybe because of tax reason.
00:50:40.396 - 00:50:44.922, Speaker B: No, but it's normally in April, it was only pushed because of the pandemic one month.
00:50:44.976 - 00:50:45.610, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
00:50:45.680 - 00:50:53.406, Speaker B: Yeah. Because it's normally April 15, and this year it was May 17. I can't remember why. I'm looking at something to do with.
00:50:53.428 - 00:51:35.338, Speaker A: COVID and it doesn't seem to backtrace. That great. A lot of times in April, it's climbing quite rapidly in the bitcoin price history. So I'm not sure even like now, I think we're in the era where a lot of people are choosing to not sell their bitcoins to pay down taxes because that incurs even more taxes. They might just collateralize it and get a BlockFi loan. So more leverage in the system. But I noticed that people are doing that rather than to incur a tax event on capital gains with their yeah, yeah.
00:51:35.504 - 00:52:03.300, Speaker B: And I was going to say it could be a bunch of the DeFi yield farmers, but since there isn't a huge overlap with the bitcoin community, it may not be the case. All right. One other of your favorite metrics, Willie, is SoPR I actually don't know what that exactly stands for. I know how you define it, but can you give us the definition and explain what it is that says about the market now?
00:52:03.830 - 00:52:17.302, Speaker A: Sure. This is Renato's Metric. Who called it spent output? Price ratio. Profit ratio. Sorry. Profit ratio. Yeah.
00:52:17.302 - 00:52:53.554, Speaker A: So essentially, let's say we'll pick a day and I'll get someone to count every coin that passes between, let's say investors. Actually, we just look at between wallets. But let's say the ideal case is investors. Glassnode actually does it for investors. And you go, all right, those coins moved because the blockchain tells you when those coins arrived in that wallet, you know the price that the seller sold those coins for. And now you know today this is the price they sold it for. So you can get a profit on that.
00:52:53.554 - 00:53:47.880, Speaker A: That guy sold for maybe $50,000 of profit with all those coins, and that person sold at a loss because they bought at a higher pricing. And so you kind of do a ratio of the profit that is transacted during that day. And you can say, you get this readout, you get this chart, and typically what you see is this chart. In a bull market, the price runs up higher and higher and higher. So anyone who's transacting coins is obviously moving coins that are now at vast profit. And so once the price starts to tip, the people are now selling their coins, and some of them are selling at a loss because it's it's now possible to sell at a loss because it's coming down in price they bought earlier when it was higher. And generally what you see is.
00:53:50.650 - 00:53:51.062, Speaker D: As.
00:53:51.116 - 00:54:36.310, Speaker A: It goes down, more and more people sell because they're taking the profit that they've got on the table while it's still in the hand. So this is this profit taking coming as SOPA goes down and down and down and down until it hits the 1.0 line, which is like on average, the coins that are moving between investors in the market are no longer carrying any profit. And so typically in a bull market, no one wants to sell at a loss, so the selling stops and the price bounces up. So sopra is this really nice kind of chart that tells us when does the profit taking end? When it hits the 1.0, there's a high chance the market will no longer sell at a loss if we're in a bull market. And so, yeah, sopra in a nutshell.
00:54:37.370 - 00:55:33.698, Speaker B: All right, so we're running out of time, so I want to touch on a few things before we wrap up. But one is obviously a huge trend in bitcoin. The last like, nine months, ten months has been corporate Treasuries buying up bitcoin. And after this winter's Bitcoin for Corporations event that MicroStrategy held, I kind of expected we would start to see, after some time period, another steady drum beat of corporate news about bitcoin being added to Treasuries. But it's actually kind of died down a bit. And I wondered if you're seeing any evidence on Chain or even just hearing from the industry where that's going. Is that a trend that has kind of died out or is it just something that takes well, because we're talking about corporate treasuries here, or where do you think that is headed?
00:55:33.874 - 00:56:46.202, Speaker D: So from my perspective, it's something that will continue, right? And that continues. The thing is that what you hear is obviously publicly traded companies and only those that started those processes very early on to get those bitcoin on their balance sheets. We have to remember that those are processes that take quite some time, right? It's not like, hey, let's buy and then that's it. Now that the infrastructure is essentially there that wasn't simply there a couple of years ago and for sure not during the last bull run. This is now possible for those. Right? And I think what we heard so far are those that really started setting up their bitcoin strategies very early on. And from what we saw on Chain, this might have cooled off a bit, at least when you look at large whale entities on chain.
00:56:46.202 - 00:57:51.842, Speaker D: I mean, of course they're not always mapped one to one. Many of those are not holding their coins in self custody, but use services for that. But I think that we'll hear much, much more of those in the upcoming months. And I think so because I believe that you're probably risking a lot if you don't have a proper bitcoin strategy nowadays. And also because what we hear out there are the publicly trade companies, but us as Glassnode, you wouldn't believe what conversations we're having at times, right? There is hedge funds, there is family offices, there is big high net worth individuals. There's really a lot of big private folks that are looking into this. And if those are, you can imagine how many others are.
00:57:51.842 - 00:58:06.950, Speaker D: So I think there's a lot of things going on behind closed doors. And from my perspective, it's just a matter of time until these start popping up more and more and announcing their holdings.
00:58:07.290 - 00:58:09.260, Speaker B: Willie, do you want to add anything?
00:58:10.350 - 00:59:41.398, Speaker A: Yeah, I also think that, again, I agree it's a timing like I believe Michael Saylor said that it took MicroStrategy six months to get prepared to actually deploy into Bitcoin, and they were very fast, but most companies would take nine months or even longer. And so I kind of started the clock ticking from when that conference kicked off and said, well, let's go six to nine months, probably nine months. And I was like, that's going to be very interesting if those guys really do deploy, and it is going to be in that time frame, we're looking at a fourth quarter of this year of buying from large in large ticket sizes, which is typically what we kind of expect. That's the time where the bull market starts to wane, the momentum starts to die out around there. But if those guys come in, I'm thinking that's going to make a very interesting fourth quarter because most of the models predict or are just guessing that like past cycles, we might top out near the fourth quarter. So it's an interesting timing. If this money starts coming in all around, then yeah, we'll have to see.
00:59:41.564 - 01:00:35.254, Speaker B: So one other kind of wild card is that I did notice in some of the recent analyses, glassnode has referenced holders rotating into ETH. As I mentioned before, and I'm sure you're well aware, ethereum is going to be instituting probably the biggest change to its monetary policy ever. And it's one that many people believe will make ETH deflationary, which from this is my personal perspective, but I feel like then this is the first time where Bitcoin and Ether kind of will compete in that regard. Because even though there has been a narrative that they're competitive or whatever, to my mind they're kind of just different things. And if you really understand what you're doing with your money, then when you put your money in one versus the other, it's for different reasons. That's my perspective. I'm sure many people don't actually really do the research to understand on that level.
01:00:35.254 - 01:00:48.460, Speaker B: But anyway, still, given this change to ETH's monetary policy, how do you expect that that will impact the price of Bitcoin going forward now that they will compete in this kind of deflationary sense?
01:00:48.910 - 01:01:58.606, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in terms of a store of value, asset I think Ethereum has been competing for a long time now, even as early as 2017 as they're young back then, but now we've had maybe getting on six years of price action history. We've had a lot of the kind of properties you want to see in a store of value asset develop inside the Ethereum network, even though it's like a smart contracts network and we have DeFi running on it. I think a lot of the value that has accrued to Ethereum is really people wanting to hold it, locking that up. And I think, yeah, it certainly does impact the valuation metrics if you're going to reduce the inflation significantly. Yeah, I think that's what I'll say is that it is developing those lindy effects and I have seen that it is becoming a choice for corporate treasuries. It's starting to yeah. Where previously the conversation was just Bitcoin.
01:01:58.718 - 01:02:01.220, Speaker B: And is that because of this change?
01:02:06.230 - 01:02:28.090, Speaker A: I would not know. For me, looking at this as an analyst, I go, well, actually, if you look at the sharp ratio, the risk adjusted return on this network, it's very similar to Bitcoin and I think that the traditional world is very comfortable with diversifying and having baskets rather than all in one asset.
01:02:28.590 - 01:02:30.070, Speaker B: Raphael, do you have an opinion?
01:02:30.150 - 01:03:29.680, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I'm more on the side know, those are not competing networks. I'm not quite sure if this will really grab so much of Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is still regarding its history, regarding its simplicity, or regarding this very static monetary policy that has been established now for twelve years. It's still something that from my perspective and where I believe serious money at this stage is probably more inclined to deploy because Ethereum has just made other choices. Right. And this change is experimental. Right.
01:03:29.680 - 01:04:38.082, Speaker D: We'll have to see how much and what it actually does to it. It goes into that direction. Right. It points towards doing something similar and making the asset deflationary, but I still view it as something on the site and not competing, grabbing capital off of Bitcoin at this stage at least. And we have to observe how this actually plays out and what it does with the ecosystem. I think a lot of the interest, though, comes from the fact that there's just so much development happening in this ecosystem, right. So many things being built on top of it and so much more things that you can actually do now holding Ethereum in those decentralized protocols than, you know, in Bitcoin.
01:04:38.082 - 01:04:42.534, Speaker D: And that makes it very interesting for many, I believe.
01:04:42.652 - 01:05:19.940, Speaker B: Yeah. When Mark Cuban came on my show, he felt like because of the number of things that one can do with Ethereum that that might be the coin that more people end up holding, which is kind of interesting. And that for me was a fresh idea. All right, so for you, what are you looking for to determine whether when we'll flip back to a bull market, or do you think we already are? And going forward, why don't we say August and then end of year? What would be your price predictions for those two moments in time?
01:05:22.790 - 01:06:48.458, Speaker D: Well, I'm actually very careful with price predictions, as everyone is probably so my answers to this are usually a bit more fuzzy. I think we haven't exited a bull market at this stage from an on chain perspective, from a structural perspective, there's little that points to that. So as of now, I still believe that this is a correction, a big one within the bull market, but we're still on track. Seems to be looking a bit like the 2013 double top, if you will. If you take the 65K as the first top and now this correction bit longer. I don't know if I'm as optimistic as Willie is with how fast we'll go back up at this stage. I feel that the downside risk right now is very small, but I still wouldn't be very surprised if we get another burst of pain and another kind of shakeout before we start properly regaining the trends.
01:06:48.458 - 01:07:09.366, Speaker D: The bull market trend essentially over the next couple weeks and months. But, yeah, structurally, I think we're on track and as long as the data doesn't tell me anything else, I remain bullish and we'll see where we end up towards the end of the year. Willie, what about you?
01:07:09.548 - 01:07:43.822, Speaker A: Yeah, very similar. The structure is not bearish. If this is a bear market, it's the weirdest done bear market I've ever seen. And if it keeps dropping from here, it's like, what's wrong with this network? Is it broken? We're very oversold. There's people joining. We haven't even dropped from a high mania phase, which is very consistent with four bear markets. They end with a bull market pop and then we have to revisit fundamentals.
01:07:43.822 - 01:08:35.150, Speaker A: Yeah, we were already at fundamentals when this thing sold off, so I think that we'll rebound relatively well soon ish. I don't think it's going to be multi, multi months longer than two months, but anything can happen in these markets. Yeah, I think that will climb back up. I'm pretty confident that there's nothing in the data that shows me this is serious. The most bearish thing I can find on the network is that capital was moved out of the network in terms of realized cap, which is good metric on how much is stored there. And so that's dipped quite a bit, and I haven't seen that before in the middle of a bull market. So there were some significant sell offs.
01:08:36.050 - 01:08:39.220, Speaker B: Can you just remind listeners what realized cap means?
01:08:40.230 - 01:09:30.834, Speaker A: It's a sum of all the coins sitting in wallets at the price that investors paid for those coins. So that's dropped. That means that people sold higher up and now realized cap is no longer capturing a higher value of those extra high coins. And this is one of the things that typically rises very easily and very seldom does it drop. And it has dropped at a level which is consistent of a start of a beer market. But once again, it does not agree with some much more telling metrics like the number of new entities that we're seeing on the network and the number of users coming on board. Some of the companies that I have the data on, customers are coming in, new users coming in.
01:09:30.834 - 01:09:38.950, Speaker A: That's a bull market. It's just a matter of when those coins will be reabsorbed and bought and held.
01:09:40.570 - 01:09:45.240, Speaker B: So if you were going to give your August and end of year price predictions, what would those be?
01:09:45.770 - 01:10:31.782, Speaker A: August is tough, but I'm looking at I have a model which is just a moving average of the market cap. And you tweak it a little, it captures all the tops in history. It probably won't catch this one because everyone's looking at it now, but that was prior to this crash that was starting to look like it was winding up to three, four, even $500,000 near the end of this year. Now it's starting to reduce its trajectory. Looks like it'll comfortably reach 200. It might reach 300, but we have to see how that develops. So once again, it's like I'm just naming this model.
01:10:31.782 - 01:10:40.300, Speaker A: I'm just reading what it's pointing at, but it keeps changing. So I'm safe there. Right?
01:10:41.870 - 01:10:53.386, Speaker B: Okay. All right. Well, we'll have to see what happens at that time and circle back. So thank you both so much for coming on Unchained. Where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
