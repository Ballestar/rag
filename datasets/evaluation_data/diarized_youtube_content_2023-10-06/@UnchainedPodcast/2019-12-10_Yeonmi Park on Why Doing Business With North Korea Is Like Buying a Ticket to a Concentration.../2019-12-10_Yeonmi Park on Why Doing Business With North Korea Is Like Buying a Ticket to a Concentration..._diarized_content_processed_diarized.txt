00:00:01.050 - 00:00:44.422, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, two quick announcements before we start the show. First, Unchained now has a merchandise shop. We've got a few t shirts, a couple hats and a mug. My team and I got creative with one of the t shirt designs and came up with an image of a crypto rabbit falling down a hole. Swirling into the hole with the rabbit are playing cards showing some of the coins like Bitcoin, ethereum and monero, as well as a dow card ripped in half. There's a guy Fox mask, a DeFi cake, a lambo and a teapot that says Hodl, as well as teacups showing the reddit and Twitter logos. There's even a shitcoin the rabbit is wearing a big bitcoin key on a keychain, a unicorn and rainbow t shirt, and of course, is listening to Unchained.
00:00:44.422 - 00:01:18.078, Speaker A: Check it out at shop unchainedpodcast.com. Again. That's shop unchainedpodcast.com. For those of you interested in giving an Unchained t shirt, hat or mug as a Christmas gift order by December 13, which is this Friday. Second, I wanted to say a few words about this episode. I think it's one of the best interviews ever on this show. Yes, the news hook has to do with the arrest of Virgil Griffith, but if you listen to the show, it's really about the two main tenets of the crypto ethos decentralization and censorship resistance.
00:01:18.078 - 00:02:38.378, Speaker A: As you can probably tell from my tweets and even the thoughts I expressed last week on Unconfirmed, I've been thinking a lot over why the reaction to Virgil's arrest just boggled my mind. And I realized what he was doing is pretty much against what most, if not all, of my sources have told me drives them to work in this space. North Korea is the most centralized and most censorious place organization, entity, population, government, group, country, whatever you want to call it on the planet. As Alex Gladstein put it on an episode of the Scoop he recently recorded with Frank Chaparro, quote this is the least cypherpunk thing you could possibly imagine to aid and abet the world's most vicious tyranny. Seeing people defend what Virgil was doing made me question whether I'd understood or even heard my sources correctly all these years. Like, all along, had they actually been saying censorship assistance people who are for decentralization and censorship resistance and who understand the situation in North Korea would be fighting against the regime, not trying to help it. The interview for this episode starts with Yunmi's story, which takes a while to get through, since, as she puts it, north Korea is so different from a world, it's like living on another planet.
00:02:38.378 - 00:03:23.414, Speaker A: Toward the end, we talk in broad strokes about who could have benefited from what Virgil did, the general impact of doing any business, even tourism with North Korea, and the controversial issue of sanctions. I hope this show gets you guys thinking about why you're interested in this technology and industry and the larger impact it can have on the world and why you all hold the values of decentralization and censorship resistance.

Today's guest is Yunmi Park, north Korean defector, human rights activist, board member of the Human Rights Foundation and author of In Order to Live a North Korean Girl's Journey to Freedom. Welcome.
00:05:02.842 - 00:05:03.746, Speaker A: Yeonmi.
00:05:03.878 - 00:05:06.094, Speaker C: Hi, Laura. Thank you for having me.
00:05:06.292 - 00:06:10.114, Speaker A: You're not an obvious guest for my show because you're not involved in the crypto space. However, as I'm sure you're aware from Alex Gladstein, the chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, who has been a previous guest on both my podcasts cryptocurrency and North Korea are two topics that are intersecting much more often. First, Kim Jong UN's regime has been trying to get its hands on cryptocurrency. And then recently I don't know if you're aware of this news, but on Thanksgiving, someone involved in a cryptocurrency called Ethereum was arrested here in the US. For giving a talk at a blockchain conference in Pyongyang and then later allegedly trying to help the regime send cryptocurrency to evade sanctions. So I thought, just from the crypto community, it became aware to me many people were not aware of what life in North Korea was really like. So I thought it would be helpful to have you here to talk about your experience, to talk about what it means when people do business with North Korea and about the information flow there.
00:06:10.114 - 00:06:16.130, Speaker A: So why don't we just start with a really basic question? Why don't you tell us what it was like to grow up in North Korea?
00:06:16.870 - 00:07:22.170, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think thank you for having me, and I'm really grateful for this opportunity to talk about it, because a lot of people in the west do have very strong interest in North Korea, and they somehow want to participate in some ways, but not all the times. Their involvement is necessarily helpful to improve North Korean human rights situation, and it ends up just like helping the dictatorship. Yes, I did hear about the news around Thanksgiving, and I was not really surprised because there are so many people that I met were just so naively. Somehow their involvement is going to open up the countries at some point. So when I was born in North Korea, I was born in the almost mid 1990s. So that was after Southern collapse, and North Korea was going downhill because they were not getting all this help from all other communist countries.
00:07:22.170 - 00:08:25.870, Speaker C: And so when I was born, there was no public distribution system was running, and just the country was in such a deep concession and also just starvation was everywhere. And also there was a big information blockage. Even to this day, there is no Internet in North Korea. Of course, the elite in Pyeongyang, few have access to it, but the most commoners, like myself, they don't even know the existence of Internet. And with that blockage of information and the lack of food, putting us all in a spot to just survive, that's what I was doing in North Korea. I don't remember ever living there. It was just every day was a survivor to try to find food or trying to survive from the oppression from the regime.
00:08:26.370 - 00:08:31.200, Speaker A: And you did go to school for a period. What was school like there?
00:08:32.050 - 00:09:42.966, Speaker C: Yeah, so I was born into, initially a middle class, and I wasn't able to go to school. Everything that I learned was from school was nothing like we learned here. It's not like you're learning about any science or history, but rather everything was propaganda by the government saying how our enemy, like American bastards, were trying to kid us, and how our Dear Leader so bravely defeated our enemies. And also why we need our Dear Leader to protect us from our enemies, because Americans are trying to attack us and kid us, and without our Dear Leader, we would be dead. So they told us, and they taught us why we should all be grateful. So for every, every room in North Korea needs to have portraits of our dear leaders. And if the house caught fire, the first thing the fathers would protect is not even their children.
00:09:42.966 - 00:10:04.810, Speaker C: The first thing they have to protect is the portraits of their leaders. And if the portraits get burned or get damaged, then not only the person who was responsible, but the three generations of that family member is going to go to concentration camp and get punished.
00:10:06.530 - 00:10:08.702, Speaker A: Even in school, even if the fire.
00:10:08.756 - 00:10:54.640, Speaker C: Was an accident, no, even the earthquake happens. There was a case where a man who did not know. So in North Korea, every front page of newspaper have to have a portrait of Dear Leader and tell us what he did. But on the backside is normal know the writing. So he didn't see the other side and he ripped it and then he smoked it with his cigarettes. And then that was the reason he was sent to political prison camp. So the degree of the terror and the oppression and zero tolerance is what keeps North Korea keep going right now for like 70 years.
00:10:55.490 - 00:11:00.990, Speaker A: You also said in your Ted Talk that you were taught that the Dear Leader could read your thoughts.
00:11:01.410 - 00:11:02.160, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:04.070 - 00:11:08.580, Speaker A: How did they make you think that? And how did that affect your own thinking.
00:11:10.470 - 00:11:44.910, Speaker C: In school? So if you try to understand, North Korea as a country is a hard topic to understand. But if you think of it as a religion so North Korea, apparently it is one of the ten religions in the world. And we often don't know that. We think it's just some crazy country, but it is a court. So North Korea regime copied the mean. There are people believing like God. So it's not completely absurd that North Korean people believe in Kim.
00:11:44.910 - 00:12:17.880, Speaker C: So basically, they told us that our Dear Leader, the first Kim, loved us so much and he was chosen by this universe who could do miracles, gave us his son, Kim Jong Ye. So even Kim Jong ye died that his body died. But his spirit is with us forever. So therefore, his spirit knows what I'm thinking. Even when I'm asleep. And I'm awake. And he can show up in the east and the west the same time he can do anything in this world.
00:12:17.880 - 00:13:00.360, Speaker C: And then there's no information coming in. And if that's all you can believe and that's all you taught to believe from your birth, of course that's what you're going to believe. So even after I escaped to China, when people saying Kim is a dictator and that's why you're starving, and I was like, what are your bastards talking about? My Dear Leader, that know, I was so afraid that I was even going to commit a thought crime. So thinking even in North Korea is a know, it's not a degree of we are asking for freedom of speech. Even freedom of thinking is not allowed in North Korea. That's how oppressed the country is.
00:13:01.530 - 00:13:15.500, Speaker A: You also wrote about how when you would leave for school, your mother always told you to watch your mouth. And she also told you things like that even if you whisper, the birds and mice would hear you. What message was she trying to give.
00:13:19.230 - 00:14:03.222, Speaker C: So in North Korea, everyone exists to become a revolutionary, to die and serve for the regime. We are not individuals be born and fulfill our dreams or our aspirations. And even elementary school students, it's like there's no concept of human rights or minor. So you have to go to see public execution and people get disappeared all the time. And usually the biggest crime you can commit in North Korea is not raping somebody or not murdering somebody. The biggest crime you can commit is saying something not right about the regime. So that is the biggest crime you can commit.
00:14:03.222 - 00:15:06.826, Speaker C: So every morning that I leave home to go to school, it's not like my mom saying, oh, be careful on the road or strangers or anything. She would say, always remember, even if you think no one is listening, the birds and mice always can hear you. So that was a teaching from my mom and that just made me to numb and never think what critical thinking is. So when I came to South Korea, it pretty know how did you believe that Kim Jong Ye was starving? Because in North Korea, they tell us that our dear leaders are hungry for us because they are working so hard and they don't get enough sleep. And as a young girl, I believed it and then I escaped to South Korea and I look at the picture of time and then they were saying, he's a fat guy. Hickey cannot be, possibly. And like someone literally had to teach me that he was fat.
00:15:06.826 - 00:15:32.962, Speaker C: Otherwise, because I would never think critically, I couldn't see in myself. And that's how I learned that everything has to be taught, including that critical thinking. We think we somehow understand the critical thinking naturally, but that's something doesn't come naturally. If you were born in North Korea who never heard the concept of critical.
00:15:33.026 - 00:15:43.834, Speaker A: Thinking, your father was sent to a labor camp when you were ten, what crime had he committed? Or crime, I should say exactly, isn't it?
00:15:43.952 - 00:16:34.714, Speaker C: I mean, if he were born in the free country, who would be a complete normal person? But in North Korea, it's a socialist country, so trading is a crime. So when we call black market in North Korea, that does not mean we are selling weapons or drugs or human trafficking people. Literally. We are selling rice, cloths, clothes and shoes, selling daily life items. And he was involved in black market business. Initially he was installing sugar, dried fish and clock, but later he sold a metal like a copper silver nicare and then that was a crime. So he was sent to labor camp and he was sentenced more than ten years for that.
00:16:34.912 - 00:16:38.810, Speaker A: And how did your life change after he was imprisoned?
00:16:39.390 - 00:17:34.190, Speaker C: Right? So as I said in North Korea, if someone committed a crime, the crime doesn't start with the person who committed in North Korea. Even though it's a socialist country, there's no real equality. The government, the regime made the system, which is a different class system. And because of my father was a criminal, my status was going down too. And they would call me, my blood was tainted and I wasn't pure anymore in the eyes of my dear party. And I could never be able to ever marry someone who was in a higher life status. And my fate was determined to be always diving and possibly to die soon from the disease and starvation.
00:17:34.850 - 00:17:37.120, Speaker A: And how do they enforce that?
00:17:37.890 - 00:17:40.880, Speaker C: You mean how do you enforce all those?
00:17:41.810 - 00:17:49.540, Speaker A: Yeah, like the Sungbun caste thing is it that you're not allowed to go to school or what happens?
00:17:49.990 - 00:18:42.290, Speaker C: Yeah. So Sangbon system is such an inhumane way of oppressing and controlling people. So there are three big categories. We say core is like top. We are very royal to the vision, maybe top 1% or the people who are in Pyeongyang. And though we say wavering is like middle class who are like merchants or teachers, some people in the middle and when we say hospital class in the bottom, who have relatives in South Korea or whose family members who left to South Korea or whose family members like my father who went to prison. So most of them are in that bottom class and some of them in the middle.
00:18:42.290 - 00:19:29.886, Speaker C: And the very tiny percent are on the top. But in that even three big categories, they divide to another 50 subcategories of different class. The craziest thing is that you can't even know yourself. That where your song is exactly. But you know if you are in the wavering or hostile or doing the core class. So when you are trying to marry or become a police officer or get a job, all the people doing the background, the track and tell you where you are and what you can do, what you cannot do. So we all somehow know our faith when you are born, we know which our grandpa was in the south or which my uncle was in the prison or who married whom.
00:19:29.886 - 00:20:26.820, Speaker C: And also it affects your family member marry somebody but then it's not only ending there, but if someone married their family members, but then the other side family members were in the prison, then your tongue instead of going down too. So you can always go down, but you can never go up unless there's a miracle happens. So it's so easy to go down in this home cast, but never going up. So the guys men would never marry me because my tongue was extremely low. And if I marry even someone who was in the high caste system, they were going to only come down, they can never go up. So that's how people make each other hate and each other to divide and be with only same background. So the core people will not get tainted by the people like us who are in the hostile class.
00:20:27.670 - 00:20:37.800, Speaker A: You also somehow saw the movie Titanic, which is an American movie, while you were in North Korea. How did you see that and what impact did it have on you?
00:20:38.270 - 00:21:43.258, Speaker C: So, as I said, there's no Internet in North Korea, but luckily we have this long, wide border opened up with China, and a lot of outside information comes from China by the smugglers. And watching this outside information isn't like it's an extremely risky thing to do. It would be something unimaginable for us to think that people can get killed for watching a movie, but apparently it is in North Korea. There are people losing their lives for watching outside information. And my case, I was young, but my uncles had a movie, Titanic. Somehow they got I don't know how they got it, but they were lent it to us. So I watched the movie along with my parents, and that was the first time I felt some humanity and also had a little bit taste of freedom.
00:21:43.258 - 00:22:00.500, Speaker C: And it didn't quite challenge me to think the rest of the world was going to be free and very prosperous, but I just thought maybe outside the world, maybe not that terrible, as my regime told me.
00:22:01.350 - 00:22:17.160, Speaker A: And you also talked about how it changed or introduced the idea of love to you that previously had only one definition of love. What was that definition? And then what did that movie open your mind to?
00:22:18.010 - 00:23:04.950, Speaker C: Yeah, so if you have read the movie, I mean, read the book 1984 by Georgia War. He talks about the importance of the language. The Big Brother Kick comes up with a new speak, right? And basically that's what North Korea regime did. They came up with a new dictionary. The dictionary does not have definition for freedom, human rights or even gay. There is no way you can look up in the dictionary what that is and also love. The dictionary only defines love as something, the love that you have for Dear Leader or the party.
00:23:04.950 - 00:23:57.110, Speaker C: You can never use the word to describe your emotions to another human being like your father or mother, your lover. So if you don't have that word, then you don't understand the concept. Therefore, your ability to think those complex things is getting very limited. And in that situation in, you know, we don't have the concept of those love. That there was never movie made to show that a lover can die for another lover. Every movie North Korea made to show us that how the revolutionary is dying for the party and revolution and what honorable thing that is. So when I saw a movie Titanic, I was extremely confused because there was not one single thing about revolution.
00:23:57.110 - 00:24:42.520, Speaker C: And at the end, this guy is dying for women. And I was so shocked. Why would anyone make a movie out of such a shameful story? And that was something dying for your lover was something never valued or even never talked about. I didn't even think that was a possibility. And then I was keep thinking and I thought it's just so beautiful. I felt like it was so natural to just love somebody and die for lover. And that's when I started thinking slightly differently and questioned really very minor my own way.
00:24:43.450 - 00:24:49.690, Speaker A: And you eventually escaped when you were 13. How did you escape and what made you try to risk your life to escape?
00:24:50.510 - 00:25:37.238, Speaker C: Yeah, so when I was escaped from North Korea, it's very different. I never seen the map of the world. I never knew how many continents we had, how many countries we had, what democracy was or what freedom was. I was luckily living in a town called Hessan, where we are facing border with China. So we just had one river that was flowing between China and North Korea. And at night I was able to see China and they had electricity at night. If you see North Korea right now from the satellite pictures, it is literally the darkest spot in the world.
00:25:37.238 - 00:26:27.286, Speaker C: They don't have 24 hours electricity and extremely dark at night. And by being advantageous living in the border town, I was seeing the lights and ultimately I became really hungry. So North Korean regime, often we think it's such a poor country, but it isn't. It has all the money in the world to build all those luxurious resort for the party members. They have all the money in the world to spend for billions of dollars every year making more nukes and testing them. And regime chose to starve us because they can control us that way. If you are full and you have food to eat, the next thing you're going to think of is meaning of your life and what can be better in my life.
00:26:27.286 - 00:27:13.750, Speaker C: But when you are on the verge of starving to death, you don't think of any of that. You just only try to survive. So North Korean regime purposefully starving us. The class that I was in and I wasn't able to find anything to eat in North Korea. And only way for me was that time was if I go where the lights were, maybe I find something to eat. And I also heard these rumors in my town know dogs in China eat rice. And I thought that was such a like people in dying from not eating food, like how pastry on earth like dogs can eat rice.
00:27:13.750 - 00:27:34.990, Speaker C: And I still thought maybe what can I do? If I don't do anything with my life, I might not be alive tomorrow morning. And that was risking my life and crossing that frozen river to China and see what happens. And that's why I decided to escape and do that journey.
00:27:35.890 - 00:27:38.030, Speaker A: And what happened when you got to China?
00:27:39.730 - 00:28:24.254, Speaker C: I was tricked by human traffickers. So once I arrived in China, so right before I escaped, I was going to escape with my own sister. So I was 13 years old and she was 16 years old, and two of us were going to escape together. But one day, I got such a horrible stomachache, and then I went to hospital. And in North Korea, the hospital that I was in, we don't have X rays or any machine to know what's going. Simply, my doctor rubbed my belly, and he said, oh, I think you have some appendicitis. We have to operate on you right now, soon.
00:28:24.254 - 00:29:11.318, Speaker C: And they come my belly without any painkiller, and they opened it, and they realized it was just a lot of malnutrition infection, and they closed me down. So most of people in North Korea, in hospitals, do not die from cancer or any other disease. We get cured way before that, which is a lot of times just starvation, infection. And so my sister couldn't go with me. I wasn't sure my surgery was successful or not get infected. So she escaped a few days before and left me a note saying, go follow this lady, that she's going to help you go to China. So luckily, I got out of hospital without infection.
00:29:11.318 - 00:30:10.590, Speaker C: And as soon as I removed my stitches, I did find a lady with my mother, and she said she could send me to China. And she lied to me that if I go to China, I was going to find food and might find my sister. So my mother and I crossed the frozen river into China with the help of a guy. But later we realized that I was a human trafficker, that they sold us to Chinese men. They sold my mother for, like, around 75 or something dollars, and they sold me for less than $300 because I was a virgin and young. And as soon as we got into China, chinese human trafficker raped my mother in front of me. And then they told us, if you want to survive in China, then you have to be sold as a sexual.
00:30:10.590 - 00:30:25.380, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the moment when I completely lost my faith in humanity, and I just started feeling things, I think.
00:30:28.890 - 00:30:43.980, Speaker A: And during this time, I heard about how somebody said the word free to you, and you didn't know what that was. Can you tell us about the first time you heard the word free?
00:30:44.990 - 00:31:25.842, Speaker C: Yeah. So while I was living in China as a slave for two years, at the end of two years time, it was extremely dangerous in China. Chinese regime constantly cracking down us, and they catch us and send us back to North Korea to get tortured. And they cared. So in China, living in there was so unbearable, even as much as being in North Korea. And one day we met a North Korean defector woman, and she told me, actually, if we go to South Korea, then we will be free. And I was so confused.
00:31:25.842 - 00:32:29.500, Speaker C: I asked her, what do you mean I will be free and she said oh you can wear your jeans, you can watch your movies and no one going to arrest you for that. And from someone from North Korea, people killed by watching movie or wearing jeans or getting you into prison and getting punished it was something so revolutionary that I couldn't believe how can on earth that is okay. And she said it is really true that if we go to South Korea that we will be free, we can wear jeans and watch movies and no one's going to arrest you. So I thought that's amazing, I'm going to risk my life for that that's when I decided to walking across the gabby desert in -40 degrees and with a compass in my hand I crossed a desert to Mongolia in 2009 when I was 15 years old and that's how I became free.
00:32:30.830 - 00:33:01.910, Speaker A: In a moment we'll discuss more about Yanmi's story and why so many human rights groups focus on getting outside information into North Korea.

Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy.

00:35:03.390 - 00:35:25.330, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Yanme Park. So you made it to South Korea and why don't you just fill us in on everything that has happened to you to this point where now you live in the States and you have a degree from Columbia and you speak at the UN and you just have written a book. Why don't you fill us in on what happened once you reached freedom?
00:35:26.390 - 00:36:23.186, Speaker C: Once I reached freedom arrived in Was, you know, I thought like, oh, I'm at the end of the journey, my life is going to be great. But it was completely opposite. Learning to be free was so painful. It was so difficult that I actually said, if there's a guarantee that I'm going to get enough frozen potatoes and enough some food, I might go back to Korea. I mean, if the region don't kill me. And that's how hard it was adjusting to freedom and South Korea, because South Korea also had such a heavy discrimination against north skin defectors. And I was made fun of speaking the way that I was having North Korean accent and also catching up with the society.
00:36:23.186 - 00:37:47.490, Speaker C: Like South Korea were so advanced and the competition is so vigorous that there was no way for me to compete. When I arrived, I was almost dork and the kids in South Korea were going to study English when they were in mothers their stomach and studying English in their kindergarten and they do so much for education and it was just in every pass away was so difficult. But after all that difficulty, when I was in university in South Korea, one day I read a book, Animal Farm by Georgia Wear. And that was my turning point. So until that so biggest thing after North Korea is of course understanding freedom or freeware or to modernity, it was all challenging. It was completely going from one different planet to different planet. But what was the hardest thing was trusting again, right? So when I arrived in South Korea, they said, oh, Kims were dictators and Koreans were started by Kim Ye Song, not by Americans and South Koreans.
00:37:47.490 - 00:38:31.520, Speaker C: And they say, oh, you're brainwashed. Everything you believed was lie and everything I'm telling you is true. And I was so shocked and I was like, so everything that I believed was lie. Then how do I know what you are saying is not lie? At that point you're just so confused like, how is this possible? Everything that all I believed, all my heart was, you know, I was stopped trusting again. And when I read the book by Georgia Animal Farm, I could see North Korea in me. I could see my grandma in the old pigs. I could see just young pigs in myself.
00:38:31.520 - 00:39:15.122, Speaker C: Everything made sense to me. Why everything became that way. And then I started really trusting the information that I was finding online and the books in South Korea. And then one day I was sitting in the room and watched the TV in South Korea and it was big emotional concert, like fundraising concert. The celebrities were crying. And then suddenly it was showing donation and it was a campaign for animals rights and my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe you had animals rights.
00:39:15.122 - 00:40:02.750, Speaker C: What is animals rights? I didn't even know I had the rights as a human being. How on earth that we are living in the same planet? There are 25 million people don't even know they are oppressed, don't know even they are enslaved and they have rights. But the other parts of the world, they have a room to care about animals rights. And that's when I decided something was so wrong. And then I realized also that just the world had no idea what was happening to North Korean people. Because the media in the know when I was starting my activism is when the movie, I don't know if you heard the movie called The Interview came up by Sony.
00:40:03.090 - 00:40:05.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw it. I have a friend who was in it.
00:40:05.972 - 00:40:49.994, Speaker C: But anyway, really it was really sad moment because every newspaper was so busy making fun of North Indicator and North Korea. How bizarre these people marching on the square. The old people were so brainwashed and acting like robots. And how bizarre this dictator looking like cartoon character with a funny haircut. And everything was so funny that people didn't get the gravity of this tragedy that we are having. It's a holocaust happening, but the world is just so busy making fun of it. And that's when I realized I have to let the world know what's happening.
00:40:49.994 - 00:41:35.420, Speaker C: It is not so mean. I think people were confused about North Korea. That of course we have freedom to make fun of North Korea. That's our freedom and that's our privilege. But when something is so funny, then you lose the gravity of the seriousness of this issue. How much people are being affected by this tragedy. So I think that's when started educating myself and really understood why the world is not caring about this issue was not just because the people were in freedom, were just evil and having no compassion, but just because they did not know what was happening.
00:41:35.420 - 00:41:46.430, Speaker C: And that's what I do now. It's really I dedicate all my life to let the world know what's happening and just tell the world that this must be stopped.
00:41:47.170 - 00:42:24.460, Speaker A: So we're going to get to how you do that. But I actually also just want to ask a little bit more about foreign media in North Korea nowadays. If you know how common is it for people think is there still literally no internet access? Because you defected obviously a while ago. So I'm not sure how much, you know, how things have changed because as far as I understand, I think a lot of groups working to free North Korea, their main focus is still on getting outside information in. Why is that their strategy and how did they do?
00:42:26.430 - 00:43:40.900, Speaker C: I have I'm still working with a lot of underground networks and I have contacts in North Korea, so I get the up to date news from and, you know, I work with a lot of NGOs who does rescue and who gets information. And based on what I hear from the people in North Korea right now is that, yes, the outside information is really everyday life, at least minimum, more than 80% of people, 87 even up to percent people have access to outside information, especially among the elites in these metropolitan cities and in the border towns. They have a lot of access to the outside information. And the fact that that is changing the people's minds. The young generation like myself, grew up with outside information, that they do really have less loyalty towards the regime. Of course, they are staying silent because of the fear, because of this punishment, inhuman punishment by the regime. But inside, they know that the regime is not the good.
00:43:40.900 - 00:44:22.394, Speaker C: You know, for me is that to change North Korea, it's not like the answer should be the movement should start within North Korean people. They should demand their freedom and their rights. And that's true, positive change is going to happen in North Korea. And that only can start with liberation of their minds. And the outside information is liberating their minds. They are slave even in their minds, the regime. But this information is going and they see and they are not slaves anymore unless with their minds.
00:44:22.394 - 00:44:35.700, Speaker C: And I think if we get enough information and to tell them what they deserve and what humans deserve, I do think this is a real chance that when we can free North Korea with information.
00:44:36.710 - 00:44:53.420, Speaker A: And when you say that there's a lot of outside information in North Korea, does that mean that the punishment for watching it is less? Or how can it be a lot? And how do you define a lot? Do they still have to do it in secret? Or how is this happening?
00:44:54.110 - 00:45:38.966, Speaker C: Yes, because of the country right now becoming very corrupt. So North Korea regime has one of the worst corruptions in the world. And because if you think about it, as your officer in the government, you don't really get the rations, and your salary is extremely low. They said the doctor's salary a month is something over one dollars. You cannot possibly survive with that money a month. The doctors, officials and the party members have to find a way to survive. And that means accepting the bribes, and the bribes coming from people who commit the crime.
00:45:38.966 - 00:46:05.490, Speaker C: So of course, there are still people going to prison camps and still getting executed for distributing outside information. But for doing that, they get money. You need to make money somehow. And that means you have to sell outside information. But when you get caught, then you have to bribe. But if you get unlucky, you're going to get executed. So of course this is extremely dangerous thing.
00:46:05.490 - 00:47:00.740, Speaker C: But also it opens the opportunity for the people to survive. And that's the way of course you cannot now go to movie theater and publicly watch asset information. But you do it at your home, your TV and the electricity is a real problem. But then these people getting ready by corruption and they get somehow there's like a natural way or burning the oil or something. They get the electricity that way and they get the device is like we call it notebook, laptop. But the note that doesn't have internet but can't lay USB sticks or SD card. So all this modern technology is helping North Koreans to access to information.
00:47:00.740 - 00:47:31.258, Speaker C: And also there's so much demand. But this NGOs is increasing the supply. They get all this information like USB sticks and all this. They cut the cost when it was North Korea. And that just makes it so much available for people to access and also it's to get out because of the corruption than before. And people's royalty has changed. Everyone just tried to survive.
00:47:31.258 - 00:47:52.850, Speaker C: So maybe in my mother's generation there were so many true believers and they would go to authority and complain. But now people just want to survive. So less loyalty makes it available for people to trust each other and selling these things underground and bribe each other to survive.
00:47:54.710 - 00:48:01.160, Speaker A: Yeah. I was just realizing, I bet you probably watched Titanic on a DVD. But now on a US.
00:48:04.650 - 00:48:54.070, Speaker C: It was a really old time. It was like the films were even before the DVD. It was like in the late ninety s. And North Korea always catching up with the technology a few decades later. So my time was like before I escaped, it was like DVD. But when I saw Titanic was something like really old cassette, almost, right, cassette, yeah, those things I use. And right now when I talk to my North Korean contacts in North Korea, they use SD cards like USB with tiny devices that you can even swallow when you're in trouble, you can just swallow them and the officials can't really find in you.
00:48:54.070 - 00:48:59.660, Speaker C: My time was so hard to hide because they were so big. But now it's so easy.
00:49:00.510 - 00:49:12.640, Speaker A: Yeah. And not only that, but you can only watch one movie on one tape. But with an SD card or a USB you can watch hundreds or thousands even. I don't know how much you can fit on there.
00:49:13.250 - 00:49:51.462, Speaker C: Yeah, even I remember we needed a few tapes. Even watch Titanic was such a long movie. It was hard to finish a Titanic because of lack of electricity or all of that. We need a few tapes and we sometimes took my time. Sometimes it took months to finish a movie because we only get the electricity under the ideal leaders, like birthday or New Year's Eve, something like only national holidays. They gave us electricity. But now USB does not need the entire device.
00:49:51.462 - 00:50:04.560, Speaker C: With the power, you can charge and you can last for many hours. So North Koreans are also benefiting by these technological advances right now.
00:50:05.090 - 00:50:21.060, Speaker A: Yeah. So one thing I wanted to ask you, is there's this increasingly popular trend for tourists, even from the United States, to go to North Korea? When people go to North Korea as tourists, what impact does that have on the country?
00:50:21.990 - 00:50:48.694, Speaker C: So it is a thing. So in North Korea, when I was there, they told us, everyone wants to come to North Korea. We are the most envied country in the world. Literally. There was song called Nothing to Envy. So we had nothing to envy in this world because we are the envious country. And they say, everyone admires our dear leaders, and they all worship our dear leaders.
00:50:48.694 - 00:51:33.734, Speaker C: So they will show us the pictures of the foreigners, come to North Korea, and bow in front of the statue of Kim. And of course, I believe, yeah, everyone really admires our dear leader. And so when you go to North Korea as a tourist, yes, you reinforce this propaganda that North Korean people are doing. The second of all, the dictatorship wants hydrocarrency by these tourists. And the tourists idea. And the argument of them going to North Korea is such a naive way of arguing. They say, oh, if I go to North Korea, I'm going to change some people's minds because I'm such a generous, benevolent foreigner.
00:51:33.734 - 00:52:24.726, Speaker C: And the restaurant, if I show them that I'm such a kind person, they will change their mind about themselves, and then they're going to maybe start a revolution or open up. But the craziest thing is that Kim Jong UN was educated in Switzerland. He went to school in a country that is most democratic. They respect human dignity and freedom. So by teaching them how generous Westerners is not going to change, north Korean elite, of course, knows everything. They know too well that they don't want change. They know that if the system collapse, they lose their privileges, they lose their royal status.
00:52:24.726 - 00:52:46.610, Speaker C: They are not the anymore. And they know that those defectors go to South Korea. They all become commoners. Even they were the highest ranking in the party when they defected. South Korea, America, they just become one of everybody. They are not special anymore. Their children don't get those benefits for their lifetime.
00:52:46.610 - 00:53:45.090, Speaker C: These elite people go to school in Beijing or Europe, in Germany, like in Moscow, they see the rest of the world. They know what's happening. Exactly. And they have every intention to keep the system going for their benefits. So when you go your guys were the ones who were studying in Beijing and who went abroad to study foreign language and who are the children of the most elite people. And when you only interact with those people and when you go to staying at these hotels or these casinos or anywhere you go, the people that you meet, the ones who are benefited by the regime, who doesn't want the change. So you don't like helping anyone's mindset and you also give money to the regime to maintain in power and also it's ethically so wrong.
00:53:45.090 - 00:54:54.620, Speaker C: It's like you are visiting concentration camp but not as a liberator but as a friend, as a celebrator of this know imagine you right now when you're in the world War II we have a ticket to concentration camp and not delivering them, but show them how you are so very bad and you're free and that's what you're doing. Going to North Korea and looking at miserable starving North Koreans and look at me, I'm free because I was fortunate enough to borrowing democracy but you're not. So in so many possible ways this is so messed up and I can't even describe I think a lot of people do not have the bad intention to go. They are just so genuinely naively believe that they can change people's minds and this is going to benefit in some ways but that is so not and actually such a destructive behavior in the movement of liberating North Koreans and yeah, it's just so sad how sometimes people are so naive that way.
00:54:55.150 - 00:55:26.440, Speaker A: Yeah. And I wanted to ask because this is similar but a little bit different, that cryptocurrency researcher I mentioned before, his name is Virgil Griffith, he had permission from the North Korean government to give a talk at this conference in Pyongyang on blockchain technology. So knowing what you know about how the Kim regime works, how they, you know, interact or how they allow interactions with foreigners, who do you think the audience would have been? Who would have benefited from such a talk?
00:55:27.450 - 00:56:34.300, Speaker C: So right now, North Korea, Venezuela, all these countries are interested. The regimes are interested people because they want to avoid the sanction. They want to make the moral to north Korea makes money by selling drugs, by human trafficking its own people, by selling weapons to middle east. So they do all this dark crime and they need more money and they need to avoid the international sanction and they need of course cryptocurrency can empower a lot of individuals oppressed by the regimes but also we have to be cautious because it can be also used by the dictator. I don't know how North Korea went far to creating their own currency and cryptocurrency and going to do it. But anyone who is benefited by this free society going there and helping this murder is a crime and I think he is about to prosecute by the US government. Right?
00:56:36.270 - 00:56:43.214, Speaker A: Yeah. It's not clear what will happen obviously, but he was charged if he was.
00:56:43.252 - 00:57:40.734, Speaker C: Really benefiting this dictator that is a crime. So I think I don't know enough to go into the entire crypto benefit. I think when it comes to North Korea, all I can say is north Korean government is extremely interested in cryptocurrency because they want to avoid the sanctions in their illegal activities and they need that technology and support. And I just hope that people stay on the side, know, people not with the I mean, what can I really say? He had the freedom to go to North Korea and give that speech, but that wasn't legal, apparently. And I think we have rule of law in this world and that's what keeps our world better than yeah, I.
00:57:40.852 - 00:57:58.166, Speaker A: Also earlier when you said cryptocurrency could help people in Oppressed mean, I think obviously that's true if they have access to the Internet. But in North Korea, where they don't, I think it would be quite difficult for anybody who's not part of the.
00:57:58.188 - 00:58:48.550, Speaker C: Regime to benefit that cryptocurrency conference that he was in. He was absolutely benefiting the regime, not the people. Obviously, he didn't go there to empower the people. He went there to empower the dictatorship. The people who can only attend that cryptocurrency conference is the extreme top elite who train to become hackers, who train to do all those illegal activities, and who wants every intention to want the regime to stay. He didn't go some commoner's conference where everyone could attend, so he just went there to team up with a dictator and try to impart the yeah, that's the thing. That cryptocurrency conference wasn't like any yeah.
00:58:48.620 - 00:59:09.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm so glad you said this, because people on Twitter seem to think that he could have interacted with everyday north Koreans. And I'm not an expert in north Korea, but I have read so many books on it, and I was like, what? I was like, I don't think you guys know how this place works because he would be in a prison camp right now if he did that.
00:59:11.250 - 00:59:55.114, Speaker C: No, he might get shot. So, you know, our rainbow got tortured and to death. The American poor university students, right from Virginia tech, and there's a south Korean woman who went to gumgang mountain, the tourist, and the official said, you cannot pass that line. And she did, and they shot her right on the spot. If these people truly believe that they can go to North Korea and meet everyday life, why don't they dare to try it? It's a hermit kingdom. Not because the information is only controlled for north Koreans. North Korean regime controls the information both ways.
00:59:55.114 - 01:00:34.840, Speaker C: They control what north Korean people can hear about the rest of the world, and they control the information. That why we can know about North Korean people. Even outside the outsiders, we can't know. So when you even go there as a tourist, you cannot just go grab, take a know, hiking around and go anywhere you want, or there's backpack traveling that you do in the Southeast Asia, you have to be with your guys all the time. Otherwise you become a traitor and send to prison camps. Like what did yeah.
01:00:35.450 - 01:00:38.120, Speaker A: And all he did was taking a poster or something.
01:00:38.510 - 01:01:15.310, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a crime. Can you believe that? That's a crime that he took his life for. I mean, if North Korea has a gut to treat a white person, white American that way, can you imagine what they are doing to North Koreans who doesn't have voice, who's not visible in the rest of the world? If that's the brutality they do with a white person from America, the terror that North Koreans are going through is something beyond our comprehension.
01:01:25.450 - 01:01:48.960, Speaker A: Sanctions hurt the citizens of these countries more than they hurt the he was one of the things that the Department of justice charged him with was helping the North Korean regime evade sanctions. So if he actually had done that, what effect do you think that would have? Would that help the North Korean people or hurt them?
01:01:49.490 - 01:02:21.290, Speaker C: So I have anecdote so when I was young, I said, in the world 90s, right, north Korea had a greatest famine. It was a man made famine. The regime chose to stive us. So more than even, like, over 3 million people died. Not in Pyeongyang, but the people who were, like, in US. In the hospital class in the northern part, that was a lot of people seeing dead bodies on the streets. Everyday life, for me, I never thought that was something unusual, that I had to be shocked.
01:02:21.290 - 01:03:12.778, Speaker C: And in that situation, I'm still very petite. North Koreans are average three to four inch shorter than South Koreans, even though we were same people because of the malnutrition. And so this malnutrition, when we were there, they were gathering these diving children, and they get some foreigners to come and see, and they get food from some Uni chef. I don't know, UN or other countries get so much cash and medical aid, all of this, and they use us as toys and show them. And then when those things come in, they all take them to Pyongyang. So those aid, those money, those rice, those food that you send doesn't come to us. That goes to North Korean elite people.
01:03:12.778 - 01:04:20.090, Speaker C: So if those aid helped, why did I escape and became a sexual slave and being raped in China? The first thing when I arrived in China, and after getting my mom raped, and they said, you have to be sold and get raped. And they say, if you don't like it, you can go back to North Korea. My mother asked me, what did I want to do. She asked me, when I do you want to go back? What do you want to do? One thing made me to change my mind was when I, for the first time, saw a trash bin in China. I did not know what it was but the lady told me that's the way you throw away things that you don't want I was so shocked like how on earth do you have things to throw away in this country? I never needed a trash can in my life in North Korea. There's nothing to throw away in North Korea. And people like in North Korea, if they really get benefited by all this international aid, no one should be dying.
01:04:20.090 - 01:05:10.030, Speaker C: In those 90s when I was exactly in North Korea. South Korea all these like Hyundai, all these big groups when the Kim Daezung he won the Nobel Peace Prize, he gave millions of dollars I mean the billions of dollars money and food, cash and every possible resources he could gather in South Korea and the international could be hurt. None came to the most formal people like us and it all went to the region. So the people right now keep arguing the sanction is hurting everyday life. There's no way we can be hurt them while we are already now. There's no way people can suffer more than what we are suffering right now. And those things that we give to North Korean regime only benefiting the regime.
01:05:10.030 - 01:05:58.286, Speaker C: And why is that so hard? These people understand computer science and economics, all of these things. If you do the thing that the dictator doesn't want, that means you are winning. If you want to give the thing that dictator wants that you are benefiting him. North King dictator wants the sanction to be lifted, that means it is definitely benefiting him and we don't want the benefit dictator, right? Like when I got attacked by the North Korean regime, I thought oh, I'm winning. I need to be hated by him, I need to be criticized by him. If I was praising by him, I would definitely do something wrong. The Northeast regime wants sanctionist state and they want choice to come in.
01:05:58.286 - 01:06:42.220, Speaker C: And if you do the exact opposite, I know that we are on the right side of the history. It's really not that hard. It's just so easy. And I just don't know why some people are so somehow invested emotionally on this word of sanction. Sanction in the context of North Korea is exactly meaning of the starving, the elite starving the regime sanctioned items is like north Korean regime cannot buy the items like in a ski resort items, they cannot buy sports cars, they cannot buy Chanel bags or Prada bags. Those are the items on the sanctioned items. And even those food that we send is not going to the most vulnerable people.
01:06:42.220 - 01:07:06.280, Speaker C: So why are there so many people are so passionately using their time and resources and arguing that why we should benefit the dictator? Who is so fat enough and who is always so well fat? Why do we need to feed him more with all our resources that can go to benefiting so many starving people right now?
01:07:06.970 - 01:07:29.500, Speaker A: So given the fact that the Kim regime has nuclear weapons and is apparently now finding other ways to fund itself. What do you think is the best way to deal with Kim Jong UN? Obviously getting information in is one, but what else do you think could be done to help free the North Korean people?
01:07:30.450 - 01:08:18.762, Speaker C: So there are several ways, but I think there are really number one is awareness that people really don't know exactly what's happening, why there are so many misinformation. And they need to understand the regime has no intention ever going to give up the Nicole Ruffin voluntarily. They are just playing with the rest of the world and they just try use this as card as like we are going to get rid of the nukes, so you give me more money so they can actually secretly build more nukes. That you need to understand that. That's why one, we need a sanction. We need to starve the regime as much as we can and as much as we can. And I think that's why that trump sanction worked.
01:08:18.762 - 01:09:00.022, Speaker C: That's why we got North Korea out of their hermit kingdom and in the conversation table. So we need a sanction. And the second is empowering people. We need this information to go in North Korea so people get empowered. They know they deserve this rights, they know that the rights of the world is prosperous and free. And the third that I personally care is the rescue. It's like during the Nazi Holocaust, right? These defectors escape to China with everything they have and they become modern slaves, they become sexual slaves.
01:09:00.022 - 01:09:41.090, Speaker C: And there are so many NGOs that rescue them to South Korea, to America, to free country. And there are currently up to almost 300,000 defectors are hiding in China and most of them are women and girls who are being raped right now every day. And we need to rescue them. And I think that's what I just say that there are three ways. One is awareness so we can pressure on vision more. And second is getting information. And third is rescuing these most vulnerable people right now in the world to safety.
01:09:41.090 - 01:09:47.160, Speaker C: And there are so many NGOs that are already involved in this movement right now.
01:09:47.550 - 01:09:57.980, Speaker A: And for the listeners who are hearing your stories and are moved to help North Korea, are there any particular organizations or what do you suggest they do?
01:09:59.150 - 01:10:55.920, Speaker C: Yeah, it's exactly the reason why I'm on the board of Human Rights Foundation is that human Rights Foundation, of course they are involved in getting information inside North Korea, but they are helping with all these other groups doing the rescuing work, doing empowering women or this most vulnerable people. And they have connection to all those NGOs and helping them. So if you reach out to HRF, they know every NGO that working in this field and they're going to connect you, the people that you want to help it with and they. Have every connection to, you know, it's very easy. All you have to do is reach out to people who are at the HRF and what do you care about and how do you get involved and what you can contribute? And they always find your way know, help connect you and do the right thing.
01:10:56.450 - 01:11:21.734, Speaker A: Yeah. And listeners who haven't heard my episodes with Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, I will link to those in the show notes. He is just a fond of information about human rights issues as well as cryptocurrency and how bitcoin can help oppressed people. So, Yanmi, where can people learn more about you and your well, I'm very.
01:11:21.772 - 01:12:36.150, Speaker C: Active on social media, twitter, Instagram, Facebook. I also wrote a book, so it has a lot of more in depth of North Korean history why became that way? And they are where they're heading to. So if you just really want to know the perspective of North Korea, not from the perpetrators, not from the regime or these elite people, if you just really want to know the perspective that we are survivors having, then you should not only my memoir, but there are a lot of other memos are written by de factors. And are you sure that none of the de factors who survived the regime is going to tell you tourism is the answer and lifting the sanction is the answer. None of us are saying that everyone we experience regime the first hand. We all say the opposite. And if you believed not to believe survivors, and if you choose to believe in perpetrators, and that's out of my control, but please listen to all other survivors who have written their many more, know they're risking their lives, know, raise their voice.
01:12:36.150 - 01:13:11.530, Speaker C: Even though I escaped, right now I'm a green card holder living in America because I'm speaking out right now and tell the world about the truth. All my relatives, three generations of my relatives back in North Korea been disappeared. I don't know they've been executed or in a concentration camp. But that's the thing. This is a regime that we are dealing with. That's how evil this regime is. They are still punishing people even though I escaped.
01:13:11.530 - 01:13:33.970, Speaker C: So I don't know how else I can describe how evil this regime and how you should be so careful with your actions if that's whether going to benefit the regime or the people. Because sometimes without our ignorance can't have the evil. And I think that we are responsible for our ignorance.
01:13:34.630 - 01:13:39.540, Speaker A: I do hope someday that you can reunite with your family.
01:13:41.110 - 01:13:44.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I hope they're alive. Yeah.
01:13:44.392 - 01:14:40.566, Speaker A: Before we end, I also absolutely need to give a ringing endorsement of your book in order to live. Thank you. A couple years ago, I read it before meeting you at the Oslo Freedom Forum. And listeners should know there are many moments where it's quite heartbreaking about what Yanmi went through. But honestly, by the end, Yanmi, your indomitable spirit just really shines through, and I just was so moved. It made me feel the depths of sadness, but it also made me feel the utmost hope for humanity and for listeners. Even if you don't listen to my recommendation, I will tell you that Yunmi's book has the highest rating I've ever seen on Goodreads, which shows that thousands and thousands and thousands of people think it's exceptional, not just me.
01:14:40.566 - 01:15:00.538, Speaker A: So, Yanmi, congratulations for just for your life and what you've been through and achieved and overcome and the work that you continue to do. And thank you for coming on my show.
01:15:00.704 - 01:15:03.820, Speaker C: Thanks, Laurie. It's been a real honor. Thank you.
