00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.814, Speaker B: We've all heard that.
00:00:00.852 - 00:00:37.650, Speaker A: Banks face a moral hazard, which is my personal favorite euphemism for capitalism, which means we're basically always on the verge of a banking crisis. And we're in one right now. Silicon valley bank cratered last week in part because of its own risky decision making and in part because of what the federal reserve did. They raised interest rates very quickly, despite the negative effect. Now, there were people recommending that they do this, including Larry Summers, which hurts my heart. Huge fan since he made those comments about girls being bad at math, but I feel betrayed that he gave bad financial advice. So with these two forces working in tandem, it can be worthwhile to ask, is there a reason that bitcoin has never needed a bailout?
00:00:37.730 - 00:00:39.094, Speaker B: I'm not the only one who's asking.
00:00:39.132 - 00:00:59.660, Speaker A: If traditional banks have something to learn from bitcoin, since no individual or group controls bitcoin, which means that they couldn't bail it out even if they wanted to. And believe me, they wanted to. Furthermore, all protocol changes to bitcoin require an open source development process, which can take years. I bet you never, ever thought that one of the selling points of bitcoin might be its slowness. But here we are.
