00:00:00.250 - 00:00:53.850, Speaker A: If you allow Creators to kind of revoke a license because someone used hate speech, then you've really opened the door to censorship and people creators being able to rug their holders. And it's hard to refute that because ultimately there is a risk of that in the event that creators retain that. Right. But at the same time, right, you can imagine that Creators and other NFT holders in a community wouldn't want people to be able to use their NFTs in some propaganda that really kind of reflects badly. And so there's very differing views on what is the right approach. And again, we didn't take an opinion on kind of what the correct approach was. And so we have version of each of our licenses that have kind of the hate speech revocation.
