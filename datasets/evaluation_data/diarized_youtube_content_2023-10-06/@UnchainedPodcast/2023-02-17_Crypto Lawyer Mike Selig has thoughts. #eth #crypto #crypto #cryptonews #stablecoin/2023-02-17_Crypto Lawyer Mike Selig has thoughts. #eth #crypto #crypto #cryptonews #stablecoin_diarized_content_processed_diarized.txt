And of course, there's going to be legal challenges here because the arguments we don't know what arguments they're making, but there's very good arguments potentially that these products are more like money transmitter issued products like a stored value and instrument or a gift card. And these are things that money transmitters that are licensed at the state level and have a registration with Vincent or even a trust company that doesn't need the registration with Vincent are able to you know, you can load dollars into your PayPal or Venmo account and send those dollars to someone else. And that's all regulated as money transmission as opposed to the offering or issuance of securities. And so the lines are starting to really blur here when we get into the world of stablecoins because they really do look like gift cards on a blockchain that are transferable, open loop gift.
