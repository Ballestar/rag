00:00:00.410 - 00:00:29.302, Speaker A: When you think of a traditional pig butchering case, the scammers are going to reach out to victims in a number of different ways. One way that we see frequently is on dating sites. Another way is on Instagram. Another way is on LinkedIn. Another way is just a random text that pops up on your phone. And I feel like when I bring those up, a lot of people say, oh, I've gotten a random text on my phone. That's so that's and a lot of people, believe it or not, are responding to those.
00:00:29.302 - 00:00:54.170, Speaker A: So what the scammers are doing is they're looking to make any connection with someone, and then they immediately move from whatever the platform that is to WhatsApp or telegram or something else that's encrypted. And from there, they begin a long term con of really creating a trusted relationship with the person that they are scamming. It is wholly and completely manipulative.
