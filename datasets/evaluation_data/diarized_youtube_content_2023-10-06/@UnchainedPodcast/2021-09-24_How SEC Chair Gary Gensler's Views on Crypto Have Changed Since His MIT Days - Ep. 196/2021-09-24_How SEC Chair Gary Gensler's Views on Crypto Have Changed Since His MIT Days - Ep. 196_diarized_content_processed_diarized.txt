Welcome, Nick.
00:02:35.898 - 00:02:37.600, Speaker B: Hi, thank you for having me.
00:02:38.130 - 00:02:50.050, Speaker A: So there's been a lot of regulatory news this week. Let's start with SEC Chair Gary Gensler's, q A with the Washington Post about crypto. What were the main takeaways from that discussion?
00:02:51.430 - 00:03:50.040, Speaker B: Yeah, Gensler kind of repeated a lot of his talking points, but what really struck me was near the end, he kind of implied that he doesn't see cryptocurrencies, or at least some types of cryptocurrencies lasting in the long term, which really almost feels like an opposite view to what he said when he was lecturing on crypto at MIT. At the time, he was talking about crypto as a change catalyst, as something that will kind of define finance in the future. But now that he's a regulator, it feels like he is being a lot more cautious. And given his role as the head of the SEC, he, if anyone, has the power to kind of ensure that whatever regulatory regime he implements is capable of ending cryptocurrencies or facilitating this kind of innovation depending on how strict it is or what kind of requirements he enforces. So that to me was kind of the most telling thing that he said.
00:03:50.730 - 00:03:56.150, Speaker A: And do you have any sense of what is the reason for the shift in his views?
00:03:57.610 - 00:05:19.700, Speaker B: I want to say stablecoins in DeFi. He's been talking about this for a while now, warning about how he sees a lot of stablecoins as possibly being securities, especially those that are backed by a basket of assets, including commercial paper or money market funds. It feels like he's kind of casting this wide net because at this point, the crypto industry is large enough and has enough momentum that if he's trying to regulate specific narrow issues like stablecoins or DeFi, a narrowly tailored regulatory proposal might not cut it. So my sense is, and this is speculation from me, but is that he is casting this wide net saying we're going to do all of this stuff to regulate crypto. And it's to an eye of being very targeted at the end in terms of what specific issues he wants to regulate, what kind of cryptocurrencies he wants to see registered as securities, and what kind of exchanges or trading platforms he wants to register with the SEC as securities trading platforms. He's been escalating his rhetoric around this for a while. He's gone from saying stablecoins might be securities to saying feels pretty explicit about Coinbase registering as a securities trading platform during congressional testimony the other week.
00:05:19.700 - 00:05:24.740, Speaker B: It all kind of feels like it's escalating to a specific end game.
00:05:25.830 - 00:05:37.480, Speaker A: So maybe let's talk about that exchange piece of it. What is the way that crypto exchanges currently operate? And then based on his comments, how do you think that might change?
00:05:38.890 - 00:06:14.094, Speaker B: Yeah, so right now, crypto exchanges in the US. Are primarily regulated at the state level. So if you're an exchange, you have to register and secure a money transmission license from every state financial regulator you want to do business in. So with the exception of Montana, which doesn't have a regime that's 49 different licenses, crypto exchanges aren't wild about this because that's 40 to nine times the amount of work you would normally have to do. It's expensive. You have to file a lot of paperwork and spend a lot of time and resources. But there is no federal regulator for crypto exchanges.
00:06:14.094 - 00:06:55.300, Speaker B: Specifically, the CFTC regulates futures products. So bitcoin futures, if you're trading those then you're under a CFTC's Purview. And if you're registering as a securities exchange, you can try doing that through the SEC if you're trying to be a broker or an ATS. But right now, there's really no real federal regulator that oversees spot crypto trading. And Gensler said in the past that he sees that as being a cause for concern. He said that he believes that in the interest of investor protection, there should be some kind of entity regulating these federal trading platforms. And he's putting forth the SEC.
00:06:55.300 - 00:07:36.270, Speaker B: I think it's fairly apparent that he seems to be viewing the SEC as the right regulator for this. And this is based on him saying that in his view, if an exchange has listed 50 or 100 or hundreds of tokens, then at least some of them are going to be securities, or at least they would be recognized as securities under the SEC's Purview. And so he's said that exchanges that list these tokens, which nothing explicitly named yet, but any token that might be a security, if it's trading on your exchange, he wants you to register with the SEC as a platform that's subject to its regulations.
00:07:36.770 - 00:07:39.920, Speaker A: And do you have a sense of whether exchanges are open to that?
00:07:40.610 - 00:08:35.406, Speaker B: I haven't heard anything from exchanges yet, but it's going to come down to what kind of specific guidance. Right. Gensler has been saying all of this during congressional testimony and speeches, and he always prefaces with, know, these are my views, not to be used as a commission, but there's no formal SEC guidance right now. I think what it might take is if the SEC were to come out and know, we think that this cryptocurrency and that cryptocurrency and this token that you have listed here are definitely securities and you should register with us, that might be one way he could kind of force the issue. But as we saw when the SEC sued Ripple on claims that it sold XRP as a security, a lot of exchanges just either delisted or suspended trading in XRP. So unless the SEC is comprehensive about Know, I don't think exchanges are going to be rushing to register. And like, we're a securities trading platform.
00:08:35.406 - 00:08:40.100, Speaker B: And again, part of that is, just, know, how exactly do you do that?
00:08:40.470 - 00:09:17.374, Speaker A: So this kind of gets at another question I wanted to ask you, and this sort of even goes back to what we were discussing with Stablecoins in Gensler's Q A with the Washington Post. He talked about how stablecoins look like they could be either investment contracts or also banking products. And I wondered, is it even know what the SEC's purview is, and does it look like it already has the necessary authorization to regulate this area? And actually here, I mean, it could even be Stablecoins or but also the exchange issue.
00:09:17.572 - 00:10:20.194, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been the defining question in their regulatory world for at least a year, if not more. My understanding about the Stablecoin issue is if they are backed by securities. So anything that might bear interest, then he's kind of implying that stablecoin should be registered as a security. But then the banking regulatory side comes in when you have a lot of these platforms that are offering lending or interest bearing products based on Stablecoins. And banks do this too. But banks are subject to a very strict banking regulatory regime, and that's either under the offices of control of the currency or state bank regulators or sometimes even Fed and FDIC, like all of them, are kind of involved. But the point is, it's a very strict banking regime, and any traditional bank that wants to offer these kinds of interest bearing products are subject to strict regulations about it.
00:10:20.194 - 00:11:11.106, Speaker B: Crypto exchanges or crypto lending platforms or startups in this industry. They're not registering as banks and they're not licensed as banks, so they're not subject to those regulations. But there's also, again, still no real federal regulators. So the argument for a securities regime has been that if you're offering an interest bearing product, it might be a certificate of interest, might be kind of seen as a note in the security sense. And so the SEC has jurisdiction there. And in this case, the SEC would already have that jurisdiction for sure. Gensler has been saying that he needs more plenary authority to regulate crypto, but there is, I think, a solid argument that at least when it comes to lending products or interest bearing products and some of these other tokens, the SEC has the authority it needs.
00:11:11.106 - 00:11:20.340, Speaker B: But again, that doesn't stretch to spot trading of cryptocurrencies that aren't clearly securities. I think that's what Gensler's been asking.
00:11:21.350 - 00:12:31.900, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, because then that would fall under the purview of the CFTC. And we did see kind of in the middle of some of the contention around this, I did see former Commissioner Brian Quintens tweet something kind of like implying that when appropriate, the CFTC tries to make sure that things will fall in their territory. So in a moment, we're going to discuss more about the lending issue. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

Back to my conversation with Nick Day. So as you mentioned, another area that SEC and in general regulators have been making a lot of noise about is lending.
00:13:14.006 - 00:13:58.998, Speaker A: We're going to just talk about one of these issues to start, a few weeks ago, Coinbase revealed that it's been trying for several months to get the SEC's blessing to launch a Lend product. And at that time, in frustration, the Exchange published a blog post saying the SEC had threatened to sue them if they launched the Lend product. And in a tweet, Storm CEO Brian Armstrong called the SEC's behavior sketchy because he claimed that the SEC would not explain to them why Lend is a security. It would not meet with him. And then this week, Coinbase stated finally it decided not to launch Lend. So why do you think they finally came to that decision and why do you think that they kind of like poked the bear if they weren't even going to launch it?
00:13:59.164 - 00:14:39.942, Speaker B: Honestly, that part is a bit of a mystery to me. I think a lot of people in the industry expected Coinbase to launch anyway and take it to the courts to make a ruling on whether or not it's an actual security. I think one of the issues here is we don't have all the information. The SEC sent a Wells notice to Coinbase and so we have Brian Armstrong's viewpoint from his tweets and we have their chief legal officer Paul Riwal's views from the blog post. But we don't know what the SEC actually said. They haven't published the Wells notice. And so, you know, we know that the SEC cited certain Supreme Court precedents and that's from the blog post.
00:14:39.942 - 00:15:41.750, Speaker B: But the exact specifics of what Coinbase was launching or what the SEC says are the issues are still up, still a bit of a mystery. There's definitely a bit of a question around that. The SEC did apparently point to long standing Supreme Court precedents and it's been a point of contention in the crypto industry for a while that we're looking to the Howie case, which was almost, I think, 70 or 80 years ago and now we're talking about the Reeves case which happened in 1990. There's been definitely a point of contention about using these decades old Supreme Court cases as precedent for an industry that was born less than 15 years ago. But I don't think the SEC has a lot of flexibility there. I think the law has said the SEC has to abide by these and the Supreme Court has know these are the precedents, the SEC must enforce them and they must be uniform about how they enforce them. So if the industry wants to get more clarity or get change here.
00:15:41.750 - 00:15:51.194, Speaker B: They either have to challenge these precedents in court or they have to try and lobby for Congress to pass a new law. And it doesn't seem like either of these is happening right now.
00:15:51.392 - 00:16:20.200, Speaker A: Yeah, I did see in an interview that former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo did with CoinDesk that he kind of suggested that he felt the laws needed updating. But to talk a little bit more about this lending issue, all of this kind of controversy with Coinbase and the SEC is also happening in the context of state regulators going after other crypto lenders such as BlockFi and Celsius. And I was wondering what you felt this said about the overall picture of crypto lending in the US.
00:16:21.530 - 00:17:04.386, Speaker B: Yeah, so those cases are really interesting. We're at five different states filing actions against Blockfind. Three of them also filed against Celsius. And I read the filings and orders, and they all pointed to state securities laws, which are pretty close to federal securities laws. So it's the same basic issue that the SEC would have with Coinbase lend, I think, without, again, knowing the specifics of what Coinbase lend was going to actually do and how the SEC viewed it. But yeah, again, it just kind of comes down to who's the actual regulator. And it seems that we've seen that New Jersey's securities regulator has delayed its enforcement of the BlockFi cease and desist by a couple of months now.
00:17:04.386 - 00:17:53.570, Speaker B: I think they just pushed it back. You know, they're not just trying to say, like, get out, we don't want you. They're saying, okay, well, we're open to a dialogue, but we think that right now you're violating the law and we want to figure out what's going on here. So there's definitely something to be said about possibly updating laws or figuring out what the best regulatory regime is for these products that regulators will be comfortable with and that will still allow companies to launch these kinds of products and not feel overly burdened. But it all kind of seems to stem back to the basic principles of, like, who's the actual regulator? Are these products regulated and are they safe for investors? And if not, what is the appropriate way to respond?
00:17:54.710 - 00:19:13.760, Speaker A: Yeah, so these cases all involve centralized intermediaries. But when it comes to DeFi, I feel like there's kind of this other tension that we're seeing. And for sure, the regulators look like they're setting their sights on DeFi. And to me, the issue that I see is and actually, I got this from a conversation I had with Collins Belton, who is a lawyer in the space, and he was talking about how regulations are based on regulating intermediaries and decentralization aims to remove the intermediaries. And I did notice, actually, when Chair Gensler defined staking for The Washington Post Q A, he defined it in a way that assumes that you're working with an intermediary who's doing the staking for you, which I thought was interesting. But I just wondered, does it look to you like the SEC is going to write regulations that will sort of force the crypto industry to use intermediaries and to not go the decentralized route? Or do you expect that they'll leave some leeway with some openness toward decentralized models, which has been suggested by SEC Commissioner Hester purse with her token safe harbor proposal that would basically give projects that start out centralized to decentralize over time? How do you see this tension playing out?
00:19:15.090 - 00:20:30.630, Speaker B: Yeah, that is definitely a very good question. I think Gensler is he said in the past he's used a lot of this as kind of, I think one McAuley's called a decentralization theater. He said that he doesn't see a lot of these decentralized projects as actually being decentralized and I think know controller Michael Sue at the OCC said something similar the other day. He was giving a speech to a group of crypto companies and said that he sees a lot of these projects as being more centralized or more intermediated than they would otherwise claim. And it feels like that's what they're kind of going for right now is just see and we've seen that they've issued subpoenas reportedly to Uniswap, trying to figure out what exactly is going on with Uniswap and whether or not it's actually decentralized. And so it feels like they're going to try and kind of make this the precedent saying, okay, well, these projects are saying they're decentralized, but really they're controlled by these firms or these labs or these developers and therefore they're not at all decentralized. And how that translates into enforcement action or regulations remains to be seen.
00:20:30.630 - 00:20:46.250, Speaker B: But it doesn't feel like they're going to go after the Unintermediated projects yet, but they are going to say that in their view, these projects are not as decentralized as they claim to be and so they are subject to the SEC's purview.
00:20:47.470 - 00:21:05.714, Speaker A: So next week there is likely to be a number of enforcement actions or other settlements or just other activity in general from the SEC because the end of its fiscal year is September 30. So I was kind of curious what you expect to see from the SEC next week.
00:21:05.912 - 00:21:57.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know anything specific, but there's a rumor that there will be something big happening by the end of the fiscal year. And in the years past we've seen this happen at the end of 2019 fiscal year, we saw the massive Block One settlement and it wouldn't surprise me if there was something like that on the horizon. I don't think it's going to be any of the cases we're following right now. The SEC case against Ripple and the XRP allegations is the big one, but I don't see that settling anytime soon. So I'm not sure what exactly this will be, but you're absolutely right, there will be some kind of case or settlement happening and the SEC is going to know. We just we have this new precedent that is going to give us we're going to use this as our reasoning or our base for when we go after other projects in the future.
00:21:58.310 - 00:22:27.962, Speaker A: Yeah. My personal theory is just reading between the lines of what happened with Coinbase where they refused to meet with them. They refused to explain why they thought it was a security, but then also at the same time, they're inviting companies to come and adopt the SEC. I kind of was like, oh, I wonder if they're working on something big involving lending and they kind of can't say anything about it yet, and that's why they can't talk to Coinbase about this. But anyway, it was just like a thought in my mind. So we'll have to see what actually happens.
00:22:28.016 - 00:22:28.620, Speaker B: Absolutely.

00:23:30.526 - 00:24:19.934, Speaker A: Treasury sanctioned a crypto exchange for the first time. Sux, a cryptocurrency exchange based primarily in Russia, has been sanctioned by the United States Treasury for allegedly facilitating transactions for ransomware attackers. The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, believes that Sux was involved in eight ransomware variants. Furthermore, OFAC alleges that, 40% of known volume on Sux was associated with the addresses linked to bad actors. According to Chainalysis, the blockchain analytics company that helped OFAC in this case, Sux deposit addresses, quote, received over $160,000,000 in bitcoin from ransomware actors, scammers, and darknet market operators. The exchange is now officially listed on Ofax's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, barring U. S.
00:24:19.934 - 00:25:07.258, Speaker A: Residents and businesses from interacting with the firm. The move comes shortly after a Wall Street Journal article last Friday reported Treasury's intent to target crypto ransomware payments with sanctions. Next headline twitter rolls out verified avatars and bitcoin tips according to Decrypt, Twitter began rolling out bitcoin payments features yesterday. Users will have multiple avenues to hand out bitcoin tips for Normies Square's cash app, and GoFundMe will let users send BTC via a more conventional route for hardcore bitcoiners. Twitter will allow users to utilize Strike, a Lightning network based payment app to send tips. Bitcoin tips went live starting Thursday on all iOS devices. In addition to Bitcoin tips, Twitter shared plans to explore NFTs for authentication.
00:25:07.258 - 00:25:46.006, Speaker A: Think blue check marks but for NFTs, said Twitter executive Esther Crawford, quote we're interested in basically making it somehow visually clear that this is an authenticated avatar and then give you some interesting info and insight about the provenance of that NFT. Next headline. Binance is under investigation for insider trading. Bloomberg reported last Friday. That us. Officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are investigating the world's most popular exchange for possible insider trading and market manipulation. According to Bloomberg, the CFTC is looking into whether Binance or its staff took advantage of its customers to generate profit.
00:25:46.006 - 00:26:27.586, Speaker A: Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg says that the CFTC has contacted, quote, potential witnesses as part of its inquiry. For now, Binance is not formally accused of committing any wrongdoing, and it is unclear if the investigation will lead to any actions from the regulator. The exchange is already under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service and Department of justice, as well as the CFTC. Next headline. Robinhood users will soon have crypto wallet capability. Robinhood is planning to roll out its highly anticipated crypto wallet and transfer features starting in October. With Wallets, users will be able to transfer ETH, BTC, Doge and other supported tokens.
00:26:27.586 - 00:27:18.598, Speaker A: Off platform security features like identity verification, multi factor authentication, and email and phone verification will be implemented for storing crypto on Robinhood. According to Christine Brown, chief operating officer at Robinhood Crypto, the trading platform will slowly launch its crypto wallets, with only a small group of customers testing the Alpha program next month. More customers will be able to join later through a waitlist. At publishing time, there are at least 115,000 users on the initial waitlist, which is less than 1% of the 13 million crypto traders on Robinhood. Perhaps the reason for the low waitlist number can be attributed to the fact that Robinhood crypto traders are Dogecoin dominant. In Q, 262 percent of crypto revenue came from Dogecoin trading alone. However, data from Bit info charts shows that Dogecoin is not widely used in actual blockchain transactions.
00:27:18.598 - 00:28:04.626, Speaker A: Despite its popularity in Robinhood, Dogecoin facilitates far fewer daily transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum. For example, on Wednesday, Dogecoin executed 16,000 transactions, while Bitcoin executed 275,000 and Ethereum saw 1.17 million, respectively. It will be interesting to see if Robinhood's new wallet feature will affect such numbers going forward. Next Headline The Evergrande news was not grand for the crypto market as concerns around Evergrande, the heavily indebted Chinese property giant, caught momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with traditional and crypto markets, took a big hit on Monday and Tuesday. Bitcoin dropped to $40,835, while Ethereum dipped below $3,000 for the first time since early August.
00:28:04.626 - 00:28:43.890, Speaker A: According to the Crypt, over $1.2 billion in crypto futures were liquidated in just 24 hours in traditional markets. The Dow Jones industrial average ended Monday, down 600 points the dip was most likely related to negative sentiment regarding Evergrande's balance sheet, which showed over $300 billion in debt, an amount that some analysts believe the company would not be able to pay back. However, on Wednesday, Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, calming the tumultuous market. The total crypto market cap jumped 6% on Wednesday, according to data from Coin market cap. Next headline. Investors are throwing money at NFT platforms.
00:28:43.890 - 00:29:18.826, Speaker A: Two NFT companies dapper Labs and Soware. Disclosure the latter is a sponsor of my show announced raises with valuations in the billions. Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA TOPSHOT and flow blockchain, closed a $250,000,000 funding round, valuing the company at $7.6 billion, nearly tripling its last valuation of $2.6 billion in March of 2021. In addition to the funding round, Dapper also announced a partnership with La Liga, Spain's top soccer league. The deal will be similar to Dapper's collaboration with the NBA via TOPSHOT.
00:29:18.826 - 00:29:58.902, Speaker A: La Liga will have its own marketplace on Dapper's flow blockchain, where NFT moments and highlights with varying degrees of rarity will be bought and sold. The Dapper Labs news comes right on the heels of two similar announcements from So Rare, an Ethereum based NFT fantasy soccer game. On Tuesday, So Rare announced a raise of $680,000,000, valuing the NFT company at $4.3 billion. The latest funding run was led by SoftBank. So Rare also signed an exclusive partnership deal with La Liga to issue NFTs for its players less than two weeks ago. Regarding the overlap between Soware and Dapper, Dapper Lab CEO Roham Garagoslu believes there is room for both platforms.
00:29:58.902 - 00:30:33.526, Speaker A: He told CoinDesk, quote, Companies like Soware can be complementary to us, adding they're much more focused on fantasy, while video is very important to us and sets us apart. In related news, the ties between sports and crypto continue to grow stronger.
