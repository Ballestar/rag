00:00:00.330 - 00:00:36.118, Speaker A: Look, I do respect having some governance level innovation. I think that's something that has been underexplored. But I just think all these ideas are not where it's at. I don't want to go on too much of a rant about the last piece, which is, as you were mentioning, the sort of the tokens all being under Kanto as opposed to having their own kind of native applications. But to me, it's just sort of the block chain playing favorites and deciding that these applications are enshrined in the blockchain. They're sort of nationalized, quote, unquote. It's kind of like this blockchain level industrial policy, which implies that it's like, okay, we're done.
00:00:36.118 - 00:00:55.420, Speaker A: We're done with DEXes. We found the right one. It's this. And nobody better try out innovating us because we're going to support this at the protocol level. Same thing with lending protocols, right? If anybody comes up with any more innovation around lending protocols, fuck you. We already figured it out. We know this is the one that we want and what else is there to do? Like, we already have the end result.
