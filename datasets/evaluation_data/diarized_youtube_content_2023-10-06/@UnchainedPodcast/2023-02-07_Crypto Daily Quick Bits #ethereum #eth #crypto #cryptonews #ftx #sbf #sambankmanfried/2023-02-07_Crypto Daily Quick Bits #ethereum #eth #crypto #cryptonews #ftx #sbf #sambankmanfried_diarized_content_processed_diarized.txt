00:00:00.330 - 00:00:59.130, Speaker A: Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis and its parent company, Digital Currency Group, have agreed on a way forward. DCG has reportedly begun to dispose of its stake in various investment funds run by its subsidiary Grayscale, which manages GBTC at a significant discount. Yuga Labs reached a settlement with Thomas Lehman, a developer who assisted Ryder Rips in creating the smart contract for the Rrba C project, in a trademark infringement lawsuit. John Ray II, who was appointed as the replacement CEO for the failed crypto exchange FTX after Sam Bankman Fried was accused of fraud, charged the exchange $690,000 for his first few weeks of work. A Delaware bankruptcy court judge decided to let lawyers negotiate a mutually agreed solution. Instead of ruling on an examiner's appointment in the bankruptcy case of FTX, the legal team for Bankman Fried and prosecutors reached a deal to modify the terms of the FTX's founder's bail, which restricts his use of electronic communication.
