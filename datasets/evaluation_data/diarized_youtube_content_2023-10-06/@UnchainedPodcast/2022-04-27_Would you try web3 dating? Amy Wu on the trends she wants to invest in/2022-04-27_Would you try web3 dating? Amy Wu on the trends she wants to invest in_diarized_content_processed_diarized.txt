00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.150, Speaker A: The intersection of Web Three and dating apps. How do people incentivize maybe, like, friends introducing their friends dates, utilizing tokens in some way? That would be super interesting. But how would you incorporate that? Maybe you can get rewarded more tokens if you introduce a friend to a date where they go on a third date or something like that. Right. You're incentivizing great dates referrals. I'm just throwing that idea out there. Yeah.
00:00:32.150 - 00:00:51.018, Speaker A: Or you get like ten times the amount of tokens if they actually get married. Oh my God. Yeah, or like 100 times. Right. That's priceless. I actually know some people who are extremely good at this and have set up multiple couples. Yeah.
00:00:51.018 - 00:01:18.978, Speaker A: So then it's like, you get cred. You are a hyper connector of people on dates and high quality dates, and so therefore, maybe you have a higher score, and so you get dropped, like more valuable NFTs or something like that. I don't know. There's a lot of different ways to potentially get that. I think I had tweeted about this once and then people were like, no, this sounds like it's a terrible idea. Honestly, I would love to see this in practice.
