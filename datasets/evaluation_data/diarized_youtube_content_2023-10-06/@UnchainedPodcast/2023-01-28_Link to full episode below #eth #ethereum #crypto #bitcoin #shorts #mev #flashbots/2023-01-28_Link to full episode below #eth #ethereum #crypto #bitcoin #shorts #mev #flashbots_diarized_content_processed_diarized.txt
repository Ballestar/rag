00:00:00.250 - 00:00:36.680, Speaker A: We're basically seeing one of the largest corporate frauds of the last couple decades play out. And anytime that you have something that's that catastrophic, you just get all sorts of vultures coming out trying to capitalize on that process. And I don't know enough to be able to tell whether Sullivan and Cromwell is there. There certainly seems to be a lot of smoke. I don't know how to evaluate the fire. It's kind of an education for all of us just to see when things go this fucking wrong, what happens, and how many other things also go wrong downstream. That kind of feels like the story that we're all going to learn from this.
00:00:37.610 - 00:00:42.022, Speaker B: I bet you the same thing was true with a lot of the other cases. Like made off.
00:00:42.076 - 00:00:42.566, Speaker A: Oh, absolutely.
00:00:42.668 - 00:00:52.860, Speaker B: Whatever. I'm sure that there was some over, right? Like if you watch the madeoff thing, there are tons of people who are like, oh, the process screwed us because the trustee took too much money. Whatever. Right.
