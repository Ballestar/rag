They said, hey, we think you're violating the CEA, and we need to talk. A Wells notice. Essentially, we had kind of two weeks to put together a letter to kind of respond to their allegations. If we were able to kind of swatch their concerns, perhaps they wouldn't recommend moving forward with an enforcement action.
00:00:35.350 - 00:00:45.060, Speaker A: But typically a Wells notice is putting you on notice that we're thinking about recommending an enforcement action against you. And we weren't exactly sure why at the time.
