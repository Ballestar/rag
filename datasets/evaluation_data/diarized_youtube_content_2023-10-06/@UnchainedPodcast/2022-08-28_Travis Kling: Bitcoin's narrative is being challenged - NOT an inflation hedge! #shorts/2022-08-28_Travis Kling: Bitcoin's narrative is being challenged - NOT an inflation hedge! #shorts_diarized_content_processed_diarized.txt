And there's a lot less uncertainty around it, and it's just gotten a lot bigger. And you had DeFi and then you had NFTs and gaming, you've got multiple use cases that are happening on layer one smart contract platforms, and you juxtapose that against BTC's narrative, which is as challenged as I've seen it in the five years that I've been paying attention to this. BTC did not really act as a CPI. Inflation never.
