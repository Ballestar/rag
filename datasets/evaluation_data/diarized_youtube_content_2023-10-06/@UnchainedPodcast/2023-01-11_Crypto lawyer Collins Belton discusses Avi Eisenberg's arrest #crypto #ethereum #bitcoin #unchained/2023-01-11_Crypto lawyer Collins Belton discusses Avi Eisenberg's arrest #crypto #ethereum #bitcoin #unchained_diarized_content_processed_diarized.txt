00:00:00.250 - 00:00:45.698, Speaker A: People that hold the tokens are going to be making these same types of decisions if this type of liability regime applies because they're going to know, hey, hold on. Maybe we should or should not allow something like this to occur if the government is going to be able to show up in two years and say, hey, 63% of you who voted for this are liable for the other 37%. So the entire dynamics of how Dows will work I think, are upended by this. And yeah, it's a good example of an implication know might seem very limited, but it won't be. Just like people are already starting to change and order their behavior in response to the UK Dao complaint despite there not even being a resolution yet. The same thing would start to occur here if it really was the case that these DAOs are not just operators, but suddenly individual members or collectives could be liable for these things. The entire system would be upended.
00:00:45.698 - 00:00:59.340, Speaker A: And I think you'd see a lot more anonymous participation, you'd see a lot more student participation, offshore participation. And I think Gary or CFTC is listening to this and they're like, yeah, that's what we want. I think they should really consider if that's what they actually want.
