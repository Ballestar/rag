00:00:00.170 - 00:00:53.386, Speaker A: Spencer Noon. No offense to Spencer, I've never met him in person, but he's a variant fund and he tweeted something like oh, when artists songs are streamed, they shouldn't make any money because the song is effectively an advertisement for their work. And I was know, I was like, do you know any musicians? Because musicians, they are much more likely to say should earn so much more for my streams. They're more likely to complain about the fact that they kind of have tour to make enough money. It's like the actual work they do doesn't make enough, so they have to do this additional thing on top to actually make the like. And I was surprised know Jesse Walden is part of Variant Fund, and I was a little bit like, I feel like Jesse definitely knows musicians, so you guys should have talked to some to understand what their world is like from a business perspective. And then I was surprised.
00:00:53.386 - 00:00:59.500, Speaker A: Like Kyle Simone beck Spencer knew enough. And I was like I just tweeted back at them I was like, you guys must not know any.
