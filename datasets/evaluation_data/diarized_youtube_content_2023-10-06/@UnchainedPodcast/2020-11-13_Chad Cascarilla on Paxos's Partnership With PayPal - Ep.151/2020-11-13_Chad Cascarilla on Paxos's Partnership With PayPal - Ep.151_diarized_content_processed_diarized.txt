00:00:52.930 - 00:00:55.470, Speaker B: Hi, great to be here. Thanks for having me, Laura.
00:00:55.890 - 00:01:14.238, Speaker A: So today being Thursday, not the day this comes out, it was announced that all PayPal users can now buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies. And your company, Paxos, is its partner, enabling this service behind the scenes. Congratulations. What exactly is Paxos doing with PayPal?
00:01:14.414 - 00:02:22.730, Speaker B: Yeah, this is very exciting partnership for both ourselves and I think for really the entire crypto ecosystem. And so we are offering a crypto brokerage service and what this allows is anybody really to come in and have a turnkey solution to be able to offer crypto to their customers. And so very specifically in the case of PayPal, we're operating in the background as the custodian and the liquidity provider for them to be able to offer crypto to their US customers. And those crypto services are bitcoin ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin. And we actually offer a very similar service for revolut amongst others. And so this is something that we're increasingly seeing many different firms start to take up, which is how can we offer crypto to our customers, how can we do it in a trustworthy way, how can we do it very quickly? And that way we can have a deeper relationship with our customers, we can acquire new customers and really we can be part of this ecosystem which I think is very exciting and very dynamic and which has historically been kind of just an early adopter ecosystem. And I think it's really going through a phase shift now.
00:02:22.730 - 00:02:29.770, Speaker B: And I think that's what we're doing with PayPal and what I think we're going to do more broadly for the whole ecosystem.
00:02:30.350 - 00:02:37.182, Speaker A: And so how does a small company like Paxos convince a more than 200 billion dollar company like PayPal to partner with it?
00:02:37.316 - 00:03:34.874, Speaker B: Yes, well, that is, I think, a great question because we've spent probably the last seven or eight years positioning ourselves exactly for this type of partnership. And so we have really positioned ourselves as financial market infrastructure. And so that means really in more common terms, a regulated platform. And a regulated platform is something that maybe isn't as needed in the early stages of an industry's development because you tend to have full stack solutions that are offered. On the other hand, as you become more mature as an industry, you need platforms where people don't have to build everything themselves, where they can come in and they can leverage other people's know how and technology. And that's what we've done. And so ultimately as a regulated platform, we've built a regulatory stack and that includes being the first company to be approved as a trust company in the state of New York to operate in crypto and blockchain.
00:03:34.874 - 00:04:02.934, Speaker B: And that was in May of 2015. Started working on that in 2012, some time ago, really very early days, there wasn't even ethereum at the time. We started working on the trust company. And the reason we did that is because we believed that not just crypto, but crypto and blockchain would be able to transform financial services and that you would need an infrastructural layer. And so we built a trust company and we were the first one. We predated the Bit license, that's how long ago this was. And then we went and got a number of other firsts.
00:04:02.934 - 00:04:37.090, Speaker B: So we built, give an example, we have access to the Federal Reserve National Settlement System. We're a full member of Swift, we have a no action letter from the SEC. So we have all of these things and we have plus more and more. And we are first and all of these things and doing that really set us up because we were asking for permission, not for forgiveness. And also because we set ourselves up as infrastructure. We're not trying to go acquire 20 or 30 or 50 million retail customers, we're not even really trying to acquire end institutional customers. Our goal is to be a B to B or a B to B to C company.
00:04:37.090 - 00:04:47.160, Speaker B: And so that's exactly what firms need, who want to be able to come in, have an infrastructure provider that they can rely on, that they can trust, but also one that's not going to compete with them.
00:04:47.930 - 00:05:11.070, Speaker A: Yeah, I do remember interviewing you in 2015 about that New York State Trust charter and at the time understanding it was significant in some respects, but also not understanding why it would be useful. So you briefly mentioned the Paxos crypto brokerage, which is that service that you talked about. Can you just describe how it works on the back end?
00:05:11.220 - 00:05:33.810, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I do remember that 2015 conversation. It's amazing that it's already been five years. It feels like it was yesterday, five and a half years. And in some ways we were ahead of our time a little bit. But we really believe that crypto and blockchain, and we still believe it, are going to change the financial system, that they're going to replatform the financial system. And that doesn't mean you don't need regulation.
00:05:33.810 - 00:06:06.606, Speaker B: And so that's always been our thesis. You need to be regulated in order to be able to create a trustworthy ecosystem. But at the same time there's a moment in time when that becomes really relevant. And I think that's when there's this phase shift from early adopter to mainstream, which I think is exactly what we're undergoing right now. So it's just an exciting moment for us to be a part of that because ultimately I think that's what got us all excited about crypto and blockchain. Wow, you could actually change everything. And it wasn't meant to just be a small community, want to be something that's very big.
00:06:06.606 - 00:06:10.818, Speaker B: And I think that's the moment we have right now. So that's something we're proud to be.
00:06:10.824 - 00:06:14.994, Speaker A: A part of for the brokerage, how it works on the back end.
00:06:15.112 - 00:06:51.610, Speaker B: Yeah, so the way we have the crypto brokerage work is it's API based, so anyone can come in and they can plug their systems into ours. We offer custodial services, we offer liquidity services so they can buy and sell their crypto on behalf of their customers or their customers can directly. And you can integrate with us in actually a couple different ways. And we allow you to basically choose your own adventure with the APIs. And we did this deliberately. So we have some customers where they might not have licenses to be able to operate in the US. They can have their customers actually be housed and sit within Paxos.
00:06:51.610 - 00:07:27.110, Speaker B: And this would be what we call a third party integration. And so we have customers, they sit inside of us. Now the partner, their customers don't know that they're actually sitting inside Paxos unless you read the fine print, you would know if you looked. But they're able to keep that end relationship. And so we're providing them with a regulatory umbrella as well as the custodial and liquidity benefits. And then you have other customers where they're highly regulated. An example would be PayPal, but they are actually housing their conditional bit license inside Paxos.
00:07:27.110 - 00:08:04.754, Speaker B: And so that was part of the press release. And so we're really proud that was the first conditional bit license that was created. It's what you need to be able to operate in the state of New York if you're not a bank. And so they were able to receive a conditional bit license and we provided the regulatory umbrella for that to be able to be housed. And again, we're providing custodial and liquidity services to them. Now of course you could have a bank that would come in and they wouldn't necessarily need any of our regulatory umbrella to operate at all, but they would still want a regulated custodian and they still want a safe liquidity pool. And so that's really what we're bringing here is different models for different types of firms.
00:08:04.754 - 00:08:25.230, Speaker B: You could be a fintech, you could be a technology company, you could be a bank, you could be a broker. And we have different ways of being able to allow you to integrate seamlessly, turnkey way, turn on, buy, sell, hold, send, and receive as you would like. You can kind of choose that part of the adventure too. But we're making this really easy and really seamless.
00:08:26.130 - 00:08:38.370, Speaker A: And so PayPal has started with bitcoin ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin. Are those cryptocurrencies that PayPal selected, or are those simply what is available through Pax's Crypto brokerage?
00:08:38.710 - 00:09:03.862, Speaker B: Well, they're actually overlapping Ven diagrams. That's what they were looking for. That's what we had. We actually have authority to be able to custody and trade additional tokens. And in fact, we have PAX gold, which is one of our tokens. We have PAX dollars. So there are other products that we have that weren't included in the crypto brokerage launch.
00:09:03.862 - 00:09:47.110, Speaker B: But in terms of pure cryptocurrencies, those are the four that we have that we're listing on both our exchange and really providing constant custody for. So we're going to expand those as our customers need more product. But ultimately we want to be customer driven. And there's a lot of questions as you start to get outside of those four or maybe a handful of others about whether there's securities or not. And I think that's always something that maybe creates a little bit of hesitation. For instance, bitcoin, bitcoin cash as a result, and Litecoin, which are very similar, and then Ethereum, have essentially been grandfathered in by the SEC. Bitcoin explicitly, and Ethereum explicitly.
00:09:47.110 - 00:10:03.920, Speaker B: And once you start getting out away from these top four, there's always a little bit of questions around them, and not just for us, but just the industry in general. And so that's something I think we just need to be sensitive about.
00:10:04.530 - 00:10:23.074, Speaker A: In a moment, we'll discuss more about the regulations surrounding this. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn, and spend crypto all in one place. Earn up to 8.5% per year on your BTC. Download the Crypto.com
00:10:23.074 - 00:10:59.838, Speaker A: app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on BTC and more than 20 other coins. Once in the app, you can apply for the Crypto.com Metal card, which pays you up to 8% cash back instantly. Reserve years now in the Crypto.com app. Back to my conversation with Chad Cascarilla. So earlier we were discussing which cryptocurrencies you guys offer, and the New York Department of Financial Services has other cryptocurrencies that it has whitelisted in particular, something like Zcash for Gemini or not just for Gemini, but this is how Gemini has listed that.
00:10:59.838 - 00:11:11.106, Speaker A: So would the assets on that list be the ones perhaps that would be up for discussion to be listed on PayPal or through the Paxos crypto brokerage service?
00:11:11.288 - 00:11:55.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so they have that whitelisting, or I guess I think they call it a green listing list. And so a couple of our tokens are on know, our gold token, our dollar token, the Gemini dollar tokens on there. And then there's really, I guess, ripple that can be custodied but not necessarily traded. And then I think there's just a handful of others. And so those are certainly very logical ones for us to list, really, that's up to PayPal whether or not they want to offer them to their customers. But partly what we want to do is be customer driven about what we add into place. When you start looking at liquidity outside of the top four or five, and certainly outside the top ten, they are almost trading by appointment.
00:11:55.942 - 00:12:30.090, Speaker B: They're quite illiquid and relatively small cap. And so there's the old 80 20 rule. It applies to these traded assets just as much as it does to anything else. And so while there's lots of tokens, 80% of the trading is happening in the top 20%, or probably in this case, the top four tokens. And so I think everyone's always looking at, is this worth adding into place? Could this create more confusion? How safe is this as a general product offering for customers? So those are all the considerations that come into place and not just the regulatory approval.
00:12:30.670 - 00:12:40.478, Speaker A: And so you mentioned the liquidity issue. I'm assuming that the brokerage will source liquidity across multiple exchanges around the world. Is that how that works?
00:12:40.644 - 00:13:21.370, Speaker B: Well, we mainly source liquidity from our own exchange at the moment, but we do use external liquidity providers now we're integrating with more. And so our viewpoint is we want liquidity to be as safe as possible. And part of being safe is a couple of different things. The first is, do you have an ability to know the liquidity pool is clean, so is it regulatorily clean? And then secondly, do you have an ability to know who your counterparties are so there's no counterparty risk? And so these are really important and really relevant in terms of making sure that you're not just providing liquidity, but you're providing the right kind of liquidity.
00:13:21.870 - 00:13:36.530, Speaker A: So I have to say I'm a little bit surprised because yesterday I did look at the Itbit volume and for BTC, it was $18 million in volume yesterday and it was 70 eigth in the world by volume. So it didn't seem like a super large marketplace.
00:13:37.030 - 00:14:02.842, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think there's a couple of components to that. First is we're just a dollar US. Dollar marketplace, so it's not trading against tether. So I think you kind of normalize against exchanges where they're calling it dollar, but it's really a tether pair. And when you look at it like that, I think our volume is really not too much different from some of the other US based marketplaces. But secondly, it's also about the tightness of the spreads. And so that's what's really important.
00:14:02.842 - 00:15:10.480, Speaker B: So there's volume and then there's also tightness of the spreads. And so we have all the largest market makers are trading on our exchange, offering really great prices, and we're able to trade away to other liquidity providers when needed. And so that's an important function as well. And I think that'll get bigger and bigger over time. One of the key risks for us when you trade away is could you have counterparty risk, could that counterparty fail, how do you fund the trade? Do we have to send our assets out and then they send us the payment? So you have to work through a lot of the logistics, which hopefully Blockchain, by the way, should be solving ironically. But there is this concept of replacement risk in case someone fails when you agree to a trade. And then there's counterparty risk, which is, is someone going to fail when they send you the assets before you've received them? And so there's this real question around those and I think the industry is coming up with some good solutions, side chains, other things, but it makes it a little bit difficult to feel really safe trading at a lot of venues because you're inherently taking that counterparty risk when you use them.
00:15:11.170 - 00:15:51.774, Speaker A: Yeah, although I guess you could also argue that you're spreading the risk out in case if there's issues with any one exchange. But anyway, I actually just also wanted to ask something a little bit which I think I could probably assume the answer, but here we are with PayPal offering this now to its 346,000,000 active accounts. And as we all know, the two most popular blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are seeing a volume of transactions that on many days will near the cap, sometimes causing delays or fees. So are you just kind of batching all the transactions to manage that issue?
00:15:51.972 - 00:16:50.250, Speaker B: Well, there's a couple of components to know. PayPal is just launching in the US, so it's just for their US customers. But secondly, we are just batching when we're sending externally and so that's market makers or others. But what PayPal is really doing is they're holding their crypto inside Paxos as custodian and they're sourcing liquidity inside Paxos. And so that means a lot of those activities don't have to move through the on chain issues that you're and so now, at the end of the day, there's a knock on effect. Because when there's lots of volume, the industry does a very good job of using market makers to kind of cross balance across all these different institutions to be able to source liquidity. So inevitably there is going to be some component of on chain fees creating friction.
00:16:50.250 - 00:17:10.760, Speaker B: And that friction will show up in execution prices no matter what, because it has to come from somewhere. And the same with the dollars. And so I think we get around that clogging of the network because essentially you're just seeing the institutional batching of those movements because they're the one who are providing liquidity to the retail players on our platform.
00:17:11.850 - 00:17:28.486, Speaker A: And Paxos also has the white label stablecoin business which has enabled it to power the Huobi dollar. And Binance USD is PayPal? Or is Paxos crypto brokerage working on adding stablecoins, or are you working on even creating one specific to PayPal?
00:17:28.678 - 00:18:16.166, Speaker B: Well, from our crypto brokerage perspective, we can absolutely add in any of our stablecoins to a customer if they would like them. And certainly that's something that PayPal might want to do. I can't really speak for where they want to go with their product roadmap, but we're obviously a very logical player to offer that type of product because we're the only one who's done a white label stablecoin. We have regulated stablecoins and the only other one is Gemini. And so we've really spent a long time making sure that we have a primary regulator. We went through that at the beginning of the conversation about creating the trust, and that's what's enabled us to now create regulated tokens and that's what's unique. Our dollar tokens that we've issued for ourselves or for our partners are regulated and so is our gold token.
00:18:16.166 - 00:18:31.840, Speaker B: And so not only are we regulated, the tokens are regulated. That puts it at a whole different standard. And so we're happy to launch them for anybody who's interested in creating one and really being able to drive community engagement and I think some really significant customer acquisition benefits.
00:18:33.250 - 00:18:50.950, Speaker A: Part of Paxos's partnership with PayPal is to offer custody of the crypto assets. And after the news about PayPal offering crypto buying and selling broke, bloomberg reported that PayPal was in talks to buy crypto custodian bico. How would such an acquisition work in conjunction with the custody service that Paxos already provides?
00:18:51.290 - 00:19:29.758, Speaker B: Well, lots of things get reported in the press. It's hard to know exactly what will end up being materialized, but I think what's clear is the space is growing. People want to be able to have in house capabilities. You also want to be able to rely on partners. No one would want a single point of failure. And we think that we're providing a great service that everyone can rely upon, but people have different strategies and there's different capabilities and different things they want to do. Our crypto brokerage product isn't cover all facets of the crypto markets.
00:19:29.758 - 00:19:46.680, Speaker B: It's not designed to. And so there's reasons why I think firms over time will think about what should we build, what should we buy, who do we partner with? And we're definitely going to be in, I think, most of those conversations, but at the same time, we're not trying to be all things to all people.
00:19:47.530 - 00:20:02.730, Speaker A: And in addition to the brokerage and exchange, paxos also has a blockchain based equity settlement platform that received a no action letter from the SEC. It launched with Credit Suisse and Society General. How is this business going and will you be adding new financial institutions?
00:20:02.890 - 00:20:49.062, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's been going great. We have Instinet Nomora, we have Sockgen, we have Credit Suisse, and we have another couple of firms that have agreed to join up, including one that will be going live shortly. So that'll be an exciting announcement for us. I promise to maybe talk to you a little more about that when the news comes out. But then we have quite a great pipeline behind that. And what's interesting about settling tokenized equities is whether they're public or private, is that it really solves a really big problem around capital that's tied up operating costs that exist in the system, but also it creates more access and it creates new types of products that are possible. And that's the whole point of blockchain, is that you're really upgrading assets to be on a blockchain rail.
00:20:49.062 - 00:21:13.934, Speaker B: And sometimes they might be private chains. I think over time, they'll probably end up all on public chains personally over time. But there's lots of steps in the journey. But putting assets into blockchain rails changed fundamentally how the financial system will work. And the equities markets are the biggest part of the financial system. They're $45 trillion of market cap. It's almost bewildering how big it is for crypto.
00:21:13.934 - 00:21:53.966, Speaker B: As exciting as it is, it's only $350,000,000,000 of market cap, right? So it's less than 1% the size of the US. Equity markets. And can you imagine the size of the global equity markets? I think it's something like $100 trillion. So there's so much opportunity to change the financial system. And that's part of what we're trying to do, is be a multi asset custodian that holds assets whether to crypto, cash, securities, commodities, and upgrades them and puts them onto blockchain rails to move around and so on. In terms of equities, we've settled over 16,000 trades. We've been offering the no Action Letter, which is deliberately meant to be limited in size and scope, allows us to be live and to learn lessons.
00:21:53.966 - 00:22:30.214, Speaker B: And we'll be filing a clearing agency registration hopefully shortly, in which we will seek approval from the SEC to be a clearing agent. We would be one of really three clearing agents in the country the DTC, the OCC, which is the Options Clearing Corp. And ourselves. This will be a really huge accomplishment for us in the industry because you'll now have a piece of regulatory infrastructure that can now move securities in a highly regulated way, but do it in a blockchain based system. I think that'll be really seminal.
00:22:30.342 - 00:22:41.280, Speaker A: And then would that be something that you would only use with this product, or is that something that could open you up to taking on other customers in other ways?
00:22:41.650 - 00:23:08.950, Speaker B: Oh, definitely. A clearing agent is very powerful regulatory umbrella. And so initially, we'll be starting with just US. Equities, but there's no reason why that can expand to a whole variety of other types of securities. Corporate bonds are a good example of them and others. And so the markets are very large. There's so much opportunity in what I would call traditional financial services to change how these assets move.
00:23:08.950 - 00:23:49.240, Speaker B: And so we're trying to start actually very specifically, we're doing US equities, but just broker to broker trades. There is an enormous world out there of client side trades where you're allocating them to the underlying funds securities lending trades, repo trades to help do funding, triparty ETF movements, corporate bonds, you kind of go on and on and on. The markets are just enormous. I mean, it's a ten or 15 year journey to address all of those parts of it, but in order to even get started on that journey, you actually have to be regulatorily approved. And so that's a key component of what we're doing.
00:23:50.090 - 00:23:57.462, Speaker A: All right, well, it'll be exciting to see how everything shakes out. And congratulations again on the PayPal deal.
00:23:57.596 - 00:24:00.570, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Exciting times here. It's great to be with you.

00:24:04.496 - 00:24:57.030, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is a weekly news recap. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline ethereum chain accidentally splits in two on Wednesday, what seemed to be a significant issue with Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura turned out to be the result of a bug in the Ethereum code that split the network's transaction history in two. The turmoil began when a major service outage struck infura around 08:00, a.m. Coordinated universal time, prompting some exchanges, including Finance, to halt ETH and ERC 20 token withdrawals temporarily. As it turns out, the bug was actually intentionally triggered. Optimism Cofounder and CEO Zheng LAN Wang tweeted an apology Wednesday evening, explaining that the Optimism team had noticed the bug.
00:24:57.030 - 00:25:54.138, Speaker A: But after seeing that almost all nodes had upgraded to the fix, they, quote, decided to test the bug and see what would happen. This was boneheaded in hindsight, she wrote. The outage's actual cause was a bug in the Go Ethereum client, which is used by 80% of Ethereum applications. A chain split appears to have been triggered by the consensus bug Ethereum developers had quietly patched a year ago in the Geth V One Nine release. Geth team lead Peter Salegi posted in a blog that the team didn't warn people that this fixed a consensus bug because, quote, in the case of Ethereum, it takes a lot of time, weeks, months, to get node operators to update even to a scheduled hard fork. Highlighting that a release contains important consensus or denial of service fixes always runs the risk of someone trying to beat updaters to the punchline and taking the network down. Others called for increased transparency from Ethereum devs.
00:25:54.138 - 00:27:14.502, Speaker A: Nikita Javarankov, leader developer At Blockchain, argued that the event constituted a consensus failure that could be, quote, the most serious issue Ethereum has faced since the Dao debacle four years ago. Infuria and other service providers affected by the chain split have since fixed the issue by updating their nodes with inferior, posting a postmortem on its blog. The price of ETH itself was not affected at all by the Snafu Next headline bitcoin price roundup for the first time in three years, bitcoin surpassed $16,000 after a week of consolidating between fourteen K and sixteen K, bitcoin is now up 123% this year. Billionaire hedge fund investor Stanley Druckenmiller revealed that bitcoin is a part of his portfolio. Anticipating a three to four year decline in the dollar, Druckenmiller said, quote, frankly, if the gold bet works, the bitcoin bet will probably work better because it's thinner, more illiquid, and has a lot more beta to it. Bridgewater Associates founder and co chairman Ray Dalio said this week that should bitcoin become, quote, material, he could foresee a time when governments would move to outlaw it. I have a feeling that if that were to happen, PayPal, Fidelity Square and other big companies would probably have something to say about that.
00:27:14.502 - 00:28:15.898, Speaker A: Bloomberg's senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone says bitcoin may break 20,000 in 2021, adding to his previous projection that bitcoin could then experience a parabolic year.

Even as Bitcoin continues to be the primary crypto asset custody by large financial institutions, bitcoin looks more like a grassroots movement in terms of wealth inequality. The first metric, supply equality ratio, is the ratio of the poorest accounts, the sum held by all accounts with a balance less than 0.1% of the supply against the richest accounts, which is the total held by all the top 1% of addresses compared to other crypto assets. Bitcoin's supply equality ratio is much higher at 0.8

He starts with a real life example of someone who wanted to go backstage at a concert to meet the band. I understand this feeling and so updated its Wikipedia page to say he was a family member right before he approached the security guards. Then Sam walks through several examples of how price oracles have malfunctioned or been manipulated, starting with the time a broken Korean wan price oracle on synthetics enabled a trading bot to make off with $1 billion, which I've discussed with Kane Warwicks of Synthetics on unchained. You should definitely check out that interview if you haven't already. Other examples Sam gives are people manipulating prices on uniswap, where prices are constantly fluctuating. He says, quote, Trying to read that price accurately is like reading the weight on a scale before it's finished settling.
