00:00:00.170 - 00:00:38.978, Speaker A: It turns out that Signature Bank has lived up to its name by doing one of the signature things banks do and totally collapsing. But then again, who hasn't this week? First we had Silvergate Bank go down the so called Silvergate Gate, then Silicon Valley Bank, which is almost an oxymoron. Then on Sunday, the US. Treasury and the Federal Reserve announced that Signature Bank was being shut down due to systemic risk. Anytime the government steps in to fix something, it's always was like, okay, so you can do things like the fact that I waited 48 minutes for the F train last night. That was a choice. The collapse inspired a panic that caused stablecoins like USDC to depeg from one dollar to eighty five cents.
00:00:38.978 - 00:00:58.700, Speaker A: Is that necessarily the most relevant piece of information for this story? No. But will I ever miss a chance to use the word DPEG? Crypto is basically unbanked right now, and their goal was to bank the unbanked. So now we have to ask the question who will bank the unbanked? Bankers of the unbanked. And is this a start to a Dr. Seuss book?
