00:00:46.030 - 00:00:51.802, Speaker B: Today's guest is Gregory Peppin, deputy CEO at Deltech Bank and Trust. Welcome, Gregory.
00:00:51.946 - 00:00:52.640, Speaker C: Hi.
00:00:53.090 - 00:01:09.534, Speaker A: Last weekend, a medium post by a pseudonymous former bitcoin investor going by the name Crypto Anonymous made the rounds on crypto, Twitter and elsewhere. It was titled the Bit Short Inside Crypto's Doomsday Machine.
00:01:09.662 - 00:01:14.226, Speaker B: And it alleged that the stablecoin tether, which is supposed to be backed one.
00:01:14.248 - 00:01:15.122, Speaker A: To one by US.
00:01:15.176 - 00:01:19.350, Speaker B: Dollars, is a, quote, highly probable fraud.
00:01:20.010 - 00:01:24.710, Speaker A: There were a lot of different strands that Crypto Anonymous wove together to present.
00:01:24.780 - 00:01:26.966, Speaker B: His or her hypothesis, but the one.
00:01:26.988 - 00:01:29.286, Speaker A: That most people zoomed in on concerned.
00:01:29.318 - 00:01:31.478, Speaker B: Whether or not tether is fully backed.
00:01:31.654 - 00:01:53.162, Speaker A: So tether is run by Tether Limited, and Tether Limited's bank is Deltec, which is where you work, and that's a bank based in the Bahamas. And the part of the piece that people were concerned with was a section where Crypto Anonymous showed some tables of the foreign liabilities of domestic banks.
00:01:53.306 - 00:01:55.454, Speaker B: And he or she wrote, quote, from.
00:01:55.492 - 00:01:58.514, Speaker A: January 2020 to September 2020, the amount.
00:01:58.552 - 00:02:00.546, Speaker B: Of all foreign currencies had by all.
00:02:00.568 - 00:02:15.782, Speaker A: The domestic banks in the Bahamas increased only by $600 million, going from 4.7 billion to 5.3 billion. And so the Bahamian dollar is pegged to the US dollar 101. So it's the same in US.
00:02:15.836 - 00:02:21.398, Speaker B: Dollars then he or she wrote, but during the same period, total issued tethers.
00:02:21.494 - 00:02:25.722, Speaker A: Increased by almost 5.4 billion, going from.
00:02:25.776 - 00:02:32.350, Speaker B: 4.6 billion to 10 billion. So Greg, can you explain why this discrepancy exists?
00:02:32.690 - 00:03:21.274, Speaker C: Well, I've seen that article, actually, and I find very interesting that there's someone that apparently have time perfectly buying and selling crypto. It's actually often the case in those article of so called expert. They usually have timed the market like geniuses and then start to claim things that are kind of unbacked, especially in that case they went to that, I think it's the Digest or central bank of the Bahamas and they became overnight banker expert, which I love that because we always look to recruit. But in that case, they didn't dig a little bit further about how that report works. First of all, they should have known that the Bahamas is what they call an offshore jurisdictions. So what you mean by an offshore jurisdiction is you have domestic bank and international banks. In the domestic bank, there is two type of license linked to it.
00:03:21.274 - 00:04:01.918, Speaker C: You have what they call the authorized dealer license and the authorized agent license. Deltec do own an authorized agent license, which is a license that allow them to custody Bahamian dollars. However, we don't have what we call an authorized dealer license. So when it comes to cash and deposit, we cannot hold any Bahamian dollars, cash and deposit, and at the same time, because we cannot hold those dollars, Bahamian dollars, we cannot serve local customers. So what we have is we have along with that authorized agent license, we have an international bank license, or I think it's called restricted license as well. So in fact, for that report, and I'm sorry for that person because I guess he thought he was onto something. We are not a domestic bank for the report of deposit.
00:04:01.918 - 00:04:43.174, Speaker C: And actually, if he went and took the little effort to go and dig a little bit about the size of the Bahamian market of banking, he would have found out that the entire mass of banks have around $200 billion in asset, I believe. And we are part of that. So we are not a domestic bank, aside of that authorized agent license, but that is an irrelevant business for us and that maybe not much must be reported. We are an international bank and that is part of the international bank aspect. That's why I did answer to some people asking us, but you are domestic. We say no, because we cannot take domestic customer and we cannot hold domestic behaviors. So that report is actually not relevant and nothing to be seen there.
00:04:43.174 - 00:04:55.098, Speaker C: And actually so that I can complete. Okay, yeah, every tether is backed by a reserve. Their reserve is fully backed and more than what is in circulation, we can see it firsthand. So I can confirm you.
00:04:55.264 - 00:05:04.906, Speaker A: Ah, okay, interesting. So then are all the dollars that back tethers held by Delta, the reserve.
00:05:04.938 - 00:05:51.798, Speaker C: Like I said, all the tether in circulation, they have the reserve matching that and more probably. But they have the reserve and there is no secret. And when you look at the article, the reserve, like the entire reserve is there. They have sufficient held by Deltec, held by Deltec and probably other institution. But to go back to explain a little bit about the article, because I want to go back to the article, because you're right, this article went around and created a lot of FUD. First of all, like I said, the notion that it's unbacked is incorrect. The notion that to be able to reference the fact that it's unbacked, they use that report from Central Bank of Bahamas, which actually is incomplete, because if they know a little bit how Bahamas bank jurisdiction, they would have realized that looking at domestic bank was inaccurate.
00:05:51.798 - 00:06:57.598, Speaker C: And then on top of it, I believe that aside of the fact that he discovered that tether existed only early 2020, which is kind of weird for someone investing in bitcoin or early 2021, he actually indicated that every time the bitcoin price went up, tether printing went up. I think there's one thing that surprised me, and I've seen that on one of your podcasts where I think it was coin metric people that actually indicated the growth of Stablecoin and they mentioned the arbitrage that happened in march 2020. March 2022. And that tether stayed above one dollars, I think, for two months when the other stable coin went back to one. I think that one element that the person that was there, which was a very interesting podcast for Kot to mention, is that people, when they do that kind of arbitrage, they don't do the arbitrage directly on the pair tether dollar, they do it on the bitcoin USDT. Bitcoin USD. And the reason why, again, I'm not an expert, but based on what I've seen on market flow, the reason why the USDT was always at premium is because you had an imbalance of demand and offer between Asia and US and Europe in the BTC.
00:06:57.598 - 00:07:40.282, Speaker C: And since most of the liquidity in Asia is done in USDT, if you have more seller of BTC and USDT, the BTC price will be below. And if you have more buyer BTC USD, what happens? The BTC price USD goes up, the main currency used in Asia being USDT. That's why it was the Stable coin that stayed at premium for a long time. And if you look into it again today, I believe Silvergate announced very impressive earnings, congratulations to them. And they announced that their balance of deposit doubled, I think around two 3 billion. And same for signature, which I believe have informed that they have a big growth. And that is just reflection that tether, you can see the demand in Stablecoin publicly with tether USD coin, et cetera.
00:07:40.282 - 00:08:15.846, Speaker C: But this is a shadow of the demand in USD. And right now, what I've seen me from the inside and outside, you start to see a lot of buying from Europe and US. Using USD based exchange. And you see a lot of natural selling coming from Asia because a lot of miners are in Asia and a lot of historical holders are in Asia which use BTC USDT. And so that's why you see that imbalance. That's why you see a lot of demand in USDT, because for market makers and traders, there's a natural arbitrage. You can buy BTC cheaper in Asia because there's more sellers there and you sell them at a higher price in the US and Europe.
00:08:15.846 - 00:09:18.158, Speaker C: And that's where I'm like, nobody realized the simple market force. And when people say tether is printed out of thin air, basic knowledge of 101 market, if you print tether out of thin air, they have to buy BTC USDT. Correct? If you buy BTC USDT, what's going to happen, that price should shoot up and it should be well above BTC USD because you have, let's say, unnatural demand going on in this pair and it's not the case. If you look at the data between Coinbase and binance, I believe over 70% of the case, the price of Coinbase was always above the price of binance, meaning that the buying was from the US and the arbitrager were taking advantage of it. So I just wanted to clarify that because this is not expressed properly in this article, because that so called trading expert didn't look at that aspect. And that's where I'm like, yeah, there's elements that seems to indicate that he doesn't have the knowledge of the market action. And the same way as they all wanted to know what banking works and I've tried to interact with some of them on Internet, on Twitter, but then when I follow what they say outside, I realized that they don't understand how banking work either.
00:09:18.158 - 00:09:40.200, Speaker C: They started to ask Wale, why do you wire money through a corresponding bank? Well, that's how bank works. So all of a sudden you have overnight experts that have expertise in LRIA. They don't know which I'm okay with it, but it create misunderstanding. So I wanted to clarify that because you talk about that article, I may as well just indicate everything I saw when I read that article. That just proved by itself that it doesn't make any sense.
00:09:40.650 - 00:09:56.294, Speaker A: Okay, and just to go back to the banking so what you're saying is that deltec because you're a smaller bank, you work primarily through some of the large correspondent banks like Citi or HSBC.
00:09:56.342 - 00:10:41.842, Speaker C: Or no, no, it's not related to that. The way banking works is a European bank to get US dollar need US dollar custodian and corresponding bank, a US bank that needs Euro need a European corresponding bank and European custodian. We are based out of the Bahamas, so our native currency is Bahamian dollars because that's the currency where we're licensed. So for us to be able to receive or send Euro, or to receive or send dollars or to custody those, we need multiple corresponding bank in Europe and US. Which we do, we have multiple of those in both currencies because that's how you pretty much diversify your counterparties. And that is just how banks works. If you look in your bank, for example, if you reach out to your bank in the US and ask for a wire in Euro, they will tell you to route that wire.
00:10:41.842 - 00:10:59.150, Speaker C: I mean no, they will give you the Swift and you will find out if you look at the swift message, that the wire was routed through a European based bank. Because every Euro are held in Central Bank of Europe and every dollars are held at the Fed and every Bayman dollars are held in the Central Bank of Bahamas. Pretty much.
00:10:59.300 - 00:11:12.302, Speaker A: Okay, and just quickly before we go to our ad break. So what this has to do with tether is because since tether is backed by US dollars, how does this relate?
00:11:12.366 - 00:11:44.346, Speaker C: What you're mean that's let's put it that way. This is one of the other cases where people trying to find issues did not understand how the banking system works. So they thought they were onto something by understanding how you can send money to Deltech Bank and Trust when in reality that's how everything started. And I explained to those people, I said no, to send money to a bank, you take the swift of the bank and then the swift will give you for those banks where to route it. So there's no thing and that's one.
00:11:44.368 - 00:12:08.366, Speaker A: Thing that created it's not related to tether. No, it's related to how the flow works. Yeah. Okay, so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about tether and some of the allegations in the article. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:12:26.940 - 00:12:37.194, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Gregory Peppin. So can you walk me through the process of how tethers get created, at least in terms of the part that concerns Deltech?
00:12:37.322 - 00:13:06.306, Speaker C: Sure. So what happened is on our side we see customer that we have clearly the full KYC. So we know that are also, I believe customer of tether and they just literally instruct us or send to us wires and at the same time instruct, I believe tether about how much wire tether they want to get. And we notify them once we have been informed by the receipt of the money. And that's how a tether is issued.
00:13:06.498 - 00:13:37.874, Speaker A: So one thing I was wondering is in the article, as you saw, tether at least compared to USDC tends to get issued in these very round number blocks such as 400 million USDT, 300 million USDT, whereas USDC gets minted in amounts like 9,374,133, which seems like tied to very specific orders. So why are all the blocks for tether, these huge round numbers?
00:13:38.072 - 00:14:34.850, Speaker C: So first of all, I believe that again, this article being very incomplete, the big chunk of 400 300 are I think when tether create pre mint or pre authorized tether. So they just create a reserve in their tether treasury. And then what about the size of the orders? There is size that can go anywhere within size of few hundred thousand dollars to a few millions, tens of millions or 50 million. Because again, that's what the traders or the OTC desk or the funds that buy want. So that's their decision of buying. And then remember one element that is key, there is much more volume in Tether trading, meaning USDT BTC, USDT ETH, that size of issuance related to Tether are naturally bigger from the different customer because of the needs in relation to that, because there is more trading going on with it. But again, those size of order are more dependent to the customer asking for those size.
00:14:34.850 - 00:14:52.614, Speaker C: But they're not the 400, 300 million indicated because those are pre minted Tether. I believe in their treasury so that they can reshoo them once they can authorize them. I believe or release them once there is demand matching that and we can confirm that we have received the wire and the funds in relation to the transaction.
00:14:52.742 - 00:15:01.740, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I do see on their transparency page that there are ones that they haven't issued yet. But they do keep track of that.
00:15:04.030 - 00:15:13.186, Speaker C: That's the way they work operationally. That's something that would be up to discuss with them. It's probably for security reason. I think you mentioned that in a different podcast, the team there, okay.
00:15:13.368 - 00:15:26.446, Speaker A: And Tether says that it's backed by cash or cash equivalents. And you said that Deltec holds the dollars in Tether's reserve. So does Deltech also hold the cash equivalents?
00:15:26.638 - 00:15:54.030, Speaker C: So one thing that is important when it comes to treasury management, when you manage that big amount of money, them or any other customer, you usually do treasury management. And so what do we mean, what it means by cash equivalent? It's assets such as T bills, time deposits, things like that. And obviously that's part of the asset class, that's part of the reserve. Like they're investing the reserve in treasury management and I think they've indicated how they would invest it and that's what it means by cash and cash equivalent.
00:15:55.730 - 00:15:59.040, Speaker A: It sounds like you know what those cash equivalents are.
00:15:59.890 - 00:16:08.530, Speaker C: Yes, we're not involved in the investment, but we are a custodian of their cash equivalent.
00:16:11.830 - 00:16:19.126, Speaker A: Based on whatever the knowledge is that you do have of those, how do you think that they affect the risk that any crypto investor has when he.
00:16:19.148 - 00:16:20.630, Speaker B: Or she purchases Tether?
00:16:21.290 - 00:16:34.566, Speaker C: They're following I mean, again, we're not involving their investments, but as far as I can tell, they're following the regular treasury management, you would imagine for managing such reserve. Nothing beyond what you would expect for treasury management.
00:16:34.758 - 00:16:47.002, Speaker A: So earlier you very easily said that Deltec is holding the reserves for Tether. But Tether famously hasn't had a true audit of its books.
00:16:47.146 - 00:16:50.830, Speaker B: Why not? And does that fact give Deltec pause?
00:16:51.490 - 00:17:03.278, Speaker C: So first of all, like I said, I said that, yes, the Tether is fully backed by their reserve. So that's not a secret. They've been repeating that over and over now in relation.
00:17:03.374 - 00:17:11.254, Speaker A: But there definitely was a moment in time when they did lend a huge chunk of their money to Bitfinex. And that was what led to fair.
00:17:11.292 - 00:17:55.106, Speaker C: Enough, but again, that's the definition, it's a reserve. The question is to wonder if the counterparty is insolvent or not, which is another debate, but it's not for me to discuss. But to go back to your initial question, I think it's good to go back to when we started to work with them, or in general, when we work with any entity. We actually do. Always an enhanced due diligence. Especially when it's in relation to that industry digital asset because it's a newly established industry and we didn't really want it to follow any article out there because when you're in the Bahamas you're used about article painting a very bad picture of yourself even if it's unfair. So we started to do an investigation by literally do a deep dive due diligence with them.
00:17:55.106 - 00:18:43.362, Speaker C: And we were able to apply that very famous rule don't trust verify. And we kind of verified and we continue to constantly verify that they are pretty much following what everybody is expecting them to follow. I do understand that people would like to see an audit and it's up to them to find out if they will do one or not. But I do also believe that it was our responsibility to follow the rule of don't trust verify. I mean, audit is usually very useful, but when you see the case of a wirecard or the case of an enron, audit didn't unveil the fraud that was there. And in our case, we really did a very enhanced due diligence both in their AML KYC policy, because I heard a lot of things around that and we cannot budge for that. As a bank, we cannot afford taking any risk there and we really did an enhanced due diligence there and we're very pleased with that.
00:18:43.362 - 00:19:19.274, Speaker C: And the relationship we have with them on that aspect is actually very good. And it's good to remember that they are registered Finsen. So it means that they do report to the same regulators that every other Stablecoin report to for KYC AML. So we've checked that and we are in constant relationship with their compliance team, which is pretty big. And at the same time, we actually always check from time to time to make sure that their reserve in general is properly pretty much matching. And we also make sure that there's no crazy things going on as we do with any customer. We don't see any difference for us to treat them or any other customer in term of due diligence and assessment.
00:19:19.274 - 00:19:23.250, Speaker C: So that's why, like I say, we don't trust, we verify.
00:19:23.990 - 00:20:08.234, Speaker A: So, amongst the full class of Stablecoins, tether clearly probably falls in what you would call the unregulated camp as opposed to something like USDC, which we mentioned earlier. And just in this past year, stablecoins have become a huge business. And as we've also been seeing, there's a lot more regulation that's coming to the crypto space and already we have the New York Attorney General's Office, which has been investigating Tether. And I wondered, as we see this regulation grow in crypto, how do you think that would affect deltec in terms of the fact that it's banking, the company that issues the biggest unregulated, stablecoin.
00:20:08.362 - 00:20:44.906, Speaker C: Define unregulated, stablecoin and regulated. Step on mean, how do you define one being regulated and the other one being unregulated? I'm aware that USDC is registered at the New York Financial Board, I believe, which means that it allowed them to do business in New York. But is it regulated to do business in France? Is it regulated to do business in Asia? There's no regulation there going on. So no, they are regulated to do business in New York, and I think it's the NYDFS license, which is a few others have picked to do so it's important to indicate that for us as a bank, what matters the most?
00:20:44.928 - 00:20:49.450, Speaker A: Can you name a regulator? Can you name a regulator for Tether?
00:20:49.790 - 00:21:41.942, Speaker C: Like I said, the regulator related to Tether and actually regulated to Paxos and related to USDCoin and all of them, they're all registered Finsan. It means that for AML QYC, which is what matters the most. Because if you look at all the comments related, like Janet Yellen recently, it's all about and should be a lot about money laundering and terrorism and all those things. And in that level, they're all regulated the same. They are all registered Finsan and they all report to Finsan, maybe USDC, USDT or Paxos, they are all regulated under Finsen in a sense that they are all registered there. And that's something that was very important for us, because again, what is critical, and if you look, as you said, on the environment of regulation related to crypto, the regulation focus is all about money laundering. When you listen to Yellen, Janet Yellen, or when you listen to Ms.
00:21:41.942 - 00:22:14.066, Speaker C: Christine Lagarde, I believe in Europe it's all about money laundering, illicit usage of crypto. And that's a legitimate concern to always have and always be focused crypto or any other asset class. And in that aspect, they actually are regulated under Finsen. They are reporting under finsan. They have a complete investigation, risk and compliance team that we have actually assessed ourselves. And that's the same case for USDC and Paxos and I believe all the other stablecoin out there because that's what you need to do. So that's why I was saying defining regulated and unregulated.
00:22:14.066 - 00:22:53.266, Speaker C: Now, you are right that USDC and Paxos I believe as well, can do business in New York because they are regulated under the New York license, the Bit license there. But the bit license only applied to New York. It doesn't apply anywhere else. And there's other exchanges that actually decided to walk away from New York because they didn't want to apply to the Bit license. However, all of them have a common ground, which is money laundering protection or regulation which is fincent. And for us, that was a critical point. So we're not overly concerned about that, because we believe that it's a relation of the quality of any cryptocurrency or any digital asset company's compliance program and compliance policy.
00:22:53.266 - 00:23:00.646, Speaker C: And in the case of tether, we've never been really worried about it. Actually. As I said, they've been very collaborative and very good on that.
00:23:00.828 - 00:23:05.880, Speaker A: And are you worried at all about the investigation by the new York attorney general's office?
00:23:07.610 - 00:23:22.060, Speaker C: Again, that investigation concerned them, so we're not involved in it. So, I mean, I can't really comment about it. We still have a relationship with them right now, so we did our due diligence and that's it. So we maintained a relationship, but that's all I can say.
00:23:22.670 - 00:23:26.080, Speaker A: So you just have your eye on that and see how it turns out?
00:23:26.770 - 00:23:59.354, Speaker C: No, we have a eye on all our customer, regardless of data limit regarding to them or anything. What matters for us is the nature of the relationship we have with any of our customer as long as they continue to fulfill any requirement we're asking them, and any requirement that are in line with what the bank role is. And the bank role again, is to make sure we're not the vehicle of money laundering and other things like that. They are doing their job like all the other customer we have at the bank. Therefore, we don't have an opinion, and we should not have an opinion on whatever happens with the ongoing investigation, as you said.
00:23:59.552 - 00:24:34.690, Speaker A: Okay. And Hugo rogers, Deltech's chief investment officer, said in an end of year video, end of 2020 video, that deltech has a large position in bitcoin. He said, quote, we've maintained a very significant position in the beneficiaries of maximum monetization, which includes this large position in bitcoin. And he goes on, we bought bitcoin for our clients at about $9,300. That worked out very well through 2020. We expect it to work well in 2021 as the printing presses continue to run hot. So what was the purpose of these bitcoin purchases?
00:24:35.190 - 00:25:24.622, Speaker C: Again, that was another route that was really interesting. They create a lot of FUD, a lot of people and a lot of so called journalists claimed that we bought bitcoin for tether, and I believe tether denied it, and rightfully because in our case, people need to remember that deltech exists, since I think the we've been established as a well known private bank. We have a lot of customer from asset manager, to high net worth people, to corporate, et cetera, and we have a very competent and well respected investment team. And as part of their portfolio allocation for those customer, they actually did an allocation in bitcoin on behalf of those customer. And that's just an overall strategy. And I think it's a pattern that you start to see in many, many other investment firm that believe that now crypto, and especially bitcoin, is a normal asset to hold in a portfolio. So it's just an investment decision.
00:25:24.622 - 00:25:43.260, Speaker C: And again, this kind of overblow because those so called experts deducted something that came out of nowhere. We try to deny it. I've tried to do it myself and it was a waste of my time because they have their own truth and we have ours. I guess one of the party have the data, the other one don't. That's the only difference.
00:25:44.670 - 00:25:49.020, Speaker A: Yeah, I said in a recent episode that I think there's an epidemic of this in our.
00:25:53.310 - 00:26:42.318, Speaker C: But just for people to think if one day Tether wants to buy bitcoin, do you really think they're going to go to their bank to do that? It doesn't make any sense. I mean, why would they go to us, a Bahamian 70 years old bank, to purchase bitcoin when they are one of the biggest player in this industry? The thing is, they look at every details and we've seen a lot of rumor like apparently Tether and Ifinex are bitfinex are shareholders of Deltech. I told them no, but yet they still believe it's the case. What do you want to do? You know what I mean? At one point of the time you just let that happen and it was just good to clarify some elements because it's always clear to clarify, but at the end you can't convince everyone and if you want to try, you're going to waste your time.
00:26:42.484 - 00:26:51.466, Speaker A: Yeah, but just to wrap up that last question, so basically your wealth management services was purchasing the bitcoin for private clients.
00:26:51.578 - 00:27:28.634, Speaker C: Exactly. In the portfolio management, that the client. And if you look, if people were following Deltec for other than FUD, they would have found out that our CIO and the team has been preaching about the massive printing going on with the fed and the ECB. And they mentioned that gold and bitcoin was a very interesting play to do and they have been rehearsing that for many, many months. And we ended up creating because the way they invested in bitcoin is we didn't buy bitcoin straight up in the market. We created a structured product that allowed the client to be long bitcoin without having to buy the bitcoin. But again, nobody listened to that when we explained that, but that's what we did.
00:27:28.634 - 00:27:48.180, Speaker C: We actually allowed them to be exposed to bitcoin without having to worry about the custody by creating a structured product. So, yeah, it's just part of a global strategy and I'm proud to say that our team was advanced because now it seems that it's the new trend and a lot of institution wants to do it. We were good enough to do it before everyone. I mean, before most. That's an honor to them and I applaud them for that.
00:27:48.550 - 00:27:52.078, Speaker A: Great, all right, well, thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:27:52.254 - 00:27:53.826, Speaker C: Thank you for having me.
00:27:54.008 - 00:28:01.526, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Thanks for tuning in to.
00:28:01.548 - 00:29:18.240, Speaker B: This week's news recap. First headline BlackRock world's largest asset manager prepares to invest in bitcoin futures. If there was ever a sign that bitcoin is drawing the institutional crowd, it came Wednesday when news broke that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, which is nearly $8 trillion under management, had made two filings with the securities and exchange commission that two of its funds could invest in bitcoin futures. The filings for BlackRock Funds Five and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund mentioned illiquidity as a potential risk. Quote as bitcoin futures are not as heavily traded as other futures, given that the bitcoin futures market is relatively new, it also noted that the funds would only invest in, quote, cash settled bitcoin futures traded on commodity exchanges registered with the CFTC, which basically at this point in time means the CME. On a related note, Goldman Sachs is exploring digital asset custody, issuing a request for information to at least one crypto custody company at the end of 2020. Meanwhile, Onchain analyst Willy Wu is seeing more whales buying up the recent dip in the bitcoin price, with holders of 1000 BTC sharply increasing and coins moving off exchanges to wallets that accumulate but do not sell.
00:29:18.240 - 00:30:35.474, Speaker B: And finally, if you're wondering how well bitcoin businesses have been doing amidst this frenzy, look no further than Silvergate Bank, which saw nearly $3 billion in deposits in the fourth quarter of 2020, all from digital currency customers, including crypto exchanges like Coinbase Kraken, which disclosure is a previous sponsor of my shows, Bitstamp and others. Next Headline How a crypto friendly SEC head could affect the industry Several appointments by President Joe Biden have crypto people feeling positive about what the industry can expect from this administration. The new head of the SEC will be Gary Gensler, replacing the notoriously anti crypto Jay Clayton. Gensler, formerly the chairman of the Commodity Futures Exchange Commission, is familiar with blockchain technology, having taught about digital currencies at MIT's Sloan School of Management. In an opinion piece for CoinDesk, Jeff Bandman, a former CFTC official, said he expected Gensler would bring more clarity to market structure and infrastructure for crypto assets to, quote, promote adoption and investor confidence. He added, quote I would be shocked if there are not things that make the industry howl. He also said he expected the SEC would finally approve a bitcoin ETF Banman.
00:30:35.474 - 00:31:46.314, Speaker B: Also raises an interesting question whether Gensler will seek a mandate from Congress for the SEC to regulate the spot market for crypto assets that are not securities, noting that the CFTC only has enforcement authority, which isn't the same as regulatory or supervisory authority. Next Headline more crypto Savvy picks likely to lead CFTC and OCC Georgetown Professor Chris Brummer is Biden's likely nominee for CFTC chair after the crypto friendly chair Heath Tarbert stepped down Thursday. Tarbert will remain a commissioner, however, Brummer has recently been researching cryptocurrencies and in recent years has testified about them, as well as Central Bank digital currencies to the CFTC, former Ripple board member Michael Barr will likely replace Brian Brooks as the controller of the currency. According to the Wall Street Journal, Barr is a former Treasury Department official currently serving as dean of public policy at the University of Michigan. Next headline. Janet Yellen cites cryptocurrencies as a terrorist financing risk. In her Senate confirmation hearing, Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen called cryptocurrencies a particular concern when it comes to terrorist financing.
00:31:46.314 - 00:33:10.142, Speaker B: Noting that the government should be sure its technology keeps up with that of the terrorists, she said, quote I think many cryptocurrencies are used, at least in transaction sense, mainly for illicit financing. However, in written testimony, she acknowledged the benefits of cryptocurrencies, as well as, quote, the potential they have to improve the efficiency of the financial system. Meanwhile, the same Day Chainalysis published the first portion of its 2021 Cryptocrime Report, which found, quote Cryptocurrency related crime fell significantly in 2020 from 2.1% of all transaction volume in 2019, which added up to $21 billion worth up to zero point 34% in 2020, which is only $10 billion in transaction volume. Scams made up the majority of all crypto related crime, accounting for 54%. Meanwhile, Ransomware, although it only counted for 7% of all funds received by criminal actresses, tripled in the work from home world spurred on by the pandemic. Next Headline Finsen Remains a Question mark for crypto under Biden In a long analysis piece, Nicholas Day of CoinDesk went through how appointments at several agencies would affect crypto, noting that the controversial proposed Finsen rules that were being pushed by former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have now had their common periods extended.
00:33:10.142 - 00:34:38.390, Speaker B: However, he noted one part of the rule only gets 15 more days, while another part about record keeping on counterparties will receive a 45 day extension because of its complexity. Next Headline ETH Hits New Alltime High The price of ether hit a new alltime high earlier this week, surpassing $1,420, although by press time the price had fallen again toward one $100. Next Headline The Bitcoin Double Spend that wasn't Wednesday BitMEX Research tweeted that there was a small double spend of 0.6 bitcoin, which was about $21. However, as Hasu of Derabet explained in a blog post, Instead of this being the equivalent of someone bouncing a check in bitcoin, it was more that a transaction was invalidated. But based on the fact that almost an entire day pass between the initial transaction and the first transaction that attempted to replace it, it seems unlikely that this was someone trying to cheat a merchant who offers purchases with zero confirmations, which was one explanation. Instead, what seems likely is that this spender, who Hasu calls Alice, actually made an additional transaction that assumed her previous transaction with a too low fee had already passed, and this time the fee she used was enough to pay for both transactions, so they both went through time for fun bits.
00:34:38.390 - 00:35:05.646, Speaker B: Why 1 million people follow her price calls on TikTok. You've probably seen Marin Altman's TikTok videos in which she uses astrology to make crypto price predictions. She correctly called the January 11 drawdown on Bitcoin. And in this Reuters video, she explains that she's, quote not an oracle, I'm just somebody who studies patterns. Altman, who dollar cost averages her crypto purchases, says, quote astrology can be thought.
00:35:05.668 - 00:35:07.198, Speaker A: Of like a giant mirror or a.
00:35:07.204 - 00:35:42.518, Speaker B: Symbolic language where certain signifiers of planetary alignments are archetypes and they represent themes in the world like growth or restriction or aggression or peace. So when she looks at how the movement of the planets aligns with bitcoin for the next few months, she says february and early March are favorable, but then there will be a big price correction. But then may will be bullish. All right, well, thanks for tuning in. To learn more about Gregory and Deltec's relationship to Tether, be sure to check out the links in the show notes.
