00:01:36.310 - 00:01:37.430, Speaker A: Welcome, David.
00:01:37.590 - 00:01:39.194, Speaker C: Hey, Laura. How you doing?
00:01:39.392 - 00:01:53.710, Speaker A: I'm interested to hear your background because you obviously work at the Federal Reserve, but you are also quite a prolific author and speaker on Blockchain and cryptocurrency. So tell us how you came to be in this role.
00:01:54.290 - 00:02:36.014, Speaker C: Right, sure. So my background is actually as an academic economist. I spent about 20 years in academia and moved to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in the research division, where I got to basically apply the theories that I was studying. And I learned as an academic that involved primarily monetary policy, banking, financial stability, payments, et cetera. And so when this new phenomenon emerged, I quite naturally became very interested in this kind of alternative type of money and payment system. So I've been basically keeping an eye on it ever since.
00:02:36.014 - 00:02:58.120, Speaker C: It's not part of my official job description here. It's kind of just more of like a hobby, something that I keep an eye on and try to see how it relates to things I've seen happen before in history and also whether or not any of this emergent technology has any monetary policy implications going forward.
00:02:58.890 - 00:03:10.166, Speaker A: So how did you hear about Bitcoin and Blockchain and also, why do you think that they really caught your interest other than the fact that it is sort of in your professional sphere?
00:03:10.358 - 00:04:14.030, Speaker C: Yeah, well, as a bit of an historian of monetary policy and monetary developments. I was aware that there have been many attempts in the past of private currency issuance or non government currency issuance. And that when I first heard about Bitcoin. I think I probably heard about it kind of referred to people were very, very skeptical at the time, calling it a scam. I think Paul Krugman famously wrote something on it that intrigued me. And so I think if I recall correctly, I mean, that's five or six years ago now, maybe longer, but I decided to peek under the hood to see what all the fuss was about. And it didn't take me too long to realize that there was actually something quite interesting, something quite novel about this new innovation.
00:04:14.030 - 00:04:26.980, Speaker C: And that's just basically how I got started in studying the phenomena and kind of researching it. And I continue to do that today.
00:04:27.430 - 00:04:53.180, Speaker A: So before we get into the meat of our discussion, which is going to be pretty wide ranging and really interesting, I just want to make sure that the listeners kind of understand essentially what the Federal Reserve does and also what the different regional Federal Reserve banks do and also the role of commercial banks. So can you just sort of talk generally about how all of that works?
00:04:53.550 - 00:05:55.114, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, sure. So the Federal Reserve was founded in 1913. It was founded after the United States had experienced a number of severe panics in the latter part of the 19th century financial panics. And one of the big ones happened in 1907. And what was decided at the time was that this type of very unstable kind of financial structure needed some sort of backstop, some sort of government sponsored bank to kind of help stabilize the financial system. There were attempts in the past, two other attempts that the first and second national banks in the United States that failed to get their charters renewed. The Fed was established as kind of very unique kind of creatures, kind of like this public private sector partnership.
00:05:55.114 - 00:06:48.670, Speaker C: It's not completely public, it's not completely private. It's kind of this mix. And the Fed was basically designed to basically be there as a backstop, to serve as kind of a lender of last resort, to provide an elastic currency, as the phrase was used at the time. And since then it's evolved over time to play a major role in facilitating payments in the United States. It played a big role in clearing checks, for example. And also there's that part of the Federal Reserve that is responsible. It has congressional mandates to use the powers that it has to fulfill its congressional mandates of price stability and full employment.
00:06:48.670 - 00:07:27.660, Speaker C: And so the Federal Open Market Committee is responsible for that. And that committee consists of the twelve regional Fed presidents, plus seven representatives at the Board of Governors. And basically most of your listeners are probably aware of that part of the Fed where the FOMC, the Federal Open Market Committee makes decisions about the path of interest rates in the economy to help regulate inflation and economic activity according to the congressional mandates that it has.
00:07:28.110 - 00:07:32.720, Speaker A: And can you also elaborate on the role that commercial banks play in the banking system?
00:07:33.090 - 00:08:28.666, Speaker C: Sure, commercial banks, I mean, there's a lot of them in the United States, thousands of them. And these commercial banks all have accounts with the Federal Reserve Bank. In fact, they are basically digital currency accounts. Fedwire, for example, is a real time gross settlement system that the commercial banks use to clear payments with each other. So this is kind of interesting in of itself in the context of the talk today because as we speak for a long time, we already have had a central bank digital currency, but it's been restricted basically to the commercial banks. So the Fed plays a major role in facilitating payments across banks as they help facilitate payments that occur in the private sector. So when you go and you make a payment to the Starbucks merchant, your account is debited.
00:08:28.666 - 00:08:47.460, Speaker C: The account of the merchant is credited. There's got to be a flow of funds from the two accounts. What's happening in the background is that Federal Reserve funds are flowing from your bank to Starbucks bank, and that happens through these back channels in the payment system.
00:08:48.230 - 00:09:09.770, Speaker A: All right, so this sets enough of a stage for getting into the meat of the discussion where we're going to talk about all the different ways that developments in the crypto and Blockchain world are sort of intersecting with your world. Let's talk first about probably the biggest news of this year, which is Libra. What do you think of the Libra proposal?
00:09:10.270 - 00:09:38.342, Speaker C: It's intriguing. I mean, there's been a lot of proposals. This is not new. This is not new by any means. There's been a lot of proposals in the past to create Libra like objects. The special drawing right at the IMF, the International Money Fund, is an example of this type of Libra. Although it has limited access, there have been many proposals in the past to do it as well, pre Internet days.
00:09:38.342 - 00:10:26.100, Speaker C: What's different about this is, of course, we're now in the Internet era one, and also Facebook is a social media giant. It has over 2 billion users. So it already has a really vast network in place already so people can talk to each other through Facebook. And that's at the end of the day, what money is money transfer is all about is talking to different accounts. It's information transfer. And so what makes Libra interesting is you've got this large private entity with this just humongous network already established that could potentially move information around. It already does move information around.
00:10:26.100 - 00:11:10.100, Speaker C: You can talk to your friends, for example, but imagine opening up an account at Facebook and asking whoever's in charge to debit your account of whatever Facebook units or Libra units and crediting the account of somebody else. In principle, Facebook could be involved in this in a way that could have a major impact on payment processors around the world, on a scale that, like I said, these types of proposals have been around in the past. But just the massive scale that Facebook brings to bear on this possibility is what makes it really interesting.
00:11:11.110 - 00:11:42.110, Speaker A: And so when you say it would have a massive effect on payment processors, I guess you mean from the sheer aspect of people might prefer to use the Facebook system simply because of its reach. But I'm curious to know also, do you think that it would have an impact on central banks? What would the impact be on retail banks, on maybe weaker economies, or just aside from payment processors? What are some of the other impacts on existing players?
00:11:42.770 - 00:12:02.980, Speaker C: Well, I don't see what other impact it would have other than payment processing. Well, that's not quite true. I guess there might be some effect to the extent that this monetary object that they create might serve as a competitor to other types of monetary instruments. So there's that.
00:12:04.890 - 00:12:07.206, Speaker A: What are some examples of some of the others?
00:12:07.388 - 00:12:35.982, Speaker C: Oh, I just mean euros and yen and US. Dollar. Currency competition has always been very fierce. We have Bitcoin, we have many, many competing currencies out there. And central banks have to constantly be concerned about currency competition. Usually you're concerned about currency competition of other types of currencies. For example, in many emerging economies, people like the US.
00:12:35.982 - 00:12:54.274, Speaker C: Dollar, for example, that competes against the domestic currency. In principle, a private currency issuance like libra might compete against the US. Dollar, for example. These are just kind of the potentials. I don't necessarily see that happening.
00:12:54.472 - 00:13:17.420, Speaker A: Oh, you don't? Okay. Because what I was going to ask, you know, David Marcus who headed up the group that developed libra at Facebook, he's come out a few times and said that it's not a threat to these existing fiat currencies. You said it could potentially be, but then you actually just said you didn't think it would. So yeah, I'm not sure if you agree with David or disagree with.
00:13:20.190 - 00:14:16.190, Speaker C: Could. It's a complicated issue. One could imagine different kind of parameter configurations for how things are set up. But a lot of it depends, for example, on how libra would be restricted by basically domestic regulations. They're going to have to be compliant to the underlying regulation of every country. And I just think once these companies are compelled to become compliant, that they're going to be on an equal footing with any regular money market mutual fund, for example. I don't see what the difference is necessarily between libra and a money fund, a government money fund, except for the fact that Facebook, of course, can be accessed globally very easily relative to say, a US.
00:14:16.190 - 00:14:41.670, Speaker C: Money fund, I don't know. So yeah, I see a lot of regulatory hurdles. I think that would make it very difficult for libra to kind of displace such a dominant world currency like the US. Dollar at least anytime soon. We should never say never, of course, but I don't see it in the foreseeable horizon.
00:14:42.410 - 00:14:53.638, Speaker A: And what about for weaker economies? That probably doesn't apply. Like, if you know a Turkish central banker or Argentine or something, what would you be thinking about the advent of libra?
00:14:53.814 - 00:15:50.090, Speaker C: Well, that's a good question. Right. For libra, again, I think for countries like that, they could impose currency controls that would effectively prohibit their citizens from accessing facebook, for example, on the internet. That would prevent them. I think that one of the disadvantages of Facebook is it's a registered corporation, there's a CEO, they have to be compliant if they want to play nice. And so ultimately they're subject to the regulatory whims of whatever country they're operating in. This is very different, very different, say, than, say, from bitcoin, for example, that has no designated CEO or corporate structure.
00:15:50.090 - 00:16:19.190, Speaker C: So it's a very different competing against bitcoin is completely different animal than competing against, say, libra. So even there, I think that it kind of depends on how open the jurisdiction is to permitting its citizens to process payments using some private provider like facebook. It just kind of at the end of the day, just depends.
00:16:20.010 - 00:17:20.298, Speaker A: Yeah, and even what you were saying about how they could shut off access to Know, facebook claims that it will be the libra association that will be in charge of libra, and that there will be other wallet providers that are built on top of this network that's controlled by the Swiss entity. And so even if people couldn't access Facebook, maybe they could access these other wallets. But we're getting really far ahead of ourselves because we don't even know if libra will launch. But I was also curious to know, you talked about how libra is not that different from previous attempts to form. Like, you compared it to the strs that the IMF has created. And I just wondered, in general, what do you think of the way that Facebook approached Know? If you were to have designed a global stablecoin, would you have done it the same way, or do you know it was a mistake not to just peg it to the dollar or just on the design of it?
00:17:20.304 - 00:18:54.994, Speaker C: What's your I mean, the idea is in terms of creating a stable coin, I can kind of see the logic of the approach they took. And indeed, I think they may very well have been inspired by the approach that the IMF took when the IMF, the international monetary fund, created the special drawing right. When the special drawing right, however, was created, which of course was many, many years before the internet. Nevertheless, I've seen references to people back then proclaiming the end of domestic currencies, that one day everybody was going to be making their payments, receiving their payments, their wages, spending their special drawing rights that it was going to basically displace all national currencies. Well, needless to say, that never happened. And so whether or not the ability of facebook to leverage up the internet might make it more amenable for people to want to use kind of a basket of currencies as kind of the numerair the unit of account, I don't know, I just think it was a big hurdle to kind of climb. I think they may equally well have approached it by just saying, look, we're just going to create these things called facebook dollars, just the way a lot of games create their own credits inside their environment.
00:18:54.994 - 00:19:12.640, Speaker C: Facebook just can create its own money. Could be airlines create air miles, various companies create coupons redeemable in money that they issue themselves little credits. So facebook credits.
00:19:13.730 - 00:19:26.662, Speaker A: But what would the value have those been like? Would it have been pegged to the US. Dollar then? If you're saying that they should have just created facebook dollars, are you saying it should have been pegged to the US. Dollar?
00:19:26.826 - 00:19:49.878, Speaker C: I guess it depends on what your objective is. I mean, if you wanted to peg it, you could try to peg it to the US. Dollar. But I don't know, I guess you could have chosen that model too. The US. Dollar is the dominant currency, but I guess for a variety of reasons, you might want to move away from having the US. Dollar being the dominant currency.
00:19:49.878 - 00:20:13.310, Speaker C: They probably have in mind that they have a global set of users. And these users may have wanted a currency that was backed more by a basket of currencies rather than just the US. Dollar. So like I said, I can kind of see the motivation behind I mean, I don't know, they could have alternatively, like I said, just created their own Facebook dollar.
00:20:14.690 - 00:20:23.954, Speaker A: Right, but that's why I was asking you what would the value of that have been? What would the exchange rate have been? Just a floating are you saying then? Oh, I see.
00:20:24.072 - 00:21:30.442, Speaker C: Yeah, just a floating exchange rate. One way to envisage what this currency, because I guess you have to distinguish between this currency as a store of value and as a kind of what I think some economists have called a vehicle currency. So most people perhaps might not even hold this floating currency. These facebook currencies, this facebook currency, what they might use it for is just to affect a transfer of funds. So they'll just buy it for a very short period of time, transfer the credit from one facebook user to the other facebook user to facilitate the payment very quickly that they couldn't otherwise facilitate, say, through the correspondent banking sector in the world. And then facebook could just like debit and credit accounts instantaneously, basically, so you'd bear very little exchange rate risk. And then there'd be a separate set of agents or agencies or firms that would be holding this libra currency as kind of a store of value, absorbing all the risk associated with it.
00:21:30.442 - 00:21:40.300, Speaker C: So that would have been kind of an alternative model. It's not entirely clear to me which is the best way to go.
00:21:41.550 - 00:22:34.430, Speaker A: Okay, well, since we've been talking about the US. Dollar, I did want to bring up this letter that was recently sent by House Representatives French Hill and Bill Foster to Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, and they stated, quote, we are concerned that the primacy of the US. Dollar could be in long term jeopardy from wide adoption of digital fiat currencies. The letter notes that 40 countries are looking into developing digital currencies. It cites the soon to be released digital yuan in China, and it concludes by asking Chairman Powell if the Fed is looking into a digital US. Dollar, how it plans to respond to competing digital fiat currencies, what the Fed would need from Congress for the development of a dollar, et cetera. What did you think of the letter, and do you think they're right to be concerned about the long term primacy of the USD?
00:22:35.090 - 00:23:01.446, Speaker C: No, I don't think they should be concerned about it. I mean the US. Dollar has, if anything, solidified its hold as the primary currency in the world. Since the 2008 financial crisis. There's been a lot of regulations passed worldwide, basel three, for example, that have solidified the role of the US. Dollar as a regulatory object. So I don't think I'd be too concerned about that.
00:23:01.446 - 00:23:46.866, Speaker C: But even I have to say this even if it was true, who cares, really? Most countries don't have a world preserved currency. I mean, it's like Canada, for example, seems to be a perfectly respectable country to live in, and nobody wants to hold Canadian dollars except for Canadians. And whenever I visit Canada, it seems like a very nice place to visit. People are prosperous and happy. At the end of the day, I don't even think it's a huge deal in the sense that the wealth of a nation is determined by its people, its human capital, its productivity, the opportunities it offers. Whether or not the US. Dollar is the world's global currency is actually kind of just peripheral.
00:23:46.866 - 00:24:32.818, Speaker C: It's kind of like an exorbitant privilege, as they say, for the United States, because it gets to export dollars for goods and services. And that's kind of a nice benefit to have in some sense. But, I mean, it's not critical for the well being of a nation in terms of, like, a digital currency. I'd argue most people have access to digital currency already. They have access to digital bank accounts, for example. So the commercial banking sector is how we make payments, right? We use our debit cards, for example. And most of the complaints, I guess, are well, it's kind of interesting.
00:24:32.818 - 00:25:10.250, Speaker C: I mean, I'm old enough to remember when even I didn't have debit cards. You'd actually have to use checks or travelers checks and things like that. So many young people today kind of take a look at the landscape, the financial landscape out there, and they see inefficiencies everywhere in terms of payments. But one thing you have to realize is that there's been tremendous innovation in money and payments over the last 20, 30, 40 years. It's not like things are standing still. In the old days, if I wanted to travel to Europe, I'd have to take travelers checks. I don't even know if many of your listeners know what a traveler's check is anymore.
00:25:10.250 - 00:25:30.082, Speaker C: You'd have to go to the travel to Europe. Yeah, you'd have to go and buy some travelers checks. You'd have to visit the office, buy the travelers checks. You'd have to have them issued. You have to have to go back, pick them up. You'd fly to Europe. You'd have to go take a taxi to American Express or Thomas Cook office.
00:25:30.082 - 00:25:54.270, Speaker C: It'd be closed because it was a bank holiday. So you'd have to go back home and go back the next day. Then you'd go back and visit the office, and then you'd make a big cashing of lira if you're in Italy, for example, and then you'd have to carry around a wadful of lira in a country where maybe you didn't. I mean, today you travel to Europe and I take my credit card. I mean, it's.
00:25:57.250 - 00:26:35.142, Speaker A: You if you were to design, like, a US. Dollar CBDC, how would you do that? Because there are a few options here. Like the Fed could issue a digital dollar, where it then allows everyday people to have accounts at the central bank, and it could bypass the commercial banks to distribute. You know, would you go that route? I've seen you have written that you believe that if the central bank releases a Fed coin that there shouldn't be KYC restrictions on it. So just describe for me your ideal US. Digital dollar.
00:26:35.286 - 00:27:01.780, Speaker C: Right, well, I'd be very careful about that last statement you said about Fedcoin. There's different models of what one means by central bank digital currency. Of course. Right. Kind of the old idea is just opening up the Fed's balance sheet to everybody and not just commercial banks. So in a sense, the Fed already does that. We all own a piece of the liabilities of the Federal Reserve to the extent that we hold paper.
00:27:01.780 - 00:28:15.526, Speaker C: So, you know, one might say, well, if we're allowed to hold paper dollar accounts in our wallets, why can't we hold digital money accounts at the Fed directly? Right now, it's just the commercial banks that are permitted to have digital currency accounts with the Fed. Well, that's fine. I mean, what happens now is the digital money accounts that you and I have to hold are going to be done through bank of America, for example, or through a money market fund, perhaps. So in this model, it's basically indistinguishable from central bank digital currency, except that in fact, for most people it's just indistinguishable. You could permit everybody to have accounts directly with a Fed or you could kind of have it disintermediated a little bit, let the banks intermediate it. That's the model we have now. And the only quibble that people have is really about with respect to the fees that banks charge and whether or not their accounts are insured above some certain minimum level and whether or not they can make payments overseas efficiently.
00:28:15.526 - 00:28:19.260, Speaker C: These are the things that people are complaining about.
00:28:22.190 - 00:28:31.006, Speaker A: If you were to design it, would you design it bypassing the commercial banks or like you kind of said, you could do it either one way or the other. But I'm asking what do you think.
00:28:31.028 - 00:29:58.970, Speaker C: Is the better the I'm sorry, I got a little off track there in terms of the KYC thing. There another model of issuing the Fed digital currency is to have it basically as kind of the anonymous Swiss bank account model as well as kind of a token based model. So there's a wide variety of models in which you could issue this central bank digital currency. For myself, I think that many people have made the case that it would seem that there might be a role for the Fed to provide a basic utility banking service for people in the economy, very much like I guess the US Postal Savings Bank did for many years from I think 1913 to 1965. Just a basic plain vanilla payment processing service that would pay kind of a nice little interest rate on your deposits. It would offer real time gross settlement, it would charge no fees, your accounts would be fully insured and there would be no other services provided, no overdraft privileges, for example. And that this type of service is kind of like a public option that should appeal to people who might otherwise find it difficult to open up bank accounts in the commercial banking sector.
00:29:58.970 - 00:30:53.802, Speaker C: It could coexist with banks. It's not like it would drive banks out of business because banks of course offer their clients all sorts of services that they bundle together with payments. So, yeah, I think I've been a proponent of the idea that the Fed could issue just a very basic, plain vanilla, kind of central bank digital currency, which, the way I'm describing it, is not a Fed coin, but it's just basically permitting people to open up bank accounts directly with the Fed. Very much by the ways in the way that Americans can already open up bank accounts directly with the US Treasury. You can go to www, TreasuryDirect. Gov and you can open up an interest bearing account there at the US Treasury. You're not allowed to make payments with these interest bearing objects.
00:30:53.802 - 00:31:26.360, Speaker C: But that's something that could be overcome. That's not a technical barrier, that's just a policy barrier. So one could imagine a world where you could kind of remove that barrier and people could. One form that this central bank digital currency could take is in fact in terms of treasury money, where people could make online payments directly with their www dot treasury direct gov accounts. Many other models are possible, of course, but that's kind of the basic one. I see.
00:31:26.970 - 00:31:55.518, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to discuss how all of this could affect commercial banks as well as how cryptocurrencies play in all this.

00:33:55.692 - 00:34:31.940, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with David and Alfato of the St. Louis Reserve Federal Reserve, is it? One thing earlier when you talked about how you didn't think it was super important that the US. Dollar be the global reserve status currency. What's your take then on China's PBOC digital currency, which will be released soon? Do you think that could kind of affect the US. Dollar's global reserve status. And does that give you concern, especially as you're watching kind of what's going on in Hong Kong and how maybe a digital yuan could, I guess, increase China's power?
00:34:32.950 - 00:35:14.850, Speaker C: Yeah. Am I concerned? I'm a central banker, so I'm paid to get concerned about everything, I guess. But I don't know. I take kind of the view that all the power to them, if they want to try to do that, they might have some success as a regional currency, like in Southeast Asia. And I think that would be mean. I personally don't see them competing on the global stage with the you know, you just have to ask mean, how would you rather be holding your wealth in US. Dollars or Chinese yuan? You just ask yourself that question.
00:35:14.850 - 00:36:05.890, Speaker C: A lot of it depends on how the global community trusts a particular country. And I think right now, and probably for the foreseeable future, the US. Has got it and China hasn't. Although, like I said, perhaps China could have some success and especially regionally, and I think that would be fine. It's not like control over this stuff is going to dictate the trajectory of the wealth of nations. Like I said, what we're talking about here is record keeping, debiting and crediting accounts, information transfer, record keeping, database management. I mean, it's not something that's profound in the sense of, like, developing human capital, developing entrepreneurial spirit.
00:36:05.890 - 00:37:01.810, Speaker C: We have to keep our eye on a ball on the ball about what truly it is that creates the wealth and material well being in a society. Yes, payments are important. Yes, it is advantageous for a nation to have kind of a favored currency, but it's not something foreboding that if suddenly China becomes the world's reserve currency, is the United States economy going to go into a death spiral? I just don't see that. So we have to be a little bit careful about being too melodramatic here about what the ultimate consequences of Bitcoin or some other currency displacing the US. Dollar. It's happened before. It's happened before in history and countries and people just continue to live and prosper.
00:37:02.230 - 00:37:16.070, Speaker A: So in the crypto world, many people see the emergence of central bank digital currencies as practically inevitable. And I was wondering, in your world of Federal reserve bankers, how much are these ideas being discussed and how seriously?
00:37:17.050 - 00:37:47.730, Speaker C: Well, they weren't being discussed that much years ago when I started to study the phenomenon. But increasingly, you know, you see more and more prominent central bankers discussing the idea. And indeed, President Harker of the Philadelphia Fed just recently suggested that a central bank digital currency among the G 20 is likely inevitable. Now, he didn't believe the US. Would be a leader on that front, but he sees it as inevitable.
00:37:48.390 - 00:37:57.030, Speaker A: And what did you think of the bank of England governor Mark Carney suggestion to have a global digital reserve currency?
00:37:57.370 - 00:38:42.322, Speaker C: Right. So that's an interesting idea. Right. That's, again, trying to get away from the special status that the US dollar has and kind of the issues that it implies for a number of countries that like to peg to the dollar or that issue dollar denominated debt. I think that it's an interesting idea, but that kind of from a practical perspective, I just don't see how countries are going to agree on how to manage such an object. So at least I could be wrong. There might be a way to do it, but I actually don't think that politically it would happen.
00:38:42.322 - 00:38:48.550, Speaker C: And so for the time mean, I guess we're basically stuck with the US dollar as far as I'm concerned.
00:38:48.970 - 00:39:26.100, Speaker A: And earlier when I asked you about how you would design a central bank digital currency, you did say that you felt that everyday citizens could open accounts at the central bank thereby bypassing the commercial banks and you didn't seem to really kind of imply that this would have a huge impact on commercial banks. So do you feel like this is something that they should not be scared? JP. Morgan and Wells Fargo are also working on their own versions of digital dollars and I just wondered how you thought that they were viewing all these developments and if you were in their place, what would you be doing?
00:39:27.430 - 00:40:41.782, Speaker C: Well, I think that they should be worried all right, but primarily in the sense that they should be worried only to the extent that they would be worried quite naturally about the emergence of any competitor. Right. So any new competitor on the scene should have them worry about how they going to compete against this new player on the block. In that sense, with the Federal Reserve entering into the offering its own accounts directly to citizens instead of having them intermediated and having these accounts, say, pay maybe a more competitive deposit rate, for example, would certainly increase the cost of maintaining deposits in the commercial banking sector. So that'll definitely might have some impact on how much profit they could extract from deposit accounts. To the extent that the banking system is a monopolistic sector, one could well argue that this might be a good thing, reducing the monopoly profit and providing better services to the depositors. The other thing is that they'd be able to continue to compete as full service banks.
00:40:41.782 - 00:41:16.520, Speaker C: Right? I mean the model I envisage is just a very plain vanilla payment processor that may appeal to kind of a very limited constituency. People will most likely most people will continue to have both commercial bank accounts and Fed accounts, for example, in the world I'm envisaging. So yeah, I think that they'd have to be concerned, but I mean, it's not like a threat to their business model. They just have to be concerned about competing more vigorously for the payment services.
00:41:17.050 - 00:41:48.334, Speaker A: And do you think that this could also have an effect on the fractional reserve banking system? And if so, I have seen some other academic papers that say that if fractional reserve was affected that that could also, and presumably if that became less common, that that could have an effect on the creation of credit and even affect monetary policy. Do you agree with that? And if so, what do you think those effects would be?
00:41:48.532 - 00:42:54.878, Speaker C: Well, that's a big question. I think that banks would continue to I mean, the so called fractional reserve banking model is exactly the business of banking. Bankings are in the business of creating money when they extend loans against good business prospects or good collateral, and they issue their deposit liabilities to be redeemable on short notice, on demand, typically for currency. And so it's exactly that stipulation and the demand deposit liability that makes banks dependent on reserves and currency. The fact that they have fractional reserves is hardly relevant, I don't think. As long as they're running their business model in a responsible manner, the amount of reserves they have on hand, they always have the option of borrowing. Reserves from each other on the interbank market or borrowing reserves at the last resort at the discount window at the Fed if they're in need of reserves.
00:42:54.878 - 00:43:42.770, Speaker C: So I don't see how the business of banking necessarily interacts with what I'm talking about, what we're talking here, which is about the processing of payments. The processing of payments entails the debiting and crediting of accounts. How do we keep the account safe, secure, how do we transfer information rapidly at little cost? How do we keep the ledger secure? These are the important questions in any database management system. But these questions are very, very different than the question of how should a bank be permitted to extend credit, to, say, an entrepreneur? To me, that's a very different question that I don't really see how it directly bears on this question of processing payments.
00:43:43.430 - 00:43:55.430, Speaker A: Right. It's more about where people are keeping their money in order to then later make payments. So if they're keeping it in a commercial bank versus at the central bank.
00:43:55.770 - 00:44:26.370, Speaker C: Like I said though, but the private banks can compete for those deposits. They might actually have to pay a higher deposit rate to retain those deposits. Or they can borrow the reserves on the interbank market. Or they can access the reserves from the Fed at a higher cost. So they're just going to have to compete. So again, it's more like about how are these banks going to have to up their game, so to speak, to kind of retain these deposits?
00:44:26.870 - 00:44:48.862, Speaker A: You've written that bitcoin is essentially what you view as like a promising payment system, but that as money. Maybe you view it as less than ideal and also you view it as having a less than ideal monetary policy. So I was curious, just on this payment system aspect, how you view it competing.
00:44:49.026 - 00:46:27.800, Speaker C: Well, right. So, as many people have commented in terms on the payment side, I think that the underlying model is, of course, tremendously inefficient. And it's designed to be inefficient, in a way, kind of the proof of work that underlies. The clearing of payments in Bitcoin is kind of the cost one has to bear to make it a permissionless system without any central trusted third party to do the accounting. But nevertheless, in spite of that property that one thing that is true is that given the current structure, given the current infrastructure of the worldwide banking system, the correspondent banking system in know the kind of the quasi monopoly status, say, of Western Union and making international remittances, that I could see kind of a role for something like Bitcoin to kind of bypass the correspondent banking system or to bypass Western Union as a relatively efficient way to process payments. So in that sense, I kind of see bitcoin as being kind of promising, and also promising to the extent that it should spur competition in the kind of conventional space to promote competition so that these banks are motivated. To do better to kind of use their standard database management systems to extend their lines of communication to make World Global Banking kind of operate more seamlessly than it does at present.
00:46:28.750 - 00:46:56.900, Speaker A: Something that I find interesting about your take here, about how it's more promising as a payment system and has less than ideal money and monetary policy, is that actually I view bitcoin as succeeding so far primarily on the strength of maybe the monetary policy. Most people really are treating it as a digital gold right now, rather than as a payment system or digital cash. So why do you think that is?
00:46:57.670 - 00:47:50.974, Speaker C: Well, I think that inherently, it's very difficult to displace kind of a local unit of account, right? I mean, when you go pay your rent, assuming you're in the United States, your monthly rental payment is denominated in dollars. And so if you're selling your services and accepting bitcoin as payment, you receive the bitcoin as payment, and you you're all happy about that. And then tomorrow you wake up and you notice that bitcoin has depreciated 20% relative to the US. Dollar, and suddenly your rental payment just went up by 20% overnight. And you're going like, what the heck happened? Of course, the very opposite could have happened. Maybe the bitcoin would have appreciated and you would have been happy. But the whole point is that you are exposed to exchange rate risk.
00:47:50.974 - 00:48:41.698, Speaker C: And people do not like exchange rate risk when they're trying to manage their payments. They want something more stable. When they're making their everyday payments, they want to make things more predictable. And so the very properties, the monetary properties of bitcoin, which is to hold the money supply, basically fixed. It means that the demand, as the demand for bitcoin fluctuates, it's going to cause very, very volatile fluctuations in the bitcoin exchange rate, making it basically very unsuitable for making high frequency payments like paying your workers or paying your rent. On the other hand, its monetary policy is kind of probably arguably very good for as a long run store of value. So if you're willing to live with the volatility that it might not be a bad place to park a bit of your wealth as kind of a long run store of value.
00:48:41.698 - 00:49:05.500, Speaker C: So that's what kind of motivated my comment, that I can see it as a flight to safety, security, or is it kind of a long run store of value, kind of something the digital equivalent to, say, some sort of commodity like gold. But that as kind of an everyday monetary payment instrument. It is probably not likely to be taken up anytime soon.
00:49:06.190 - 00:49:16.640, Speaker A: And what do you think of a currency devoted to interbank transfers such as XRP? Does that make sense? And if so, why do you think it hasn't really taken off yet?
00:49:17.250 - 00:50:11.774, Speaker C: Well, I don't think these things are taking off because fundamentally, the system we have in place is ultra efficient. In the sense I know some of your listeners are going to fall off their chairs when I say that, but in the sense that, again, one really has to sit down and ask, what is this fundamentally all about? And this is all fundamentally about debiting and transferring debiting and crediting accounts in a ledger. This is not rocket science. I can do it on my Excel spreadsheet here on my computer, right? I mean, it's just debiting one account and crediting the other. So at a fundamental level, this is not rocket science. And if you can trust an entity to do the bookkeeping, it's very efficient to have an accountant just do the debiting and crediting. You have to worry about security, of course.
00:50:11.774 - 00:51:01.120, Speaker C: You have to worry about resilience, you have to worry about keeping backup copies, you have to worry about a whole bunch of stuff. But this is standard. This is just standard problems that people who manage databases have had to contend with for a very long time. Enter kind of the bitcoin kind of model, the blockchain based or kind of something quasi in between, like XRP, where you want to replace this designated record keeper with some sort of more communal effort in the case of XRP, maybe some sort of designated nodes. In the case of bitcoin, you're opening it up to anybody in the community that wants to become a miner. They can become basically an accountant and contribute to the accounting effort of maintaining the ledger in Bitcoin. That is a very, very different type of model.
00:51:01.120 - 00:52:07.718, Speaker C: This consensus based model of recording communal information, like the could be communal information in general, like the type of information we keep at a library, at a public library. And this happens to be information in a spreadsheet of digital accounts of money. Whenever you bring a community to get involved in managing a database, you introduce all sorts of problems, right? You have to achieve consensus, it's kind of tough to achieve consensus, and it becomes more and difficult to achieve consensus the larger the group is. And it's not impossible. And I tip my hat to bitcoin for actually solving this problem. But what's true at the same time is despite whatever merits this consensus based approach has, it's inherently more expensive. And so unless you have a pressing need for a consensus based record keeping system, like, why would you want one anyways? Even people who hold bitcoin often hold it through a trusted intermediary, like coinbase, for example.
00:52:07.718 - 00:52:35.454, Speaker C: So people have demonstrated their willingness. They'd love to trust their intermediaries. Why would you want to hold something that bypasses that trust? Well, there might be some reasons. Some people just might not trust the government. Some people might not trust the central bank. Some people like permissionless, access to payments, fine, but it's going to cost you. And for most, people are just not worried about stuff like that.
00:52:35.454 - 00:53:15.302, Speaker C: I'm very happy. I get my paycheck. I get paid through the banking system. Sometimes we complain about the fees that banks charge, but the answer to that is just let's encourage more competition. But by and large, the banking system does a pretty good job, or can do a pretty good job. And to the extent that it doesn't like in terms of corresponding banking system worldwide, the answer to that is not bitcoin. The answer to that is just to let banks encourage banks to talk to each other more directly so that I can bypass the correspondence structure.
00:53:15.302 - 00:53:32.786, Speaker C: Instead of going through a chain of correspondence, just open up a direct telephone line. What could be easier than bank A in the United States, talking to bank B in Italy, just directly? So that's kind of how I see things stand. My broad view on things for you.
00:53:32.808 - 00:54:08.890, Speaker A: As a consumer, let's say that we're five years, ten years in the future, and there's central bank digital dollars as well as these stablecoins on public blockchains that are pegged to USD. Which would you prefer to hold? And I know there's different models of stablecoins. So which model of stablecoin would you put most faith in? Like one that is backed by reserves, one that's crypto collateralized, like MakerDAO, or like a Senord shares model of a stablecoin? Well, it's a two part question.
00:54:09.040 - 00:54:45.618, Speaker C: Yeah, for under $250,000, I would hold it in a US bank. There's no stable coin in the world that can beat that. I mean, there's federal deposit insurance covers that account. It's completely stable. I know that when I go to the ATM, I can withdraw my bank account at par, and that if the bank ever got in trouble, that my account is fully insured up to $250,000. And indeed, in a crisis, the insurance is probably going to go up. So there's no stable coin in the world, private stablecoin in the world that can match that stability.
00:54:45.618 - 00:56:01.520, Speaker C: Already but I think that the point you're trying to make is that these stablecoins do not need to rely on any government insurance regime. Their value is guaranteed by kind of a verifiable set of assets that they hold. And you asked me the question, which of these would I find kind of more desirable, safer? Yeah, it's not entirely clear to me which ones I would because as a student of monetary history, I'm very familiar with what is called unilateral exchange rate pegs, which is basically where a country tries to peg its currency against, say, the US dollar on a unilateral basis. And the way it does that is by accumulating sufficient US dollar reserves or US treasuries to back up the promises of meeting the redemptions at the par exchange rate it promises. Almost every attempt to do that in history has basically failed. And I'm not sure why I would expect anything different to happen with these stable coins that are emerging. It's conceivable, it's possible.
00:56:01.520 - 00:56:31.750, Speaker C: And like I said, the models that I know of that could be run reasonably well basically already exist today in the form of government money funds. So I'm not exactly sure what's new here, except I suppose possibly that they would enable a user to make, say, cross border payments more efficiently. I guess that would be one reason why you might want to use one of these stablecoins.
00:56:32.430 - 00:56:51.360, Speaker A: A lot of people espouse the potential for blockchain technology to bank the unbanked, but at least I think so far it's really barely made any inroads in that effort. So why not? Or why do you think that hasn't happened? And what do you think needs to happen for us to get there?
00:56:51.890 - 00:57:42.160, Speaker C: Well, I don't know why people think blockchain is a solution to the unbanked problem. I mean, blockchain, like I said, is a consensus based record keeping technology that might be desirable if you want permissionless, access to a database, and if you don't trust a third party to do the accounting. But most people who are unbanked don't have those problems. They're perfectly willing to have permissioned accounts and they're perfectly willing for a banker to do the debiting and crediting of their checking accounts. So it's not like one can wave the magic blockchain and expect the unbanking problem to go away. And indeed, like I said, blockchain is an inherently more inefficient way to conduct information transfer relative to a centralized system.
00:57:42.710 - 00:58:03.080, Speaker A: I think the idea is that a lot of banks don't find the unbanked population kind of desirable as customers. Whereas if you can just open a blockchain wallet, then you have a way to safely store money where you don't need kind of like the approval of a bank. I think that's sort of the thinking.
00:58:03.450 - 00:58:32.030, Speaker C: No, that's a good point, actually. That is a good point. So I think that a part of this depends on what unbanked you're talking about. I'm not sure if you're speaking of the unbanked in the United States or the globally unbanked. I'm not sure that the unbanked in the United States kind of suffer from this. So, for example, compare Canada to the United States, and the unbanked issue in Canada is much less pronounced. It's almost virtually non existent, in fact.
00:58:32.030 - 00:59:19.760, Speaker C: So there is a question of what exactly is driving this phenomenon of unbankedness in the United States. Is it regulatory? Are banks being prevented in some way for regulatory reasons from reaching a particular constituency? I don't know for sure. I think one would have to look into that. But you're right that in the sense, to the extent that imagine, well, I guess even opening up a treasury direct account, what sort of information do you need? You need basically your address. You have to identify yourself. So there's that information requirement. I guess what you're suggesting is imagine you have access to a payment system where you could really just open up an account with no need to identify who you are.
00:59:19.760 - 01:00:05.194, Speaker C: The equivalent, I guess, of holding cash, for example. I guess that would encourage people to open up digital accounts. I have to grant you that. And I think that could be desirable along that dimension. But like I said, in many jurisdictions, like in Canada, for example, the population is 100% banked, virtually fully banked, and it's done under a very conventional banking system. So it's not entirely clear to me that the solution to the problem of unbanked is kind of like a blockchain based payment system. It could be it could play a role.
01:00:05.194 - 01:00:36.390, Speaker C: I mean, I'm not going to rule it out entirely, but to me it's like, gee, if we've got a constituency that's unbanked, why is it the case? Is it a regulatory hurdle? Is it something we have to maybe? Is it something that a central bank could get in and provide a basic public service? I think that that would be the more natural way to attack this problem of unbankedness than just kind of hinging my hopes on kind of some blockchain sort of solution that, like I said, is probably not a solution.
01:00:37.130 - 01:00:48.662, Speaker A: All right, well, we have run out of time. There's just so many topics we could have covered. But it's been so great having you on the show. Where can people learn more about you and the St. Louis Fed?
01:00:48.806 - 01:01:30.440, Speaker C: Oh yeah, well, of course, naturally we've got Google and you can Google the St. Louis Fed come to our website and of course you can Google my name and I have my website up there as well as you, I think, alluded to. I have a blog post, a blog, I should say, that I run. It's called MacroMania, and I have several posts that relate to cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
