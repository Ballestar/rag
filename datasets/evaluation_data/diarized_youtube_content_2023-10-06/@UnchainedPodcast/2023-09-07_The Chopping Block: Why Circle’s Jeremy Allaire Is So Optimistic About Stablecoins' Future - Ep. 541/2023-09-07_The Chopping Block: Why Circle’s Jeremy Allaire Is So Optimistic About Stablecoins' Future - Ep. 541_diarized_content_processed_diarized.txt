00:00:00.650 - 00:00:21.930, Speaker A: There's going to be a new law in the United States for payment stablecoins. And payment stablecoins are going to be legally defined as cash equivalent digital cash instruments in the US financial system. And when that happens, that's a great thing, and it will create a consistent, clear way for a very vibrant, competitive market to emerge. Not a dividend.
00:00:22.010 - 00:00:23.242, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quant.
00:00:23.306 - 00:00:25.922, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:25.986 - 00:00:28.482, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:28.626 - 00:00:31.590, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:31.930 - 00:00:33.986, Speaker B: ETH is the ultimate DeFi.
00:00:34.018 - 00:00:36.600, Speaker D: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:37.530 - 00:00:56.362, Speaker C: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, first, quick intros. We've got Robert, the crypto, connoisseur and Czar of superstate. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet. Today we've got a special guest, Jeremy Alair, stablecoin steward and CEO at Circle.
00:00:56.362 - 00:01:13.886, Speaker C: And finally, you got myself, I'm Azeeb, the head hide man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat. Nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. Jeremy, we've been trying to get you on the show for a while. Great to finally have you here. How are you doing? How's life in cryptoland?
00:01:14.078 - 00:01:38.234, Speaker A: It's great. It's exciting, never dull. No, it's really good, it's really good. There's a mean there's a lot going on. Obviously we'll touch on a lot of different things, but I've been working in this for 1011 years and I've never been more optimistic about where we're at on so many levels. So I think it's a super exciting time.
00:01:38.432 - 00:02:11.240, Speaker C: Last time I saw you, it must have been over six months ago, I think, last time I saw you. And so I haven't seen you since the banking crisis, which I think everybody in this industry has had their kind of near death experience, and I think for you guys, that was probably the closest that you've had to having one of those. Obviously, it wasn't literally near death, but I think from the perspective of the market, everybody was terrified about what was happening. For those of us who maybe weren't paying attention at that time, give us a bit of a recap of what happened and what you learned personally from going through that experience.
00:02:12.010 - 00:03:09.260, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Actually, we've had multiple near death experiences as a company over ten years, so it's sort of life in crypto land. But in all seriousness, look, I think there's a few first of all important backdrops, which is that as an industry, obviously access to the banking system has been a challenge for virtually every company that's been in this industry for a long time. And there are lots of different reasons for that. In some ways, actually, Circle has been really fortunate because we set out to be regulated and licensed and operate with a high level of compliance. I think a company like Circle has historically had really good access to the banking infrastructure that's out there. And that's a big part of the promise of USDC, obviously.
00:03:09.260 - 00:04:36.674, Speaker A: And that comes from both what Circle does and also what Coinbase does, and basically being always having great both retail and institutional TradFi rails that connect the existing traditional financial system to stablecoins and to digital dollars and what that is. So that's been a huge part of what's there. And I think coming as a company, we've always tried to sort of always up level the infrastructure that sort of sits behind USDC. And so that's like a constant for us and will never be done right. And we talk about the future and what that looks like, but we for a very long time have been trying to up level who are the kinds of custodians that will hold cash, what is the transparency and rigor and protections of the underlying market infrastructure that sits behind USDC? And what's the redundancy basically of there's sort of like where money is held and then there's sort of the transactional layer, which is basically how can people who have access to the banking system, whether it's in the US. Or internationally, how can they really easily create and redeem USDC? And so we've always been trying to basically up level that and have more and more redundancy. And as you kind of go back to the end of 2022 in particular, some pretty dramatic things took place, which have been talked about a lot in a lot of places.
00:04:36.674 - 00:05:32.118, Speaker A: But it's really the end of 2022 that began many aspects of what became a broader sort of not just US domestic banking crisis, but also a broader, what I'll call debanking crisis for the entire crypto industry. And so a huge starting point was basically the collapse of FTX and essentially the fears that existed that Silvergate Bank had some kind of huge exposure to FTX. And that actually caused the first set of runs on Silvergate. And it caused a lot of companies to say, wow, well, we really feel exposed to just this hyper concentration risk with a bank like Silvergate. And so you started to see people try and have more. And we had already launched like Redundancy, you had Silvergate, you had Signature. These were like popular US banks for providing kind of interoperability at the same been.
00:05:32.118 - 00:06:13.998, Speaker A: So we've been adding Redundancies at the same time. Also, we're basically trying to up level the reserve infrastructure. So we made a huge partnership last year with BlackRock. And as part of that partnership, we created something with them called the Circle Reserve Fund. And basically it's operational today. It's been operational since basically late last year, but it was kind of fully operational coming into Q One, which is basically that there's an SEC registered and supervised fund that holds historically, it was holding about 80% of the reserves of USDC. Right now, it's about 95% of the reserves of USDC.
00:06:13.998 - 00:06:23.362, Speaker A: And so it's registered and supervised with an independent board, an independent audit, and it has protections that come from being an SEC supervised vehicle.
00:06:23.506 - 00:06:26.920, Speaker C: Does that fund only hold the Treasuries or does it also hold some of the cash?
00:06:28.330 - 00:07:17.266, Speaker A: I'll walk you through kind of where it is today. But effectively, initially it was basically all holding Treasuries. So that was sort of we had 20% in cash, 80% in Treasuries. But the power of it is that basically, not only is this sort of registered structure, it has daily transparency. And so unlike any other dollar, stable, at least in the world, you can go to the USDXX ticker to search in your search engine and you can actually see down to every single instrument exactly what is there, exactly the duration, exactly any kind of counterparties that are embedded in that. And you can just see that. So very high level of transparency and the fund itself and the underlying security instruments are custodied with basically the safest custodian in the world, a globally systemically important bank.
00:07:17.266 - 00:07:56.222, Speaker A: That custody is over 25 trillion assets. So really strong market infrastructure that's there. So we've been moving to that. The area that always had the most risk though, was exposure to the traditional banking system. And it's not like a company like Circle or pick any of your portfolio. Companies can call Morgan Chase and say, will you hold cash reserve accounts? For me, my business is this open blockchain crypto thing and that doesn't really happen. And so the up leveling of banks that hold assets has been something we've been constantly pursuing.
00:07:56.222 - 00:08:44.594, Speaker A: And so for us, on the cash side, we largely had, because of the industry, we're in the cash piece. We either held limited amounts in what we call these transaction banks, which are basically dealing with settlement, the in and out, every day of things, and then another limited amount spread across what are mostly like mid size regional banks that would hold these reserves. Right. So in some ways, we were constrained by the capacity of the banking sector to do business with companies like us and the like. And we're like at the top of the list in terms of compliance and rigor and all this sort of stuff. And so we have that high threshold. Now, if you walk into early 2023, you had a couple of other things happen.
00:08:44.594 - 00:10:04.906, Speaker A: So in January, the federal regulators, banking regulators, basically came out with new guidance that essentially said, banks, you're basically forbidden from doing anything that directly touches blockchains. And it was like a huge spook. And then all of a sudden, a lot of banking institutions started to kind of throw up more challenges, right? And so that was like signaling. And then another set of things started to happen which is basically, there know, wave after wave of SEC enforcement actions that started getting launched starting in January and then in February, and then the very beginning of March. And there were big scares around a lot of things, but you started to see all this happen and then effectively all at once in one week period, you had basically three bank failures. And these are three banks, two of which were like the pipes that were like transaction settlement for USDC insurance subrogate, and one of them, which was a mid sized bank, which was Silicon Valley bank. Now, I think for us it's a fascinating story, which is that there was a set of news that came out which everyone probably remembers well, which is that SVB had failed to raise capital with Goldman Sachs.
00:10:04.906 - 00:10:49.994, Speaker A: And so people started to get very concerned. We had actually, just previous to that, like, literally like a week or two before that, had actually successfully onboarded the ability to hold cash with a giant GSID for USDC, but limited to a couple billion. Like, it was sort of like, okay, the appetite's this, but like, that's a big deal. So Wednesday comes, and then basically by Thursday morning, there's like a credit rating issue. Silvergate was actually literally being closed on that Wednesday. And there were rumblings about exposure on balance sheet, risk on Signature. I mean, it was a very stressful kind of moment.
00:10:49.994 - 00:10:57.200, Speaker A: And so we took a decision to sweep everything that we had into this GSIB. They don't like me using their name.
00:11:00.050 - 00:11:03.162, Speaker C: I see, but I thought they limited you to only 2 billion.
00:11:03.306 - 00:11:32.890, Speaker A: By that Thursday, there was a full on US. Banking cris going on, and basically all the regional banks were getting drawn down. And so the Gsids were basically getting huge amounts of deposits coming and people basically saying, I want to move XXX. And if you go back and you look over the course of that end of week and into early the following week, there was this giant exodus of regional bank capital into GSIBs.
00:11:33.710 - 00:11:38.746, Speaker C: By the way, just for those who are not familiar, GSIBs stands for globally systemically important bank. So they're the biggest banks in the world.
00:11:38.768 - 00:12:04.990, Speaker A: Too big to fail. Too big to fail. Right. So there was this sort of rotation. And so effectively, it was like, okay, hey guys, there's a banking crisis. We need to move $9 billion, kind of thing. So we basically undertook all the instructions to do that, and we were effective in that with the exception of one wire, or roughly one wire, so to speak, that didn't land on Thursday, and that was Silicon Valley bank.
00:12:04.990 - 00:12:50.100, Speaker A: And so the context is we're dealing with constraints of being a company in this industry. We're dealing with multiple transactional infrastructure failures, and we're dealing with a regional banking crisis and all this. And I think the really unfortunate thing is that because essentially signature bank was being seized, our ability to kind of maintain 24/7 Minting redemption was closed on that weekend. It had never been closed before. I mean, basically and it was closed on that weekend. You couldn't do it through coinbase, you couldn't do it through circle. And so the combination of that and then concern about are these reserves going to know moved et, caused panic selling, which a lot of people profited from, obviously.
00:12:50.100 - 00:13:14.486, Speaker A: But then the interesting thing is that because of the work that we had been doing to up level our infrastructure, we literally were able to open on Monday with new transactional banking infrastructure, with new banks, and with actually the reserve infrastructure, actually the strongest it had ever been. Like, with the best reserve infrastructure, with the most that's Jeremy just to paint.
00:13:14.518 - 00:13:32.206, Speaker C: The like this whole weekend. So everybody, I think here remembers that weekend as being one of the most harrowing weekends in not just crypto, but in finance, period. Where were you? Were you like at home? Did you sleep at all that weekend? Paint us the picture of you personally, where were you and what was that like?
00:13:32.388 - 00:13:34.990, Speaker A: Yeah. So I was actually in Dubai.
00:13:35.490 - 00:13:36.770, Speaker C: You were in Dubai.
00:13:38.230 - 00:14:05.226, Speaker A: And actually I was actually going to be spending the weekend with my son who was on break. And then I was going on to Europe for work. And so it was like this really great thing. And he had flown in and I remember he came in and I was like, there's this thing and I don't know what's going to happen. The weekend just kind of got and it was really difficult because I was 9 hours ahead of the East Coast and 12 hours ahead of the West Coast. So that just made so all the.
00:14:05.248 - 00:14:08.620, Speaker C: News broke like at evening time for you basically.
00:14:12.430 - 00:14:51.670, Speaker A: At this point. But yeah, it was a pretty busy weekend. I think there was a lot of things about it that were fascinating. I think one was we communicated on the Saturday, like we have this and part of that was that over the weekend a market developed literally over the weekend a market developed to purchase what would essentially be receivables from the FDIC in the event that the bank were to fail. And so these were basically, people were basically large capital markets. Companies, like huge Wall Street companies were basically bidding or dealing in terms around like you could get $0.85 on the dollar or whatever it was.
00:14:51.670 - 00:15:39.014, Speaker A: And so the combination of our balance sheet and that, we're like, we're good, we're going to be able to do this. But the fascinating thing was we opened on Monday and we were able to be up and operational even though we had seen all these other pipes fail, all these things go off. But it was a pretty intense week. So now on the other side of that, like I just said earlier, right, USDC is reserved in probably the single best, lowest credit risk cash custodian for dollars in the world. And it has 95% transparency on every single instrument. And we've actually been able to improve it by being able to use what are called essentially triparty overnight collateralized, treasury repos as well. And you can see if you go into USDXX, exactly what it is.
00:15:39.014 - 00:16:37.078, Speaker A: And those are counterparties are also all GSIB. So the strength is actually, we're stronger now than we were. We have greater transparency than we were. And actually the fascinating thing is that we now are pretty dramatically expanding the banking infrastructure globally that sits behind USDC, bringing online more banks in more markets. The idea basically is we're building this global liquidity network. And what that means is that if you bank in Singapore, or you bank in Hong Kong, or you bank in Brazil, or you bank wherever, that you within the domestic banking system will be able to directly create and redeem USDC locally facing circle. And so that relates to another thing that happened, and I think all of you probably can relate to this, which is essentially over the course of that week, 5000 plus companies were just debanked.
00:16:37.078 - 00:16:57.010, Speaker A: I mean, effectively. So they were literally debanked. And so there was this giant debanking. And when you look at that all combined, you had this debanking. You had wave after wave after wave of enforcement action and other things. And it created an environment where basically the narrative was, get the hell out of the US. Get your money out of the US.
00:16:57.010 - 00:17:25.494, Speaker A: The US financial system is fucked. Any exposure here, anything that has anything to do with the US. Is like, you're screwed. And so that kind of created what I like to call a flight from safety. It was literally a flight from safety, what would typically be thought of as you're compliant, you're embedded in some of the biggest market infrastructure companies in the US. You have this good sound footing. You've got the best auditors.
00:17:25.494 - 00:17:57.926, Speaker A: You've got all of this fiduciary stuff wrapped around you, like what would typically be considered like, oh, that was somehow all of a sudden perceived as completely exposed to total risk. And you're now going to go to something where you don't even know where the banks are. You don't even know if there are banks, and there's no supervision at all, and there's no proper audits at all. And you're like, that feels safer. Now, are you referring to Tether? There's lots of offshore stables, but there are some, lots of them.
00:17:58.028 - 00:17:58.920, Speaker C: So many.
00:17:59.290 - 00:18:07.960, Speaker B: Well, I think if you made a movie or a podcast on this, you clearly have to call it escape from safety or whatever.
00:18:09.470 - 00:18:13.238, Speaker C: Flight from safety, that is a great name for a documentary.
00:18:13.334 - 00:19:13.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating, right? It's fascinating. But I think where we are today is not just like circle and stuff, but that has moderated, right? I think that has moderated people have actually seen no, actually there's more and more banking infrastructure. Maybe there's a level of risk management around that, that's different now. And so it is probably more challenging for some companies and probably fine for others. And the progression here and this gets into a little bit of regulatory stuff is the other big story of 2023 is that basically everywhere in the world there are now laws around stablecoins that are coming on the books. So there's like clear stablecoin laws in Japan emerging, singapore about to come in Hong Kong, in UAE, in the entire EU about to be issued in the UK. And there's like a bill that's actually moved into the House of Congress, in the House of Representatives, in the US.
00:19:13.630 - 00:19:56.410, Speaker A: And so the question of are stablecoins here to stay? Are they going to be treated as a part of the global financial system? That has been so I think in some ways that clarity has been really helpful and that's why we're actually seeing more and more traditional financial companies that are moving in and they're plugging in. And I think that's a really positive backdrop because you wouldn't have thought that, right? But that is what's been happening. It's another story of 2023 is regulatory clarity for stablecoins is arriving. And so to me that's a huge unlock on the future. Like a huge unlock.
00:19:56.830 - 00:20:33.270, Speaker C: So speaking of other financial companies getting into stablecoins, one of the big stories from, I think it was about a month ago, is PayPal actually we have a running bet on the show as to what the eventual market cap of the PayPal USD stablecoin is going to be. I believe I am the largest, I am the highest bidder at 500 million at the end of the year. Robert is the most bearish. It was just announced today. I believe that PayPal USD is getting listed on coinbase. So it looks like there will be a significant experiment. I don't know what that means, but I appreciate you pointing that out Jeremy.
00:20:33.270 - 00:20:48.490, Speaker C: So I am curious to get your take. I know that you have to be very diplomatic about it because they are a competitor and whatever, but I would love to hear you talk shit about PayPal USD and why you think it's going to fail.
00:20:49.390 - 00:21:52.202, Speaker A: Mean, look, there's a lot of different things that I would say. I think the first is that today for dollar stable coins, there are two that have a pretty significant and entrenched position. Some that entrenched position is concentrated in certain emerging markets or Asian markets or certain centralized exchange platforms and that's slow to shift. And then I think for USDC we're pretty entrenched in DeFi, I think more broadly in kind of payment applications where traditional firms are comfortable adopting that and using that. And actually just as a note, I think at the heart of this, when we think about this from a circle perspective is we really think about what we do as providing market neutral infrastructure. It's really important to how we think about what we do. We think about USDC as a network utility, as like an Internet network utility.
00:21:52.202 - 00:22:10.694, Speaker A: And it's a market neutral network utility. Market neutral network infrastructure. We're like a platform and utility company. We are not competing for end users. We are not competing for merchants. We're not competing at that level. And so that's been really interesting for us.
00:22:10.694 - 00:23:19.574, Speaker A: We've been able to build partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, with Stripe and Block, with Robinhood and Coinbase and MoneyGram and others. So we've been able to build partnerships with a huge array of companies, many of whom would view each other as like direct, arch competitors. And that's because we're a market neutral infrastructure company, and it's really important. So I think the question I would be asking is, is that important for Stablecoins? Does the digital dollar dial tone that people want to build on and compose with and integrate and use? Does market neutrality matter or not? And I think it does. I think it matters a lot. And I think user preference, developer preference, ecosystem preference, that's a really important component to it. And so while it is true that PayPal as a company has a lot of users of different products and services that they offer, they're in the business of competing for eyeballs, and they're in the business of competing for kind of payment processing.
00:23:19.574 - 00:24:41.474, Speaker A: And so when I think about all the different retail companies in the world and all the different payments companies in the world and the like, I believe that we're going to be really effective in being that market neutral company. And so, literally, yesterday was yesterday, the day before we announced a partnership with Mercado Libre and Mercado Pago, which is mercado Pago is the largest fintech in all Latin America, and they have a huge number of users. They're part of the broader Mercado Libre, which is like a $60 billion market cap company, the Amazon of Latin America, and they're rolling out USDC, and they just started in one market. And obviously we'll see that expand. And would Mercado Libre do that with PayPal when they're direct competitors? I mean, that's an interesting I just I think the market neutral infrastructure piece is really important. And then, look, I think there's been a lot of attempts by lots of different companies to kind of get into the crypto market. For example, like several years ago, actually, when PayPal said, we're going to launch Bitcoin, buy, sell, hold, we're going to launch this, I know the crypto community was like this was like over the moon.
00:24:41.474 - 00:25:06.014, Speaker A: This is incredible. This is like 400 million people are going to start buying Bitcoin. And it was like this huge thing. And there was actually a bid that came from that. But the reality was, if I'm a person in the United States, and I do, how do I buy? Like, it's not hard to buy Bitcoin. I think there's a little bit of the same thing with ETFs which is if you want to get exposure to Bitcoin, it's not hard. You don't need an.
00:25:06.014 - 00:25:25.278, Speaker A: Like you can just go open up an account with a number of very credible companies and get Bitcoin actual. So I think there was a little bit of like the fact that there's a large user base must equal usage. It's a fallacy. It's like when Facebook launched payments in WhatsApp and messenger, people are like, they're.
00:25:25.294 - 00:25:25.906, Speaker C: Going to take over the world.
00:25:25.928 - 00:25:27.710, Speaker A: They have 2 billion users.
00:25:27.870 - 00:25:29.350, Speaker C: I totally agree with this.
00:25:29.500 - 00:25:35.958, Speaker A: Does anyone use Facebook for payments? Does any person other than someone on Facebook marketplace where you're forced into I.
00:25:35.964 - 00:25:43.594, Speaker C: Have one friend who pays me on Facebook and I'm always annoyed by it because I have to it's the only money I have in my there are.
00:25:43.632 - 00:26:22.390, Speaker A: Substitute goods and they're really good. And so that's the thing, it's like, what are the substitute goods and are they really good? And then it gets into what is the position of that company or that infrastructure and the like. And so look at the same right? I hope that they're successful. I hope that they make stablecoins a more important part of the way that their ecosystem interacts with the rest of the world. Because our vision is that stablecoins become the interoperability layer for the entire financial system and every payment wallet and everything in the world. And we want interoperability and we want everything happening on chain, and we want to see that that's good. We want to see that.
00:26:22.390 - 00:26:31.820, Speaker A: I'm sure that a lot of people were excited when their AOL account could send the email on the Internet, but did everyone become an.
00:26:35.310 - 00:26:37.930, Speaker C: AOL? PayPal is AOL is what you're saying?
00:26:38.080 - 00:27:14.854, Speaker A: I'm saying companies with large user bases that connect to open networks, like, that's a good thing. It does contribute to the growth of those open networks. But the open networks grow with entrepreneurship and builders and new companies and the like. I want to see open networks grow. And I think PayPal saying we're making a bet on open networks with dollars is a really good thing. It says a lot. And I do want to see success from that because I think that a vibrant competitive market is a very positive thing.
00:27:14.972 - 00:27:30.060, Speaker D: So to round this out, Jeremy, you are probably the best equipped to make a prediction in the chopping block prediction market. What do you think the market cap of PayPal USD will be on December 31 of this year?
00:27:30.690 - 00:27:38.714, Speaker C: Just a benchmark. Right now it's sitting at $43 million USDC. By comparison, sitting at 20 billion.
00:27:38.842 - 00:27:42.746, Speaker D: Sitting at 5 million issued, according to 5 million issued.
00:27:42.858 - 00:27:50.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I see. uninissued. I think Coin market cap is giving me a different number. Okay, CoinMap, 5 million issued. Okay.
00:27:50.312 - 00:27:51.922, Speaker A: I don't make predictions like that.
00:27:52.056 - 00:27:52.786, Speaker D: Come on.
00:27:52.888 - 00:27:53.730, Speaker A: I don't.
00:27:54.230 - 00:28:06.440, Speaker C: Hypothetically, if you were to make a prediction, bizarro World Jeremy makes a prediction. Not you, somebody else. So you can imagine making a bet. We're not betting. We're not betting people. We don't do that. Come on.
00:28:07.290 - 00:28:08.422, Speaker A: Not going to do that.
00:28:08.556 - 00:28:16.426, Speaker C: Okay. Refuses. All right, fine. What I am hearing from you, Jeremy, is bring it on. Is that a good encapsulation of what.
00:28:16.448 - 00:28:49.880, Speaker A: You just so I'll say a couple things. Yes. But what I'll also say is that there's going to be a new law in the United States for payment stablecoins. And payment stablecoins are going to be legally defined as cash equivalent digital cash instruments in the US. Financial system. And when that happens, that's a great thing, and it will create a consistent, clear way for a very vibrant, competitive market to emerge. And I expect many big companies to be in that.
00:28:49.880 - 00:29:37.302, Speaker A: Like, that is what we want to see. You want to see open, competitive markets. And in fact, we make the argument, Congress, all the time, which is that how do you compete in the digital currency space race? Do you try to out China China by doing a nationalized government run infrastructure? Or do you create open roads, open rules, open markets, and allow the market and open technology innovation to be the basis for how you compete? And that's clearly the answer for the United States. It historically has been the answer for the United States. It will be the answer for the United States, and there'll be a lot more competition. But I'm very comfortable competing in that market. I feel very good about what we're building and how we're building and the opportunity.
00:29:37.302 - 00:30:01.660, Speaker A: And the total addressable market for electronic dollars today is 25 trillion. That's a big total addressable market of electronic dollars that exist in the world. And if in ten years there's 5 trillion that are in these fully reserved dollar stablecoins digital dollars, et cetera, that's a huge space to grow into as well.
00:30:02.270 - 00:30:38.040, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, I want to shift topics a little bit, and let's talk a little bit more abstractly, less about kind of the nuts and bolts of circle and USDC and so on. But I want to talk a little about the kind of philosophical contrast between central bank digital currencies and stablecoins. So it's a topic that comes up again and again. It's one of the oldest debates in crypto. It seems like, more or less, at least within the US, there's a convergence that, hey, we don't want to have a centralized, Fed backed central bank digital currency. We wanted said to have private innovation to do.
00:30:38.040 - 00:30:54.970, Speaker C: You know, I was just chatting with somebody at Visa who works on central bank digital currency stuff, and it's the meme that never quite goes away. And of course, China was one of the very first to push central bank digital currency through the digital yuan. Tarun, I want to get your take.
00:30:55.120 - 00:31:10.446, Speaker B: The only thing I find CBDC is to be one of the most utterly boring concepts that exists within this industry. Like, you have all this stuff. Where you have to think about a lot more math and instead CBDCs are just like, how does McKinsey make increase its revenue?
00:31:10.478 - 00:31:11.060, Speaker A: This.
00:31:13.350 - 00:31:19.814, Speaker C: Explain that. I think a lot of people in our audience will not know what the hell you're talking about when you say that. What do you mean that?
00:31:20.012 - 00:32:09.830, Speaker B: When I think about CBDCs, I just think about really fancy consultant decks that say, like, hey, here's what a government can do. And they take the same deck, they change the flag on the front slide, and then they go to 20 different governments and they say, hey, here's this deck we made for you about what you can do to innovate with your currency. And it always gets like people who like, going to davos very excited. Unfortunately, those people couldn't tell you what a hash function is. So I don't really I just feel like CBDC doesn't feel like this thing that there's an entire class of people who love making money off of it because the thing never will exist. And it's just kind of this perpetual football.
00:32:10.810 - 00:32:13.682, Speaker C: Robert, okay, your take. Do you agree with Tarun?
00:32:13.826 - 00:32:28.134, Speaker D: I mean, I see where Tarun is coming from in that it's an idea that can be shopped to pretty much any nation with a currency, right? Totally. I do think the CBDCs will arrive in various countries.
00:32:28.262 - 00:32:29.434, Speaker A: I do think it's going to be.
00:32:29.472 - 00:32:39.114, Speaker D: Competitive with other digital implementations of a currency, whether it's stablecoins, whether it's legacy systems I think are going to exist.
00:32:39.162 - 00:32:40.560, Speaker A: Will it happen in the US?
00:32:41.010 - 00:32:41.422, Speaker C: Maybe.
00:32:41.476 - 00:32:42.974, Speaker D: Will it happen in the short term?
00:32:43.022 - 00:32:43.522, Speaker A: No.
00:32:43.656 - 00:33:24.154, Speaker D: Will it happen in China? Yes. Will it happen in Russia? I don't know. There is this inevitability where many countries will likely transform the way that their currency functions. And the idea that you can have some of the benefits that we've all grown to absolutely love from blockchains, which is transparency, instant settlement, some capabilities for automation. These are really good things. These are all like the virtues that got me excited about crypto in the first place and a lot of people excited about crypto. And the idea that you can bring some of these superpowers to a currency.
00:33:24.154 - 00:34:01.910, Speaker D: Yes, there's the Circle approach, but there's also the CBDC approach. And I think we're going to see it because I think it's superior to what exists. Yeah, Fed now is better than not Fed now. And I think a CBDC, even in the dollar, is better than Fed now. And so it's like, what takes over eventually. I don't want to bash on Circle and Jeremy, but is USDC going to be the monopolistic interpretation of the dollar? No, probably not. I think it's possible that the US government inevitably competes with Circle in the creation of a CBDC.
00:34:02.070 - 00:35:21.282, Speaker B: So I will say in my mind, the only thing that looks like a CBDC maybe quacks a little bit like a CBDC, and definitely walks like a CBDC is India's Payment Channel payment rails, which is actually successful, right? Basically, India went from zero people doing electronic payments to 700 or 800 million via this centralized identification system. But they made applications that use it have this ability to write sort of like open source, almost like smart contracts, actually, if you read the docs things that can be built on top of that. So I can make a little fintech that is able to give you a loan based on some of your prior data, which is like public at this. I wouldn't call it a blockchain, but it kind of bears a lot of resemblance to a blockchain thing. And it's actually crazy that they basically skipped credit cards completely. They skipped sort of conventional digital payments and they went even past WeChat, because in the WeChat super app model of the world, where you have payments done through a messenger or chat app, you kind of have this monopoly. That sort of owns, effectively, the app store of like, hey, if you're going to build something that uses this type of payment, you have to go through our app, right? Like, we've captured this, we take some tax against you.
00:35:21.282 - 00:36:16.626, Speaker B: But the Indian version is actually that the government's sort of almost CBDC is basically just an open source layer for people to write these types of apps on. And I think India is successful that because it doesn't have all the dog shit like, hey, we're going to Naval Gaze about what the definition of a CBDC is and what the boundaries of having a CBDC are and what permissions you should have. And oh, we're going to talk about everything other than the technical considerations. The Indian version of Aadhaar was literally only focused on what is the open source software and how can we build this, and the technology side. And that's why they were successful. But most of these other governments investigating this stuff are doing everything other than kind of the technical design, which is why it's just hard to view them as credible other than and it's just sort of like know, fighting each me.
00:36:16.648 - 00:37:12.982, Speaker C: Let me let me give my take real quick. And then I'll hand it to Jeremy because I know that he's itching to respond to points. So I think I take to rune sighting this in that I think CBDCs are mostly nonsensical. I think that in principle, one could build a CBDC that actually is substantively different than just an upgrade to the back end of a central bank. All central banks for many, many years have had digital ledgers, right, of course, because whatever, it's 2023, so this stuff is already digital, right? The thing that's interesting about a CBDC relative to just you have a digital real time gross settlement system, which is great that's what Fed now effectively is, is real time. Instead of, you know, settling at some fixed interval, that makes settling up kind of annoying. The thing about a blockchain system that's different is, I think, two fundamental things about a blockchain that's different.
00:37:12.982 - 00:37:42.954, Speaker C: And people often say they're like, well, CBDCs aren't decentralized. I don't think that's what matters from the perspective of what users and developers can do. I think the first thing that matters is that it's programmable. And no CBDC that I have ever seen that is actually going into anything like production has any programmability whatsoever. So your ability to basically know if A then B, you cannot do that in the ECNY, the Chinese central bank digital currency, there is no such thing. They do tout that. There is a blockchain.
00:37:42.954 - 00:38:19.786, Speaker C: There is no actual blockchain, there's no blocks, there's no chain. They do have hash functions and stuff like that, but who cares? Just having PKI with central bank infrastructure is just an improvement to authentication. It's not the same thing as what you get with Blockchains. So the first thing is programmability. Almost none of the CBDCs that are getting through to production have that. And then second is this idea of non sort of decoupling money from personhood and none of the CBDCs do that either. Right? And so that's one of the key things about blockchains, is that you can have a multi SIG, you can have non human agents, you can have AIS, whatever it is you want.
00:38:19.786 - 00:38:53.718, Speaker C: As long as there is a public private key, you can interact with money and they can be ephemeral. Even that concept does not exist in any CBDC. And I think that very much limits the design space of what you can do with CBDCs that you couldn't already do with real time gross settlement systems. And so that, I think, is the reason why most of these CBDCs are kind of window dressing. They're sort of yelling blockchain as loudly as you can while getting some budget to improve your infrastructure. Which is great. A lot of these central banks need infrastructure improvements, but it's not what stablecoins do and I don't think it ever will be.
00:38:53.884 - 00:40:16.110, Speaker A: Yeah, if I can respond, I think we think about this a lot, but not because we think that CBDCs are imminent or a threat or anything like that. We think about a lot because people ask us a lot. But I agree with a lot of what you said, Haseeb, and a few things I would share on this topic. I think the first is it is absolutely correct that most central banks need to continuously upgrade their core settlement infrastructure and that's not going to stop. And I'm a technologist, and so when I look at the core architecture of the dollar, it doesn't make me feel good because years ago I was in a meeting and I was talking to the chief Information officer of the Fed, I was like, what is the dollar? Tell me the tech spec, what is the architecture? What is the dollar? And he was basically saying, well, it's a cluster of Oracle databases in sun solaris machines in these redundant data centers and I was okay, okay, so that's the dollar, right? And then I'm like, okay, I interface with the dollar and it's FTP servers and common delimited text files. That's how you interface with the dollar. That is what movement of dollar is in the United States.
00:40:16.110 - 00:41:10.830, Speaker A: FTP it's CSV or whatever. I look at that, I'm like yes, we can improve that. That should be like there will be fiat and there'll be government obligation money and it should be continuously improved. And that is like a wholesale infrastructure thing. And there will be some countries, Allah, India, where they have a tip of the sort of mountaintop which is sort of retail exposed, which is there. I think that is innovation and I think that's real to your points, haseeb it's not solving the same set of problems that are being solved by So, which I want to come back to the other piece of this. That is, I think really important is just to acknowledge that the history of electronic money innovation in the west at least the history of electronic money innovation has been entirely private sector driven.
00:41:10.830 - 00:42:00.542, Speaker A: It's every single innovation and we can think about what innovations exist. The wire messaging system was a consortium of private sector actors building standards. The ATM machine was an innovation of the private sector. Credit card networks, debit card networks, innovations of the private sector PayPal innovation, apple Pay innovation, stablecoins, like all these things are private sector innovations. And there's a reason is that the private sector mobilizes and iterates on technology at a very, very different pace and has a very, very different set of incentives. The other fact is that 95% of electronic money in circulation is privately issued. It's not government issued, it's privately issued.
00:42:00.542 - 00:42:54.318, Speaker A: And there's, I think for many parts of the world there's a desire for there to be an air gap between your money and the government. And that's real. Now in some places you're not allowed to have that air gap, but in a lot of places that is. And in the west that air gap has been important. And so those are like big phenomenon. But then kind of when I think about why did I start circle, what is it that we were excited about? It was exactly the kinds of stuff you're talking about, which is basically, I believe that open networks, open protocols that have the reach of the Internet, that are continuously improving open source infrastructure and very specifically the innovations of cryptocurrency of blockchain networks and the programmability that comes from open compute services that are continuously upgraded as well. That's the innovation.
00:42:54.318 - 00:44:04.566, Speaker A: And so to me, we want internet scale money, we want internet scale secure programmable money, and we want to be in the continuous feedback loop of improvement that comes from open source technology. And that is not going to be built by governments, it just isn't. And so I do think there is this kind of like if I had magically had a license to access the Fed directly, which I don't right now, but if I had that, would I rather interface with a cryptographic primitive that's a distributed ledger technology or whatever than FTP servers and stuff? Yeah, I would much rather like as a technologist, I'd rather interface to an infrastructure that is so I do think I would love to support Fed now. And you'll probably see us do that. You'll probably see know yeah, you want to create and redeem USDC through Fed now, go for it. But you're moving into the digital currency. You can see us supporting Fed now where we allow for people to kind of move in and out through those rails.
00:44:04.566 - 00:44:11.946, Speaker A: And so as there are improvements in what central banks do, those can be positive things for Internet scale money.
00:44:12.048 - 00:44:35.010, Speaker C: Got it. Okay, so one more question. I know we're running up on time a little bit. One more question. I kind of want to go around the room and get people's reads on. So once upon a time, a very long time ago, jeremy knows backstory, but I was once working on a stablecoin way back in the day. And one of the questions at that time that really this is like 2017, 2018 really felt unsettled.
00:44:38.410 - 00:44:44.630, Speaker B: Instead of bald being the token for the rugging on base, we could have made bald your stablecoin.
00:44:44.970 - 00:45:03.100, Speaker C: That is true. So actually, funny enough, the name of the stablecoin we were working on was called USDC. USDC as the Circle thing at that time was not public. That was the name of Circle. So we had a bit of a name collision. Anyway, it's a long story we'll tell another day. But Jeremy did win.
00:45:03.100 - 00:46:20.406, Speaker C: His baldness overcame my baldness, and he ended up winning. But a big question at that time that many people were asking is will stablecoins? At that time, the dominant stablecoin was Tether, and today it is still the biggest stablecoin in existence. Will the architecture of Tether, which is basically you KYC on redemption, you KYC on minting, but you do not KYC holders. Anybody can hold it was a real question in 2017, will this continue as a status quo? And will we basically get a very different relationship with holders of money for something like a stablecoin than we will for traditional bank deposits? And it was unclear at that time. It seems like it's becoming more clear that for whatever reason, especially the stablecoin bill that's in Congress right now seems to contemplate basically keeping the status quo, which is KYC on redemption and minting. But for the most part, anybody in the world potentially can hold a stablecoin. I want to get a view from Robert Tarune and then Jeremy of do you think that persists indefinitely or are we in a kind of intermediary period where we get to enjoy the fruits of this freedom on chain and anybody can do anything.
00:46:20.406 - 00:46:24.920, Speaker C: But is this going to be short lived? What do you guys think? And if it changed, why did it change?
00:46:26.010 - 00:48:02.230, Speaker A: I would say one thing, which is that we have agency in the world as people. Nothing is predetermined, obviously and so the outcomes of those things are things that we have agency in. And so I spend a fair amount of my energy educating, advocating for policy that preserves the innovation of digital token instruments and open blockchain networks and what that is. And I think there's a lot of other people who have agency and who do that and that's the most important thing is that in a vacuum if governments just said this is what we'd expect, this is what the rules are and here they are, then we probably know what the outcome would be. But because we have agency and because there's actual product and technical innovation that's happening and it's establishing user preference. And the user preference is all around the world like individuals, entities, firms, others, society expresses its will ultimately and policy responds to the will of society. And so you couldn't put the genie back in the bottle that anyone can stream anything to anyone in the world even though if you had asked governments in 1998 or whatever, do you want anyone to be able to stream to anyone in your country without any restrictions? They'd say no fucking way.
00:48:02.230 - 00:49:05.450, Speaker A: Ban it, right? But user preference is established. And I do believe that's happened in many mediums on the internet and there's Section 230 and there's all these sort of things that were codified to basically establish open platforms and the free agency that comes with that in many respects and it's enshrined in the nature of the internet protocols themselves and all of this. And I think that's real, and I think that's durable. And I think that is now arriving into the financial system. And it's been decades in the works. And I think of the Internet as like an organism, and it's like the Internet organism is evolving, and we're all just part of that, contributing our ideas and computation and other things. And I think that the organism of the internet is evolving into adopting a financial system, an internet financial system and I think user preference in the world will prefer that and policy will respond to that preference.
00:49:05.450 - 00:49:13.854, Speaker A: That's my belief. And so that's like a very abstract answer to your question but it's what I actually believe.
00:49:14.052 - 00:49:15.360, Speaker C: That's a great answer.
00:49:16.290 - 00:50:31.298, Speaker A: And I think though, however, the problems that governments care about still exist, right? People don't want terrorists to be able to freely operate, they want to be able to enforce have effective enforcement of war powers in times of war or what are perceived to be extreme national security context. Someone who's building a nuclear weapon that might attack you or whatever that is, whatever you decide is that. And likewise generally there's like a social contract between financial intermediaries and the government that we don't want to just let criminals run over all of our stuff and do whatever they want and launder money. And so that's like a social contract that exists. The mechanisms through which the enforcement of those happen has to evolve. And so my own belief is that crypto has the answers. I actually think like zero knowledge proofs and cryptographic proofs and various forms of credentialing and attestations and other things can actually solve the problems better and preserve openness and privacy.
00:50:31.298 - 00:51:10.290, Speaker A: And that's where, again, I have agency. I can think about how do I solve these problems, how do we collectively solve these problems and keep pushing on them and pushing on them? Because we're going to solve it much faster than policymakers are. And then it gets established and entrenched and people say, yeah, of course I want a better, more transparent, but also private, secure, open thing that allows commerce to happen, more fluidly, allows financial services to be rendered more fairly equitably globally. I want that. Of course I want that. And policymakers are going to want that, too. So we have to actually think about what are the problems that governments are trying to solve for? And I don't want to solve for the totalitarian.
00:51:10.290 - 00:51:23.750, Speaker A: I get to see everything and social credit system, I don't want to solve for that. There are governments that want that. I don't want to solve for that. I want to solve for things that are enshrined in more traditionally classically liberal ideals.
00:51:24.650 - 00:51:56.830, Speaker C: That's great. Well, I will say, Jeremy, I know we're up on time so we have to wrap. But I think as an industry, we're very lucky to have somebody like you as an advocate. Because as much as it gets depressing sometimes seeing kind of the slings and arrows of regulation hitting our industry, it's folks like you who've been in this just been grinding for many years trying to make one particular vision come true that this industry is built on. So kudos to you for your service and please keep those USCC rails running because we all need them.
00:51:56.980 - 00:51:58.958, Speaker A: They're getting better and better every day.
00:51:59.124 - 00:52:02.238, Speaker C: Glad to hear that, Jeremy. Thanks for coming on.
00:52:02.324 - 00:52:03.098, Speaker A: Thanks, army.
00:52:03.194 - 00:52:05.620, Speaker C: See everybody next week. Like.
