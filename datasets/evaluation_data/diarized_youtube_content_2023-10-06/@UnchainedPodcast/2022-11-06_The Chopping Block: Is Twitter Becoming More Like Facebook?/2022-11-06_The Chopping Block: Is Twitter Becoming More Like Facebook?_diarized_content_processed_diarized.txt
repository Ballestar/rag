00:00:00.090 - 00:00:37.750, Speaker A: The actual decentralized alternative to Twitter today, which is de facto macedon, is still like a tiny nothing that nobody really cares about. I mean, it's cool, it's an awesome project, but in reality, it's like so small compared to what Twitter is. I don't know, it feels to me a little bit it feels a bit too shrill right now. And obviously we don't know what changes Elon is going to make. He's talked about freezing moderation decisions until they construct some kind of council. And that council is going to be making very large, important moderation decisions for the platform, which is basically exactly what Facebook has, if I recall. And so essentially, Twitter is going to become more like Facebook, which I'm not sure really how radical that is.
00:00:37.750 - 00:00:53.930, Speaker A: And also, for some reason, do people perceive it as radical on both sides, I think on the right, people are like, wow, that's like a radical change of open free speech. And on the left, they're like, oh, that's a radical reversion to allowing hate speech and all these other horrible things happen. To my mind, it's just basically turning Twitter into Facebook.
