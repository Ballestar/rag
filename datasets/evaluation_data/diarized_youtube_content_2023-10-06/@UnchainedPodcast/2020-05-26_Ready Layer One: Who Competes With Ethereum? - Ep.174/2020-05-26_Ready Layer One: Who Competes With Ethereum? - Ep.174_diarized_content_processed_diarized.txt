00:03:12.990 - 00:03:37.314, Speaker B: Welcome everyone, to our panel, where we've got a number of founders of layer one protocols, which I believe a year ago, maybe we were calling them ethereum killers, but I don't know if that's the term nowadays. Anyway, why don't we just have each of you just go around and say what it is that you're working on and where you're sheltering in place from?
00:03:37.512 - 00:03:45.620, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Zucky. I'm sheltering in place in Palo Alto, working on Cosmos. Just working on watching IBC right now.
00:03:46.010 - 00:03:56.920, Speaker E: Hi, my name is Rob. I work on Polkadot, which is a heterogeneous sharding platform. I'm hunkering down in the DMV in the DC area.
00:03:57.790 - 00:04:14.490, Speaker F: Hey, everyone. Amelia, co founder at near. Working on pretty much we just released Mainet and like, stage one and then kind of going to decentralize it over those months and beyond, actually, in Shanghai in China.
00:04:14.990 - 00:04:24.530, Speaker G: Hi. My name is Arthur Bregman. I'm a co founder of Tezos, China. Has been live for a bit over almost two years now, and I'm sheltering in place in Singapore.
00:04:25.350 - 00:04:50.940, Speaker B: Great. Well, thank you all for joining. So I actually wanted then all of us to also just give everybody kind of an overview of why we brought you all together. So why don't you each now just say what it is that your protocol does and kind of where in this stage of development you're at.
00:04:51.870 - 00:04:52.620, Speaker G: Cool.
00:04:52.990 - 00:05:39.026, Speaker D: I can go cosmos. So Cosmos is a software stack for building your own blockchain. And so the Cosmos Hub and a number of other blockchains like the Binance Dex chain, IRISnet, Kava, Terra have all been live on this software stack for about a year. But sort of the two pieces of this sort of vision of Cosmos, one piece was this idea of build your own blockchain. Everyone can have their own sort of customized, community driven layer one. And then the second piece was interoperating those blockchains. So in the year since we launched, since a bunch of these networks started to launch, we've been working on this interoperability framework called IBC.
00:05:39.026 - 00:05:56.990, Speaker D: And right now we're in the midst of Game of Zones, which is the sort of incentivized testnet sort of inspired by Game of Stakes, which was sort of the original incentivized testnet that we're sort of putting IBC through its paces. Expecting to launch IBC on the Cosmos hub later this summer.
00:05:57.410 - 00:06:41.686, Speaker E: Robert yeah, so I view that there's a design space of blockchain scalability. So what Polkadot does is it occupies a point in this design space that's in between something like homogeneous sharding, where you have a bunch of different shards that all execute the same kind of smart contracts and things. And in between something like Cosmos, where you have a bunch of different blockchains that all talk to each other, each of those blockchains has to be fully sovereign. So there are trade offs to both sides of that design space. So we try to occupy a middle ground where those shards are heterogeneous. We have a bunch of different shards. We split up the work between a bunch of different blockchains that draw security from the same source.
00:06:41.686 - 00:07:19.594, Speaker E: But those blockchains are specialized to specific tasks. They don't have to bring their own balances. They don't have to bring their own validator sets, things like that. So as any engineer knows, the closer you can specialize to a specific task, the better your solution is going to be more general solutions are less efficient. So that's our notion of parachain. So we also embody this notion of build your own blockchain, bring your own blockchain. We built a toolkit called Substrate, which is for building your own blockchains, writing what we call the runtime the logic of your blockchain in WebAssembly, in rust code and everything else is sort of taken care of.
00:07:19.594 - 00:07:52.580, Speaker E: We eat our own dog food in the sense that we've written polkadot using substrate as well. So we've launched the Kusama Network, which is essentially polkadot, but it isn't polkadot. So it's a incentivized real value bearing network for sort of putting through our thesis through the hoops. And we're working on deploying the initial implementations of Parachains over the next few months.
00:07:53.430 - 00:07:56.580, Speaker B: Ilya, I know you also have some news.
00:07:56.950 - 00:08:51.362, Speaker F: Yeah. So as Rob mentioned, there's kind of a spectrum. So we're on the other side of spectrum from Cosmos, where we see the world as kind of developers might want specialized solutions, but in very rare cases, and instead they kind of want speed and ability to go to market if they actually building a business faster. Hence, we think of Nier as developer platform, really targeting kind of people building applications and not needing to think how infrastructure underneath works. Right. Kind of same motives that AWS been able to build a huge business around at the same time, to actually be able to service developers, you do need a scalable platform. You do need to solve a lot of technical challenges.
00:08:51.362 - 00:09:26.820, Speaker F: So that's what kind of infrastructures that we're building with near protocol is a Sharded protocol. It runs WebAssembly. It kind of provides all this tooling around it. And yeah, like yesterday, as we mentioned in one of the opening talks, we just kind of opened up our main net. It is a proof of authority right now, but the point is that it allows people to start building applications and actually getting initial users. And then throughout May and June, we're going to be decentralizing, bringing more validators on board and over time, kind of releasing it to the community.
00:09:27.430 - 00:10:06.718, Speaker G: Arthur, I think if you think of these networks and platforms merely as technology, you're missing the forest for the trees. What these things are primarily is they are communities. I would say the closest thing to them are polities. They are essentially political organization. And the backbone of that usually is a blockchain. It's a good way to do it's, just one way. And what we're trying to do with Tezos is ensure that you can preserve that community, you can preserve that network while being somewhat agnostic to the technology.
00:10:06.718 - 00:10:56.350, Speaker G: And the way you can do that is by having technology which can evolve. So if you're looking purely at obviously software and development are very important. You cannot go anywhere if you don't have good engineering, if you don't have good software. But I would say that it's not the end goal. These things are not operating systems, they are fundamentally political entities. And what Tezos does is essentially trying to really tackle on that ID directly by introducing means of control by the community of the platform and how it evolves. And so Tezos has been in a testnet for many years now, it was on a Mainet for almost two years and it's already been through three protocol upgrades.
00:10:56.350 - 00:11:17.670, Speaker G: There are proposals for a force one coming and so you can't define it as a piece of technology itself because the technology can change. And so anything we can discuss in terms of Sharding, in terms of interoperability all of these fundamentally they're technologies but they're not communities. And I think that's the focus specifically of Tezos.
00:11:18.650 - 00:12:04.990, Speaker B: Yeah, well, let's talk a little bit more about that because I kind of made that joke at the beginning about the Ethereum killers, which is sort of like this just catch all phrase that was used for a lot of protocols that are sort of working in the same area that all of you are. But I'm sure even just like listening to each of you describe what you're working on, obviously there's a lot more nuance and yet at the same time we are in this reality where kind of like the most used blockchain in this space is Ethereum. So I was curious to know how you differentiate yourself from Ethereum, what problems you believe still need to be solved in this space and what you guys are working on and anybody can start I know we've been going in this little clockwise circle but it can go in any direction.
00:12:05.150 - 00:12:46.558, Speaker G: I'm happy to, was one thing I was reading about near, which I thought was completely on point. And I don't know how relevant it is today, but there was a statement saying, like, look, we've been working on Sharding and having this super high scalability. And then we realized, hey, there's no point in building it's. Like building this giant building in a desert. And so I would say by and large it might seem if you're really looking very closely at this, it's like oh, everyone's using Ethereum. But I would say no one is using Ethereum on a global scale. You have some applications, most of them are going to be around lending, there's not that much.
00:12:46.558 - 00:13:23.706, Speaker G: And so you might be tempted to think like oh, well, this thing have not been adopted. But I take the view and it's a view that's very popular in the bitcoin circle, but I think that if you have too much of a platform, a technology mindset, you might miss that. But I take the view that merely holding a token is using it. If you're thinking in terms of censorship resistant Caesar resistance store of values, which are fundamentally what these things are, and you can try to think of them as gas as much as you want, this is not the reality that we are today. Not in Ethereum, not in Bitcoin, not in any network.
00:13:23.898 - 00:13:55.618, Speaker F: Yeah, I think one thing I do want to mention, I don't think Ethereum is even close to most used blockchain. And I would want to have some data, but I think it goes Git and then a bunch of fuzzer protocols that kind of follow very similar use git used by millions of developers. So Git is actually using it maintains a data structure which is pretty much a blockchain. It has like, caching.
00:13:55.714 - 00:13:59.110, Speaker G: No, what it doesn't have is right. It doesn't have economical.
00:14:01.370 - 00:14:05.354, Speaker F: So in general and then if we go cryptocurrencies, right.
00:14:05.392 - 00:14:16.560, Speaker B: We have bitcoin right, in this space where you guys are playing. That's what I meant. Obviously bitcoin is yeah, but anyway, so keep going.
00:14:17.170 - 00:14:37.186, Speaker F: Well, I think it's important to remember how far we are from actually used stuff. I think Electric actually has a very good report which actually track down all the developers building the space. And it's like laughable numbers, right? It's like 10,000 actual active developers in the whole smart contract space. Right.
00:14:37.288 - 00:14:43.686, Speaker B: I just wanted to say, I did an interview with Maria, who wrote that report from Electric Capital. But anyway, keep going.
00:14:43.868 - 00:15:12.846, Speaker F: Yeah, I'm just saying 10,000 developers was like first few weeks of Google releasing the framework, right? That's kind of the difference of magnitude. So I think definitely understanding how can we bring more developers and actually users, because definitely agrees that if we have developed to developers to come here, we need people to use this stuff, right? They need to have value and need to see value why they will be using this.
00:15:13.028 - 00:15:52.750, Speaker B: So, Ilya, can I just ask you a little bit more about your approach with Nier? Because obviously you announced your new funding yesterday. Congratulations. And that's the news I was referring to. It was 21 million and you also launched your proof of authority main net. And I think you would agree with me, like proof of authority seems really appropriate for enterprise blockchain where kind of the validators are known. There's a very limited number of them. And so I just wondered, is this your way of kind of targeting a different audience from the audience that a more public blockchain like Ethereum is targeting?
00:15:53.970 - 00:16:53.380, Speaker F: No, I mean, the plan is to start onboarding more and more validators pretty much within the months. So we actually have 40 validators running right now on one of our testnets across the world, which actually is more decentralized than some other public blockchains right now. But yeah, so the idea of this POA is really just give the developers a platform to start deploying while we're still testing everything and kind of in a way pipeline still validating that decentralization everything works like the networking issues, all the things. And Zaki can tell how really hard these problems are and how long it takes to debug all this. At the same time, already start providing a platform for developers to actually build applications. And we have few developers kind of who already have an application and actually serving users right now from testnet and we really wanted to give them platforms that actually will maintain state going forward.
00:16:53.830 - 00:17:38.638, Speaker B: All right, well, so to continue what I was asking about before, just know whether or not you guys are thinking about how you're thinking about Ethereum kind of as know, working on your protocols and figuring out which audiences you're targeting or which problems you want to solve or things like that. And I guess, in a way, Robert and Zucky, you guys, you're really working in a slightly different way, where you're just trying to kind of bring a bunch of different types know, whether it's different blockchains or, I guess for Robert With know, how are you thinking about what you're doing, knowing that ethereum at the moment, at least in this particular.
00:17:38.724 - 00:19:01.830, Speaker E: Space, is leading well, as the others have said, they're leading a developer community, which is small relative to the amount of momentum that we want the space to gather in the future. And I would like to clarify that the concept of heterogeneous sharding is very, very fundamentally different from homogeneous sharding because you're bringing in a capability of optimization and specialization that you cannot have with homogeneous sharding. But I mean, without a representative of Ethereum here, I don't feel too comfortable speaking a lot about Ethereum. So maybe I'll speak a little bit more generally, like how we look at developer ecosystem and developer growth. I mean, this is one of the reasons that we've historically and we continue to lead the charge into technologies such as rust, like bringing rust into the blockchain space and bringing WebAssembly into the blockchain space. That these especially with WebAssembly, when you have the ability for developers to target WebAssembly, you're talking about a system of technologies where we don't have to reinvent the wheel and you've got the strength of the millions. Strong developer community, huge open source bodies behind it, all the browser vendors behind it for things like formal verification, good developer tools, and for people to write blockchain software in languages that they're familiar with.
00:19:01.830 - 00:19:14.560, Speaker E: And I think this is key, right, that you don't have to learn an entirely new language and rather you can maintain your comfort when moving into a new blockchain space as a software developer who hasn't previously been exposed to those things.
00:19:15.650 - 00:21:04.260, Speaker D: So I guess the way I mostly think about the blockchain space and what we're trying to do with Cosmos is where Ethereum has been successful, is it has been an incredibly successful sandbox for building sort of early financial primitives and onboarding assets and having some sort of baseline of economic activity on those assets. The question is really Ethereum maximalist strategy is the way I think about it, is it's a point of view that's basically like, well, we can take these successful experiments organically grow this ecosystem, sort of glue on scalability solutions as they're needed, and essentially sort of organically evolve into the sort of a global financial sort of ecosystem. I guess the sort of Cosmos point of view is that we're sort of missing some primitives there. And the primitive that we're missing is basically this sovereign interoperability primitive. And sort of not having that primitive means that these sort of nascent experiments will never be able to grow into sort of large scale platforms. And we've had some early signs that there's general enthusiasm for this. We don't really sell the Cosmos platform really that hard, but we've seen sort of a number of other entities sort of either adopt the platform wholesale or basically adopt the philosophy and concepts of the platform in what they've built.
00:21:04.260 - 00:21:20.470, Speaker D: And that sort of seems like the indication that we're sort of moving in the right direction by introducing this new primitive into the blockchain space, which is to a certain extent that's sort of like our governing philosophy.
00:21:20.970 - 00:22:15.058, Speaker B: I recognize, as you guys have all been saying, it's super early and the number of developers that are working in the blockchain spaces is still very small globally. And yet at the same time, I think we could say about Ethereum that at least they do have sort of a network effect. And some of you did allude to this. Right now, obviously, DFI on Ethereum I would say has a certain network effect. At the moment, there's about $400 million worth of ETH locked in DFI on Ethereum. So just like in terms of attracting developers, if this theory that has been talked about for quite a while in the blockchain space is true, that cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks really are about building network effects, then how do you plan to attract developers to your ecosystems?
00:22:15.234 - 00:23:14.460, Speaker F: There's actually an interesting point that public blockchains in comparison to something like Libra is actually allowed to link to other blockchains, right? And that's what Zaki working with IBC. But there's various ways to connect, which means network effects, actually. And bringing people into the ecosystem kind of benefits everyone. Obviously, we need tooling and we need kind of better connectivity. And that's, for example, we working on a bridge which is somewhat similar design to ABC, that links to Ethereum and allows you to build applications that just use the kind of existing liquidity, existing Lego pieces from Ethereum on other platforms. And I know Polkadot is doing the same. So in general, I think there is a network effect and there's people who are kind of professionally building solidity contracts now and are excited about the space.
00:23:14.460 - 00:24:33.060, Speaker F: But I don't think at this point we see that Ethereum way of specifically building on this specific technology is winning. And I agree with ARSEC here, it's more about there's a community of people who are building this financial primitives and excited about the new way of building kind of fintech companies and they will be looking for kind of what is the best pieces of technology they can pull together to build a better experience for users, right? What happened on March twelveTH? The kind of spike in gas price, spike in usage pretty much rendered a lot of applications unusable or some of the developers end up paying huge amounts in fees. Right. Because Ethereum just couldn't scale to this kind of very extreme capacity issue. So there's definitely a need for kind of different solutions and I think even this existing cohort of people who already here will be extending. And I think the other part is to just bring more people who are excited about fintech and see that kind of these approaches and these technologies actually will allow them to get faster to the market.
00:24:33.510 - 00:24:49.320, Speaker B: And Arthur, actually does that apply to you that you can kind of interoperate with Ethereum in some ways to take advantage of the developer activity they have there? I see how it applies to some of the other blockchains, but I wasn't sure about.
00:24:51.930 - 00:25:29.426, Speaker G: Know tezos doesn't have any way know tezos is what it is. So it's either attractive to developers or it's not. And the only means that I have to I would say to make attractive to people is going on podcasts and explaining why it's a great blockchain. So that's pretty much what I can do for it. But I do think it's very attractive. I think the spirit and the idea of it is that you can have a chain which is in some sense autonomous. It has internally mechanisms that can make it current over and over and over.
00:25:29.426 - 00:26:40.586, Speaker G: And the idea of knowing that you can build on a platform and know that it's going to keep current, it's not just going to be displaced by something else which is going to be faster or more scalable. The idea of having the means, technologically speaking, to always be at the forefront or close to the forefront is I think pretty compelling. But in general, I think that if you want developers, the best thing is to have good developer tools on top of a good platform, you want to have easy to use good developer tools. And that's probably but I would say also if you're not an incumbent and much of the network effect of ethereum I don't think it comes from the fact that they have existing. It's not so much that what they've built. I think it mostly comes from the fact that they're an incumbent and we're in a space which is mostly winner take all and so incumbents have a huge advantage. So bitcoin has a huge advantage over Ethereum because they are direct competitors and Ethereum has a huge advantage over the other platform just because it was there earlier and it's been there for longer and it has nothing to do with, I think, the network effect in terms of developers that they've built.
00:26:40.586 - 00:27:12.278, Speaker G: It's more of a mind share type of network effects that I'm referring. And I think the way that you can deal with that is by being very focused and by having a really good understanding of what it is that your technology do what it is that you're building and that lets you avoid a lot of dead ends if you really understand your product. And I think very few people in this space understand what it is that they're building. Like they know how to build it.
00:27:12.284 - 00:27:46.370, Speaker B: They just don't understand what they're I think I'm just translating that as know, sort of saying that basically everybody should have a vision know, kind of keep that in mind while they're building. But I was curious to know with Tezos, what are people voting on? I kind of took a look and it looks like it's all stuff kind of really focused on the protocol and it doesn't seem like there's anything controversial happening. But I didn't know, aside from that, what else are people doing with Tezos?
00:27:46.710 - 00:28:43.582, Speaker G: So there was actually something controversial in the Babylon upgrade and even in essence there were some discussions over the upgrade. So I think that's fairly important. And you also have to say that because there is mechanism, you should think of the voting mechanism on a chain not as a decision procedure, but as a ratification procedure. In some sense you have some governance that essentially happens off chain but then you present it and you ratify. And basically I think it avoids a lot of the scenario which you might have otherwise where people might push for controversial ideas through hard forks because they know that they're not going to get the votes. And so you don't necessarily observe it, but I think it has an effect, an important effect on the network. I think they're using it as cryptocurrency.
00:28:43.582 - 00:29:25.678, Speaker G: And fundamentally I think that if you're building a platform and you're thinking you're building a platform for application and that you're not building a cryptocurrency, I think you're not understanding what you're building. If you don't think that Ethereum is direct competitor of Bitcoin, I think you don't understand Ethereum if you don't think whether or atoms or anything like that. They are all direct competitors. And the fact that you can build application is great if you can have applications because cryptocurrencies, they're good for a few things, they're interesting as a store. If the Kozaks come and take everyone's money and chase everyone from a stealth then you can keep your cryptocurrency and that's great. That's use case number one. Use case number two.
00:29:25.678 - 00:29:34.158, Speaker G: You want to make a lot of cross border payment between machines all over the Internet. It's completely infeasible to use one of the thousands of payment networks that exist out there. You want to use cryptocurrency?
00:29:34.254 - 00:29:34.900, Speaker D: Great.
00:29:37.030 - 00:29:50.220, Speaker G: If you want to pay fees for a smart contract, that's a great way to use a cryptocurrency. So having smart contract being a smart contract platform lets you use your cryptocurrency in a useful way. But you're still building a cryptocurrency fundamentally, and if you're not seeking a bit of a cryptocurrency, you don't understand your product.
00:29:51.230 - 00:30:02.838, Speaker A: In response to the challenging times, crypto.com is introducing three measures to help the community. First, the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for.

00:32:16.570 - 00:32:24.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just so curious. Zucky, Robert, and Ilya, do you agree that Bitcoin and Ethereum are direct competitors? Because I don't see it that way at all.
00:32:25.230 - 00:33:18.700, Speaker D: Well, what I think a lot about is we have platform technologies, and each of us have different platform technologies, but it is somewhat like the. The search for comparative advantage for a token is also sort of somewhat like is like it's like a different social and technological progression to the platform evolution. They're coupled because the token exists within the platform technology. But you have this search for comparative advantage and comparative advantage is not zero sum but there is a relatively narrow space in which to search for that comparative advantage right now and that does sort of render all of our tokens in something of a competitive space.
00:33:19.150 - 00:33:43.586, Speaker E: Well, it's competitive but it's not zero sum, at least at the moment because there's a lot of room for growth. So I think that's a very important distinction to make is that what one protocol gains is not necessarily the loss of another protocol once you've saturated the market. Yes, I think that this would be the case but at this point we're looking for differentiators that will just expose us to broader and broader markets and bring more people into the space.
00:33:43.768 - 00:35:21.374, Speaker F: I think good framework is that tokens and especially monetary policy is in some way a central bank of this country of people and users and developers and everyone who is using this system. Right. And in some way obviously every country wants to take over the world but at the same time we actually have countries coexisting to some extent and the central banks have very different properties around what is their economics is based on. If you look at some of Russia, for example, a lot of its economy is based on oil versus I'm not going to talk about us. But in general the way the economics of the central banks operates can be very different and while at the same time it is money and it is what people use for day to day operations. So I think it's important to remember that, yes, in underlying way when I agree with Robin we saturate the market, it will become somewhat more of a competition but at the same time the economics can be based on very different kind of components and utilities that it provides. I do want to mention though that on the governance side, just to put one thought, I actually don't believe there will be contentious hard forks in proof of stake systems at all because in proof of stake, in proof of work, the decision of switching to a new protocol is on miners.
00:35:21.374 - 00:36:31.562, Speaker F: But everybody else needs to accept it, right? Like everybody else needs to also change the binary because miners can shift and start mining a different chain. But if I'm running my node, I can start mining the old chain, right? So there can be like natural forks and mining power in proof of stake, especially BFT where we prefer liveness. You kind of need 66% to switch or you need both to be contentious hard forks. Right. You cannot keep the chain that no changes chain anymore because you don't have a supermajority to produce blocks in the first place, even if more than 33% left. The kind of somewhat bad part about this is actually if there is something like this happens and both chains modifies their state to produce new forks, then the choice is actually not at people's hands but at exchanges hands. Because the people who decide which one to value and which one has stake is like whoever values it and whoever puts a price on it, which right now are exchanges and centralized exchanges for the most part.
00:36:31.562 - 00:36:36.860, Speaker F: So there's a lot of mechanics that we need to be aware of here.
00:36:37.390 - 00:37:44.126, Speaker G: I don't think that miners decide on forks in proof of work because miners have to expend electricity in order to mine. And so they're going to follow markets and markets are going to follow basically social consensus. So it's a bit of a circle where everyone is trying to pre commit very hard to one branch of the fork, but it's hard to make credible commitments where there's so much on the line. It's kind of a giant game of chicken between users, maybe exchanges, miners, and you get an outcome which basically you end up with groups having like massive leverage just because it's just so untangled and you have this crazy game of chicken. And that's I think the beauty of having on chain governance is that you bypass this thing. I also think that even if you have BFT, like classical BFT for doing a consensus, you can still have contentious hard forks because you will have validators who just decide to go on both wrench and they can't be slashed. It's easy to modify slightly the code in one wrench to make sure they're not going to be slashed from one to the other.
00:37:44.126 - 00:38:06.530, Speaker G: And so they'll just sign both. I think it depends on the mentality of the validators. If you have validators which are convinced that, yes, it's important to maintain the integrity of the network, it's fine. But if they are the school of thoughts of oh, we're just building technology platforms, they're just applications, then in other words, if they don't get it, then yeah, they're going to be on multiple platforms.
00:38:06.690 - 00:38:49.240, Speaker B: Yeah. I would just add to that, that if we just look at history with what happened with Ethereum Classic, there were some really small number of miners, maybe like one or two or something that kept the old chain going originally. But Ethereum Classic didn't really exist until the exchanges started offering it, offering trading on it. So it really was a situation where the exchanges actually led and the exchanges themselves would say it was the users who led because they were demanding trading in it. So just from that one example, I don't know if I would say miners were the ones who decided, but one thing I just wanted to ask was I don't remember who it was.
00:38:50.730 - 00:39:21.866, Speaker F: No, I just wanted to mention when I said miners, I said miners can not that they are. But in general, if there was no miners, there will not be ethereum classic like somebody actually mined in proof of stake. If I decide to fork off a tezzus right now, I will not be able to produce blocks, period, or I will be producing blocks. You'll have to tweak the state. But you could if you just took the state enough. And that is a contentious hard fork. That's a definition of contentious hard fork.
00:39:21.866 - 00:39:40.200, Speaker F: Tweaking the state. That's what I'm saying. There's no zero choice. There's always whatever is the supermajority wants or nothing. There's no kind of splitting into contentious options.
00:39:40.970 - 00:40:09.600, Speaker G: Oftentimes the problem is not that you have a fork and that there's an ethereum classic or a bitcoin cash or something like that, because these are generally very small. The problem is that the one that becomes canonical becomes canonical for the wrong reason. And so the problem with the forks is that it's not that, oh, you're going to have two branch, because one branch is almost always clearly going to be the canonical branch. The problem is the function that decide which branch is.
00:40:11.570 - 00:40:15.234, Speaker B: Oh, Zaki, did you want to add on this? I mean, this is interesting.
00:40:15.352 - 00:41:49.818, Speaker D: Well, all I wanted to say is I think that a big part of the design of polkadot, cosmos and Tezos, at very least, are people who have been designed by people who were around for the blockchain wars of 20 15, 20, 16, 20 17. And so they are informed by the political processes of that. And Cosmos, a year into its life, is just kind of starting to experience a world where we actually have real politics on chain and there are real protocol governance questions. So we're very early in the maturity process of that stuff. And so our experience with these sort of political systems are our experience with the limitations of the technology platform and how that affected the politics informed these design decisions, but we are still yet to know how they play out. It isn't until you really stress the system, until there is tension and contention and disagreement, that we really know any of this stuff and how our design decisions have played out. But that is where kind of the rubber meets the road on these protocols, is how they're going to process all of these political changes and how a polity and how an actual community forms.
00:41:49.818 - 00:42:16.578, Speaker D: So we're still like very early days in these things, but I think that would just generally be, I think, something that people kind of miss in the this technology is better than that technology. We're trying to operate at this intersection of developer, onboarding community and politics on top of a technology platform. And it's only the combination of all those things that eventually becomes like a significant player, not any individual aspect being better or worse.
00:42:16.754 - 00:42:58.326, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually, I feel like maybe what Arthur was saying in the beginning, but I find it interesting because I do agree with you that it does seem like those tensions from those years have really informed the different design choices that you guys have made. But what's interesting, and I didn't realize this actually literally until we were here talking meaning before when we were figuring out who would be in the panel, I didn't think of this, but it does feel like and Arthur, correct me if and actually I think even in this conversation, you've already had a slightly different vision. Were you the one who said that this is like a winner take all space and then the others were like, no, it's not. Was that you who said that? Or who said that?
00:42:58.508 - 00:43:38.890, Speaker G: No, I did say that, but I agree with Robert that just because it's winner tickle doesn't mean that now that it's negative some now. I don't think it's negative some now because in the world of program says most startups don't compete against each other. They compete against anyone giving a shit. And clearly blockchains today they're not startups, but they compete for something. And right now they compete against anyone's giving a shit and not really against each other. What I find very sad is that I think that the economic insight behind maximalism is correct. And some people use a correct economic insight as an excuse to not only be dicks on the Internet, but outright call for state violence.
00:43:38.890 - 00:44:02.474, Speaker G: And I find that absolutely despicable. But the economic insight is correct. I think it's way down the line and I just think it's better to maintain a collaborative environment and see who makes it out alive rather than try to tear each other to pieces like that early in the game. We tear each other to pieces in ten years.
00:44:02.512 - 00:44:02.810, Speaker B: Okay?
00:44:02.880 - 00:44:03.740, Speaker G: Not now.
00:44:04.830 - 00:44:24.800, Speaker B: Well, so I'm curious to know like, Robert Zucky and Ilya because you guys had this slightly different vision that you guys were talking about. So do you agree with Arthur that someday down the line it will become winner take all? Or do you just fundamentally foresee a totally different future where it's kind of like more this interoperable world that you guys are trying to build?
00:44:25.510 - 00:45:34.998, Speaker E: I think that's in many ways, just the nature of things, that things follow power, law, distributions and that when you start to run out of resources, competition is inherent and you can see that in many different ways and places in the world. And I don't think that this is going to be any exception, but the road that we have out before us is one that has a long way to go before I think we reach that point of exhausted resources and fervent competition. At the end of the day, though, blockchain protocols need to provide value for the token in order to provide security. These things are built off of incentive loops where new issuance has to be based off of demand. That drives security. So if there's no demand, or if there's more demand for another platform, then down the line, if there's a limited amount of possible demand, then you can't secure all of the platforms or some of them may grow largely more powerful than others. But as Arthur says, I think that this is really why I'd like to strike the point that things are not settled right now, like the best directions to go in are unclear and that it's really a time for experimentation, it's for projects to do something different from each other.
00:45:34.998 - 00:46:16.680, Speaker E: It's one of the reasons that we also are using on chain governance in our protocol, because we think that one sometimes the alternative seems to be, as we've seen from history, oftentimes just no governance, that nothing happens and you get caught in kind of obfuscated power structures and your systems don't adapt as they should. So a formalized system of government allows the system to adapt, bring in new technology, but it also allows people to just fundamentally put their money where their mouth is. And if they want to back a position with a certain amount of conviction, they can spend money and they can spend time in order to back that position. And well, whichever the community decides is the way that it's going to go.
00:46:17.370 - 00:47:32.080, Speaker D: So my general thought here is that I expect there to be fundamental trade offs in sort of what tokens can be good at. I think there are going to be sort of politics and governance will imply that not everything is for everyone. And so if a token is sort of pursuing this base layer monetary vision, it's likely to be like a sort of politics list protocol and sort of optimized for that. I think all of us are starting definitely building systems that are more sort of specific and will tend to end up with unique characteristics. And so I'm more skeptical than in the blockchain space that you'll follow the sort of standard technology, industry, power law distribution because of sort of scalability constraints about communities and sort of standard practices around how your blockchain actually works. So more skeptical of anything truly achieving sort of like a winner take all space.
00:47:32.690 - 00:47:34.426, Speaker B: And Ilya, you got cut off earlier.
00:47:34.458 - 00:47:35.680, Speaker A: What were you going to say?
00:47:36.290 - 00:48:40.898, Speaker F: Yeah, I'm actually with Rob, I do think it will follow power law and following my example. With countries and central banks, we do have few superpowers that kind of controlling the world in many ways and then there's a few other sub kind of followers in a way on the other side of this, this space is evolving so fast and even the last two years we learned a lot kind of new things. There's new cryptography coming out. There's all kind of things happening all the time. So it's both not the time nor it's unclear that what we think right now is the right way, will be right way in a few years, right? Maybe we all switch to zero knowledge proofs. And we don't need a chain, right? We all just exchange zero knowledge proofs offline or like P to P, right? There's so many possible other kind of alternatives. And I think us exploring the space and figuring out what works right now and how we get it to people is important.
00:48:40.898 - 00:49:41.526, Speaker F: But also looking forward to new technologies is definitely something and it may reshape completely how we think this will be evolving, right? I mean, same as before bitcoin, nobody could imagine this kind of thing. There's a possibility that there will be some new kind of evolution that will completely change how we look at this. So we should be open minded about that. At the same time, I'm agreeing we should be evolving and our plan is kind of continue both working as well as continue evolving the protocol and both feeding it closer to what developers need, what users need, and bringing in new technologies. So I do think governance is very important. I don't think that token holder, like direct token holder voting is the best way to do it and I don't think we have a good ways right now to kind of organize it. At the same time, I do think in proof of stake right now, validators are kind of at power one way or another.
00:49:41.526 - 00:50:43.610, Speaker F: They are the people who are running code and they are defining what blocks are produced. So pretty much building from there and kind of evolving that into operational governance is crucial. And I think I'm here in many ways following and with Cosmos and what they've done already just because they kind of gave power to validators and kind of delegators through the voting and then pretty much given they are who pretty much producing blocks and signing it and running hardware is a reasonable way to start from. But I do think we need to bring more people who actually would be introducing other sides of this non protocol developers, kind of community leaders and other financial institutions as well to kind of manage houses going forward.
00:50:43.760 - 00:51:32.842, Speaker B: Well, that's kind of where I want to go next. Or depending on the time, this is probably where we'll leave off. But basically if we're saying it's so early in the space that we just need to get more people in, how are you doing that? You guys did talk a little bit about the technological things that you think will your technical features that will interest different developers and stuff, but also there are the community aspects and everything. So just in a holistic sense, what are all the different things that you're thinking of doing to bring more people in and to get people to use your networks and to just get into cryptocurrency? Hopefully this is not one of those questions where nobody has a I'll answer.
00:51:32.896 - 00:51:58.340, Speaker G: That by rebinding on what Zachi was saying. Zachi was saying if you want to be something akin to money it shouldn't be political, and I agree with that. But I also think that the protocols themselves should not be political. The best way not to be political is to basically have very strong norms against never changing anything. But then you give up on innovation. And so I think right now, if you look at these cryptocurrencies, they're not quite money. They're proto money.
00:51:58.340 - 00:52:14.470, Speaker G: And as such, they are political projects. It doesn't mean they have to be internally political, but you have to understand them as political projects. And I think embracing that is a way of growing communities because it's accepting the nature of the beast.
00:52:16.250 - 00:52:32.206, Speaker B: But how do you bring that message to people out? How do you get people outside of crypto to take an interest in that? What you just said just seems very kind of internal, not something where what would be your message to somebody who's not in the crypto space to be.
00:52:32.228 - 00:52:34.160, Speaker A: Like, hey, come check this out?
00:52:34.610 - 00:53:42.130, Speaker D: So my point of view is on this is I think the next sort of interesting big steps for Cosmos is the Atom community is a very crypto native community. But I think that we have participants in the Cosmos ecosystem, whether you have the Agoric folks who are very native to the mainstream Java community. They've been part of the sort of JavaScript standards work in the mainstream distributed computing world for 30, 40 years. Is there a community that's going to be founded that's sort of more based in that world? You have people like Regen who are sort of based in sort of like the environmentalism sort of ecological transformation movement. So in many ways, I think the way that you get mainstream people to care about blockchains and the way Cosmos helps onboard those people is the ability to sort of go and land sort of social coordination mechanisms that are native to those communities and then bring them and connect them to some of the more crypto native communities inside of the cosmos.
00:53:42.550 - 00:55:24.082, Speaker F: Yeah, I think there's a trend that's happening in the real world, which is communities wanting to have more control and moving away or trying to kind of build that control outside of this big distribution platforms like Facebook, Reddit, et cetera, right? And like, Hacker Noon is a good example, right? They moved away from medium, so they have more control over their platform, over their users, over the monetization, et cetera. And this technology, as part of it provides kind of a substrate for sounds as like how to build a community, how to bootstrap it, how to align incentives and create new economies around this. So I think that's like an interesting perspective. The other one, which Vitalik mentioned yesterday, was around just like, kind of controllers reliability, right? We have these huge platforms that now pretty much becoming like they need to exercise control over and censorship over their own product and kind of sometimes censor even governments. And for them something that actually decentralizes, control, and in a way removes the need or brings it back to the communities, to the kind of more local governance, provides a new way of doing it, right. But I think at the end, what we do need to do is stop talking about how can everybody use blockchain? I do agree that it's about money and politics in underlying way, but at the same time, most people don't really care. Most people, when they use an application, they don't think this is like a SQL application, right? They just use application.
00:55:24.082 - 00:55:47.318, Speaker F: They don't care. So it's the same. They don't think that dollar is gold backed or not gold backed. They just want to use a dollar and buy something with it. And we need to get to that point where people actually just use this for the function and kind of start operating on that level. And I'm originally from Ukraine. Our economy sucks.
00:55:47.318 - 00:56:41.470, Speaker F: Every crisis that hit us hits Ukraine twice, three times more. And I'm actually very scared of what's going to happen given what's happening with us right now. And there's a huge opportunity for this technology and especially money, as a way for people to shelter their savings and actually hold up in the economic turmoil. The problem is the kind of stuff is completely unusable. No, people can actually get it on their phones or devices. There's no markets created in the local countries, right? So we really need to really up the game on Usability and really up the game on actually liquidity. If you think of USDT, which is in a way the only right now usable, stablecoin, I love Maker, but the amount of Daes that exist in the world is so small that it's not really operational.
00:56:41.470 - 00:57:07.560, Speaker F: If we think of USDT removing all the issues of how it's managed, et cetera, again, it doesn't have liquidity in the places where it needs to be, right, where people actually have demand for dollars and there's no dollars and there's no way to acquire them. So I think we kind of need to start investing more in these types of things on top of just making this stuff really usable for people.
00:57:08.170 - 00:57:47.140, Speaker B: So one other thing I wanted to ask about was right now, while we're speaking, we're kind of at the beginning of what will eventually be a multi phase and quite long transition to Ethereum 2.0. And so even though we were just talking about kind of getting people outside the crypto space in, I'm sure you do want to also get developers who are already developing in crypto interested in your projects. And so does that create some kind of opportunity for you? How do you think the transition to Ethereum 2.0 will sort of shake up the existing kind of blockchain space?
00:57:48.310 - 00:57:50.290, Speaker G: Ask me again in 2016.
00:57:51.110 - 00:57:52.450, Speaker B: 2016.
00:57:53.430 - 00:58:26.640, Speaker G: I remember in 2016 I was talking about Tezos and how it had proof of stake. And I remember people saying like, well, who cares if Tezos has proof of stake? Xero is going to have proof of stake next quarter. I think there's a lot of super interesting design in Ethereum 2.0 but I feel like Ethereum gets all the credit of Ethereum 2.0 with none of the deployment. So let's give credit to the blockchain which are out there, which are actually chardaying, which are actually using proof of stake, which are actually doing these things as opposed to talking about them.
00:58:27.250 - 00:58:41.010, Speaker B: Well, and just out of curiosity, would you say that most people that are interested in Tezos just are developers that didn't have previous experience in crypto? Like didn't come from another blockchain, they just came straight to Tezos?
00:58:41.670 - 00:59:02.700, Speaker G: No, I think most people who took an interest in Tezos had an interest in cryptocurrencies to begin with, although I think more people had an interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. I think in terms of the balance in the community, I would say that's a difference.
00:59:03.390 - 00:59:15.360, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. And what about the rest of you guys? How are you thinking about how that's going to affect the development of your protocols or interest in them?
00:59:16.050 - 01:00:14.530, Speaker D: So one, I guess thing that I think a lot about with Ethereum 2.0 is Ethereum has sort of embarked on this strategy that is very much like, okay, we are going to sort of ground up design a second system. It is an interesting strategy because there's an alternative strategy which is we're just going to try to colonize our network hex into other people's technology stacks and it's sort of, I guess, an interesting and alternative strategy and it sort of remains open to Ethereum. The option of pivoting like Ethereum could pivot and decide there's like a lot of things that we like about the near technology stack. It's close enough to the Ethereum 2.0 vision. Why don't we just colonize it and then try to bring our network effects over into that technology stack? We are all building open source technologies.
01:00:14.530 - 01:00:59.626, Speaker D: There is nothing that stops any one of our technologies from sort of colonizing the ideas, ethos, code of each other. And I'm kind of surprised that this happens less than you think. So I think the way I think about Ethereum 2.0 is Ethereum 2.0 will be the attempt of the Ethereum community to move their network effects into a new system to take that network effect with them into some new technology. I think the assumption that Ethereum Two point that how that happens is sort of like a fixed vision may not end up actually being the case and so it'll be interesting to see what occurs.
01:00:59.818 - 01:01:04.580, Speaker B: Okay, we probably have time for one more person who might want to jump in on that.
01:01:05.510 - 01:02:32.250, Speaker F: Yeah, it's a lot about excitement in the space and Ethereum Two has this kind of ring to it. So I think from our perspective, we focus on developers and bringing it to end users, like bringing their products to end users. So in many ways, we cooperate or have conversations with the Serum Foundation on technology and underlying things, we share a lot of, indeed, ideas with Zaki and polkadot folks. And I think on technology side, I think it's kind of in a way, like shared mind space of us all figuring out what works, what doesn't, and how to make it. And I think on network effects, I think it will be more utility and in some forms, maybe the governance and politics, but I think the kind of utility and functionality and getting this to the users will be the driving factor first. And I think all of us are focused on a different aspect of this and how this is brought to developers and we all kind of proving that this is the best way or this is at least a sizable chunk of the market and we'll see how it'll play out.
