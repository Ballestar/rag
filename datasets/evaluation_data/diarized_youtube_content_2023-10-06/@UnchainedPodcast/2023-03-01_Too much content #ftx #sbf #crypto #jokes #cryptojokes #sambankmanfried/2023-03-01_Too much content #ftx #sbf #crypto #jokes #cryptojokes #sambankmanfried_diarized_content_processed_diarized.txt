00:00:00.250 - 00:00:27.682, Speaker A: Charges against FTX are literally like netflix. There is so much content I cannot keep up. This week, Nishad Singh, an FTX founder and former director of engineering, pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors investigating SBS. Honestly, so inspiring to me when men agree to cooperate. Like, I once had a boyfriend who once did dishes. One time Singh pleaded guilty to securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud. Okay, honestly, maybe it would faster if I listed the types of fraud he didn't commit.
00:00:27.682 - 00:00:51.326, Speaker A: He's also charged with participating in an effort to artificially inflate FTX's revenue. Artificial inflation. You guys got the wrong AI. But you're very close. Singh's lawyers have said that Nishad is deeply sorry for his role in this and has accepted responsibility for his actions. Okay? I had no idea that all it took for men to apologize was to hire a very expensive lawyer. Singh wants people to know that he was wasn't always a bad guy.
00:00:51.326 - 00:00:58.860, Speaker A: He was once a Facebook engineer who was very involved in the effective altruist movement. But I guess maybe before that, he wasn't a bad guy.
