00:02:38.650 - 00:02:40.526, Speaker B: Hi, thanks for having me.
00:02:40.708 - 00:02:59.000, Speaker A: This was a big week in crypto news, both on a global stage and here in the US. Let's start talking about the conflict between Coinbase and the SEC, which began with a tweetstorm by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and a blog post by the chief legal officer Paul Gruel. What did they say?
00:02:59.770 - 00:03:38.740, Speaker B: What did they say? They were unhappy because so Coinbase has a product that is sort of like somewhat resembles a bank account and there would allow people to get a high yield, like high interest on their deposits. And they asked the SEC for they told the SEC they were planning to release this. And the SEC said it could generate litigation. And Coinbase, which likes to say that it really, really wants to follow the rules, got mad and started trolling a regulatory agency online.
00:03:40.070 - 00:03:42.802, Speaker A: When you say trolling, what I mean.
00:03:42.856 - 00:04:29.780, Speaker B: Is that they did go. So Coinbase went to the SEC, they introduced their product. They asked how would the agency respond to the product? The agency said this could run afoul of securities laws. And then Coinbase's response was to go on Twitter and to post on their own blog their estimation that their product is not a security. And also the chief executive in his Twitter thread had a lot to say about how the agency's behavior was sketchy. And he had questions about the chairman and it was arguably trolling a regulatory agency on social media.
00:04:31.190 - 00:05:12.538, Speaker A: Yeah, one thing I would say is when Brian introduced his thread as saying that he was going to describe sketchy behavior, he did go on to talk about how when he went to DC, he tried to talk to a number of regulators and the SEC was the only one that refused to meet with him. And that when the SEC told them that the agency felt that their lend product was a security, that it would not give clarity into the reasoning. And so I think that was what he was describing as sketchy. But let's dive into this lend product. How is that product structured and how does that compare to traditional securities or lending products?
00:05:12.724 - 00:05:49.750, Speaker B: Well, so I think there's a whole one of the questions, I think right now is that nothing is actually finally settled and the products are new and they raise new questions. And all of the law is about characterization and categorization. So on the one hand, Coinbase's argument was like, this is not at all like a security. How is lending like a security? It's like a bank account. Well, okay, you don't want to be an investment vehicle. You want to be a bank. But a bank would be highly, highly regulated.
00:05:49.750 - 00:06:58.242, Speaker B: They would have a lot of different demands if Coinbase was running from a regulatory perspective. There would be a lot of demands if Coinbase was running a bank in terms of risks and guarantees and reserves and all kinds of things. And so while it is true that the SEC has not necessarily made it very clear and a lot of this stuff is popping up relatively quickly and government does not operate, rulemaking does not happen quickly by necessity and people would not be happy if it did. There is a space right now where I feel like there are a bunch of products that straddle lines and they haven't been characterized. And businesses sometimes advance one characterization in one context because it's useful. And so Coinbase did talk about its lend product, like a bank account? Like an account, like an account. I'm not totally sure if it would want to be talking to banking regulators instead of the know because it's not clear yet.
00:06:58.242 - 00:07:07.320, Speaker B: It's not clear and it's not entirely clear how the ecosystem will evolve and develop and who should be in charge of all these things.
00:07:08.090 - 00:08:13.260, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually reached out to a few different crypto lawyers and hilariously, I got really different answers. There were some who felt it was definitely security, there were others who felt that it was not, or rather that the law was so unclear that it was not something that could be determined at this moment. And I think the cases that they were citing was the Howie case, which most listeners of mine will know because that was what was applied during the ICO period. And that has the four prongs an investment contract and a common enterprise with an expectation of profits dependent on a third party. And then there was a new one that I haven't heard of or hadn't heard of before called Reeves, which had to do with notes and I think I did see another lawyer maybe bringing up one other one. I didn't talk to that person. But the point is, I think as we've been saying, it's not totally clear and obviously maybe Coinbase has one set of arguments and the SEC has another.
00:08:13.260 - 00:08:21.980, Speaker A: So what do you think that this whole, I guess, conflict says about how the SEC is going to regulate crypto lending going.
00:08:23.790 - 00:09:11.142, Speaker B: Think we honestly I just don't think we know or they know or anybody knows. I mean, I'm certain that they know more than I do yeah, about what they're going to do. But my sense from some of the statements so there was an exchange between SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Senator Elizabeth Warren over the summer exchange of letters. There was a lot of discussion about all kinds of products, including lending and borrowing. There was a call for more authority. Like Gensler said, we need more authority from Congress to regulate. Now, what specifically like, what more do they need? I mean, to me, that indicates that there's a recognition that there are products or developments that are not currently covered under the law as it is written.
00:09:11.142 - 00:09:56.410, Speaker B: And that to some degree, for example, the argument that Coinbase made that these old laws don't fit or whatever, maybe they're right. Maybe the old laws don't fit. Maybe new laws have to be written. I mean that's also one of the big debates like do we fit everything into how things are? Do new tools need new rules? I mean everything is unsettled from a legal perspective. To me it strikes me as very early to make any determination. And I think Coinbase is trying to win the popular that they're making the argument online because otherwise why are we not going to go around debating securities law unless they make to a topic that we want to debate.
00:09:58.030 - 00:10:47.738, Speaker A: Yeah. And given that Gensler did ask for this extra authority to regulate this area, I do think that maybe there is merit to this idea that the law is not clear on what the lend product is. But I did wonder then for this alleged behavior of the SEC that was like, what Brian called sketchy, but to whatever extent it was sketchy or whatever you want to call it, their refusal to meet coinbase or whatever, what do you think that like? Do you think it says that perhaps the SEC is kind of working things out and just not ready to say something? Or do you think that, yeah, just waiting for more authority or what do you think is going on there?
00:10:47.824 - 00:11:42.150, Speaker B: I think there are two different views of how to interpret whether or not a government official will meet with a business person. And there is a view that the business community would no doubt take that business and government must work together and that the government should open its doors to business people who want to discuss and communicate. Well, that's one view. There's also a view that government must have a certain dignified distance from industry in order to create rules that are because government is not just there to promote industry. It is also there to protect consumers and facilitate societies. They're not just there for the advancement of innovation. And so I don't actually think it's that problematic.
00:11:42.150 - 00:12:36.926, Speaker B: I think there is a view of the SEC saying, no, we're not talking to crypto companies. That's very honorable. That doesn't mean it's not honorable to talk. If they were going to engage, and they do engage on specific issues, that's also fine. But I don't think that the arrival of the chief executive from California, the first cryptocurrency company, frankly, some of the language in his thread showed some of the language in Armstrong's thread showed a sense of entitlement about what the government might owe that I don't know if it's shared by all Americans. I don't know that all Americans feel that the cryptocurrency industry is owed or deserves anything in particular. Should they be treated fairly? Sure.
00:12:36.926 - 00:12:41.838, Speaker B: But I found it unseemly frank, I'm sorry to say.
00:12:42.004 - 00:12:44.194, Speaker A: Brian's Tweetstorm. You mean?
00:12:44.392 - 00:13:05.960, Speaker B: Yes, but I'm in Washington DC. So it's hard, obviously, you know what I mean. I'm awkward by government. But I think that there are two views, and I don't think it's necessarily problematic for the SEC to take a step and say, like, at this time, we are not necessarily engaging in this way.
00:13:06.730 - 00:13:15.946, Speaker A: Okay, and just quick wrap up on this before we move on to the next topic. What are Coinbase's options going forward, or do you have any insight into what.
00:13:15.968 - 00:13:37.218, Speaker B: It'Ll do next in terms of what in terms of lend? Yeah, so they declined to speak to me about it. So I don't know what their plans I will not speculate on what their plans are.
00:13:37.384 - 00:14:03.110, Speaker A: Okay, well, in a moment we are going to switch gears and talk about El Salvador because that was also huge news.

Crypto data from Digital Asset Research is available through refinitiv or directly@digitalassetresearch.com back to my conversation with Efrotlivny. So let's turn to the other big news of the week, el Salvador and bitcoin. Tell us what happened there.
00:15:13.990 - 00:15:42.140, Speaker B: So a central American nation adopted bitcoin as legal tender. And so that's the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as a currency. So they're adding bitcoin to the dollar, which is they adopted in 2001. And it was arguably a historic day for I mean, certainly a historic day for cryptocurrency, right?
00:15:42.510 - 00:15:44.140, Speaker A: I mean, I would say so.
00:15:44.590 - 00:16:03.650, Speaker B: I think it was a big there's a lot of debate about the merits of the adoption and the process of adoption, but there's, I think, little question that it was a big day for bitcoin. It was like a big event for a country to adopt this computer project.
00:16:03.800 - 00:16:12.420, Speaker A: So talk a little bit about kind of the questions that raised or the controversy around it. What were some of those issues?
00:16:12.790 - 00:17:03.454, Speaker B: So, one, I think we could start with the way that the adoption was announced. So it was announced by the president naibu Kele in a bitcoin conference. So a recorded announcement in a bitcoin conference in Miami in English. So the people of El Salvador heard about it. Second, it was passed very quickly thereafter with minimal debate. While the little bit of debate was happening in Congress, bukele was on a social media chat with American bitcoin enthusiasts. And the reason I raised that is that there is something the project is being advanced as a project for financial inclusion and the vast majority of Salvadorans do not have bank accounts.
00:17:03.454 - 00:17:34.400, Speaker B: And it is true that arguably, like a mobile phone based financial system could improve the economic life of some salvadorans. But there is a question about the way bukele moved on this and also his motivations. Who is he wooing? Like, it could be great for El Salvador, but there are reasons to be.
00:17:35.570 - 00:17:42.630, Speaker A: So when you say it could be great, what are some of the, I guess, the pros of having adopted bitcoin as legal tender?
00:17:42.730 - 00:18:48.920, Speaker B: So arguably, if you see bitcoin, not as if you don't think about because bitcoin is not a practical payment mechanism, right? It's volatile. It's almost everything you don't want in a currency for daily use. Yeah, but if you see bitcoin as a stand in for blockchain, let's say we talk about bitcoin because that's what we know. But what we mean is that a whole financial system exists on the blockchain where people are able to just arguably, like the lend product and things like that, where there are accounts where you can borrow crypto, like, you can borrow money based on your crypto, and you don't need the credit checks, and you don't need the same interaction with institutions. Theoretically, that's the promise of crypto, theoretically, is that it brings billions into a alternate financial system.
00:18:50.490 - 00:18:56.230, Speaker A: But how did the El Salvadoran people react to the adoption of bitcoin as legal currency?
00:18:56.970 - 00:19:55.270, Speaker B: So it is my understanding that there's a range. There's a range, surely. Yeah, but there were protests. Part of the protests, I think in conjunction with the protests about bitcoin, people were also protesting the passage of a bunch of laws about whether that you can fire prosecutors and judges over age 60. And so that law, which is more recent than the bitcoin law, was also passed very quickly and with minimal debate. And so I think in the eyes of people who are worried about Bukelli, these actions indicate that whatever he's saying about economic liberation or any other kind of liberation, he's arguably autocratic. So there are protests they're not aimed solely at bitcoin.
00:19:55.270 - 00:20:11.280, Speaker B: In terms of the general population, I think from based on the polls in the national newspaper, people are not that interested. The vast majority of people said they would not want to transact in bitcoin. Like it's something like three.
00:20:12.210 - 00:20:45.878, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I saw the same. Yeah. One other issue was I did see some pro bitcoin groups in the US. Protesting what is called article seven in the Salvadoran law, which says, quote, every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service. So for the protest, which I know you said had, it also do with this other law. But was that part of the reason they were protesting or what were their reasons for protesting bitcoin?
00:20:45.974 - 00:21:50.074, Speaker B: I think their reasons are more general. It's a more generalized but there are a couple of problems with the bitcoin law from the perspective of even bitcoin enthusiasts in the United States. And so it is this mandate. Now, number one, you have a payment mechanism that was designed to operate outside the total government control of money being co opted by a government and then mandated. And that is why the article seven thing is like a double frustration for bitcoin fans. It's like, not only did the government take a money that was supposed to be outside of government, which you can argue, whatever, there are arguments either way, but they adopt this non governmental decentralized money as money that the government recognizes and then mandates its use when it was designed for choice. And it's very problematic philosophically for bitcoin.
00:21:50.074 - 00:22:05.922, Speaker B: Like, people are cheering this movement on, but the mode in which it's happening is undermining the very reason for bitcoin's being. It's complicated, right?
00:22:05.976 - 00:22:33.420, Speaker A: I mean, it's yeah, I know. One of the people that I saw tweeting about that, and he wrote an article on this in CoinDesk is Jerry brito, who's the head of coins center, which the whole know for coins centers being is to advocate for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies here in the US. And so it was interesting that he really took objection to.
00:22:33.790 - 00:23:08.940, Speaker B: So I spoke to him, and one of the things that was really interesting was that he raised that and he says this sort of moral philosophical problem. But then he also was concerned. He's like, on a practical level, this is not really work yet as a payment mechanism. There are a lot of conflicts in americans going abroad and advocating for things that in societies that they may or may not completely understand.
00:23:10.590 - 00:23:33.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I did see some people who happen to be there now demonstrating how they're paying for things at coffee shops and stuff using the lightning network. So perhaps they've found the places where it's working out. Well, going forward, what developments or storylines are you going to be watching for in terms of what happens with bitcoin and el salvador?
00:23:35.350 - 00:24:14.960, Speaker B: Well, there are a bunch of things. I mean, price volatility. Price volatility is interesting, right? I mean, now a country has taken on the risk of whatever, the same risk that investors do just at a totally different scale. So that's interesting. I mean, that's something to follow, I think the extent to which this works or doesn't work, we'll be watching. You know what I mean? We'll be watching. I don't think that there will be a determination of whether it's a success or failure for quite some time, and maybe both arguments will be made simultaneously all the time, which on some level they are being made right now.
00:24:16.690 - 00:24:28.158, Speaker A: Yes. That's par for the course in pretty much all corners of the world and the internet. Okay, well, this has been a great discussion. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.
00:24:28.334 - 00:24:30.014, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks for having me. Bye.

First headline The SEC has begun investigating DeFi stalwart Uniswap Uniswap Labs, the developer behind the biggest decentralized exchange. Uniswap is reportedly being investigated by the US. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Wall Street Journal initially broke the news, citing sources familiar with the matter. According to the report, the SEC is probing into how investors use the trading platform, which has $6.5
00:25:39.594 - 00:26:43.546, Speaker A: billion in values locked, and how the exchange has marketed itself. The regulator has not yet issued subpoenas and is only requesting that developers voluntarily supply information. Jake Trevinsky, general counsel at Compound Labs, noted that the news quote shouldn't worry anyone too much yet an investigation is not an allegation of wrongdoing, it's just how the SEC gathers information. In addition to Uniswap, the SEC's Division of Enforcement has also sent letters to multiple crypto startups in an effort to start understanding the crypto lending space. That, plus the SEC's wealth notice to Coinbase about its potential lend product could indicate the regulator is setting its sights on lending. Next Headline Bitcoin May Have hit $39,000, but the bull market is still intact after staying above $50,000 for the 48 hours prior, bitcoin dropped 10% on Tuesday, its largest dipped since May. At one point, the digital currency fell below $40,000 on the crypto exchange wobi, marking the low point for bitcoin across major exchanges during Tuesday morning's flash crash.
00:26:43.546 - 00:27:22.938, Speaker A: Data from Coinbase shows the daily low for bitcoin bottoming out at 42 $830, while bitcoin plummeted down to 39 $818 on whoopi bitcoin was far from the only crypto to experience a dip. The total cryptocurrency market cap fell to a low of $1.95 trillion Tuesday, plummeting $400 million, or 17%, between midnight and 10:00 A.m., according to the block's Larry Sermac. Starting at roughly 09:20 A.m., over $2.6 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated in just 1 hour, with the primary culprit being in the cryptocurrency trading platform.
00:27:22.938 - 00:28:03.654, Speaker A: Bybit data from Blockware intelligence shows that a total of $3.22 billion in long liquidations cascaded across the futures market on Tuesday, wiping out a total of $4.4 billion in bitcoin futures. Open interest notably, bitcoin supply, held by both strong hands and short term investors increased during the dip, and exchange inflows and outflows remained somewhat steady. Based on the onchain numbers, blockchain analyst Will Clemente concluded the swipeout was almost completely fueled by an over leverage in the system. He added, Broader market dynamics have only increased. The bull market is not over.
00:28:03.654 - 00:29:06.870, Speaker A: Remember, we had 820 percent plus pullbacks from March 2020 to March 2021, I don't see anything to be concerned about. Speaking of a bull market, the British banking giant Standard Chartered released a crypto report on Tuesday, revealing a very optimistic outlook for both bitcoin and ethereum. The bank values bitcoin in the price range of in the long term and ether at a range of current prices. Standard Chartered expects bitcoin to three x and ether to ten x. Next Headline Ukraine becomes the latest country to legalize cryptocurrency On Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that would legalize and regulate digital assets. Previously, in Ukraine, cryptocurrencies existed in a legislative gray area, as it was neither legal nor forbidden to own crypto assets within the country. If signed by President Vladimir Zelensky, the law will protect crypto holders and exchange platforms from fraud.
00:29:06.870 - 00:29:44.050, Speaker A: In contrast to El Salvador, which made bitcoin legal tender, virtual assets cannot be used as payment or exchange. Instead, the bill allows crypto businesses to officially work in Ukraine and pay taxes. Next headline loot Blute. More loot and copycat. OOTS proliferate. On August 27, vine cofounder dom Hoffman dropped a 7778 piece NFT collection of randomized Adventurer gear. The NFTs, which Hoffman refers to as bags, each contain eight lines of text describing equipment or loot for a supposed adventurer.
00:29:44.050 - 00:30:35.826, Speaker A: From that string of text, the idea is for developers to develop games around the loot, interpreting and including the loot characteristics however they wish. The bags were quickly snatched up and hoarded. With only 2400 accounts getting the initial mint at publishing time, Loot's price floor is eight, ether over $25,000. Last Friday, for everyone who missed out on Loot 10, Dom dropped an additional 1.3 million bags of loot in a project the community has dubbed More Loot, which is free to mint minus the gas fees. The project has a dynamic supply increasing in a 10th of ethereum's block rate, allowing the loot metaverse to expand with ethereum if it sustains its current popularity. Shortly after Loot's successful launch, Blute, or based Loot, dropped a parody of the textbased NFT collection.
00:30:35.826 - 00:31:56.740, Speaker A: Instead of containing items like lights, tier, heavy boots of protection, Blute added a bit of color to his bags with items like the ERC 20. Poor maxi skirt of Rugging Blue quickly caught on and ranks as the 7th most popular NFT project over the past week. By volume, the Loot copycats did not stop there. On Saturday, two textbased NFT projects titled the Completely Pointless NFT Collection and first a collection of 5000 algorithmically generated satirical first ever honorific NFTs combined to raise over 390 e, which is roughly $1 million for charity thanks to the new NFT fad. Next Headline Seoul Leapfrogged two crypto OGS this week after hitting $100 less than two weeks ago, Salana's native Token Seoul has exploded above $200, marking an 80% gain over the past seven days. During Seoul's rapid ascent, the Token Leapfrogged two crypto OGS, doge and XRP, and now sits as the 6th largest coin by market capitalization at a $60 billion market cap. Seoul is approximately a $9 billion, or 13% increase away from passing both USDT and BNB to move in a fourth place.
00:31:56.740 - 00:33:09.370, Speaker A: Cracking the top three, however, will be more difficult, as cardano's ada Token has a $20 billion market cap advantage, while Ethereum and Bitcoin stand head and shoulders above the rest of the market at $400 billion and $850,000,000,000, respectively. Next Headline FTX adds NFTs and Step query to its ever expanding repertoire On Monday, FTX launched a new NFT product that allows customers to mint directly onto the exchange. According to CEO Sam Finkman Fried, each NFT will be cross chain compatible with both Ethereum and solana. For now, the NFTs can only be sold through the FTX marketplace through withdrawal feature, which will be live in a few weeks.
