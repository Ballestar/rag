00:11:42.640 - 00:11:51.786, Speaker A: Time for fun bits. Ginny from Unchained has thoughts about how Sam Altman of OpenAI is returning to crypto and WorldCoin.
00:11:51.978 - 00:12:20.150, Speaker B: OpenAI founder Sam Altman is now turning his attention towards crypto, which I guess makes sense because AI can kind of manage itself now, like how you get back into gardening after your kids go to college. He's close to raising $100 million, which he clarified is in fiat for Worldcoin's new minimalist wallet. WorldCoin isn't new. It got big last year with a crypto version of a universal basic income, like a crypto token, to be distributed equally to everyone in the world. I think this sounds totally easy. We just need to choose one of the coins whose value is zero. There are a lot to choose from.
00:12:20.150 - 00:12:51.810, Speaker B: There were a lot of issues with Worldcoin's initial rollout last year, but now it's back with a wallet that includes a global identification system. Basically, it scans your irises to prove that you're a human. And I cannot wait to make all of my exes try it. Rollcoin's first round of funding included investments from SBF, but I doubt he'll be part of this round unless, in lieu of cash, they accept D D hit points. I don't know what's gonna happen with WorldCoin, but I do think it's smart for sam Altman to have his hands in both AI and crypto. True diversification, the hottest sector in tech right now and crypto.
