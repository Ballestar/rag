00:00:00.090 - 00:00:15.214, Speaker B: You know, that meme, where it's like it's like someone who's like, yeah, I've been trading two years in crypto. It hasn't aged me at all. And then it's like a picture of a really old person. I feel like that after this weekend. I have to tell you, I do too.
00:00:15.412 - 00:00:56.730, Speaker A: This felt even more different to me than other market calamities in the past, where shit is going crazy. Because this isn't just like people's fund money. This isn't just like someone's portfolio going up and down, like SVB deposits and USDC. These are funds that companies are using for operating expenses, for payroll. And so over the weekend, I just had people asking me, hey, what's happening with the coins? It's like, hey, this is the money that I'm using to run my startup. What should I do with my corporate treasury? Do you have any banking suggestions? Should I put it all into ether? Because USDC is going to zero. It felt a lot more existential than, I think, some of the other market events.
