00:00:24.574 - 00:00:32.226, Speaker B: app day. Today's guest is Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence. Welcome, Mike.
00:00:32.418 - 00:00:34.818, Speaker A: Thank you, Laura. It's good to be on crypto.
00:00:34.834 - 00:00:52.250, Speaker B: Twitter was pretty excited last week to see your Bloomberg Intelligence Crypto Outlook report on bitcoin, which was titled The Bitcoin Maturation Leap. Why don't you explain, first of all, what the Bloomberg Crypto Outlook is when it got started and why Bloomberg felt that it should start a crypto outlook.
00:00:53.070 - 00:01:18.114, Speaker A: Well, I guess it was me who started it. I was kind of intrigued by the space. And as you mentioned, I'm a commodity strategist, so I really started it 2018. It was probably earlier in the year. I felt this space really needed to be covered, and the main reason why is the interest. And the question is it evolutionary or revolutionary? And I've come around to that. Bitcoin is revolutionary.
00:01:18.114 - 00:01:55.026, Speaker A: And what I found is Bloomberg is mostly institutional, mostly professional, and if anything, it's a good sign that people are really interested. So I started writing about it and got a lot of interest, and so I keep doing it, and partly because I'm interested in it. And I find that we've had a decent run at kind of predicting where the market is going to go. And that's what I do. As a strategist, I don't really care too much. I am completely objective about different markets. My goal is to say this is where it's going and why.
00:01:55.026 - 00:02:03.540, Speaker A: And actually, after we're done speaking, I'll be working on my outlook for May, which will be published the first week of May.
00:02:03.990 - 00:02:07.094, Speaker B: And in your most recent crypto outlook, what were your top line?
00:02:07.132 - 00:02:47.570, Speaker A: Takeaways that. This crisis, bitcoin, born in the previous crisis, 2008, 2009. This crisis should define its maturation, and it's doing a really good job of that. Now, initially, it did have a correction in terms of price. Again, my outlook is really just where it's going in terms of the price of cryptos, most notably bitcoin. But now, as we speak, on Friday, May 1, bitcoin is up 26% on the year and SP 500 is down 9%. So bitcoin to me is trading more and more like gold and becoming a digital version of gold.
00:02:47.570 - 00:03:35.570, Speaker A: And that is what this year should define, because some of us have been really kind of expecting something like this. I-E-A decent setback, I should say shakeout in the stock market and continuation of some really unfavorable trends, which is debt to GDP increasing, more Fed easing, but a potential recession, which really was triggered by I guess it had a major catalyst with the coronavirus. And the problem is a lot of these syndications were there well before the virus kicked in. And bitcoin is just right in the right place to be one of the top assets to benefit from, I guess you could say, from the ebbing tide of the global economy.
00:03:35.990 - 00:03:44.274, Speaker B: And so was your feeling that bitcoin was reaching this point even before the pandemic, but that the pandemic is just accelerating it?
00:03:44.472 - 00:04:15.242, Speaker A: Oh yeah, absolutely. So it's obviously not so much the pandemic, it's the reaction to the pandemic, the complete shutdown. So the number one thing is unprecedented global central bank liquidity providing. People might call it money printing. So, for instance, the fed, fed's purchasing bonds, interest rates are zero, and they're buying assets with basically creating money. That is very bullish for gold. And I view bitcoin in the same bucket as gold.
00:04:15.242 - 00:04:45.078, Speaker A: It's essentially a collectible. It's a digital form of gold. I don't really view it as a form of payment because it's not really good for that. Partly because supply is linearly trending down, the supply is just going away, and it's being adopted. So I view what's happening now globally as the key test for bitcoin. This year, I think we'll look back on is the year that defined bitcoin becoming a mature asset. And right now it's doing quite well.
00:04:45.078 - 00:05:10.186, Speaker A: I e one thing to remember about bitcoin is risk adjusted. It's trading very well, even though it had that big correction. It trades to me just like gold did in 2008. Remember when the market initially collapsed, I mean, all markets except for the bond market, gold went down about 30%. And that printed, printed at a bottom around 700 and then went straight up to 1900. That's right. At the time the fed really started aggressive quantitative easing.
00:05:10.186 - 00:05:18.580, Speaker A: Now we're doing the exact same thing now, bitcoin corrected around 40%, and here it's now back up on the year. So I think that's going to continue.
00:05:19.510 - 00:05:40.390, Speaker B: And one other thing you mentioned is the trend in bitcoin futures increasing. It a little bit more than doubled year to year in q one from 2019 to 2020. So what impact would you say that increasing bitcoin futures trade volume has or will have on the price of bitcoin?
00:05:40.810 - 00:06:19.454, Speaker A: So a lot of what I'm focusing on is the maturation and adult supervision coming into the space for bitcoin and that's futures are a key part of, you know, I mean, listed futures. I e. Futures that are listed. On CFTC approved exchange CME and are part within the US. Regulatory format I e that is part of the on ramp to an ETF in some case. So right now, as we speak, open interest on the futures contract and see me, which started trading in 2017, is reached an all time new high. And that's an indication of adoption from an institutional standpoint.
00:06:19.454 - 00:06:44.094, Speaker A: And it's indication of bitcoin really coming into the forefront of the mature space for asset classes. It's a good indication of volatility should continue to decline. And that's a key thing that's happening this year, is volatility in bitcoin is on the way down versus volatility on the stock markets on the way up. And that's why I think it's transitioned. Initially, bitcoin was kind of a risk asset. I think it's transitioned to a risk off asset. So things like that.
00:06:44.094 - 00:07:11.826, Speaker A: Futures are a good indication of adoption. We see things like addresses used adoption and then anecdotal. You hear fidelity backed futures and the GBTC. I watch the total assets management in the grayscale bitcoin trust, anything I can to see adoption. And to me, that's the key thing that matters. When something has limited supply, we know it's never going to have more supply. All that matters is adoption.
00:07:11.826 - 00:07:15.080, Speaker A: And futures are a good indication. Open interest is just part of that.
00:07:16.410 - 00:07:43.150, Speaker B: Earlier we talked about how quantitative easing will probably drive interest in this sort of version of digital gold. And you also talked about the futures being an indication of institutional interest. But I was also wondering then how this trend of, well, essentially this record unemployment that we're seeing due to the coronavirus, how that will also impact the adoption of bitcoin.
00:07:43.730 - 00:08:19.594, Speaker A: Well, I guess it's the compression or the reduction of income is a problem. But bitcoin is global, and I very view it as getting into the institutional space for the number one thing that's happening. It's causing central banks, most notably the fed, to just pump the system with liquidity. So that's supposed to help the stock market. In the short term, it's okay. So basically they're just massively increasing the supply of physical, as people say, in the space, fiat currency, paper money. And bitcoin is measured in that.
00:08:19.594 - 00:08:49.490, Speaker A: Everything like our homes are measured in it, stocks are measured in it. So it to me, increases the incentive to take that paper money that you should be spending because it doesn't have interest anymore, and there's massive supplies of it converting that into some form of physical safe assets. Now, initially, people are going to the stock market. I think that's fading. They're going to realize there's no earnings, so that's a problem. Bitcoin and gold to me, are the highest probability assets that should continue to appreciate. And then there's things like land, real estate, income producing real estate, depends on that's, all about location.
00:08:49.490 - 00:09:14.830, Speaker A: And of course, there's a bit of a lower tide factor there, but it's that no interest rates and just the fact that we're printing. People might call it debasing currency, but in a deflationary environment, the Fed and central banks are doing exactly what they're supposed to do. But you're supposed to take some of that currency they're printing and put it in. Safe assets. I think is a prudent investor, and I think institutions are figuring out that in the gold bucket, bitcoin fits.
00:09:15.410 - 00:09:45.890, Speaker B: In a moment, we'll discuss onchain price in a moment, we'll discuss price versus onchain indicators in bitcoin. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. In response to the challenging times, crypto.com is introducing three measures to help the community. First, the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months. Second, you can now get up to 10% back by using the MCO visa card on food and grocery shopping.
00:09:45.890 - 00:10:12.000, Speaker B: Lastly, you could buy gift cards on the crypto.com app from merchants like whole foods, safeway, burger king, and more, and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries. Download the crypto.com app today. Back to my conversation with Mike McGlone. I was especially interested in the part of your report that talked about bitcoin's price versus the on chain indicators. What do you see happening there?
00:10:12.530 - 00:10:31.702, Speaker A: Well, I use a lot of data. I can look, I view as many sources I can, and one of them is coin metrics. And the key thing I get from there is addresses used. I use a 30 day average of addresses used. It just reached the highest since July. I just look for anything that has a high correlation in the past. And July is when bitcoin averaged around $10.
00:10:31.702 - 00:11:21.400, Speaker A: The other metric I find that has a high correlation with price or somewhat predictive of price, is transactions. Transactions, adjusted transactions. And then of course, hash rate. Hash rates is more of the bigger picture. Now, transactions have lagged a little bit, but you combine that with what's happening with open interest, and I see pretty strong signs of interest and adoption from the market. So bitcoin around 10,000 makes sense with the way just looking in auto scale for last few years with addresses used. Now addresses used, I like some in a better way because I see bitcoin transitioning to gold, meaning, yes, it's great for trading, but it's probably better to just kind of buy slowly and not spend.
00:11:22.330 - 00:11:32.490, Speaker B: And one other event that's on the horizon that everyone's discussing is of course, the having. What effect do you think that will have on the price in the short and medium term?
00:11:32.990 - 00:12:07.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I was expecting we'd get there, Laura, because it's the classic differentiation, having obviously matters in the big picture. But from a macro market person standpoint, it's a known known everybody knows it's there. Everybody talks about it in the big picture. The actual process happening. People will use that as an excuse for going up. But we've known this forever. But the key factor is, if I look at it from supply standpoint, if you look at supply of bitcoin on an annual basis, last year it was around 3%.
00:12:07.394 - 00:12:35.222, Speaker A: The year before is 4%, the year before is like 6%. But the next two years it's going down to 2%, then 1% and getting down. So you see where it's going. And that to me is a key thing, as the bottom line is we know there's going to be no supply unless something happens, I can't predict. So the only thing that matters is adoption. So I look at the having as, okay, I get it, but it's part of the macro big picture. When I compare it to gold is over time, gold supply historically has been 2%.
00:12:35.222 - 00:13:05.106, Speaker A: And if it goes up, they're going to bring on the old mines and they're bringing on more. You can't do that with bitcoin. So to me, I guess average, I understand is every day about 1800 coins are created a day. And as of a couple of weeks from now, it's going to be 900 a day. So when people talk about the cost of mining, it just doesn't matter. It used to, but going forward, it's not because of those 21 million total, almost 90% have already been created. And that's why I look at it as a collectible.
00:13:05.106 - 00:13:08.554, Speaker A: The having is just part of that. It's great.
00:13:08.592 - 00:13:27.710, Speaker B: Banter so we've only been discussing bitcoin up until this point, and so does all of this come down to bitcoin or how would you expect some of these factors to affect the rest of the crypto market, in particular, some blockchains that have also gotten traction, such as ethereum?
00:13:28.610 - 00:14:03.158, Speaker A: Well, so bitcoin is about seven times the next most highest AUM crypto ethereum, which is pretty significant. And I view it as bitcoin is unique. It's no one else's liability. Its adoption is completely picking up. If you compare its hash rate compared to every other coin, most notably ethereum, bitcoin is just off the charts. So it's the one that's just done, it's created, it's been adopted, ethereum. The problem is, I look at there's 5400 other cryptos, okay, that's somewhat subjective.
00:14:03.158 - 00:14:29.950, Speaker A: There's just too much supply, too much ease of entry, and too much competition for me to really care. And that's where I look at ethereum and then I say, okay, well, there's EOS and I get it. It's just not the one that's gaining the traction. And adoption, it doesn't have futures. Maybe it'll get there, but I view the rest of the space as kind of a gaggle now. It really mattered before, but now in this macro environment, it's bitcoin. And partly because just look at the adoption.
00:14:29.950 - 00:14:42.710, Speaker A: It's the one that you can trust. It's where you can get the liquidity. And the bottom line thing you learn in trading and I learned in futures, it's the depth. If you need to buy or sell a large quantity, you're going to get that in bitcoin.
00:14:43.130 - 00:14:54.460, Speaker B: And what would you say will happen with the adoption of some of the centralized stablecoins such as libra, tether or some of the central bank digital currencies that are in the works?
00:14:55.550 - 00:15:36.630, Speaker A: My bottom line is the outlook when I hear anything about tether or libra is it increases improves my outlook for the appreciation of the price of bitcoin. Here's the main reason why. The key inflection point in 2019 when bitcoin was kind of on its way down, and everybody poo pooed tether. I was in Hong Kong two years ago, and they just loved cryptos, partly because they need to get away from China, and they just hated tether. And I remember pointing out, well, look at the AUM. That's all that matters to me. So when the New York attorney general came down in tether and the market didn't care, that flipped the switch for me because to me, if the market doesn't care, I don't care.
00:15:36.630 - 00:16:11.726, Speaker A: And to me, what tether is what all the other cryptos want to be, and that's currency. Most of the other cryptos are just speculative digital assets. Tether is obviously tethered to the US. Dollar, the world's stable currency, but it's indicative of what a real currency needs to be stable, transactable, and then there's a store value, bitcoin. So I view the appreciation tether as positive and not so good for the other cryptos because they just can't do that. But good for bitcoin because it's so unique. It's like gold.
00:16:11.726 - 00:16:38.520, Speaker A: It's no one else's liability. Work at know that's someone else's project in a way. And then the key thing is libra. Libra is also a wannabe. It's potentially, you know, stable, wants to be a digital currency. But again, it just added to my bullish view on bitcoin because it showed to me how unique bitcoin is. No one else's liability and just something everybody else wants to be.
00:16:38.520 - 00:17:11.986, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know if it's going to work or not, but just the fact that people want to create it to me says, well, there's already something there that is a digital store value that I can move. My money around in the world on a thumb drive and I don't have to worry about versus hearing all these issues in physical gold lately. There has to be some form of digital store value. It's bitcoin. And then I look at things like we hear a lot about. One of the major people are all going cashless and the world's going cashless. And so one of the primary ways to do that is in this country notably, is credit cards.
00:17:11.986 - 00:17:39.790, Speaker A: But there's someone in between getting two to 3% of that exchange that just does not make sense when interest rates are zero. So I view all the stablecoins and potential digital assets, I should say sovereign digital assets like in China and even in the US. As getting into that space where you'll be able to transact. I know there's privacy things, but you don't have to have that credit card in between and taking your two to 3%, most notably from the merchants.
00:17:40.370 - 00:17:49.170, Speaker B: So it sounds like you think that adoption of centralized stablecoins or central bank digital currencies is like a foregone conclusion.
00:17:49.670 - 00:18:01.640, Speaker A: It's just a matter of time, unless you think technology is going backwards. I mean, I'm in my home in Connecticut. I look out to my garage. I have electric car. I got electric panels on my mean, this is just where things are going.
00:18:02.330 - 00:18:07.750, Speaker B: And what would you say about something like a decentralized stablecoin such as Dai?
00:18:08.350 - 00:18:38.210, Speaker A: Don't know much about it because it doesn't help me get a better view of what's going to happen with the price of other cryptos or Bitcoin. But that's more in the space that a lot of your other guests will cover. That's more the business side. But I think those kind of things are just a matter of time. I just don't know much about it because my primary focus as a strategist is this is where the price is going and why, and it doesn't really help. Give me an indication.
00:18:40.070 - 00:18:56.550, Speaker B: But to go back to that, obviously you cover commodities and people have talked about Ether as sort of like a digital oil oil used for running the Ethereum virtual machine. What do you think of that theory?
00:18:57.390 - 00:18:59.866, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, that works, but there's a.
00:18:59.888 - 00:19:03.930, Speaker B: Lot of oh meaning like other smart contract.
00:19:05.790 - 00:19:39.080, Speaker A: I can't I just mentioned EOS one of them because at have we launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index. So we work closely with Mike Novogratz and he was a big fan of EOS, but I just see that as great helped create a lot of the other coins and things. But in a macro standpoint, from what's happening in the world with money and things, bitcoin is obviously gold. Ethereum is just another one of the 5000 other cryptos out there.
00:19:40.650 - 00:19:50.120, Speaker B: And I also wanted to get your opinion of this trend in decentralized finance. Is that an area that you're watching? And if so, where do you expect it will go?
00:19:50.750 - 00:20:25.950, Speaker A: Definitely watching and a lot of it I get from your program, listening to your guests, Laura. But for me I think it's just a matter of time, most notably with what's happening in the world. But I don't know how that's going to really impact prices so much. Because if anything, decentralized finance needs something stable to transact, like the dollar. Average annual volatility in the dollar is what, five, 6%? Bitcoin it's 80% and a lot of the other cryptos it's over 100%. That's just not practical for transactions. That's speculation.
00:20:25.950 - 00:20:41.500, Speaker A: But my bottom line is that the trend that way helps me think. If that's successful, that means a digital store value like Bitcoin is going to gain more traction, more adoption, which improves the outlook for the price.
00:20:42.190 - 00:21:10.446, Speaker B: Yeah, and actually there was a new version of Bitcoin, what they call a trustless bridge that basically you can use your Bitcoin as collateral in DeFi. And so we'll see what happens how this works with the digital gold being used in the DeFi space. Well, anyway, it's been so fun having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
00:21:10.638 - 00:21:33.050, Speaker A: Well, thanks for having me. Actually. I never write my outlooks without listening to your program. And since we've been locked up lately, I haven't been listening as much because I don't commute as much, but I really appreciate the education that you provide in this space, and it really helps me formulate my opinions and my views, which I publish.
00:21:33.390 - 00:21:50.174, Speaker B: Great. Thank you so much. Yeah. And I know people have told me they listen on their commute or at the gym, and I'm like, I wonder what they're doing now. I wonder when they're listening to I guess people will have to tweet at me and let me know. All right, well, thanks again.
00:21:50.292 - 00:21:51.342, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:21:51.476 - 00:22:57.334, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, time now for this Week in Crypto. First headline Telegram Delays Its Launch due to Regulatory battle Telegram has postponed the launch of its Ton blockchain to April of 2021 and offered to return $1.2 billion to investors after a judge ruled that Telegram could not launch its blockchain or issue Gram tokens until its case with the SEC was resolved last fall. The agency charged Telegram, which had a $1.7 billion ICO in early 2018 withholding an unregistered securities offering. CoinDesk reports that the company is now offering to return up to 72% of each investor's stake, but has also given its investors the option of lending their investment to Telegram until a year from now. It quotes the letter as saying, as a token of gratitude for your trust in Ton, we are also offering you an alternative option to receive 110% of your original investment by April 30, 2021, which is 53% higher than the termination amount.
00:22:57.334 - 00:24:06.442, Speaker B: Read the full CoinDesk article for some juicy details include indicating that the decision to postpone the launch was made at the 11th hour. Next headline. A 16 Z Crypto's second fund raises $515,000,000 after its first fund of $300 million. A 16 Z Crypto has announced a second fund. Partners Chris Dixon and Katie Hahn wrote up a blog post about the areas within Crypto that they're excited about, including Next Generation Payments, modern Store of Value, decentralized finance, new Ways for Creators to Monetize, and Web Three. Next Headline ethereum's not any More centralized than Bitcoin An Analysis of Ethereum's Top 10,000 wallets adam Cochrane, partner at MetaCartel Ventures, wrote up a 109 Tweet Tweetstorm on his analysis of the top 10,000 holders in Ethereum, not counting smart contracts such as the Wrapped Ether smart contract. He found that the top 10,000 addresses represented 56.7%
00:24:06.442 - 00:25:14.370, Speaker B: of all ETH, which he says is basically the same as Bitcoin's top 10,000 holders, who hold 57.4% of the Bitcoin supply. In comparison, 16 XRP addresses own 55% of XRP, 300 Litecoin addresses own 54% of LTC, and 1031 addresses own 51% of Tron's TRX, he writes this means when it comes to equity of distribution, ethereum and Bitcoin are in a league of their own. No other coin comes within an order of magnitude of their distribution. He also makes an estimate of what the yield would be under a proof of stake system in Ethereum, finding that early adopters might obtain something like twelve to 20% yield. I urge you to read the whole thread, which is actually much longer and contains many more nuggets of information than what I was able to give you here. And there is also a version available on Substac and on Medium, although odly, I personally found the tweetstorm to be the most readable.
00:25:14.370 - 00:26:17.160, Speaker B: Next Headline uma's initial Uniswap offering Permissionless price discovery or manipulative as Hell? The token sale for Uma protocol on uniswap caused a bit of controversy. Delphi. Digital did a great analysis titled uma is listing on uniswap in 4 hours. We can already tell you what will happen. I'm just going to urge you guys to read this because I actually cannot do justice to this post here. But long story short, because Uma was listing only 2% of its tokens, and because of Uniswap's constant product model, the writer analyst Jan Lieberman was able to predict that the Uma token price could not go below its starting point. He wrote, quote the 2 million starting in the pool establishes the floor price, and the constant product aspect of uniswap ensures that even if prices increase considerably, a massive selloff would still end, with prices never going below that starting point.
00:26:17.160 - 00:27:09.446, Speaker B: On crypto Twitter, the way this played out did not garner accolades. As Rick Burton, who's active in DFI, said, quote the fully diluted valuation ripped through $120,000,000 plus for a promising team with a protocol that is still in development. Or as Adam Cochrane of MetaCartel Ventures put it, manipulative as hell. Suzhou of Three Arrows called it arguably scammier than actual ICOs. Playing defense was co founder Hart Lambert of Uma, who tweeted My view initial price discovery is really hard. This wasn't a perfect attempt, and in hindsight, Rick Burton is right we should have upped the communication, but this was a genuine attempt at permissionless price discovery. Other options aren't great.
00:27:09.446 - 00:28:19.366, Speaker B: Chris Berniski of Placeholder, who has invested in Uma, also tweeted Uma protocol, has decided to publicly release Uma, starting at the same network valuation that seed investors paid. And he followed up with another tweet saying the options would have been to cater to centralized exchanges or seek further illiquid and bespoke private market valuations. Uma opted for a novel low cost and permissionless price discovery process. Uma co founder Alison Liu solicited community feedback and said, quote I felt that it made more logical sense to have this convo after the token had a price and feel awful that it came off as anything else. Next Headline Hedgek Typo creates ruckus if after the BZX and Dforce attacks, you didn't get the memo that the security in DFI is questionable, a kerfuffle last weekend about onchain options protocol Hedgek is a good reminder. On Saturday, April 25, Hedgekick tweeted an alert saying, quote A typo has been found in the code. Because of that, liquidity and expired options contracts can't be unlocked.
00:28:19.366 - 00:29:13.058, Speaker B: For new options, please exercise all of your active options contracts now. Everyone will be 100% refunded with the amount of premium that you paid for options. This prompted a number of responses similar to this one by Hudson Jameson of the Ethereum Foundation, who tweeted, It's a bug, not a typo. You're downplaying the severity of the bug in a series of tweets, Trail of Bit CEO Dan Guido tweeted in three days earlier this month, we identified ten critical flaws in Hedgehog options that could harm users. We noted a lack of tests, a lack of documentation, and that the time afforded to review their code was insufficient. Bottom line we told them to hold off deploying Maria. Paula Fernandez summed it up as quote to those late to the party a summary we can all get trail of bits.
00:29:13.058 - 00:30:35.560, Speaker B: Basically told Hedgek to not go out, but because they were too wasted and wearing a tube top and Hedgek went out, had a wardrobe malfunction and ruined everything and said trail of vids. Didn't mention that tube tops and drinks don't mix. Next headline number of DeFi users still small but growing exponentially. Richard Chen, partner at one confirmation, wrote up a great post arguing that total value locked is not the best metric by which to judge DFI popularity, because that figure can be driven by fluctuations in the price of ETH and also because DFI is dominated by whales. So he looked at total number of users for DFI across a number of projects, including Kyber, which had more than 62,000 unique trader addresses Uniswap, which has almost 52,000 unique liquidity provider and trader addresses Compound, which had nearly 28,000 unique lender and provider addresses, as well as other big DFI projects. He finds that the total number of unique addresses across all projects is a bit over 150,000 users and says, quote, at the current growth rate of zero point 56% daily, we'd expect to see 1 million DFI users by March 2021 and 10 million by May 2022. We shall see.
00:30:35.560 - 00:31:23.814, Speaker B: All right, fun Bits crypto Twitter shadow banned. So this is not actually fun, necessarily, but it seemed worth mentioning. And yet this is also random enough that it didn't really go in the regular headline, so I'm going to put it here. A number of crypto Twitter people such as Anthony Sassano, Naraj Agrawal, Linda Shea, Nick Carter, Mike Dudas and Jeff Garzick believe that their notifications and Twitter impressions have been down over the last few days. So actually, I don't really tweet all that much, but I think perhaps that maybe this is also happening to me too. It's unclear why, but if you like following crypto people on Twitter, maybe set up a dedicated stream for them now. All right, that's it.
