00:00:00.090 - 00:00:57.770, Speaker A: The problem is that there's no good recommendation, because the reality is that had you risk managed yourself properly, you would have never put yourself in this situation. If you want to ask me, how do you get this resolved quickly, yes, you got to sell what you can sell, which I would suggest is probably some of your more valuable assets that, if anything, bury probably treasures. But then, if anything as well. The way I kind of looked at it and the math that I kind of did in November suggested that if there were a redemption mechanism that were enabled for GBTC, then you would see a large increase in the asset value of their GBTC holdings, which are obviously 11% of all GBTC outstanding, which would fill a big chunk of that hole. Now, it's worth noting, DCG Grayscale make a lot of money off those fees, which I believe are currently at 2%. And that is kind of the prized possession for the DCG empire.
