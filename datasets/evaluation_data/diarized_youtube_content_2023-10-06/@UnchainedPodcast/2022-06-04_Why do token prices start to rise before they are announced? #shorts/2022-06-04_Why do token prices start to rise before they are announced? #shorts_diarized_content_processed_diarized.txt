00:00:00.410 - 00:00:53.450, Speaker A: Any platform that is listing tokens should have for its own employees an insider trading policy. A policy that spells out for employees what they can be doing and what they can't be doing, what they should be doing, what they shouldn't be doing. And among those rules really has to be the sort of core rule here. If you have information about a particular coin or token, you should not be trading on that. These rules are very familiar in the corporate world. Most companies, law firms, have insider trading policies where if the law firm, for example, is representing a publicly traded company, people at the law firm who may be in possession of confidential information about the client, they shouldn't be trading that. Crypto companies need to adopt these kinds of policies and enforce these kinds of policies.
00:00:53.450 - 00:01:30.534, Speaker A: Otherwise I've been saying for years there are going to be issues where, as you said, the price starts creeping up before something is publicly offered or publicly listed. And inevitably, we're going to find that there were people on the inside, maybe it was some insiders who were buying up the coin because they knew that the price was about to pop. So folks in the crypto world, my friends, if you're working for a project and you know that your coin is about to pop because of an imminent listing or something else, please don't trade. Talk to a lawyer. Don't get yourself in trouble here.
