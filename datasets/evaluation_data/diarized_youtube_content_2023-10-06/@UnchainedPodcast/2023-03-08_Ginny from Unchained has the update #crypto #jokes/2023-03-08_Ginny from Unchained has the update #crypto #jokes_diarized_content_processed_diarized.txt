00:00:00.250 - 00:00:28.870, Speaker A: So Vitalik Buterin recently sold about $700,000 worth of shit coins, which are these joke coins that are often a huge waste of money. Not to be confused with regular cryptocurrency, which are non joke coins that are often a huge waste of money. But like a hot girl in a bar, vitalik actually got these coins for free. It turns out that sometimes people will send free coins to a celebrity in the hopes that their followers will copy them and then buy the coin. It's not a bad strategy. I mean, people do copy the Vitalik. That's why unicorn T shirt sales have gone through the roof in recent years.
00:00:28.870 - 00:00:49.780, Speaker A: Anakin has positive repercussions. One time, Shiba Inu sent about half their total coins to Vitalik, and he donated them to a COVID relief fund. I have to imagine, is the sole reason why the pandemic is wrapping up after a mere three years. Is it rude to sell something that somebody gave you for free? My mother would say yes, but in my defense, I think that a gift card for egg freezing was kind of a weird birthday present.
