00:00:00.090 - 00:00:33.590, Speaker A: So it turns out that 196 members of Congress got direct contributions from SBF or other FTX executives whoops yeah, that's over a third of all Congresspeople. And the other two thirds are pissed that they didn't get the memo that he was handing out cash. I am not surprised by this development. I mean, SBF defrauded the public, violated campaign finance laws, and is refusing to admit to any guilt. Or, as politicians like to say, he's relatable. But these politicians are not happy about it now because SBF committed the grave, grave, grave sin of getting caught. In fact, a lot of them are now denying any specific connection to him.
00:00:33.590 - 00:00:57.050, Speaker A: Representative Lou Correa claimed he never talked to SBF, which is weird, because SBF literally does not shut up. Seriously, wander around Palo Alto for ten minutes and you will literally bump into Sam Bankman Fried wearing a shirt that says, STX us is solvent. I'm innocent. Most of the politicians who've received these funds have said that they're going to hand it over to charities to avoid being associated with SPS. No word yet on whether or not SBS legal fund is technically set up as a charitable foundation.
