00:00:00.250 - 00:00:53.440, Speaker A: Does a 16 Z control uniswap? You've probably heard about the recent controversy involving the venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, aka a 16 Z, and their supervote on a recent Uniswap proposal. If not, let me give you a quick and easy rundown about this crypto drama. A few weeks ago, the Uniswap community did a temperature check vote on how to deploy Uniswap V Three on the BNB chain. 62% of voters chose to use wormhole as the bridge, beating out its competitor, Layer Zero, which received 32% of the votes. It was the largest vote in Uniswap's governance history, with over 20 million votes cast. However, in the final vote, a 16 Z whose portfolio companies include Layer Zero and who had not been able to participate in the initial temperature check, used 15 million Uni tokens to swing the vote against the use of wormhole for the deployment. This caused an uproar in the community.
00:00:53.440 - 00:01:36.450, Speaker A: Furthermore, data from bubble maps shows that a 16 Z could control 41.5 million unitokens, representing approximately 4% of the supply. The question is what impact does this have on community governance and decentralization finance? CEO Chang Peng Zhao has entered the fray, promising on Twitter that he won't use tokens locked on finance for this battle, and he's assured the community that he will let them decide. The vote will end on February 10. What are your thoughts on this situation? Was it a 16 C's right to swing the vote in this manner? Should this kind of behavior from whales be prohibited by Dows? What's the proper role for VCs in a decentralized world? Let us know in the comments.
