00:00:00.090 - 00:00:34.678, Speaker A: I think at this point, they just want the precedent of getting some type of judgment against a Dao. Right. We don't know what further they're going to do there with that judgment. Like, will they try to find individual members of the Dao and say, you're now liable for damages for violating the thing? Or will they say, hey, we got a judgment against the Dow. Let's go to the ISP for their website and say that their website is facilitating an illegal business. Shut it down. Let's go to whatever platform the governance forum is run on.
00:00:34.678 - 00:00:52.730, Speaker A: Say, look, their conduct is illegal. Shut this governance forum down. I think that's probably more likely what they're going to do than try to chase all these individual people who they may or may not know who they are. Right. But it's sort of yet to be seen. And it's yet to be seen whether they even will get the default judgment. But that's what they're seeking.
