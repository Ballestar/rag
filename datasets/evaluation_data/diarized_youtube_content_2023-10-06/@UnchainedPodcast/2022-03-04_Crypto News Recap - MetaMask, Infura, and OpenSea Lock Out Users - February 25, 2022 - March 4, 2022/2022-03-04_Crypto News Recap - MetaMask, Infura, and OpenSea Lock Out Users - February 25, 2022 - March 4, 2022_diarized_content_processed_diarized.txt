00:00:06.890 - 00:00:41.210, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap. Are NFTs securities. That's what the SEC wants to know. According to Bloomberg, the US. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing NFT creators and marketplaces to determine whether certain tokens qualify as securities and should be regulated as such. Of particular importance to the SEC are fractional NFT platforms where an NFT can be subdivided into many units that are sold independently of the original NFT, be it art, collectible, ticket or meme.
00:00:41.210 - 00:01:43.680, Speaker A: Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg noted that the SEC had sent subpoenas to both creators and exchanges requesting information. Interestingly, crypto friendly SEC Commissioner Hester Purse, aka CryptoMom, had said to CoinDesk in December, given the breadth of the NFT landscape, certain pieces of it might fall within our jurisdiction. People need to be thinking about potential places where NFTs might run into the securities regulatory regime. The SEC's look at NFTs did not shock many crypto lawyers. For example, Anderson Kill law partner Haley Lennon tweeted that it was not much of a surprise, and Stephen Palley described the regulator's exploration as predictable as herring in brine. The news comes just a few weeks after the SEC fined BlockFi $100 million for offering a security product via its interest earning accounts. Consensus has a messy lawsuit on its hands.
00:01:43.680 - 00:01:55.950, Speaker A: A group of 35 employees at the Joe Lubin led ethereum development company Consensus, filed a request for a Swiss court to review a previous deal between Consensus and J. P. Morgan.

00:01:58.728 - 00:03:11.190, Speaker A: Than half of Consensus AG shareholders, claimed that a 2020 transfer of assets from Consensus AG to Consensus Software Incorporated was illegal. The deal saw JPMorgan take a significant stake in both MetaMask and infura two major assets originally owned by the AG without the AG's minority stakeholders being properly notified. In addition, the deal offset a $39 million loan from founder Joe Lubin. According to the claims published by Arthur Hayes, who is heading the suit against Consensus AG, the transaction was to the detriment of the minority shareholders of CAG and to the benefit of Joe Lubin personally. The legal request comes shortly after a Consensus fundraising round of $200 million at a $3 billion valuation. The company refutes the claims found in Hayes's letter. Telling the Bloc Mesh, aka Consensus AG, refutes the allegations underlying the legal action as well as those contained in the factually inaccurate press release that was self authored by one of the former employees.
00:03:11.190 - 00:03:16.330, Speaker A: Mesh looks forward to formally refuting the allegations and accusations in Swiss courts.

Iranian users of the NFT marketplace OpenSea are also claiming that they have lost access to their accounts, with multiple verified collections allegedly being removed from the platform. The IRS won't take no for an answer.
00:04:23.170 - 00:04:23.774, Speaker B: The US.
00:04:23.812 - 00:04:33.570, Speaker A: Internal Revenue Service filed to dismiss a lawsuit by Joshua and Jessica Jarrett, a married couple who claims they should not have paid income tax on Staking Rewards.
00:04:34.070 - 00:04:36.306, Speaker B: While the IRS offered the Jarrett's a.
00:04:36.328 - 00:05:52.922, Speaker A: Refund in December, the couple refused in an effort to force a federal court to decide how Staking income is taxed in the US. However, this week the IRS filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the Jarretts could not refuse its offer of a refund.

00:07:55.518 - 00:08:43.810, Speaker A: Been in the naysayer camp over that period of time. But the crypto market today has market capitalization of about $2 trillion in round numbers, which tells you that I haven't been right on this call. According to Griffin, Citadel securities, which handles 25% of equities volume traded on the US. Stock market each day and executes 35% of US. Listed retail volume, will most likely get into the crypto market making game soon, despite saying in October that the company would not due to regulatory uncertainty. To the extent that we're trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems, we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto, Griffin explained. It's fair to assume that over the months to come, you will see us engage in making markets and cryptocurrencies.
00:08:44.150 - 00:08:45.942, Speaker B: The news comes almost two months after.

Kevin, the Meme Green Pixelated money printing machine Pixelmon, a blockchain gaming project, released a collection of 9999 NFTs last week, generating $70 million in sales during a mint that saw collectors pay up to three ETH per NFT. The mint sold out quickly. However, collectors were immediately disappointed with the quality of the art, which was later described by Pixelmon's CEO as unacceptable.
00:10:31.370 - 00:10:34.246, Speaker B: The NFTs grant holders exclusive access to.
00:10:34.268 - 00:11:51.742, Speaker A: Pixelmon based land and token airdrops boost ingame earning potential and grant access to the alpha release, among other things. However, the price floor for them has already dropped to 00:29 ETH on Wednesday night, meaning that some minters NFTs are worth one 10th what they paid just a week ago. However, as this is crypto, one particular Pixelmon NFT, a species called Kevin, caught fire on social media and saw the floor price skyrocket due to its ugliness. At one point, Kevin NFTs were selling for over $20,000. Kevin NFTs spawned an entire meme culture on Twitter, with the Green Bowserlike 3D character taking over crypto, Twitter and even receiving its own song from Song a Day Man aka Jonathan Mann. Kevin became so popular that a derivative project called Kevin Punks was minted and instantly became a hit with 549 ETH in volume. After just a few days of trading and a price floor of zero eightyTH, unchained tracked down a Kevin investor via Openc and asked them essentially why they would spend 8.6
00:11:51.742 - 00:12:48.650, Speaker A: ETH on a meme. John Bisu, cofounder of Seasons IO, seemed to think it was a good fit for his NFT platform and told Unchained that he might donate his Kevin into the Trash pile on Trashdow where users can swap NFTs from qualified contracts in exchange for Trash tokens which govern the deposited NFTs. However, if Kevin continues to grow in value, Bisu might fractionalize the NFT on Seasons so that everyone can have a piece of memetic history. Because, as Bisu explained to Unchained, there is a Kevin in all of us. Alright, well, thanks for tuning in.
