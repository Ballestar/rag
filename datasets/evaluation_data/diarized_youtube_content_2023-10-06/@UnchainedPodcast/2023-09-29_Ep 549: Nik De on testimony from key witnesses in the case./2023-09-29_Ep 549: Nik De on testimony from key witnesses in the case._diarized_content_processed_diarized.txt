00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.870, Speaker A: I think the cooperating witnesses. So the FTX inner circle. That's former Elevator Research CEO Carolyn Ellison, former FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and Gary Wang. I forget which one of them was the Director of engineering. The other one was a fellow executive. But these are the three individuals I think we're going to hear from probably first, maybe might hear it from them as soon as next week. Not certainly the week after.
00:00:24.870 - 00:00:58.460, Speaker A: They're the ones who were in it, right? They were involved in this. They were part of FTX. They were part of the highs. I think we're going to probably hear from them how FTX might have fallen apart. I know from court filings, we know that DOJ wants to ask Carolyn Elson about the FTT token and allegations that Sandbag was directly involved in trying to argue for Alameda to take a large some of it and to potentially, allegedly manipulate the price. So I think that testimony is going to be really interesting just because, again, it's the first hand account of.
