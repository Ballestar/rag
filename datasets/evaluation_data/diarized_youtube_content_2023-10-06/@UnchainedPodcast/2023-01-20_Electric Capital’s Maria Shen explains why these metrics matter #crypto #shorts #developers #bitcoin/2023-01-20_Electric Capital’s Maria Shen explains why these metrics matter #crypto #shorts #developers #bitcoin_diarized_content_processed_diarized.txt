00:00:00.330 - 00:00:39.382, Speaker A: Are a fundamental measure of the health of an emerging industry. More so than prices. Prices fluctuate and they're very, very prone to change. Developers tell us how many people are actually building, how many people are pushing new code, how many people are creating protocols and useful things, dev tools to bring in more developers, applications to bring in more users. And so that's why that developer number is really important. And of course, like, one of the really interesting things we've seen is that year over year, developers actually increased. So prices fell 70% from peak this time around in 2022, developers increased 5% year over year.
00:00:39.382 - 00:00:58.730, Speaker A: And that's very consistent with our findings in the pastor market as well in the 2017 2018 cycle, after prices peaked, in January of 2018, prices fell 90%, more than 90%, as I'm sure a lot of people painfully remember. But developers stayed.
