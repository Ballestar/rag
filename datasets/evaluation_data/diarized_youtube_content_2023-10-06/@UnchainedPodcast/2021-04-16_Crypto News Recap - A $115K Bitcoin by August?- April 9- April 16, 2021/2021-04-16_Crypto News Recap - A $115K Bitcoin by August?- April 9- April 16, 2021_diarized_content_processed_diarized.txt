Pantera CEO Dan Moorehead noted this bitcoin rally is exactly like previous havings bitcoin is likely to reach 115K by August. Pantera also correctly called when bitcoin would break thirty K, forty K, and fifty K in previous months.

He told Forbes, quote we need to make sure that the conventional wisdom that is wrong about the illicit use of bitcoin doesn't hold us back from pushing forward the technological changes that are going to allow us to keep pace with China.
