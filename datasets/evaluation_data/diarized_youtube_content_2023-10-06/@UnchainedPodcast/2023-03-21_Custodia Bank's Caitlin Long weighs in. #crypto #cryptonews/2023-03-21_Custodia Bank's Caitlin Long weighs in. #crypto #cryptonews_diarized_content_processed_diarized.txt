00:00:00.170 - 00:00:57.660, Speaker A: And it is crystal clear that we are in Operation choke point two, point zero. And I'll share. I don't know by the time this episode comes out if we will have revealed some of the details about what happened to Custodia, but there were leaks by the Fed and the White House two days before Custodia's application was voted down, that the Fed vote was preordained and that we were going to be voted down. And we have that in email and I will be releasing that email, not Doxxing, the reporter who sent it, but the reporter actually asked us by email, said, we have been told that the Fed and OCC applicants have been all asked simultaneously to withdraw your applications. And that's indeed what happened. You've seen Paxos in Tigo who had applications at the OCC and then Custodia who had an application at the Fed, all basically being shoved to the side.
