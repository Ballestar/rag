00:01:18.498 - 00:01:23.346, Speaker A: Today's guest is Jeremy lair, co founder and CEO of circle. Welcome, Jeremy.
00:01:23.458 - 00:01:25.206, Speaker C: Thanks Laura, great to be here.
00:01:25.308 - 00:01:39.210, Speaker A: This week you announced the launch of a new subsidiary in Bermuda. You also received a Digital Assets Business Act license from Bermuda. Tell us about the new subsidiary and license and why Circle decided to pursue.
00:01:41.790 - 00:02:52.706, Speaker C: You know, as as you look at the crypto markets, there's obviously a tremendous amount going on. And we operate a number of different businesses. We have an exchange business, a trading business, we have retail products, and we have a product roadmap to build quite a number of different crypto finance products. And as we looked at the business and looked at the regulatory environment in the US. One of the things became very clear to us, which is that, and this has been clear for some time, and I think this has been really amplified more recently, is that the kinds of products and services and digital assets that can be offered in the United States is just becoming significantly more restrictive. And at the same time, the innovation in the space, the number of new projects, new digital assets, new blockchains innovations in the models of the blockchains is proliferating. And so it was very important from our perspective that we be able to offer as broad a set of crypto finance products as possible to as many customers in the world as possible.
00:02:52.706 - 00:03:53.030, Speaker C: And it became clear that the way to do that was to really have a US. Specific business that's regulated within the context of US. Regulations, but perhaps more limited, and a international business that is also regulated and supervised. Because we do believe ultimately, customers, whether they be individuals or institutions, want to know that the firms they're interacting with have supervision. And I'll come back to that in a moment. And so we really, starting late last year, began looking to figure out where can we set up this international operation? And as you probably know, there are a number of countries who have really looked at embracing digital assets as a new type of financial asset. And also the kind of market participants that includes countries like Singapore, Switzerland, Malta, Bermuda and some larger countries are pursuing things as well, like France and Japan.
00:03:53.030 - 00:04:47.542, Speaker C: As we looked more closely, what we found is that what Bermuda had put into place as a national crypto policy, which is this Digital Assets Business Act, was one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive frameworks for crypto that we had seen. And the things that we really were attracted to were a few things. So one was, it was comprehensive. It was a regulatory framework that spanned kind of the full suite of different types of financial products and services that we build at Circle. Everything from payments and custody to trading and both retail and institutional products, as well as the exchange business. And so it was a comprehensive regulatory framework. I think a second piece which is really critical is that it was a framework that had a high bar around it.
00:04:47.542 - 00:05:51.066, Speaker C: Bermuda has given out very few licenses and we're the first company in the world to receive what's called a Class F license, which is the broadest. And the Bermuda Monetary Authority has a very high bar on the types of firms that they will ultimately accept for registration, licensing and supervision. And that was attractive to us. We think it's important that there is a high bar around this. And then maybe most critically is that I think Bermuda has defined digital assets as a new class of financial asset. And rather than just trying to define digital assets in the context of currencies or commodities or securities or to apply preexisting banking and payments law or securities and investments law, they took sort of the core features of their banking and payments laws and securities and investment laws and integrated them into a new framework for digital assets. And this is critical.
00:05:51.066 - 00:06:32.502, Speaker C: We think it's critical that digital assets be able to be issued and offered and utilized by people. And they may have financial contract features, they may have utility and commodity features. They may also function as payment tokens and currencies. And that's a good thing, that kind of combination of those. So the framework there really embraced that. And what we found was a government both on the policy making side in particular, that wanted to work with this industry, that acknowledged that the technology is moving incredibly fast and that they need to be responsive with policy and they want to learn along the way as well. And so it's very attractive from all of those perspectives.
00:06:32.502 - 00:06:40.170, Speaker C: And that led to a process that has been ongoing for many, many months and then ultimately receiving the license and announcing the new operation.
00:06:40.590 - 00:07:29.660, Speaker A: Well, there's so much to unpack there, and some of my later questions will get to that. Just one note before my next question for listeners who missed my interview with Gabriel Abed of bit, we do talk a little bit about Bermuda's, friendliness to crypto companies and projects, and premier David Burt there, who I think really has been the champion of this industry in that country. So, Jeremy, you've expressed frustration in the past with the SEC for not providing enough clarity to the crypto space, and I believe that led you to geofence some assets on poloniax. So how do you think in general, how do you think lack of clarity around regulation has affected poloniax's business?
00:07:30.670 - 00:08:17.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think this is broadly the case. If you look at the last couple of years, first, there was sort of some very broad kind of guidance around, hey, we think almost everything is a security. And you should look at the Howie test. And I think what that led to over the course of a lot of the last couple of years was it put US. Exchanges and projects as well in a really difficult place with all this uncertainty. Well, where do we fit in that and can we be competitive? And so largely what you've seen happen is you've seen market share shift from many US. Based players to mostly asian based players, and that's very real.
00:08:17.194 - 00:09:02.198, Speaker C: And that has happened. And that's incontestible. I think it's also led to, of course, more and more projects having to jump through all kinds of hoops to domicile in other places. Really, as we've talked about, I think the US. Is missing out on a lot of things as a result of that. I think one of the critical things that happened, though, was the more recent April staff guidance from the SEC, which in some ways did provide more clarity, but in our view, it was going in absolutely the opposite, if not wrong direction. It expanded the scope of how digital assets might be deemed securities.
00:09:02.198 - 00:09:55.130, Speaker C: And our view, and this has been consistent for a very long time, is that it does not make sense to attempt to fit digital assets into just are they a security, are they a commodity, are they a currency? But it really makes sense to establish a new set of definitions for digital assets. And these digital assets can have features that are securities like, commodity like and currency like all at the same time or in different contexts. And that's a really powerful thing. And so that's what we're advocating for, that's what we think is necessary for major nations around the world, is to adopt a national crypto policy that embraces and defines digital assets as a new thing with the appropriate supervision around intermediaries and firms and market participants that's necessary.
00:09:55.550 - 00:10:03.198, Speaker A: We're going to discuss more about what crypto regulation in the US. Should look like. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:10:03.364 - 00:10:56.602, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

00:11:27.362 - 00:12:19.782, Speaker A: Now back to my conversation with Jeremy alair of circle. So something that I was wondering about was that I noticed poloniax has pretty small market share at this .2 years ago, it had about 58% according to the block, and now it's 1%. And I also was checking the bitwise bitcoin trade volume site where they rank the different exchanges by real bitcoin trading volume after weeding out what they believe are fake trades. And there poloniax's BTC trading volume for the last 24 hours was about 10 million. And of course, so we know finance is the biggest of these, and that was at 500 million. But coinbase and kraken and coinbase and kraken were at 200,000,190 million.
00:12:19.782 - 00:12:31.980, Speaker A: And those companies are kind of dealing with the same types of regulations that poloniax has been. So why are they not hindered in the same way that poloniax has been?
00:12:32.430 - 00:13:17.930, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think a couple of things. So the first is when we acquired poloniax a year ago, or a little over a year ago, this was a company and an operation and an infrastructure that needed, let's just say, an enormous amount of help. The platform was falling over, the infrastructure needed to be completely rebuilt and is continuing to be completely rebuilt. There were constant wallet failures, people getting fund stuck, there was a 200,000 ticket backlog of customer support requests. So we took over something that to some degree was on life support, but.
00:13:18.000 - 00:13:20.166, Speaker A: You paid huge amount of work, million dollars for it.
00:13:20.208 - 00:14:25.558, Speaker C: So that suggests the headline number that was reported. That is never a number that we've ever confirmed. So we've never confirmed what the actual transaction was. That was a rumor number in any case at the time. Of course, poloniax has had a very large customer base over the 2014 to 2018, millions of customers have grown to use the product and so we've been in a process of rebuilding an enormous number of pieces of it and that's been significant. Now, one critical thing is that clearly there are a number of exchanges, including the likes of Kraken and Coinbase and Bitstamp, who have had fiat connectivity into their markets for a very long time. And the kind of core Bitcoin trading on a global basis, you really see an enormous amount of that volume come from exchanges that have really good on and off ramps for fiat.
00:14:25.558 - 00:15:14.114, Speaker C: And so that was clearly one of the things that we knew we needed to do. And in fact, just in the last few weeks, we launched direct fiat support with wires from 80 plus countries, with card support from over 50 countries. And so we've literally been able to put that in place and we think that's pretty important in growth as well. I think the other piece is Poloniax, as you know, was very much known for its support for a wide range of altcoins. It was sort of the preeminent altcoin exchange for a very long time. And two things happened. One is, I think the SEC environment in the US pretty significantly restricted what we could do in that space.
00:15:14.114 - 00:16:15.562, Speaker C: And Asian exchanges surged ahead and so the altcoin share very much shifted to exchanges that were launching more and more assets constantly. And that certainly has been impactful. I think we do intend to become significantly more competitive in terms of the markets that we support and our international operations are going to be really critical to Are. Those are certainly significant factors. The other is that when we took over Poloniax, we needed to have the KYC and AML policies and the compliance policies be in line with US regulations which required full identity verification. And some of the other exchanges around the world have not imposed those standards. So on Binance, you can sign up with a fake email address and a fake phone number and you can use a VPN to get there from other countries.
00:16:15.562 - 00:16:19.510, Speaker C: And that's with $20,000 a day kind of limits.
00:16:21.210 - 00:16:28.300, Speaker A: But I was asking about for Coinbase and Kraken, they have had those policies in place for a long time.
00:16:28.670 - 00:16:41.470, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And they've been, I think, historically very strong. As for the core fiat Bitcoin pairs, and literally we weren't able to offer that until even literally just a few weeks ago.
00:16:41.620 - 00:17:20.650, Speaker A: Yeah, actually one other thing I meant to say with that last question was that Bitwise has sponsored my podcast and Kraken is a sponsor currently, so that's my disclosure. One other thing that I wanted to ask about was the Poloniax troll box was a hugely popular feature and Polo shut that down in June 2017 and I noticed you guys just revived it, which seems to somewhat indicate that closing it was a mistake. Do you feel like maybe kind of closing down that community was also part of Poloniax's troubles.
00:17:20.990 - 00:18:14.762, Speaker C: Yeah. So I mean a few things on that. So obviously the closing of the troll box significantly predated our acquisition, as you note. But what I can tell you is that there was about a 30% decline in usage immediately following the ending of the troll box, so it was definitely important. However, it was challenging back then for the company to moderate it and keep up with it. I think ultimately there was a decision that was, do we have the limited resources they had applied to customer support? Do they apply that to customer support, or did they apply that to moderating? The troll box needs moderation. It needs a scalable moderation model because you need to ensure that there isn't market manipulation or other forms of tactics deployed there.
00:18:14.762 - 00:18:48.680, Speaker C: So it was also, almost without exception, the number one feature request from customers after acquiring the company. And so we did ultimately prioritize it, rebuilt it, made it more scalable, built a scalable moderation model, and it also launched once we had what we felt were robust market surveillance capabilities in place on our platform that would make it safe. So there's been a lot of enthusiasm for the return of the troll Box, and it is highly active these days, which is great.
00:18:49.610 - 00:19:14.778, Speaker A: Good luck. I always find forums to be somewhat challenging, but I think if they're, well, moderated, they're such a wonderful benefit. I frankly love reading online conversations that are, well, moderated. So I saw that next week you'll be speaking at this Senate hearing titled examining regulatory frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain. What do you plan to say in.
00:19:14.784 - 00:20:24.740, Speaker C: Your know, I think there's really a few key themes that I would like to address to the committee. One theme is really just around helping to articulate and communicate and educate the committee on the diverse types of digital assets that exist. I think there's been a sort of kind of peripheral awareness of things like Bitcoin. There's been obviously a front and center awareness of this new stable value token and blockchain project from the Libra Association. But I think the policymakers, in particular, sitting senators and congresspeople do not really have a broad understanding of the different types of digital currencies, blockchain, platform tokens, stablecoins. So one thing I really want to do is really just help provide a better understanding of all the innovation, how to think about these things, and what are potentially some of the different policy implications of these different types of digital assets. So that's one, I think, significant piece.
00:20:24.740 - 00:21:39.580, Speaker C: I think a second is I'd like to paint a picture of what the economic opportunity is from crypto. What does a robust marketplace for digital assets and for innovation in the space look like and what's at risk for the United States economically from a financial market perspective if we don't figure out how to get this right and support it, and ultimately we think it's a competitive issue for any country. I will also speak some very specifically about Stablecoins, providing more context on that through our work with Coinbase on the Center Consortium and US dollar Coin. And then I think, finally, our perspective on the regulatory environment, what we believe is needed from a national crypto policy perspective. And in the context of that, of course, shed some light on some of our decisions around different approaches to how we're going to operate the business, given some of the, I think, limitations in terms of policy of the United States.
00:21:40.110 - 00:21:50.990, Speaker A: One last question about your time in Bermuda. Did you enjoy wearing what's called the Bermuda rig? I had to Google this, which was the suit jacket with the shorts and socks.
00:21:51.810 - 00:22:10.662, Speaker C: Absolutely. I think they've figured out something there that I think we could all learn from, which is that if you want to dress sharp and it's 90 degrees and humid, there's a way to do that comfortably. And it's great. I'm sold on it.
00:22:10.796 - 00:22:24.886, Speaker A: Yeah, I noticed, though, that the rest of your team, they were all in normal suits. I was like, geez, where's the yeah, yeah. All right, well, it's been great having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
