00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker C: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:17.330 - 00:00:38.374, Speaker B: Alright, hello everybody, and welcome to the Chopping Block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspectives on the crypto top picks of the day. So, quick intros. First up we got Tom, the DeFi maven and Master of Memes. Next up we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and Captain of Compound. Next we've got Tarun Gigabrain and Grand Poohba at Gauntlet. And then finally myself.
00:00:38.374 - 00:01:05.642, Speaker B: I'm ASIB. I'm the Head Hype man at Dragonfly. So the four of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice or even life advice. So guys, it's been a bit of a crazy week. We've got a lot of since the last time we met, a bunch of drama, especially with respect to hacks that have gone on in the last couple weeks. But I want to start laura just I think yesterday yeah, it was yesterday, right? Yesterday.
00:01:05.642 - 00:01:23.190, Speaker B: Just released her blockbuster interview with Doe Kwan, which if you have not seen, highly recommend to go see it. It's pretty crazy. What did you guys think of the Doe Kwan interview? What were your takeaways? I think this is the first time. Other than that what coinage interview? This is like his first really hard hitting interview that he's done publicly.
00:01:24.890 - 00:01:38.010, Speaker D: I'll be the first one to admit that I'm saving this to listen to this weekend, and I haven't. But in Twitter it seems like it's a banger.
00:01:39.390 - 00:01:41.902, Speaker B: It's definitely a banger. Wait, Turun, did you not see it either?
00:01:42.036 - 00:01:45.070, Speaker C: I didn't see it either. I've been focusing on things.
00:01:45.220 - 00:01:47.402, Speaker B: Unbelievable. Unbelievable, unbelievable.
00:01:47.466 - 00:01:49.120, Speaker A: Sorry. Sorry for doing my job.
00:01:49.570 - 00:01:52.542, Speaker B: Okay. Tom, did you watch it?
00:01:52.596 - 00:02:15.426, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I'm the only one. I was really impressed, actually by Laura's research and how pointed her questions were. She went really into detail on things like what happened with this Djen box thing or what happened with this. I think I saw someone that said a tweet that was like, take a shot every time Doe says the thing people don't understand. And I think it was like a very apt description of the interview.
00:02:15.618 - 00:02:17.190, Speaker D: How many shots were you by the end?
00:02:17.260 - 00:02:58.450, Speaker A: I mean, you're talking at least in the teens, so it's just like I in some ways empathize because I think what was actually happening or how terror actually worked and how it was percepted publicly were very, very different. But at the same time, I didn't get a lot of sense of remorse from Doe in the sense that he's like, yeah, it is what it is. And we acted certain ways. A lot of it feels very hearsay where he's like, oh, these weren't our funds. This is something else. So I don't have all the information on who was actually doing what as sort of the terror collapse went down. But yeah, it was super informative and entertaining to watch, honestly, like, Laura really kind of grilled dough.
00:02:59.110 - 00:03:42.066, Speaker B: It was definitely great TV. There are a lot of good accusatory moments on the main stage, which it was fun to watch. I did come away feeling very unsure because you'd expect there to be some point where Doe I mean, one, you have to ask, why did Doe agree to do this? Right? Like, he's got active court case against him. He's got criminal cases against him in addition to civil cases. So it does feel like what was his lawyer thinking in agreeing to let him do this? Or maybe he didn't consult his lawyer. It seemed like he sort of had an answer for everything, and some of them were very clear cut. Like, hey, for example, Laura was grilling him of like, hey, it looked like your Block Explorer was censoring certain transactions where you guys were minting SDT for yourselves in order know, do something or other.
00:03:42.066 - 00:04:16.686, Speaker B: And he was like, no, that is not true. Our block explorers didn't censor anything. In fact, it's all open source. You can go check it out yourself. And so I'd love to see the fact finders go and kind of take all the explanations he gave for each individual element and see whether or not he was telling the truth, if in fact he was. And supposedly there's an auditor who's going through the LFG books who's going to go through all this stuff after the fact and actually verify some of the claims that have been made and some of the arguments between himself, DFL and some of the accusers. And hopefully we'll get some clarity on was Doe telling the truth about these things.
00:04:16.686 - 00:04:48.694, Speaker B: Personally, I can believe that he may be telling the truth. And that at the end of the day, when somebody gets put on public trial the way that Doe has, there's always going to know innuendos and kind of random things that kind of look weird. That I'm sure every single crypto project, if you turn over enough stones and you paint them in enough light, they look very suspicious. They look very strange. They look very like somebody trying to profit off a protocol. When you just see transactions on chain, you have no context, you don't know what they are. But I can also believe that maybe there was some genuine foul play.
00:04:48.694 - 00:05:35.880, Speaker B: But I kind of feel like the fact that he's coming out publicly and really directly answering almost every single question that Laura answered to him means that he doesn't seem to be afraid. So it feels to me know, our suspicion that we've mentioned earlier that this might be mostly people trying to basically say, like, look, we invested in this stablecoin that blew up and we want to find somebody to go kind of nail them to a cross and say, this is this person's fault. And it kind of feels like that maybe is what's happening with Doe. We'll get a better answer to that once we have the full accounting of what happened with TfL. But honestly, my takeaway from that interview is that he seemed very confident in his answers. He seemed to be pretty self assured that there wasn't any foul play.
00:05:36.650 - 00:05:54.380, Speaker D: Well, I'm excited for the forensics and the auditors and the truth of open source analysis to sort of come through and shine a light on all clear or oh man, no one knew this.
00:05:54.750 - 00:06:42.214, Speaker B: And the thing is, even an all clear is not going to be an all clear for most people. So I imagine for the Korean government where he's currently got a criminal indictment for them, I doubt well, maybe, I don't know. I don't want to speculate, but my guess is that there will be people who want to go after him regardless of whether all the accusations that have been thrown around around malfeasance or unjust enrichment turn out to be false. Even then, I'm sure there are going to be people who try to find some way to pin the disaster as some kind of criminal affair. But I did take his point, and he made this point very clearly, which is something that I think I've stated on the podcast before, that I think it's very important to differentiate between failure and fraud. They're not the same. The he made an interesting defense of the basis cash the basis cash revelation as well, which is the claim that, look, I was never really involved.
00:06:42.214 - 00:06:59.506, Speaker B: Like, it was two other developers from TfL. I gave them my blessing to go and build this thing. I should post it on the Telegram account for a little while, maybe. Clearly I shouldn't have done that. That was a stupid thing to do. But it's like there were a lot of people who built stuff on Terra that I helped support. I'm not responsible for every individual thing they do.
00:06:59.506 - 00:07:16.120, Speaker B: And I didn't see basis cash as the failure of Terra. They're two different things. I wasn't even working on basis cash. And so I think he made a fair point in a reasonable defense of now, if he was right about that, then yes, I think it's a reasonable defense of the Terra sorry, the basis cash story.
00:07:16.730 - 00:07:47.060, Speaker A: Yeah. I also feel like there are no knives out for sort of the sub promoters of some of this stuff, like the people who are running those anchor SPVs or the people who are actually running those front ends that were taking in ACH money and putting into anchor. And I feel like we've heard really nothing about those people because I don't get the impression it was actually Doe going out and promoting people saying, hey, you should take all your money out of the bank and put it into Anchor. It was all these other people and Doe was just sort of building the thing, mostly building luna, rather.
00:07:47.990 - 00:08:23.402, Speaker B: Yeah. It's very clear, though, that the crux of what rubs you the wrong way was his arrogance about the whole thing. And I felt like that was one of the real highlights of the interview, was her talking about, like, do you regret the way that you spoke about this stuff? The way that you fought with people, the way that you showed this kind of limitless confidence that gave people confidence that there was no way that Tara was going to fail. It seemed like he I don't know, it's hard to tell what's real contrition and what's you know, I've been counseled by my lawyer to express contrition, so I don't know. It's clear that this is not the last word on yeah.
00:08:23.456 - 00:08:29.870, Speaker C: As a non watcher, did he actually reveal anything about his whereabouts?
00:08:30.370 - 00:08:40.340, Speaker B: No, he was very intentional that it's like, look, it's very unsafe for me to mention my whereabouts because I've been targeted everywhere that I have mentioned my whereabouts, which I can also believe.
00:08:41.430 - 00:08:46.580, Speaker A: It did look like he was in some sort of bunker club, though, so it looked pretty nice.
00:08:46.950 - 00:09:07.690, Speaker B: That's true. It looked interesting, to say the least. He did mention that he's very didn't you say he's very into building furniture? And I was like, did he build that thing behind him? Did not peg him for somebody who's into building furniture. Usually you expect more stability from furniture than we got out of. Right.
00:09:07.760 - 00:09:12.560, Speaker C: I didn't know you ever had enough of a funny bone to make a joke like that.
00:09:12.930 - 00:09:53.898, Speaker B: Every now and again, it comes out when I'm talking about terra. You never know what might. Right, all right, so, speaking of disasters, we should talk about the hacks that took place over the last couple of weeks. So the first one, which is probably the most ridiculous hack that I have seen in a very long time, was the Mango Markets hack. So, quick background. So, Mango Markets, one of the biggest markets on Salana, one of the biggest DeFi protocols. So Mango markets, I believe there was both like a perps protocol, but also lending Mango markets, basically, they had, like, 160,000,000 Ish TVL and there was an attack that took place against them by an initially anonymous address.
00:09:53.898 - 00:10:31.858, Speaker B: That. Basically what they did is they bought a bunch of Mango tokens and then manipulated Mango on spot markets to massively increase the price of Mango, which made the protocol think that they had a huge amount of collateral. And then using that huge amount of collateral, they borrowed all the real money in Mango, meaning like the USDC and the Seoul and whatever, they borrowed all that out. Mango, of course, then collapsed on the spot markets after they stopped buying. I think they used, like, $10 million to buy up this huge amount of spot Mango to massively shoot up the price because it was very low liquidity. And then the Mango price collapses. And by that time, they've already borrowed all of the collateral out of the Protocol and basically seize everything besides the Mango tokens.
00:10:31.858 - 00:11:07.762, Speaker B: So as a result, Mango Markets was totally drained. Okay, you're on Salana. Salana doesn't have a huge amount of TVL anymore. It's like between one and 1.5 billion, I believe. And so trying to fence all the money in Mango is pretty hard on Salana, right? There aren't a lot of places for you to hide. And so what happens is that the Protocol hacker ends up giving a governance proposal to the Protocol, where he proposes to return the majority of the money, but to keep 40 million for himself as a finder's fee, as well as a promise not to prosecute him.
00:11:07.762 - 00:11:41.534, Speaker B: And this proposal ends up passing governance, which is absolutely insane. Then shortly after, the proposer of the actual hacker ends up being doxxed. And so we now know who the hacker is. The hacker is this guy. Avi Abraham eisenberg. He claimed in his tweet, I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week. I believe all our actions were legal, open market actions using the Protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.
00:11:41.534 - 00:12:02.110, Speaker B: So he's now become a little bit of a micro celebrity within DeFi, kind of like Ken Bone kind of character. I almost feel like where now he's kind of playing it up in the character and he's kind of owning it. What did you guys think about good old Avi and his Mango Markets exploit?
00:12:02.270 - 00:12:43.122, Speaker D: Well, I'll start with the one side perspective. There's obviously a number of people on Twitter who view this guy as a folk hero. I'm going to take the opposite side, which know, what he did was market manipulation. Whether you believe that it's legal or illegal, my view is that it is illegal as clear market manipulation. It's also deeply unethical. And even though Coda's law, he completely violated the expectation of the Protocol, the users, the community. And you can rebrand a hack or an exploit however you'd like.
00:12:43.122 - 00:13:49.714, Speaker D: You can rebrand a hacker or an exploit into a profitable trading strategy. I could try to rebrand bank robbery or some other horrible crimes as profitable trading strategies. It doesn't make them right and it doesn't make them legal. And at the end of the day, I think what he has demonstrated is that as of right now, he has basically robbed the Protocol in broad daylight and is bragging about it. And it's really curious to see where it goes from here. I think one part of him is correct in that every protocol has to address the risk parameters, assuming that some black hat asshole is going to try to exploit it. Right? And it's a great wake up call for every DeFi project on every single blockchain to take this moment as a wake up call, there was already a copycat attack for the world's tiniest borrowing protocol on Sello, where it was like the Moo token or something like that.
00:13:49.832 - 00:13:51.086, Speaker C: Moolah markets.
00:13:51.198 - 00:14:50.300, Speaker D: Yeah, imagine it was like a market way smaller than Mango, but the same exact construct that was already attacked in the exact same way where Moo, which had even less know, was used to attack it. It's a wake up call for every DeFi protocol, every DeFi team, every DeFi community. Just assume that some black hat is going to be attacking you. What's going to slow them down? Well, conservative risk management, both technical and market risk. But also this is one of those things where I think the community itself has to say like, hey, it's not cool, or exchanges have to say like, hey, we don't want your money that you've robbed from a protocol. There need to be more of a community response in general or it's going to continue and it's going to escalate. This guy is shopping around similar trades to hedge funds being like capitalize me, and I'm going to go after bigger fish by robbing protocols again.
00:14:50.300 - 00:15:07.230, Speaker D: At some point this has to stop. And either it stops from the government coming into the sector, or it stops from the entire community saying, dude, no, this isn't a good thing, even if you call it a profitable trading strategy. So I think he sucks.
00:15:07.970 - 00:16:30.342, Speaker C: I guess there are a couple things that are worth pointing out with regards to this attack and more like General Oracle manipulation stuff. The first thing is that the beginning of this bull cycle started with an asset that is probably everyone on this podcast would agree is 100% a security and not even a question, which is FTT. And it started with FTT being this thing where an exchange, that's a new exchange, bootstrapped itself to basically allow people to get really cheap collateral early by basically giving people this token that was really cheap and you could use as collateral on the exchange. That way, basically, if the price of the collateral went up, you now could borrow more, you could take more margin, you could take more risk. And that was sort of a way of being like, hey, you don't have to put your ether stablecoins here. You can get this token that theoretically gets fees from this exchange, which is a centralized Hong Kong company burning its fees into the token. The beginning of the bull market, it's always actually, if you time it correctly and you're making a new exchange, allowing people to re hypothecate off your own asset, that is sort of implicitly or explicitly getting fees from the venue that you're using is a good way of bootstrapping these systems.
00:16:30.342 - 00:17:13.400, Speaker C: Mango certainly and certainly did the same thing right, like Mango's token. Actually, if I remember correctly, the token launched before the protocol was running. I forget it was very close, though. I forget if it was right before or right after, but the token was there very early. And one of the easiest ways, especially in a bull market, to increase usage of your protocol is to say, hey, we're going to have, like, crazy risk parameters. If you use the Mango token as collateral, and if you're a number go upland, well, liquidation probability is quite low, obviously a very degenerate form of risk management, but it is a good bootstrapping tactic. Right.
00:17:13.400 - 00:17:55.806, Speaker C: And so I think if you assume that it's a bootstrapping tactic, you also have to understand that bootstrapping tactics have a lifetime and you have to update your parameters as a function of market conditions. You can't just believe that this bootstrapping thing is going to work forever. You could argue the same thing happened to FTT. Why is SBF shilling FTT nowadays to try to get people to catch the fee burn? I mean, it's a very similar thing. There's a while you didn't need to do that, and now it actually is kind of important to the stability of their exchange, given how much collateral was denominated in FTT at FTX. Right. The difference is a centralized exchange, if something like this happens, can just step in and be like, kick out the user.
00:17:55.806 - 00:18:44.900, Speaker C: Right. In this case, you use the same type of bootstrapping growth hack that the centralized exchange uses, but you have none of the ability to do a reclamation in the same way. And so I think there was a lot of carelessness on that side outside of what you would call the attacker or hacker. From the perspective that both Soland and Mango have been sort of pretty, I'd say irresponsible with monitoring their protocols, right. We've seen both of them have the same type of problem. And I think a lot of this has to do with a trying to make your own exchange security token used as collateral, which again works on the way up, but on the way down, or even mildly on the way down. You probably should be starting to tampon and not let people do that.
00:18:44.900 - 00:19:30.034, Speaker C: And I think there's a lot to be said about the fact that you do need to dynamically manage these things. The other thing that's actually quite interesting is the insurance fund for Mango was also insolvent. Not just actually the loans that were made. So the insurance fund is supposed to cover these insolvencies if they occur. But the problem is the insurance fund was also completely denominated 98% in Mango itself. Obviously, when Mango crashes because of this type of thing, the insurance fund can't cover any insolvency because it's crashing exactly at the same time that everything is going wrong. And so there's a lot of fallacies here.
00:19:30.034 - 00:19:31.170, Speaker C: I'm not going to shill.
00:19:32.150 - 00:19:35.166, Speaker B: I did not realize the insurance fund was in Mango. That's insane.
00:19:35.278 - 00:19:41.014, Speaker C: I'm not going to shill my own book about how you should avoid these pitfalls, but that's all.
00:19:41.052 - 00:19:44.534, Speaker B: But if you want to know how to avoid these pitfalls, give Tarun a call. Yeah.
00:19:44.572 - 00:19:47.430, Speaker D: Let Tarun convert your mango into USDCoin.
00:19:48.330 - 00:20:26.194, Speaker B: There you go. Yeah. What really struck me about this, I agree with those points. Obviously, Tarun, in terms of, yes, having your own native asset as collateral in the beginning is kind of a nice bootstrapping mechanism, but you got to move beyond it, especially when you've got serious capital and you want to build a stable protocol. The thing about this whole saga, I mean, the attack itself is pretty straightforward, right? It's not a genius attack. It's something that a lot of people have thought about before. The thing that's so striking was just how brazen the whole thing is and how gangster the proposal was of like, okay, I'm going to give you back enough money to make your users whole.
00:20:26.194 - 00:20:46.602, Speaker B: Let me keep the rest. Also, don't at me. The idea that you can also waive a criminal prosecution by a Dow vote is also insane. I'd love to see what happens when I don't know. Where did you know where this person lives? Is he an American?
00:20:46.736 - 00:20:49.340, Speaker D: I believe he's in the Southern District of New York.
00:20:50.750 - 00:21:25.634, Speaker B: Okay. That's a good place to be making these Dow proposals from. I mean, this seems so absurd part of the other news that we didn't mention earlier. So he actually made a bet, a side bet with somebody from Twitter who bet that he would not be oh, according to Laura, he's actually in Israel. Okay, so maybe look, I don't know. Israeli police are pretty intense, too, but I don't know what I expect to happen. I don't know enough about Israeli law here, but, yeah, I think it's going to be rough.
00:21:25.682 - 00:21:34.150, Speaker C: I don't think we've ever heard of globally accepted non prosecution agreements in history. I'm a little dubious of that.
00:21:34.300 - 00:22:03.570, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an interesting one. And of course, there were Americans who had money in mango, and so I'm sure US. Prosecutors will find some way to establish jurisdiction over this dude, especially given one of the best things that you can do to get law enforcement after you is to brag about your take and to make headlines, which this guy has managed to do doubly. So, yeah, this seems just like, so brazen that this is not going to end well for this gentleman.
00:22:04.550 - 00:22:15.106, Speaker D: Hopefully. I'll just say hopefully. I mean, I don't ever wish anybody ill, but this is one of those such brazen crimes that you don't want it to become a pattern.
00:22:15.298 - 00:22:54.930, Speaker B: Yeah. And look, I mean, the idea that, well, the code lets you do this, therefore it's legal is like I think this is obviously not how anything works, ever. If that were true, then every hack on chain would be legal, which obviously they're not in which we know because people have been prosecuted before for hacking people on chain so I think this is just an obvious bunk. So we'll see what happens. But of course, the gears of justice turned much more slowly than the new cycle of Twitter. But that was not the only hack that took place. In the last couple of weeks, we had another massive hack, one of the largest hacks ever on BNB chain.
00:22:54.930 - 00:23:58.290, Speaker B: So this one was also pretty insane. So what happened was that there was a let me try to follow this because it's a pretty intense one. So what happened was that there was basically a vulnerability in BNB's relayer bridge, which allows you to move funds from Binance into BSc. And basically what the attacker did is they were able to forge arbitrary messages for sort of pretending that they were relaying sort of these cross chain transactions of minting BNB. And they were able to mint 2 million BNB, which is worth hundreds of millions of dollars using this bug. Basically, I think it was like in some Cosmos SDK kind of Iavl tree module that wasn't verifying proofs correctly. And so using this bug, they were able to quickly mint 2 million BNB, take this 2 million BNB, deposit into Venus, borrow just kind of like the same thing as having Mango borrow as many other assets as they could, bridge those assets into other chains, and then basically run the assets that they had on other chains.
00:23:58.290 - 00:24:17.290, Speaker B: They tried to make a run for it and try to go sell them, deposit a curve, whatever, onto other blockchains. So I think within like a couple hours of this hack, BNB chain shut down. So they unilaterally decided, we are going to halt the chain. I'm sorry, BNB chain is going down for maintenance, which is kind of insane.
00:24:17.450 - 00:24:20.014, Speaker D: Basically all the time. What's the big deal?
00:24:20.132 - 00:25:12.366, Speaker B: Salana constantly gets hacked, so that's why it keeps going down. So the BNB chain was down until basically they could stop and freeze the actors. Of course, they were able to get away with about 100 something million tokens that they'd already bridged out. But I think on BNB chain, I believe they are now doing governance votes to decide what to do with the hackers frozen assets once they got BNB chain up and running again. So I don't know that we have any information about the attacker or any speculation about who they might be, but this was clearly a very sophisticated attack, and it was one that ended up resulting in a very large CVE for the entire Cosmos ecosystem. That caused a patch to get pushed out, I think, last week to pretty much every Cosmos SDK chain. So, again, although the exploit itself was really, really large, it seems like the attacker made off with on the order of 100 something million.
00:25:12.366 - 00:25:20.686, Speaker B: I don't know. It's clearly been a bad couple of weeks for blockchain security. Did you guys have any reflections on the BNB chain hack?
00:25:20.878 - 00:25:55.040, Speaker D: Well, the BNB chain one is interesting for two reasons. One, it's example number 712 of bridges are hard. Bridges are like right now, the weak point in security for a lot of these things. But the thing that was technically interesting about it is that it required some pretty deep diligence and cryptographic understanding this was not a script kitty attack. Right. This was far more in depth and complex than anything Avi is doing on Mango markets. Right.
00:25:55.040 - 00:26:23.350, Speaker D: Probably required a lot of planning and analysis. And Binance chain was probably the biggest opportunity to burn what amounts to be almost a zero day. The whole ecosystem that's vulnerable has figured out how to patch it. And in doing so, they've basically upgraded a lot of the cryptographic libraries for the entire ecosystem industry as a whole. And this amount to, in some ways, like burning a zero day. Right. So hopefully this can't get replayed again.
00:26:23.350 - 00:26:51.054, Speaker D: Or there's not the opportunity to. This is the one time we'll see it. And the deep cryptographers in the world can learn from this and prevent this from ever happening again. And the rest of us users will just continue to use blockchains a little bit safer and NetNet it might be a good thing for the ecosystem after everyone gets their money back. And at the end of the day, $100 million is like a day's worth of trading profit for finance. So they'll cover it. Whereas something like Mango I don't know if anyone's going to be better off on this.
00:26:51.172 - 00:27:21.260, Speaker A: I'm surprised they almost let this happen in a way. I thought the whole idea with BSE is it's like Binance's Sandbox and nothing can go wrong other than maybe losing some money on a bad trade. And it seems like it would have been somewhat simple to just check some invariance and then given that everything is colocated anyway, and there's only a few Validators, just shut down the chain if something's going wrong. But in this scenario, you have all the downsides of a decentralized permissionless system. But it seems like the upsides are not as present.
00:27:22.590 - 00:27:44.062, Speaker B: Yeah, there clearly wasn't a lot of defense in depth here, but I think it's also pretty hard to do in blockchains, especially when these third party bridges, because I believe they exited through third party bridges. Right. So if it's not like a BNB bridge, it's pretty hard for BNB to be like, oh, something weird happened. We're going to freeze all our bridges. So if they're using other bridges, then there's kind of no way out.
00:27:44.196 - 00:28:10.200, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I was thinking the fact that it's Binance's own bridge and they run so many of the Validators, you would think it would be simple enough to have something detecting because this was not an atomic attack, which is always so difficult. I mean, it's impossible to defend against. This was similar to Mango markets, a multi step, multi transaction process. And so you would think it would be simpler to see that. As it's happening and shut down the chain if they voted to do so.
00:28:11.130 - 00:28:46.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I can see that. I mean, having an automated chain shutdown is pretty drastic because I imagine you'd get a lot of false positives. So that's, like, a really scary thing to have running in the background. I do agree with you. My understanding of the attack was that BNB's actual bridge, and I don't understand the mechanics here, so I might be getting some stuff wrong, but it seemed like these are proofs being relayed on chain, which basically means that this is primarily an on chain bridge. It's not a multi SIG type bridge. Right? Like, you're actually submitting proofs of blocks onto the blockchain.
00:28:46.334 - 00:28:58.458, Speaker B: So if that's the case, then it's pretty hard for there to be, like, a secondary mechanism that goes in and automatically turns things off or freezes things. But again, I don't know the details. I'm very much speculating here.
00:28:58.624 - 00:29:50.998, Speaker C: I mean, this was actually, like, a problem in Tendermint. Tendermint had this particular sort of merkel tree that didn't correctly check all edge cases. And so basically what happened is I guess, the listeners who don't know what merkel tree is, a merkel tree is like, how is one of the ways you represent sort of a compact proof of a block. So you take the set of transactions and then you hash each transaction. Then you make a hash of the hashes, and you kind of group them up until you get a tree. And I think, effectively, what happened was if you had an empty hash as your neighbor, there was some way you could get the proof to not actually check that. And usually that would be like an error.
00:29:50.998 - 00:30:29.560, Speaker C: So what you could do is you could insert a transaction that would always return true when the merkel proof was checked, even though it never actually generated, you didn't have to generate a signature for it. And so I think this is actually just like a generic thing, cosmos. I'm not sure if it was actually fixed outside of this incident or if this actually is like a CVE, like a serious bug in all Tendermint implementations. That part I didn't check enough about. But the idea is you basically could insert this transaction that would always just everyone, if they're running stock, tendermint would validate as true, even though it had no signatures on it.
00:30:30.250 - 00:30:34.082, Speaker B: I see. So it wasn't at a smart contract level. It was in the consensus layer. No, it wasn't.
00:30:34.146 - 00:30:47.558, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. The merkel tree, which is, like that's why it's actually quite a new Robert's point. It's not like, hey, I just swept the order book of Mango.
00:30:47.734 - 00:31:16.900, Speaker A: I did think it was kind of funny that there's a governance debate about whether or not to freeze the seized funds in addition to the patch that has fixed the bug. So maybe we will see a CZ's vision coming out of this, which leaves the hacked funds untouched, but I feel like every chain goes through at some point where there's some catastrophic failure that leaves a lot of funds isolated, and they have to decide whether or not to freeze those or to reclaim them.
00:31:17.830 - 00:31:30.070, Speaker B: I imagine part of the reason why they had to do that was just the veneer of decentralization, because everyone knows what the answer is. The answer is like, yeah, you freeze the guy, but if you do it themselves and it kind of looks like, oh, BNB controls it.
00:31:30.140 - 00:31:33.162, Speaker D: No, whatever they do, they shut down the chain as soon as it happens.
00:31:33.216 - 00:31:40.182, Speaker B: No. Come on, Robert. Don't be like that. Don't be like that. No, of course not. BNB is so decentralized. Stop.
00:31:40.336 - 00:32:14.534, Speaker C: But actually, one funny thing is that the role that these governance votes are playing is, like, maybe we didn't fully democratize finance, but we definitely democratized company boards because we now have, like, 5 million people in the forums fighting about something that's usually like, a board decision, right? Like, this freezing thing is very much like, if this happened, it would be like HSBC deciding whether to freeze some account, and it would be like, if it was so bad, it would go to the board, or if it was Credit Suisse, it would never reach the board.
00:32:14.652 - 00:32:18.966, Speaker B: The same thing was true with the mango markets of a bunch of people in governance for us deciding whether to.
00:32:18.988 - 00:32:26.460, Speaker C: Take the it's interesting that we board vote, like, the most boring thing that no one ever wants to do.
00:32:26.830 - 00:32:58.782, Speaker B: It's true. It's true. The things people do for decentralization man. So, yeah, it's been a bad couple of weeks and a couple of ridiculous hacks and some very ridiculous governance decisions that have been made. That was not the only drama, though. There was another piece of drama that actually we discussed on the chopping block on a special episode that we did over the weekend because Magic Eden announced that they are no longer going to be enforcing royalties and that they're going to zero fees. So this caused a giant stir.
00:32:58.782 - 00:33:15.420, Speaker B: A bunch of people got really mad on Twitter saying that Magic Eden is anti royalty. There's evil. Why are you doing this? And so we ended up doing a debate over the weekend with Legion, Laura, Joe Shun from Magic Eden, and myself. Did you guys see the debate? No, nobody saw.
00:33:16.670 - 00:33:17.850, Speaker D: I'm waiting.
00:33:20.270 - 00:33:26.560, Speaker B: This weekend. Okay. Of course, that's when you watch all your unchained content, you like to save it up. Okay, good.
00:33:27.250 - 00:33:30.986, Speaker D: I work during the week, and I watch on Saturdays.
00:33:31.018 - 00:33:33.586, Speaker C: Look, some of us have jobs that.
00:33:33.608 - 00:33:34.820, Speaker A: Are not being a.
00:33:38.630 - 00:33:40.260, Speaker D: Founders. You guys are.
00:33:43.590 - 00:33:50.742, Speaker B: So I didn't realize how busy you guys were. Sorry. How naive of me. Tom, did you at least watch it? You didn't watch it either.
00:33:50.796 - 00:33:55.094, Speaker A: I feel like I'm living the debate every day at Dragonfly, so I don't need guys.
00:33:55.132 - 00:34:04.860, Speaker B: Are you? Oh, my God. All right, fine. Well, whatever. We can relive the debate in real time by talking about it. So what did you guys think about Magic Eden shutting down?
00:34:06.270 - 00:34:46.118, Speaker D: You know, I didn't see the debate, but I have some strong feelings on this. So one is, I think the biggest misunderstanding in all of NFT and crypto. And when you talk to people outside of crypto, they're like, oh wow, the royalties can be baked into the NFT. It's like, no, they can't be baked into the like. And I think what people are realizing now is that there aren't royalties baked into the NFT. Like you can't actually, at an NFT level, enforce royalties where someone gets a fraction of the fee every time it trades. It's been something conceived of really at the marketplace level and socially enforced, not through the immutable laws of blockchain technology.
00:34:46.118 - 00:35:31.798, Speaker D: That being said, I think people are discovering that what they thought was true about the world is not true and that royalties are not a part of NFTs. Royalties are a part of artists requests and desires and marketplace is supporting that. But a marketplace wants to get volume and win. So the easiest way to do that is to make it the lowest cost place to trade. If you can go from a 5% fee to a 0% fee, that's a lot for a trade, especially if you're an NFT person, you're going to flip it a couple of times, you might sell it by like those fees really add up. And so it makes a lot of sense for Magic Eden to attempt to get rid of fees. Now, there's really two things that are interesting here.
00:35:31.798 - 00:36:12.174, Speaker D: One is, and I think this is actually really productive for the whole space, and I hope everyone might agree to this, shifting the fee from the seller to the buyer. Now, I think when you're thinking about a royalty or an artist, it makes a lot more sense for the fee to be on the purchaser as opposed to the seller of an NFT. And I actually think that this part of their action was really well thought out. I think if there is going to be a royalty fee, it should be paid by the buyer. Whether or not it's optional, it should add to the price and be a buyer premium, in effect. Why? Well, this is somebody entering a marketplace and a community. This is somebody like beginning their journey with the artist, not someone ending their journey with the artist.
00:36:12.174 - 00:37:03.266, Speaker D: It should really be an entry fee as opposed to an exit fee. So I think this piece of Magic Eden's change was actually quite good and quite sound, which is saying if there is a royalty, it goes to the buy side, not the sell side, not somebody leaving the community goes the person joining the community. Well, second, you know, making it voluntary, I honestly expect that in the absence of other tools, most users are going to choose not to pay. Most people are somewhat greedy, most people pennies. I assume they're going to see a lot of and the data will tell the story, but I assume they're going to get a lot of traction and a lot of people setting that to zero in their account setting because they're doing it at the account level, and you can literally be like, oh, I default to zero. A lot of people are going to default to zero.
00:37:03.368 - 00:37:09.240, Speaker A: I want to hear the rest of it. So we actually have the data now because it's been live for a few days. Okay.
00:37:11.530 - 00:37:27.850, Speaker C: By the way, one quick question. This sort of buyer versus seller fee thing, is there an analog in house purchases? I guess it's like the homeowner association gets paid by the buyer. Because I'm thinking of it in normal illiquid assets, there has to be some equivalent kind of thing, right?
00:37:28.000 - 00:37:35.470, Speaker D: Yeah, the seller pays the fees of a house generally. I mean, there might be taxes on the buyer, but the seller is paying the commissions and the brokers and all that.
00:37:35.540 - 00:37:43.850, Speaker B: Isn't that fake, though? Because the seller is going to pass on the fee to the buyer. It's going to affect the price. Right. Does it matter who's paying the fee?
00:37:44.010 - 00:37:44.702, Speaker D: Good question.
00:37:44.756 - 00:37:59.062, Speaker B: I don't know. Because it's kind of like tax incidents, right? Like in economics, people study tax incidents, which is like, you tax one side, but they raise their price, which means that a lot of times it doesn't, actually. Anyway, sorry, can you narrate what's happening here?
00:37:59.196 - 00:38:33.130, Speaker A: Yeah. So basically, pre change, the vast majority of Magic Eden sales had a royalty involved. So this is looking at non zero royalties versus total sales. So 80, 90% of sales had a royalty after the 14th was when the change went in. You're down to, like, let's say 10% of trades having a royalty. So I do want to get the dollar value for this, but it's pretty interesting that you can just check out the data immediately after the change and see what people's revealed preferences, which is they usually don't want to pay royalties.
00:38:33.290 - 00:38:40.126, Speaker B: So since the change, volume has gone up a lot. Right. Because I heard that Wash trading has gotten really intense on Magic Eden because it's zero fee.
00:38:40.238 - 00:38:50.886, Speaker A: That's what people are saying. But, I mean, the number of trades is the same, so I don't know where that's coming from. Unless people are just trading some insane dollar amount on those trades and sort.
00:38:50.908 - 00:38:54.246, Speaker B: Of marking up the what is the top line?
00:38:54.428 - 00:38:55.990, Speaker A: That's just number of trades.
00:38:57.450 - 00:39:00.074, Speaker B: I see. Okay. Looks like it's gone up a little bit.
00:39:00.192 - 00:39:02.010, Speaker D: Yeah. Ignore the final day.
00:39:02.080 - 00:39:03.178, Speaker B: Yeah, the final line just because the.
00:39:03.184 - 00:39:04.220, Speaker D: Day is not it is.
00:39:04.830 - 00:39:06.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I see.
00:39:07.710 - 00:39:15.022, Speaker D: People are pinching pennies. The data speaks for the reality. That was an excellent chart, Tom. Thank you for sharing that.
00:39:15.156 - 00:40:04.198, Speaker A: Thank you. I think the interesting thing is people's narratives. I think is that like, oh, there's a magic Eden clone that has no royalties and therefore they're using that to undercut magic Eden and they're losing market share and therefore they have to be competitive and do that. But in reality, if you look on like Solana, really the main competitor in terms of a pure NFT is Hadeswap, which is like a pseudoswap competitor on magic Eden, which of course does not have royalties. But I think even independent of the royalty and fee discussion, it's just like a totally different model. So I think they're up to like 25% of salana NFT volume depending on the day. So I feel like there's so many factors that are kind of difficult to disentangle here, which is like, okay, do these NFT AMMS outcompete traditional order book exchanges? Is it the lower fees that they charge 50 bips versus 2.5%?
00:40:04.198 - 00:40:17.282, Speaker A: Is it the crater fees or the royalties that are allowing them to outcompete them? And I feel like it's just difficult to sort of separate all those things because you're not really comparing like, for like, with one variable changed for sure.
00:40:17.416 - 00:41:12.850, Speaker D: What I think we need to see and over the weekend, me and former CTO of OpenSea put out a request for startup to explore this concept. What I think has to change is people have to want to pay royalties. It has to be like a positive thing where you're excited to pay a royalty to an artist and support an artist. There's a lot of examples of people like Patreon et cetera, being super excited to support artists and being willing to pay that royalty. But I think if that doesn't exist, they're going to pay zero as Tom has shown. So I think there needs to be more tools for creators, more ways to track royalty payments, more ways to analyze wallets and figure out who is supporting the artist or not. And I think there's going to be actually a renaissance at some point, whether it's like twelve months from now, or five years from now, or two weeks from now.
00:41:12.850 - 00:42:24.300, Speaker D: But at some point I think what's going to happen is some NFT artists or creators are going to figure out a way to get people really excited about this and say like, okay, all the people that are paying the royalty and not opting out get to go to VCON or whatever, or they get the AirDrop. And the ones who don't, don't get the airdrop. I think people are going to figure this out and I think the end state of this whole magic Eden, let's rip away the royalties to build market share thing. The end state of all this is going to be there are royalties going to artists and there is an on chain economy and artists will benefit from the existence of royalties. And they might not be programmatically enforced at the smart contract that created the NFT level, but they're going to be enforced through other means that are probably even more exciting and more advanced and more customizable and allow artists to be even more creative. And instead of just being this like, oh, we get 5% of every trade hooray, that is our roadmap, it's going to be really more creative outcomes where it'll be like experiences and very different interactions because of these royalty streams. And I think NetNet is going to be really cool.
00:42:25.230 - 00:43:12.694, Speaker B: I can believe that. I think if you see creators innovating on more reasons why you want to stay within the sort of lit economy of the pro royalty exchange. And this is one thing that we talked about near the end of the debate is know kyle made the suggestion that having these no royalty exchanges kind of means that, okay now it's really in your interest as a creator to push people onto your own platform to trade and kind of build liquidity and have a marketplace specific to you and your NFTs or your content. Because there we talk about royalties, right, as though there's a separate concept. But really royalties are just like an extra platform fee. If there was only one platform, let's say openc decided 100% market share on every chain, then the royalty is just like an extra platform fee. And if you own the platform, then there is no royalty.
00:43:12.694 - 00:44:06.522, Speaker B: There's just the platform fee, right? And so in reality, royalties, they are kind of a weird concept because if you think about it that way, imagine you just had one NFT marketplace that was OpenSea, they owned everything, okay? And when you have a royalty, basically what you're saying is that, okay, openc, when you sell this product, please charge a margin. Let's say openc is 5%, and then you charge 10%. Okay? So you're saying, please charge a margin of 15% on every purchase and give me two thirds of it. Now, in normal business would be like, wait, why are you telling me what percentage of well, first of all, why are you telling me what margin to charge? Second, why are you telling me what percentage of it you get? No, I tell you what percentage you get. Or we negotiate, right? That's how a normal business exchange of value takes place. But royalties are all dictated by the creator, right? Which is kind of it's just not how any other business would work. Any other business, a creator would say, okay, if you want to list my assets, I get 2%.
00:44:06.522 - 00:44:44.086, Speaker B: Otherwise you get it or don't get it, and they say, oh, well, what about 1%? Oh, well, okay, one and a half, or blah, blah, whatever. It's really important. I'll add this extra thing on top. I'll give you exclusivity. That's the kind of thing that happens is like a bargaining. But in NFTs, it's like, okay, if you say 12% royalty on this thing, the exchange just enforces it, even though they're charging a customer 17% net or whatever, the net of the actual fees are on the exchange and giving the artist almost the vast majority of what they're charging the customer. It's kind of weird, and I think it's not a stable equilibrium, right? That's not the way that an actual functioning market would work.
00:44:44.086 - 00:45:00.440, Speaker B: And so I do think that it's sensible to think that there is going to be a way that artists are going to be able to command more of a premium and capture a bigger share of secondary trading. But I don't think it's going to work the way it works now, which is the artist says 7% and then all the exchanges enforce it on their.
00:45:02.370 - 00:45:29.238, Speaker A: Mean. Speaking of people not realizing royalties not being enforced programmatically, there's also this weird component of at least like OpenSea doesn't even look at the royalty metadata or component of the NFT contract. You have to set it manually on OpenSea. So it's all just sort of like this just huge sort of misnomer and misconception around what is actually going on with royalties. It's literally just like a website has this feature and that's kind of where we're at.
00:45:29.324 - 00:45:53.600, Speaker D: I mean, not that we can learn from the incredibly horrific world of music where royalties are incredibly complicated and shitty and horrible, but they did sort of figure out at least the user experience of it, which is like, I go to a record store, I buy a record, I'm not thinking about royalties. It's $12, and all the rest happens behind the scenes for the user experience.
00:45:54.610 - 00:46:55.598, Speaker B: I mean, one of the things that if this weekend you listen to the debate one thing that came up in the debate was laura, I look forward to getting your comments. One of the things that Laura was bringing up is that, look, one of the reasons why royalties are so important is that, look, if you're an was I was suggesting, look, there are other ways to align interests between artists and their collections, right? One of the ways, of course, is like what Labs did, which is you mint a bunch of NFTs, you keep some back for yourself. It's like a company, you sell some to investors and you own equity. And by owning equity in yourself, like over time, you can sell it later and capture some of your upside. And I do agree that's one of the core things about royalties that's great is it creates this alignment between creators and their products even after they're already sold. Laura made the point that as a creator, as an artist, you don't necessarily have the privilege financially to be able to hold on to some of your own collection, not to sell it because you might need to make rent. You don't have the ability to sit on your own assets or kind of take this long day to bet on yourself.
00:46:55.598 - 00:47:48.046, Speaker B: And so royalties are a way to allow yourself to get this fee stream over time that is very different than having to get this payment all up front. And this is an argument that I've heard now from a few other people talking to me after the debate. And I totally disagree with this framing for a couple of reasons. One, I was chatting with somebody in twitter DMs, who was telling me about this NFT marketplace on solana that allows you not only to sell your NFT, but also to tokenize the royalties and sell the royalties. And of course, if you look at normal artists, right, like regular artists in the world, when they sign a deal with a record label, they sell both the IP and the royalty stream. They keep a small portion of the royalty stream, but very often they sell a huge portion of it up front, right? So like 90% of the royalties and 90% of the IP, or 100% of the IP goes to the record label, and artists willingly sign those kinds of deals. I mean, look, it sucks.
00:47:48.046 - 00:48:27.626, Speaker B: Maybe we wish there are better options, maybe we wish that artists had more bargaining power. But in reality, if somebody wants to get an upfront payment instead of taking a long dated thing, basically saying that, look, an artist shouldn't be able to do that. They shouldn't be able to sell their royalties and they should be forced to keep the royalties and get paid over time, to me, that's basically like saying, okay, artists need to have they need to engage in like a forced savings program. This is effectively what you're telling them is that you can't take the payment up front. You have to kind of divvy out the payment over time. If you had yuga labs do a know some new NFT collection and they said, not only are we selling the collection, we're also selling off the royalties. Anybody can buy the royalty stream for this collection.
00:48:27.626 - 00:48:53.734, Speaker B: A lot of people would buy it. It would be worth quite a lot of money. It might be worth amount of money that's even comparable to the entire collection. Because if you just look at how much money yuga labs makes from each collection versus how much they make from all the royalties, for a lot of them, it's like 50 50 for board apiat club itself. It's like 80 20. Most of the money was in the royalties, not in the initial mint. And so I think it's not as simple as just royalties are a way for artists to save money or to get fees over time.
00:48:53.734 - 00:49:25.434, Speaker B: I think the core thing about royalties that makes them special is the alignment between the artist and what they create after the fact. But I think to your point, Robert, there are other ways to do that. I think that's ultimately what people are going to have to innovate. And either one, you need to create a platform and own the platform and get people to want to pay royalties because they want to be part of your community to create extra perks or extra reasons to stay within the lit economy of your royalties. Or three, just create a culture of patronage. That's kind of what a royalty is. If a royalty is unenforced, then basically it's patronage.
00:49:25.434 - 00:49:43.750, Speaker B: And not everybody's going to be a patron, right? Some people will. Some people will sign up for your patreon just to support you. They don't even need anything, right? It might be easier to get them to do it if you offer perks. But if you don't offer perks, people will do it. And I think right now that seems to be the three different directions you can take if you want the concept of royalties to persist.
00:49:44.090 - 00:49:51.002, Speaker D: I would definitely buy the board ape royalty IP. Right? Token, but not a security.
00:49:51.136 - 00:50:06.158, Speaker B: I can't say whether I mean, if the NFT itself that's a good question. Is the NFT less of a security than the royalty stream? Because the royalties are a function of how often the NFTs are traded. Right?
00:50:06.244 - 00:50:09.440, Speaker D: Hey, the NFT is art, okay? Even if you don't like the.
00:50:12.690 - 00:50:16.378, Speaker B: Okay. If the NFT goes up in value, if the artist does good work, how.
00:50:16.404 - 00:50:40.950, Speaker C: Are trying to claim that this 1933 law, which was very under specified, has the ability to have gradations of being continuously security? And you can compare one thing being more of a security or less of security. It's not like that. It's very binary, and the way you're talking about it basically suggests it rounds up to being a security regardless.
00:50:41.770 - 00:50:49.478, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fair. I just don't know that practically speaking, it's any less of a security than the NFTs themselves would be. Given that in all these cases, you're.
00:50:49.494 - 00:50:51.440, Speaker C: Kind of, hey, is your house security?
00:50:51.890 - 00:50:54.110, Speaker B: Is it? I'm not sure. Are houses securities?
00:50:54.610 - 00:50:55.070, Speaker C: No.
00:50:55.140 - 00:51:00.240, Speaker B: Property? Okay, I guess not, then. I don't know.
00:51:01.650 - 00:51:10.706, Speaker C: I think the argument for the fee stream is it does sort of represent some common endeavor that but why would.
00:51:10.728 - 00:51:12.654, Speaker B: That be more so than an individual NFT?
00:51:12.782 - 00:51:21.830, Speaker C: Because the NFT is actually your expected future profit relies on the actual speculative market. Existing.
00:51:24.970 - 00:51:25.958, Speaker B: Fee stream is a function of.
00:51:25.964 - 00:51:37.850, Speaker C: The velocity, but the fee stream is revenue. So in the Howie test, it's like that's the common enterprise with future expectation of profit matches the fee stream much more than like, oh, the speculative market could not exist.
00:51:38.590 - 00:51:43.326, Speaker B: Hold on, that seems very arbitrary, right? Like if you're buying an NFT because.
00:51:43.348 - 00:51:46.960, Speaker C: You'Re hoping that to get profit no.
00:51:47.810 - 00:51:50.080, Speaker B: Look, I'm not a lawyer, obviously, but.
00:51:51.250 - 00:51:53.710, Speaker D: I buy the monkey. Like the monkey.
00:51:55.570 - 00:52:17.958, Speaker B: All right, look, nominally, I agree with you on the face of it's. Like, okay, one is a picture of a monkey, one is a financial product, right. So I think in a court of law, a lawyer would be like, yeah, that looks like a security, that one looks like a monkey. But I think practically speaking, I'm going to die on the cell. Practically speaking. I think they seem very similar to me because both depend on the efforts of the creator and the community. Both of them.
00:52:17.958 - 00:52:38.158, Speaker B: One is a function of price, the other is a function of velocity. Both of those are things that are ultimately the creator either can or cannot influence them, depending on the approach the creator takes, right? Some creators don't do anything to try to create velocity or create price appreciation. Some try to create both, right? Some try to make both increase, but they're a function of each.
00:52:38.244 - 00:53:02.230, Speaker D: Hold on. Let's take an example. Let's say it's not an NFT on a blockchain. Let's say it's an actual piece of art on the wall. And let's say who's your favorite artist? Doesn't matter. Let's just say super art. Okay? Super artist makes a piece of art and says, hey, I'm going to sell the royalty stream on this to Haseeb, and every time it trades, the SIB gets 1% and Robert's going to buy this really cool piece of art.
00:53:02.230 - 00:53:09.400, Speaker D: How could the really cool piece of art that I'm buying be a security in the offline world?
00:53:09.930 - 00:53:25.818, Speaker B: I agree with that. I agree with that. I agree with you. I don't think that that piece of art should be treated as a security, but the fee stream as well. At that point, it's no longer the efforts of the original artist that's going to get you to sell that thing to someone else. Right? Because that fee stream comes from reselling.
00:53:25.834 - 00:53:29.998, Speaker C: That asset, the mechanism for resale. Right. That's the hard part here.
00:53:30.164 - 00:53:33.674, Speaker B: Common among whom, right? Well, I'm not in a common enterprise.
00:53:33.802 - 00:53:42.400, Speaker D: If I buy the fee stream, the fee stream and Securitizing, that, that's probably an investment contract, for sure. But the art is not.
00:53:44.050 - 00:54:08.646, Speaker B: I mean, look, I whatever. This is probably the wrong forum for us to adjudicate this question, but I think there's a good argument that you sell it to someone else. That person is now party to the contract. But I didn't know that person. I didn't enter into some arrangement with them. Right. I think there's a reasonable argument that, look, the original creator who set this thing in emotion, I'm no longer in a contractual relationship with that person by owning the revenue, by owning the royalty stream.
00:54:08.646 - 00:54:23.258, Speaker B: That's the argument I would make. That's the argument I would make. But anyway, I get your point. I get your point. Okay, we're at time. This was interesting continuation. If you guys have thoughts, please ping us on Twitter and tell us which side of the argument you would take.
00:54:23.258 - 00:54:26.162, Speaker B: But that's it for this week. Signing off.
00:54:26.296 - 00:54:53.722, Speaker C: Yeah, see everybody, one last thing, one last thing. Some guy in the comments and YouTube was giving me shit for not giving the exact Mango insurance number. I went and looked it up, which is 94% Mango. In March, it was 80% Mango right before the hack. And now it's like 50 for 60, 59, 61 something. It's been floating in that range, so to the heckler. Go fuck yourself.
00:54:53.856 - 00:54:56.700, Speaker D: No, I like heckler. I like YouTube guy.
00:54:57.230 - 00:54:59.658, Speaker B: Great. It was great. Thanks, YouTube. Guys.
00:54:59.824 - 00:55:01.130, Speaker A: Stop blabbering.
00:55:04.670 - 00:55:15.054, Speaker B: Just to read the comment, which is on the screen. I don't know if idk if you are unsure about the facts, maybe stop blabbering. Thank you, GN. That was very useful comment. Really appreciate you stepping in there.
00:55:15.172 - 00:55:17.502, Speaker C: I figured I tried to get it in.
00:55:17.556 - 00:55:19.294, Speaker B: No, that's good. You nailed it.
00:55:19.492 - 00:55:24.142, Speaker C: Fucking dominantly. It's not like this is that much better, but I'm happy.
00:55:24.196 - 00:55:25.206, Speaker B: That right.
00:55:25.228 - 00:55:25.846, Speaker D: Thanks, everybody.
00:55:25.948 - 00:55:29.890, Speaker B: All right, thank you, everyone. Signing off. See you all. Bye.
