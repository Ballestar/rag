00:00:00.650 - 00:00:28.646, Speaker A: Mega is like, it's the oldest dow in the world. It controls the biggest decentralized stablecoin in the world. It has more than $130,000,000 in income per year. Currently, it has something like a bit more than $40 million per year in expenses. And at its peak, it was even more. For a long time, we actually didn't even, like, actually, our income wasn't even that high, but our expenses was even higher. And the biggest problem was it was sort of out of control.
00:00:28.646 - 00:00:54.380, Speaker A: Nobody really knew, what are we actually paying for? How are we paying for it? The system was sort of just, like, chugging along with the basic process being that people make proposals to the dow no longer as it was originally, for the sake of the whole dao, but primarily for their own sake. Right. Because what they saw was everyone else is doing the same thing, and you get this kind of coordination problem.
