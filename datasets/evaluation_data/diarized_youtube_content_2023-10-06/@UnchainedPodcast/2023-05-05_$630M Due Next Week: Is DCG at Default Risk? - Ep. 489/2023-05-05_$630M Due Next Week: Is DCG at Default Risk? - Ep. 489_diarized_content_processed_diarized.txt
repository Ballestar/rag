00:01:17.310 - 00:01:19.320, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Laura. Good to see you again.
00:01:20.090 - 00:02:09.906, Speaker B: On April 25, DCG announced via a statement on Twitter that a subset of Genesis Capital creditors have walked away. Two months after what they call a comprehensive settlement was submitted to the bankruptcy court. I spoke to a Genesis creditor who is in this group, and they said they felt that this was mischaracterized, that the two sides didn't have an agreement, but just a framework for what a deal could be. This person also said that this framework had been made with limited financial information and that the group revised the terms based on new information and analysis. Either way, Genesis requested a mediator to help resolve the issue. Meanwhile, DCG owes Genesis $630,000,000 next week. So what do all these recent developments mean for Genesis and DCG?
00:02:10.098 - 00:02:47.790, Speaker A: Well, it's an unfortunate you know, at the outset of the petition, the council representing DCG and Genesis, as well as the creditors, informed the judge they expect a speedy resolution because they've been working at this, and this is a step back. There was a term sheet that was published that outlined the key terms of the deal. There was a framework for the deal. As you mentioned. The ad hoc creditor group has pulled back or walked away from that, as you said, due to new information. There's a lot to unpack in what information they learned, as well as still what significant information is outstanding.
00:02:47.950 - 00:03:00.470, Speaker B: So how are you looking at all these developments? Like, what do you think is likely to happen at this point, especially given DCG's debts to Genesis next week? Do you think it's likely they'll be able to pay them?
00:03:00.620 - 00:03:29.066, Speaker A: I don't believe they'll have the ability to make the debt payments. There are $630,000,000 due on dates ranging from May 9, May 10, and May 11. $631,000,000. DCG reportedly paid off the senior credit facility to Eldridge recently. That means they have less cash to meet these obligations. But we also don't have as much information. We do not have access to the DCG balance sheet.
00:03:29.066 - 00:04:01.210, Speaker A: We know that they published financials recently. They've generated more revenue because the price of bitcoin has increased. However, even the free cash flow one would expect that Grayscale would generate is insufficient to plug the hole. I estimate something like 117,000,000 in cash flow from Grayscale. That's just not enough to plug a $630,000,000 hole. Here are the other reasons too. You have some reporting that the CFO Michael Cranes left.
00:04:01.210 - 00:04:24.942, Speaker A: That is a negative sign. That's a red flag. You're also seeing DCG port codes like Luno, their various executive departures. We haven't seen new venture investments from DCG, or it stopped entirely. The three ways to plug a hole. Either you generate capital from operations again, I don't see enough of that there from Brayscale. Second is you sell assets.
00:04:24.942 - 00:04:40.726, Speaker A: There's been no sale of any of these prized jewels of DCG. Third is you do a capital raise. Haven't seen that announced, and they haven't done a debt refinancing. So unless we see some announcer reporting around that, I just don't see how they're going to make their debt payment.
00:04:40.908 - 00:04:48.410, Speaker B: And so if that's the case, then it looks like, what, a bankruptcy for DCG would also be on the table?
00:04:48.750 - 00:05:24.206, Speaker A: Well, they'll attempt to do an out of court workout. It's very similar to what happened when Genesis announced that they're not honoring withdrawals, so there's no imminent bankruptcy. You attempt to do an out of court workout. You attempt to negotiate with the creditors and arrive at fearable terms. But guess what? That's what they have been doing over the last several months. So they'll have to continue to negotiate. And there's a strong interest that creditors have in preserving the ongoing value of DCG and seeking a settlement promptly.
00:05:24.206 - 00:05:34.210, Speaker A: It's not in the interest for creditors to hurt the ongoing concern of DCG. That doesn't help the creditors, doesn't help DCG.
00:05:34.370 - 00:05:41.590, Speaker B: And so what factors are you looking at to determine how likely it is that they will end up having to file?
00:05:41.750 - 00:06:07.262, Speaker A: Well, let's let things unpack. Let's see what actually happens next week. I think the first thing I'd look for is May 9 is that 200 million loan payment made or not? If that's not made, none of those payments are going to be made. By the way, I don't think you're going to see a scenario where DCG makes partial payments. Either they husband the liquidity or they meet all their obligations. So May 9 is a key date to focus on. Let's see what happens there and let's reassess.
00:06:07.262 - 00:06:32.070, Speaker A: Also, we don't have access to the contracts and the loan agreements. So we're making the best judgments we can based on publicly available information. I should also say that I'm not a party to any of these transactions. I'm not a creditor. Genesis not offering financial advice. I'm simply trying to get a point of view on what this does for GBTC, the spreads, the price of bitcoin, et cetera.
00:06:32.230 - 00:06:44.810, Speaker B: So one other wrench that got thrown into the works is that late Wednesday, FTX signaled its intent to try to claw back almost $4 billion in funds from Genesis. How does that affect matters?
00:06:44.970 - 00:07:02.642, Speaker A: Right. It's an unfortunate surprise. It's a surprise. Know FTX. Several months ago, under John Reigns, he had a slide indicating the course of action he would take to seek recoveries. And the Genesis claim was not on that slide. That's 1 second.
00:07:02.642 - 00:07:23.942, Speaker A: It's been a lot of time. Months have passed. Of course, the last day to file any claims is what's called a bar date. That's May 25. And so we've seen this claim come in for $3.9 billion. That does change the recovery, particularly the recovery for Genesis direct creditors.
00:07:23.942 - 00:08:02.706, Speaker A: And I think they're in a different position than Gemini earn. We'll come back to that. However, Genesis can argue the ordinary course of business defense. So that defense is used as a way for creditors to protect themselves from having to return a preferential payment to the debtor. There are two standards you have to meet to argue for this defense. One is that that payment was made in the ordinary course of the business or the financial affairs of the debtor or creditor. So a margin call would be in the ordinary course of the business operations or calling back a loan due to risk management concerns.
00:08:02.706 - 00:08:32.958, Speaker A: And the second thing, you have to show that's according to the ordinary business terms. So it's really a legal analysis question. But I would say that there's credible grounds for Genesis to dispute that that is legitimate claim. We'll have to see how that plays out. And it may simply be the case that the FTX trustee is seeking to turn over every single rock to maximize their recoveries, even if the probability of recovery is not high.
00:08:33.124 - 00:08:42.738, Speaker B: Do you feel then that Genesis has kind of good arguments to fight that or how likely do you think it is that they'll have to I believe they do.
00:08:42.824 - 00:09:10.410, Speaker A: They do have good arguments. Fight it. However, you really need a lawyer that can look at prior settlements, that have experience in commercial litigation, has looked at any prior case law that's relevant to this matter. But what I've looked at is what are the two standards? They seem to be met at the same time, though I have not seen those contracts, have not seen how often Genesis has called in loans in the ordinary course of their business. So those facts would matter to that analysis.
00:09:10.750 - 00:09:21.178, Speaker B: All right. And then, as you mentioned, the Genesis creditor group also includes the Gemini earn creditors. How did the objectives of these two groups either align or diverge?
00:09:21.274 - 00:09:40.530, Speaker A: This is really interesting. This is a breaking news new development. I hadn't appreciated this before. Happy to share. Note to now, first, I think the Gemini Earn credits have a path to being made whole quickly and promptly as well. And it's for two reasons. One is the security agreement.
00:09:40.530 - 00:10:38.514, Speaker A: So in August of last year, Gemini insisted on a security agreement, and that security was in the form of GBTC that was pledged to Gemini and that's $62 million in GBTC. So that's one. And the second is Gemini has offered up to $100 million if the Gemini Earn cool accepts the plan. Now, right now, the plan is up in the air because creditors from the ad hoc guru have walked away. So I do think they have a path to recovery, and that's terrific news. However, the direct creditors to Genesis, particularly the top 75 creditors at Compromises so called ad hoc group, they don't benefit from that security agreement and they're also not going to benefit from the Gemini Earn sweetener. That up to $100 million to waive these liabilities.
00:10:38.514 - 00:11:13.890, Speaker A: In exchange for that, they are negotiating some other sweetener from DCG. And so these two groups are at odds. Now, the second question, that would be like, what's the voting decision making look like? So you need two thirds of the notional debt balances to agree on a deal and a majority of the creditors to agree on the deal. So the top 75 creditors to Genesis, they have about 62% of the votes. They're not enough to get there. Gemini Earn can swing the vote easily. But the Gemini Earn wants a deal that's on the table today.
00:11:13.890 - 00:11:21.394, Speaker A: They want the liquidity yesterday. So there's a conflict of interest between those two groups.
00:11:21.522 - 00:12:05.806, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment, we're going to unpack this situation between Genesis and DCG a little bit more.

00:12:34.270 - 00:12:51.490, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Rom. So, when you look at what's happening between Genesis and the creditors, who do you feel is like, in the right? Or who do you feel will more likely prevail.
00:12:52.790 - 00:13:24.014, Speaker A: I think there are a lot of misunderstandings here and there's. These Asymmetric information problems and the game theory is broken is my headline. Let me walk you through that and why these misperceptions have created this dragging out scenario here. So, first off, the creditors, particularly the ad hoc creditors, are upset because they view these DCG Genesis transactions as not arms length. Remember that $1.1 billion loan at a well percentage rate payable in ten years? It's not arms length. It's not market terms.
00:13:24.014 - 00:14:31.438, Speaker A: And they're correct about that. They also feel that they have evidence of allegations of fraud, of accounting fraud and misrepresentation. You recall Cameron Leekovas said that there was, quote, unquote, unconscionable behavior in December. The other part is that the former CEO of Genesis who resigned on the petition of the filing, in the evidentiary hearings, he used the term we to refer to both Genesis and DCG. So people know cred was just saying, like, who are you representing? Are you representing Genesis interest or not? And then the other very OD is the Genesis counsel asked the judge if the DCG loan obligations, the May payments due next week, could be put in forbearance during the mediation term. So why was Genesis Council advocating DCG's interest? So you can see why that ad hoc credit committee feels aggrieved and upset. However, here's where I think they're making mistakes.
00:14:31.438 - 00:15:14.446, Speaker A: One is the $1.1 billion loan has essentially allowed these creditors to breach the veil. And these creditors want to breach the veil and go after the BCG mothership. But they've already done that. BCG has already offered in the term sheet to restructure the loans, pay a higher interest rate, pay those loans sooner, so you need faster recovery. And the creditors have upside on the sale of certain digital assets. So there's even a convergent option of debt to BCG equity between 20% to 40%, as well as a path to board seats on BCG.
00:15:14.446 - 00:15:57.518, Speaker A: So in an ordinary bankruptcy, the recourse is limited to the assets of the debtor. In this case, Genesis. Right. Genesis is a limited liability organization, and DCG has already offered up value over and above that. So I think the asymmetric information problem is this. No one has seen the DCG balance sheet. And if you're a creditor from Genesis, you're saying, okay, I know the cash flow from grayscale, grayscale is the cash count bitcoin's gone up in value, and why don't we seek recovery on that? And that can happen over time.
00:15:57.518 - 00:16:36.570, Speaker A: The problem is that you can't get enough payments soon enough to make the creditors whole. I don't believe that Genesis can be made whole on their made payments. So it's an extraordinary form of bargaining leverage that the creditors have. But putting BCG through a potential default scenario is going to create yet another legal proceeding. So something like, call it $50 to $100 million have been spent on legal fees here. Yeah, I don't think that's in anyone's interest. I think the term sheet that was advanced most recently is quite reasonable.
00:16:36.570 - 00:17:14.694, Speaker A: It's very unusual again to go beyond the estate here. And even if you acknowledge that perhaps there was some accounting fraud, this isn't the first time investment banks have committed improprieties. And you don't generally see 20 40% of the equity being given to the claimants. There's a settlement, there's a report of something that's neither confirmed nor denied. The parties move on and you have to deal with the realities of the situation. It's like squeezing blood out of a rock. And it's not in the interest of BCG to publish those balance sheet financials either.
00:17:14.694 - 00:17:26.460, Speaker A: So I think this mix of emotion and misperception is causing this to drag out and the lawyers are benefiting and it's a really unfortunate situation.
00:17:27.070 - 00:17:38.510, Speaker B: And how common is this type of situation between Genesis and the creditors where they kind of seem to come to some sort of an agreement and then things fell apart.
00:17:39.330 - 00:18:35.086, Speaker A: It's unfortunate as disappointing and frustrating. Now recall prior to the petition the parties were negotiating and they went before a federal judge after the petition date and they expect an expedient resolution that was 1 second. They published a term sheet and the term sheet is a framework for the deal and then the ad hoc treader group walked away. So the lawyers have a responsibility to lead and manage their clients as well. The motions are high, the stakes are high, and I'm disappointed in the lawyers. If you're publishing a term sheet that should be a bona fide deal, you should not be publishing a term sheet unless you feel like you've got a credible commitment from your client. If you feel like you need to gather more information, then don't publish the term sheet.
00:18:35.086 - 00:18:45.540, Speaker A: And the legal fees here are significant and that reduces the distributions, the recoveries from the pie, the size of the pie.
00:18:46.090 - 00:18:52.760, Speaker B: So it almost feels like you think the creditors should agree to the latest terms.
00:18:53.370 - 00:19:42.426, Speaker A: I think it's a very reasonable term sheet that balances the interests. If you were to tweak one thing, I think this funding comes down to a lack of trust. DCG has lost trust with that ad hoc header committee group. So for those two board seats that are contemplating the term sheet, instead of making those independent board seats, perhaps those board seats can be appointed by the ad hoc header committee group. That might be a way to split the baby and create trust. Now the DC sheet board is not going to want that. So perhaps what the Genesis ad hoc creditor community can do is advance a slate of potential board candidates, including the creditors themselves or not, and then have DCG assess, interview that slate.
00:19:42.426 - 00:19:45.158, Speaker A: That might be a path forward to create trust.
00:19:45.324 - 00:20:26.870, Speaker B: All right, well we will have to see what happens. I think there's a big meeting the day this comes out, so I'm sure there's going to be more developments in the next few days. One other thing that I wanted to ask you about was the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust has been a cash cow for Grayscale, which is one of the companies in DCG's portfolio. And Grayscale is currently in litigation with the SEC to turn GBTC into a bitcoin ETF. And if that happens, then that would cut fees for them. So if the judgment is in favor of Grayscale, which at the moment it sort of looks like it will, how does that affect the picture for all of these other proceedings?
00:20:27.210 - 00:21:13.106, Speaker A: Yeah, it's another monkey wrench. On the one hand, you would want Grayscale to prevail in their litigation against the SEC. That would unlock the so called Hotel California. At the same time, one would expect to see significant amount of redemption activity as customers move to lower cost ETF products that presumably would also be approved on or around the same time. There are something like seven ETFs that are on the docket, including offered potentially by Doug, Gemini and VanEck. But what that would mean is that it hurts the capital generating power, the number one crown jewel of DCG. And that would hurt the ability of DCG to honor its loan obligations and make creditors whole.
00:21:13.106 - 00:21:57.406, Speaker A: And this goes back to the bar point. So if the ad hoc credit community group waits another year for another process to unfold, that creates more risk on recovery. Grayscale is a melting ice cube that melts right now at a 2% rate per year that's the fees are extracted from the trust. And there's no more bitcoin getting plush in the trust since it's got a discount NAV. But if that ETF is approved, that melting ice cube has got a hot hair blowing over it and it's going to melt very rapidly, and that's the cash flow generating power. So they really need to move to expedient resolution swiftly. And the other side of this is from Barry's perspective.
00:21:57.406 - 00:22:37.950, Speaker A: On the one hand, the higher the price of bitcoin, the greater the capital generating power of Grayscale. And to make these credits whole, on the other hand, it means that DCG has to pay out more next week. So that last payment, that May 11 payment, DCG is short 4550 bitcoin. So the amount owed on that last date has gone up from where it was in December, like 68 million to now, it's like hard 30 million. So it's a really OD situation for DCG, where in a way, they have to hope that the bitcoin price drops next week and then shoots up sometime after that.
00:22:38.100 - 00:22:54.226, Speaker B: Okay, and one last thing is so we're watching for the May 9 date what happens on that date. We're also watching for the bitcoin price. What else would you advise people to watch for in the next week to see how this might all play out?
00:22:54.328 - 00:23:09.874, Speaker A: So there are a few things. One is there was an independent investigation commissioned by the Genesis Special Committee. They were. Kane cleary. Gottlie a former US Southern restrictive best. These are the bad of Saturni's. Hotbedder.
00:23:09.874 - 00:23:35.230, Speaker A: And they were going to investigate the pre petition transactions. Know other allegations. We haven't seen any findings or report of that. Now, in the docket, it was indicated that a summary report will be made available to the public. I have not seen that. I'd like to see that perhaps some of the findings from that report is the reason why the ad hoc credit committee has pulled back. I have no insight into that.
00:23:35.230 - 00:24:23.454, Speaker A: Public doesn't insight into that. So that's one. The second is know the number of questions there. No one has seen the DCG balance sheet, and they're looking a tough spot. If they release the balance sheet, it can make their situation perhaps more challenging in terms of their negotiation. The other part I'd want to know is what is the net equity position of DCG and is that the reason why they may not have been able to refinance their loans or obtain an equity infusion, notwithstanding the threat of litigation and other lawsuits flying around? And the reason I call that out is in August, DCG pledged GBTC to Gemini Earn good move. Gemini Earn for securing that collateral.
00:24:23.454 - 00:25:18.290, Speaker A: As I mentioned, however, on November 16, that collateral was foreclosed upon and liquidated, and that could have caused an impairment to the DCG balance sheet. So I'd want to understand what is a net equity position of DCG. I'd also want to understand what GBTC is held unencumbered, meaning not pledged to Gemini Earn and what's the value of that DCG balance sheet. In the end of Q Four Financials, DCG and Coin has reported some very summary statistics. They said there's something like $600 million in the investment portfolio. What percentage that is? Illiquid venture, what percentage that is liquid securities. We need that to get a definitive analysis on the ability for DCG to generate its liquidity and meet its obligations.
00:25:18.290 - 00:25:24.020, Speaker A: So I think those are the main ideas that you want to look out.
00:25:24.630 - 00:25:31.014, Speaker B: And so if they make, like, partial payment next week, what happens? Is that not a thing?
00:25:31.132 - 00:25:56.542, Speaker A: Well, I don't think it makes sense to make a partial payment. If they make a partial payment, then they're analyzed cash flow. There's a reason they can partial payment. Either you pay off all your bills on time when due, or you don't pay any of them. And I think we'll learn which state of the world we're in on Lame Night. Now, again, I don't have access to the terms. I don't see what the consequences of not paying.
00:25:56.542 - 00:26:30.914, Speaker A: These are. These are well negotiated agreements. So I expect that the consequences would be severe for non payment. Well, what happens if you don't pay? You get kicked out to an outcore workout. So I'm in the same position that I am today in a sense of negotiating the question would be would any of the creditors seek to pressure BCG by filing an involuntary petition for chapter eleven? It only takes three creditors perform that action. So DCG can be in a tough spot. Another way to look at this is DCG has their own duration.
00:26:30.914 - 00:27:08.402, Speaker A: This match, laura, you and I have talked about this in various podcasts before, where DCG has this asset called Grayscale and this other asset called Boundary and Luna and Bluell and CoinDesk, they generate cash, they generate cash flow forward tying, and DCG does not have the time. They have these payments that are due next week. And the way generally, you solve these duration mismatches, you get financing for that cash flow for that asset. We have not seen a point of that. The CFO left. So not a good sign. I think things to look for in the markets would be I would expect the spread for GBTC to widen.
00:27:08.402 - 00:27:38.720, Speaker A: I would expect that the digital assets that DCG owns on its balance sheet, I would expect that those assets sell off because the market may expect forced selling from DCG. And we saw some of that in November, December. However, we don't know if DCG chooses not to pay the know, they might not actually sell those assets. So we'll see how things unfold and it'll be ahead.
00:27:39.250 - 00:27:45.810, Speaker B: And just to be clear about what you're saying there, you were saying that perhaps Grayscale might sell the bitcoin in GBTC.
00:27:46.310 - 00:28:13.734, Speaker A: Well, so DCG. It'll be DCG. Grayscale won't sell anything. Grayscale is a fine business. They're litigating the SEC, they're seeking to convert to an ETF. But DCG, in the run up to the Three Earth capital collapse, they acquired $760,000,000 worth of GBTC on leverage from Genesis subsidiary. Now, a good chunk of that is already been pledged to egemoni earn.
00:28:13.734 - 00:28:43.454, Speaker A: However, there's some on encumber component meaning has not been pledged. It is on the DCG balance sheet. And that is a source of liquidity for DCG. DCG can sell that to generate proceeds to pay some portion of this. $630,000,000 a month. Not enough, based on my analysis. But if DCG does need to sell that, then you'd expect a slippage.
00:28:43.454 - 00:29:29.390, Speaker A: You'd expect to see market impact. You remember in November it was reported that Gemini in November 16, when they foreclosed in the collateral, they did a block sale of GPTC and it did create a market impact. And DCG has to make a decision on whether or not they want to sell those assets. And we also don't know, do they already sell those assets? Now, based on the most recent ten Q file from Grayscale, it does appear to be the case that DCG or Genesis still has a material amount of GBTC on the balance sheet.

A recent investigative report by New York Mag's Jen Vietchner has unveiled new information about Crypto Bank Portigo Trust's application with the Office of the Controller of the Currency, the US's Chief bank regulator, which had previously been denied. Valued at $2 billion. Protigo had received conditional approval in 2021 and raised over $100 million from major crypto companies, including Coinbase. An anonymous source familiar with the matter has now revealed that the denial was due to a technicality that the regulator had never before mentioned to Protico, despite securing the necessary funding before the deadline.
00:34:46.098 - 00:35:50.726, Speaker B: The OCC stated that the reason for denial was that the funds were not physically in the bank. However, Protico was previously informed that the money transfer was required only four days before the official opening, Protico founder Greg Gilman said, quote we courted regulation. We did everything that was required. In the end, it feels like there was an unannounced and unexplained policy change that derailed our efforts. This situation, along with others, seems to be another data point that the theory that there's a coordinated effort to cut the crypto industry off from the banking sector, which is dubbed Operation ShowPoint 20, has merit.

Blur unveils new protocol for NFTs On Tuesday, NFT marketplace Blur launched a new protocol dubbed Blend to boost liquidity for NFTs. I interviewed the company founder, Tishan Roquer, who goes by Pac Man. Here's what he said why is it that Blur decided to launch NFT borrowing?
00:40:02.858 - 00:40:43.754, Speaker D: Right now in NFTs there's pretty much no financialization. So there's billions of dollars worth of NFTs trading every month, but there's absolutely no pretty much zero financialization at all. If you look at most financialized markets, like the housing market or the crypto market, every big market grows through financialization. So even if you look at like Bitcoin for example, 90% of bitcoin volume is from derivative volume, it's not from spot volume. Similarly, in the housing market, the majority, when people buy their houses, they buy it with a mortgage. They don't pay all the money up front. In NFTs today.
00:40:43.754 - 00:40:46.826, Speaker D: We're still at the very early stage of this market where there isn't any.

One more time. Time for fun bits. PayPal announces that Venmo users will be allowed to trade crypto Unchained's jenny Hogan gives her take on this news.
00:42:19.468 - 00:43:10.506, Speaker E: So PayPal has announced that it's going to let users begin trading crypto on Venmo. Why is PayPal allowed to do this? Well, because they own Venmo decentralized icons for the win, given the number of people who think crypto is a scam. I do love the idea of being able to passive aggressively send money to someone, feel like this is going to be huge on first dates, like, hey, have some of this money you don't believe in, but it could be big. I mean, 74% of Venmo customers have held crypto in their accounts for the last year. To be fair, the last year hasn't been a great time to sell crypto, but Venmo is going to cap crypto coin purchases at $50,000 a year annually. This is intended to ensure responsible trading risk management and to limit the number of Tweets that start with I lost my life savings trading crypto on Venmo a thread. Venmo is, in many ways, the perfect place for crypto, since you can't make a Venmo transaction without saying what the transaction is for.
00:43:10.506 - 00:43:19.100, Speaker E: And no one should buy cryptocurrency without being able to explain why. Like, don't try dogecoin until you're absolutely sure that therapy is not going to work.
