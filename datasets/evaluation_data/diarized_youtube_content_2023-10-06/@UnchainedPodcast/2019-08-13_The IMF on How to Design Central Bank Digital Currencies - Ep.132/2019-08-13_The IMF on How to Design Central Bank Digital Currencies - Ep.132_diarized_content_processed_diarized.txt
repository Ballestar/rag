00:02:18.210 - 00:02:20.474, Speaker C: Thank you, Laura. Thank you.
00:02:20.672 - 00:02:24.300, Speaker A: Let's start with a basic question. What does the IMF do?
00:02:25.550 - 00:02:54.242, Speaker D: Okay, so that's an easy one, I think. The IMF International Monetary Fund is basically a multinational organization. We are a member based organization. We have 189 members consisting of governments of the countries. We promote international financial and monetary stability. So that's basically the function of the IMF. We were founded in 1944.
00:02:54.242 - 00:03:01.400, Speaker D: So we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary this year, actually, as part of the Bretton Wood system.
00:03:02.250 - 00:03:30.000, Speaker A: And there's one thing I want to add, which is before the show, Dong and Yen explained to me that the views expressed during this interview are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF. So if part of the mission of the IMF is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. How has the advent of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies affected the IMF's activities thus far?
00:03:30.850 - 00:04:11.146, Speaker D: Well, this is an exciting time. We are seeing a lot of changes in the technological space. I wouldn't say it has changed our work so far, but we are interested in understanding what these technologies are, the implications for the financial systems in our member countries, and eventually how that's going to affect the international monetary landscape. So I think this is just the beginning and we are still in the learning mode. So we're very interested in the issues that are going to shape the financial systems across the globe.
00:04:11.338 - 00:04:30.100, Speaker C: I just want to add since many of our countries, member countries, are very interested in this issue and we are obligated in a sense to really understand the implications so that we can provide policy advice and technical assistance to our member countries in this area.
00:04:31.350 - 00:04:58.810, Speaker A: Yeah, and I actually wanted to ask a little bit more about that, Jen, because the main ways in which the IMF works with the member countries, I believe, is through the central banks. And so before we get even more into blockchain technologies and digital currencies, can you just explain what the main ways are in which central banks can influence the economies of their countries?
00:04:59.790 - 00:05:58.558, Speaker C: I think well, it's true that our counterparts are central banks, but in terms of our mandate, we look beyond just what central bank banks do. We also look at a country's overall economic policies and also their financial sector policies to make sure that overall the global international system or global financial stability will be maintained. So we are engaging with central banks and other entities within the country through our normal surveillance activities, which is usually take the forms of an annual health checkup. We call it Article Four consultations. Also we have other instruments like financial sector assessment programs. We also provide financing to our country through the adjustment programs and our lending. We also engage with central banks and other agencies in the country.
00:05:58.558 - 00:06:17.590, Speaker C: And finally, we provide, as I mentioned before, technical assistance to help central banks strengthen their institutional frameworks and also guide them in terms of the international best practices and also on the policy matters.
00:06:18.250 - 00:07:02.980, Speaker D: So Laura, I guess your question is also about how central banks affect their own economies, right? That's the question you have. I see. So basically, central banks, the institution, the government institution in a particular economy that issues the currency of that country. Right? So when we talk about the Federal Reserve, the dollar cash notes we carry around are issued by the Federal Reserve as the central bank of the United States. So that's the very basic function of the central bank. Of course, the central bank runs monetary policy and the monetary policy affects the stability of the US. Dollar as a unit of account.
00:07:02.980 - 00:07:21.020, Speaker D: All the economic activities here in the US. Are denominated in dollars. And that dollar unit of account is really defined by the Federal Reserve as the central bank. Does that answer your question?
00:07:22.030 - 00:07:46.450, Speaker A: Yeah, and I also wanted to talk about some of the mechanisms that they use. Like for instance, commercial banks, as far as I understand, at least in the US. Are pretty central to the way the Federal Reserve manages the money supply here. And I wanted to know if that was the case, for all central banks know in those countries, commercial banks also play a key role.
00:07:47.110 - 00:08:29.680, Speaker D: Yes, indeed. So the central bank in all countries are basically the bank of the commercial banks. So in modern banking systems who have this two tier structure, right, the commercial banks provide deposits which are redeemable at par with central bank liability, one to one. And the central bank is at the pinnacle of this pyramid, you could say. So the central bank is the bank of the commercial banks and there are various ways for the central bank to influence either the price or the quantities of money in a particular economy. So that's basically how the system is set up.
00:08:32.290 - 00:08:48.630, Speaker A: Again, the topic for today is central bank digital currencies. But I feel like it's kind of useful to talk about some existing types of money. So let's talk about cash for a little bit. What role does cash play in a central bank's ability to manage its economy?
00:08:49.290 - 00:09:24.882, Speaker D: So cash is one component of what we call base money of a particular economy. So the base money is the liability of the central bank. It has two components. One is cash, the other one is reserves kept by commercial banks. As I said earlier, commercial banks also issue liabilities in the form of deposits. Right? You and I keep our deposits with commercial banks and these deposits are part of the broader monetary system. So these are also money, but these are commercial bank money, it's not central bank money.
00:09:24.882 - 00:09:52.440, Speaker D: So central bank money is composed of two components. One is cash, the other one is commercial bank reserves. And commercial bank money is in the form of deposits that the public keep with them. And these are redeemable one to one. This commercial bank money is at par with central bank liability. That's the unit of account. Basically one dollars is one dollars.
00:09:52.440 - 00:10:03.230, Speaker D: So you can convert your one dollars deposit in a commercial bank to a one dollars cash provided by the Federal Reserve.
00:10:04.130 - 00:10:22.580, Speaker A: So cash is becoming less used kind of broadly and this is kind of maybe a function of everything becoming more digital. So what is the role for cash or some kind of cash like form of money in the digital age?
00:10:23.430 - 00:11:06.146, Speaker D: Right? That's a very good question. So globally we have seen very fast digitalization digitization of payments in some economies, but it's not necessarily at the same pace. In some economies, people still use a lot of cash, like in Japan, but in know cash use has really declined very fast. And looking forward, I think the digital age, the demand for cash is likely to decline. Now, cash has certain advantages. Let me give you an example. When you buy a cup of coffee in Starbucks, let's say you can pay with cash.
00:11:06.146 - 00:12:04.340, Speaker D: You just pass a $5 bill to the cashier. And that transaction is very efficient in the sense that it's settled. It's cleared and settled instantaneously. And also there is a feature that the cashier doesn't have to know who you are, he or she doesn't have to know the buyer's, Laura Sheen, and you don't have to know who the cashier is. But the other way to pay for coffee is to swipe your credit card. Now, that is a very different payment instrument because for that transaction to be settled finally, in the sense that for your bank balance to be debited and for the Starbucks account to be credited, it has to be backed by a whole infrastructure. So there are banks involved, and it takes some time for that transaction to be set up.
00:12:04.340 - 00:12:45.646, Speaker D: So there are various ways to make payments. So there are different features attached to each payment instrument. Now, cash also has a disadvantage. If we are in different places, like you are in, let's say, traveling in Peru, I'm here in the United States, then it's very hard for us to give cash to each other. So you have to make payments remotely. And then cash is not very convenient. Then bank transfers, credit cards would be much more convenient.
00:12:45.646 - 00:13:01.110, Speaker D: So these different instruments have their own features. You could say strengths and weaknesses. Depends on the use of what sort of transactions we are conducting.
00:13:01.450 - 00:13:16.890, Speaker A: So let's talk about central bank digital currency. I've been seeing the IMF has been talking about this and releasing some reports and articles. But let's define that. What do you really mean when you're talking about central bank digital currency?
00:13:17.390 - 00:14:18.350, Speaker D: So, central bank digital currency is basically a digital version of central bank liability, which is widely accessible. As I explained earlier, the only widely accessible part of the central bank money at the moment is cash, right? The other part is commercial bank reserves kept by commercial banks. So when we think about creating a central bank digital currency, you and I will be able to hold that central bank money digitally. For example, in our iPhone. So it's more like digital cash. It's really like digital cash at the moment when we think about the cash, that's the only way that the public can hold central bank money. So if we have a central bank digital currency, then we can also hold central bank money digital form in addition to or instead of holding cash.
00:14:18.350 - 00:14:21.902, Speaker D: So that's one way to think about this.
00:14:22.036 - 00:14:29.860, Speaker A: And is that created using blockchain technology or can it be created with any other type of technology?
00:14:30.710 - 00:15:06.640, Speaker D: It doesn't have to be blockchain technology. I think this idea itself is technology neutral. So you can have a more centralized way of doing this. For example, the central bank itself is the issuer. So in contrast to Bitcoin, for example, when new coins are mined or minted, it's a decentralized process on blockchain. Central bank digital currency doesn't have to be on a decentralized blockchain. It can be.
00:15:06.640 - 00:15:17.890, Speaker D: It's probably at this stage it makes more sense for the central bank to centrally control the issuance of the central bank digital currency.
00:15:18.630 - 00:15:28.710, Speaker A: And at this point, why is the IMF interested in central bank digital currencies? And what level of interest are you seeing from your member countries?
00:15:30.090 - 00:17:01.940, Speaker D: That's a very good question because as I said, the central banks are in charge of maintaining price stability in modern economies. So they are interested and of course the IMF is also interested in ensuring price stability. So in the digital age, if private digital currencies are developed, if there's less demand for central bank digital currency, for central bank currency, for example, if cash is no longer used for economic transactions, then the public will have no interface or no interactions with the central bank. The central bank will also have more difficulty in influencing monetary conditions in the economy in the sense that particularly in the case that if there are alternative private currencies that are developed in the different unit of account. So that would make the central bank's job of maintaining price stability in the countries much more difficult. So we think that it's important for the central bank to be engaged to stay in the game in the digital age and that would help the central bank achieve their mandate of maintaining price stability even in the digital age.
00:17:02.630 - 00:17:41.230, Speaker C: Yet, to answer your second question, several central banks in both advanced and emerging market and developing countries are considering the pros and cons of issuing the CBDC. For instance, australia, Brazil, China, Denmark, Philippines, just to give you a few examples. And they are really looking very carefully at whether it makes sense to issue CBDC. So I think this is really a topic that really raised a lot of awareness and also interest among the membership.
00:17:42.210 - 00:18:05.000, Speaker A: So earlier we talked about how the central bank is kind of the top of the pyramid. It's sort of this lender of last resort and then they work with the commercial banks to influence the economy to increase or decrease the monetary supply. So when you introduce a central bank digital currency, how does that process change?
00:18:06.650 - 00:18:10.620, Speaker D: You mean how does the money supply process change?
00:18:10.990 - 00:18:13.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I see.
00:18:13.440 - 00:18:27.520, Speaker D: It doesn't alter that mechanism fundamentally. It's just another form of central bank liabilities. We are still doing research.
00:18:28.130 - 00:18:48.530, Speaker A: Yes, well, I thought that there was some thinking that it could potentially sort of reduce the role for commercial banks and people could kind of just have accounts directly with the central bank. So in that sense I see your question.
00:18:48.600 - 00:19:41.350, Speaker D: Yes, yeah, that's a very good question. I think that depends on the design of the central bank digital currency. And basically, we can talk about, conceptually speaking, we can talk about two types of central bank digital currency. One is a value based or token based. It's a bit like an object, right? Like a token. Cash is such a type in the sense that what matters is the value or the authenticity of the dollar bill or the object itself. Another one is so called account based or claim based money, like our bank account, our deposits.
00:19:41.350 - 00:21:00.430, Speaker D: So if you design the central bank digital currency more like cash, it's like digital cash, then that doesn't affect the demand for deposits as much. On the other hand, if you design the central bank digital currency more like a substitute for commercial bank deposits, that would probably affect how we value commercial bank deposits. So some of us might move our deposits to the central bank if we feel that it's much safer to keep deposits directly with the central bank. But of course, there are different considerations. One is that whether you pay interest on this deposit, so if there's no interest, then you wouldn't want to give up the interest you earn on a commercial bank deposit. The other thing is that if there's deposit insurance, then you wouldn't worry about the credit risks or you wouldn't worry about losing that deposit with the commercial bank. So you don't necessarily forego the interest you earn and move the deposit to the central bank.
00:21:00.430 - 00:21:14.174, Speaker D: These are the options or design features we have to bear in mind when we design the central bank digital currency. So it's not a uniform impact.
00:21:14.302 - 00:21:46.350, Speaker A: Talking about, and we talked about how there are different designs, et cetera, for the ways these central bank digital currencies might be issued. And I was wondering, are central banks already structured in a way where they can issue central bank digital currencies? Like do existing central bank laws allow for that? Or are there other considerations that need to happen before such currencies could be issued?
00:21:47.090 - 00:22:44.510, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it really depends on whether it is within the central bank's mandate to issue the digital currency and also whether they are allowed to do so under their existing central banking law. So maybe I just take one step back to explain what is a mandate and why it is so important for a central bank. Its mandate is the reason why it exists. And basically a central bank is established for certain purposes and also to discharge certain responsibilities. And this purpose and responsibilities are usually explicitly set forth in the central banking law. And in some countries, as a matter of fact, this could be enshrined in their constitutional law. So central banks are really, in a way, limited in what they can do based on the specified responsibilities and mandate.
00:22:44.510 - 00:23:36.130, Speaker C: And different central banks have different central banking laws. But there are a few general principles which don't already explain. For instance, they can issue currency, right? They can really set up accounts. But under the existing central banking law, generally speaking, the currency, when they meant currency, they really mean banknotes and cash. So the digital currency was not considered at a time when the existing central banking law was designed. So in many, many countries, we haven't really looked at all the country's central banking law. But I think the general speaking, the central banks do need to amend or modify their central bank laws in order to provide a very clear and certain legal basis for issuing the digital.
00:23:37.910 - 00:24:01.420, Speaker A: Want. I read a speech that guess, I don't know if she's still currently the managing director of the IMF, but she's at least the outgoing, if not former managing director of the IMF. And she talked about how central bank digital currency could help bring about greater financial inclusion. Can you describe how that works?
00:24:02.350 - 00:25:15.374, Speaker D: Right, so for example, at the moment we still have more than a billion people in the world who are unbanked in the sense that they don't have a bank account. So if you want to have a deposit held with a commercial bank, to use that for payments, you need to be banked, you need to have an account with a bank. But cash is an instrument that does not require a bank account. So a lot of the unbanked people in the world, they hold cash, but it's very expensive, right? It's also difficult to store, you can easily lose it. It's also very expensive for countries. They have to spend a lot of money maintaining the hygiene of the cash notes to replace them once in a while, to distribute them, to secure the storage. So it's a very expensive means of holding the currency.
00:25:15.374 - 00:26:23.880, Speaker D: Now, digital cash will make it much easier for these people to have access to a means of payments. In Africa, a lot of the unbanked people, they can keep their cash in a mobile account. So it does not necessarily require a bank account. You can get those digital cash through the mobile phone companies, through post offices. So that would help these people make economic transactions. Now, in the future, if these services, payment services, can be linked with other type of services through the mobile apps, then they can be incentivized to save, to invest, and that will enhance economic efficiency tremendously. I think that's one way to think about it.
00:26:24.330 - 00:27:02.130, Speaker C: But I think at the same time we should also bear in mind that this type of virtual currency or digital currencies could raise some financial integrity concerns. So it's quite important to really strike a proper balance between reaping the benefits to support financial inclusion and the need to safeguard the financial integrity to make sure that they will not be abused by the criminals. I think that's really a very important consideration for policymakers when they designing the CBDC.
00:27:02.710 - 00:28:09.718, Speaker D: In a way, one way to think about is that these days when central banks issue cash, the denominations are not necessarily huge, right? You cannot have a us. Dollar that's denominated more than $500. Let's say the largest denomination is $100. So one consideration where central banks design the denominations of cash notes is that they don't want to create too much convenience for illicit use of cash notes. So when you move to the digital world, when you have digital cash, you have to think, what is the amount of anonymity that should be allowed in the use of the digital tokens for digital cash? So you need to strike a balance. But there are also ways, technological ways to track the usage of digital cash to ensure that your financial integrity is not compromised.
00:28:09.814 - 00:28:34.020, Speaker C: So that's another way, I think. Yeah. When I refer to financial integrity, I really mean the money laundering and terrorist financing risks, how to really manage these risks in order to really safeguard the financial system while at the same time really allowing more access to the financial services by millions of people.
00:28:34.630 - 00:28:46.210, Speaker A: And how do you do that without it being like a totally surveilled system? How do you manage privacy against those concerns?
00:28:46.950 - 00:29:48.870, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that is a very good question. I think that's what Dome was saying, that there are no panacea right now. But I think it's important to really strike this balance. And using the technology, as Dong was saying, that you probably can impose some strict limits on the size of the transaction, and you can also use the technology to facilitate effective identity authentication and also tracking of the payments and transfer. This technology can really help either Central Bank or any outsource entities to ensure that the AML CFT measures are compliant, because that's really the requirements that each institution like Central Bank needs to comply with. But I do think that all these measures, I think they can be helpful, but they really need some further evaluation to really make sure they're effective to address these concerns.
00:29:49.610 - 00:30:03.278, Speaker A: We're going to keep discussing this in a moment, because actually, Christine Lagarde actually wrote or gave a speech where she outlined a scenario like this. So I'll talk about that in a moment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy.
00:31:52.106 - 00:32:27.578, Speaker B: But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors. Privacy Enhanced Compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations. CypherTrace is working on this vision of the future. Sign up to stay up to date on the Privacy Enhanced Compliance Initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML Reports, quarterly WW, Ciphertrace.com, slash keep crypto clean.
00:32:27.744 - 00:34:04.982, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Yen, Liu and Donghu of the IMF. So the speech that I referenced earlier in which Christine Lagarde sort of outlined a scenario in which the concerns of privacy, know, anti money laundering and terrorist financing could be balanced was she said that central banks could design digital currency in a way where users identities would be authenticated through customer due diligence procedures and transactions recorded. So I'm not sure exactly what that looks like, so maybe you can describe that in a second, but let me keep going. And then she said, however, identities would not be disclosed to third parties or governments unless required by law. So she had this example where, let's say that somehow credit score companies or other companies figure out that if you're the kind of person who purchases frozen pizza and beer, then you maybe are a higher risk borrower or something like that. So she would say, so if you do go to the grocery and purchase a frozen pizza and beer, then the supermarket, the bank and marketers wouldn't have a way of knowing who you were or wouldn't maybe know what you bought. But at the same time, anti money laundering and terrorist financial controls could run in the background and then if there was any suspicion about you or your transaction, then there would be this veil of anonymity that could be lifted.
00:34:04.982 - 00:34:22.800, Speaker A: So can you just describe how that works? I understand the words that she was using, but it just like on a detailed level, what are all the different actors that need to be set up in place and what are the processes to make this possible.
00:34:23.990 - 00:35:56.778, Speaker C: Okay, so basically the Financial Action Task Force, which is the international standard setter, they set the anti laundering and terrorist financing standard for all countries. I think one key requirement is called customer due diligence, which basically require, for example, the one you're talking about, the commercial banks and other entities that are involved in the transaction with either cash or with credit card. They will basically set up a very robust monitoring system to see some suspicious transaction. In your example, if somebody engaged in a transaction using, for instance, drug proceeds, and if they have a proper system set in place, they can trace the proceeds used in this transaction. They have an obligation not only to monitor that transaction, but also report that suspicious transaction to a relevant authorities. And that authorities will take certain action that maybe do further analysis and they will take further actions to trace the proceeds. And to the extent the proceeds are really identified as coming from a suspicious source and they could suspend the transaction, that can also take other actions, for instance, impose certain sanctions on the entities like commercial banks.
00:35:56.778 - 00:37:40.366, Speaker C: So this whole sort of the process, in a very simple word, basically saying commercial banks were the other entities, you need to ask questions. You need to really ask the person who gives you the cash where the cash comes from, and is that from a legitimate source or it's from illegitimate source? And then based on that answer provided by the commercial bank, the authorities can take certain actions. So that's sort of the normal customer due diligence requirement. When we talk about cash, it's very difficult to really trace, as Don mentioned, because of the anonymity. I think when you use the mobile money and you use, for instance, the central bank digital currency, to the extent you use certain technology like distributed ledger, you're able to record the whole transaction and you sort of getting a better understanding of where the money is coming from that really can help you in terms of investigating, monitoring and also reporting the cases. Having said that, I do think that as I mentioned before, these technologies still need to be evaluated because ultimately we need to know the beneficial owner of the money, meaning the ultimate owner of the money that get into the transaction. And distributed ledger may not necessarily help you really identify the ultimate owner of particular fund or particular credit or money.
00:37:40.366 - 00:37:58.182, Speaker C: So that's something we still have to look at. But I do think that technology offers some promises in terms of facilitating the monitoring, investigation and reporting by the commercial banks and other entities involved in the So.
00:37:58.236 - 00:39:03.654, Speaker D: Laura, just to supplement what Yang has said, I think in a way, technology is going to give us more options to think about these issues or to strike a better balance. Because as cash is completely anonymous, then that creates a lot of difficulties for law. Enforcement. On the other hand, in the digital world you don't want to be totally transparent either, right? Privacy is something that we value. So what Christine Lagarde mentioned is that you don't want to have necessarily customer profiling because if people can tell that you are buying certain products, you are a type of person, then the prices they offer you, the type of products they offer you would be somehow dependent on that type of profile. That's not necessarily ideal. So in the digital age, you don't necessarily want to have everything that's visible, that's transparent.
00:39:03.654 - 00:40:02.506, Speaker D: So we still value privacy. So technology actually offers the potential for us to customize different degrees of privacy. You don't necessarily have to have a centralized database that has everything. You can review your entitlements for certain things. For example, if you walk into a wine store, you just need to prove that you are over 18 years old or 21 years old and the store still doesn't have to know your name every time when you make a payment. So these are all the technologies that are going to be possible in the digital world. So it's only that as a matter of public policy, we need to strike a balance at which circumstances we want to know who is behind the transaction more than in other types of situations.
00:40:02.506 - 00:40:10.750, Speaker D: So I think technology is really very exciting because it allows us to have this kind of flexibility.
00:40:11.250 - 00:41:22.390, Speaker C: I just want to add that even under the current AML CFT standard, this flexibility is already provided there because we are applying a risk based approach. So basically you need to really design the AML CFT measures based on the level of risks. So in Dong's example, if you go to a store, you just pay $50 to buy wine, the level of risk is not that high compared to you use $500,000 to buy a piece of real estate, right? So the standard really allows the countries to tailor their AML CFT measures, like the customer due diligence requirements, to the level of risk. So in some situation you should ask the risk. In some scenarios you don't really need to ask questions. So I think combined with the technology and combined with the risk based approach, I think we should be able to design a very balanced approach that address the issue of privacy and also financial integrity concerns.
00:41:23.130 - 00:42:33.150, Speaker A: And just so I understand from what you were describing earlier, essentially there will be transactions that are more similar to cash that happen digitally. Meaning that I could meet somebody and for whatever reason, this person and I, maybe I send them money or they send me money and that would be very similar to if we met in person and I handed them a $20 bill or they handed me one. But then when you were saying that there would also be customer due diligence, maybe like a transaction or two away from that transaction, I might be interacting with someone where they would know who I am, like a bank or some other kind of institution. And then so if for whatever reason there was ever suspicion about what I was doing, then you could maybe kind of reconstruct who else I was transacting with for any transactions where it wasn't with an institution that knows who I am. Is that kind of what you were describing earlier?
00:42:35.090 - 00:43:36.030, Speaker C: Yes, very close. I think basically as you're saying that if you transact with somebody, for instance, if you transfer $50,000 to your relative in another country, I think the bank, depending on their limit under their policy, they may ask you to fill out a form, right? So they will ask you what is the purpose of the transfer and maybe they even ask you where you get the money. And so you submit this form to the bank. And the bank, based on their internal control system, they will verify your responses and to the extent they're satisfied with the accuracy or the sufficiency of your information, they will make the transfer. But to the extent they are not, they may either ask you for more information or they will not really make the transfer. So that's really sort of the normal procedure for customer due diligence.
00:43:37.010 - 00:44:09.020, Speaker A: And let's also now then talk a little bit about the other area of money has been burgeoning, I guess is the word, which is crypto assets. And Dong, you wrote a really fascinating article on how crypto assets could one day reduce the demand for central bank money. And the way you started the article, you kind of describe some of the general benefits of crypto assets over central bank money. Can you describe what you think those advantages are?
00:44:10.050 - 00:44:51.926, Speaker D: So as I mentioned earlier, there are different types of payment instruments, right? Cash versus bank deposit. And depending on the characteristics of this particular payment instrument, the information requirement is very different. So potentially cryptocurrencies can make it very efficient for payments to take place in different locations. For example, we have had a lot of pain points in cross border payments. You know that it's very expensive, it's slow, it's nontransparent. Once you send remittances, you don't know where they are. It's very difficult to trace.
00:44:51.926 - 00:45:59.934, Speaker D: So some of the payment services based on cryptocurrencies can make this process very efficient. It takes seconds or minutes for the remittances or cross border payments to happen. Now at the moment, of course, we know that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. So this is where really the advantage of central bank money has in the sense that modern central bank monetary policy is based on the economic science. So central bankers, for example, monetary policy committee members, they make monetary policy by looking at how the economy functions. They look at various shocks that are hitting the economy, like trade wars, maybe even earthquakes. So they see how the economy might be hit by these shocks and they respond by changing monetary policy stance like lowering interest rate or if inflationary pressures are going up they can tighten monetary policy.
00:45:59.934 - 00:47:12.422, Speaker D: So you have a forward looking monetary policy making that allows central banks to maintain the stability of the unit of account of the currency. And that's where the cryptocurrencies have not been able to do. The value of these cryptocurrencies fluctuates very widely and they do not provide the stability that a currency really needs for economic transactions to happen very efficiently. And so that's really important because for modern economies to function properly we need to have price stability. But on the other hand, as a means of payment, cryptocurrencies have some of the features that are very easy. They are very connected with the digital lives, particularly of young people right on social platforms or apps on your phones you can use these currencies very easily. So that's why I said early in the beginning that central banks, they need to stay in the game.
00:47:12.422 - 00:47:24.380, Speaker D: They also need to make their currencies very easy to use in the digital age. Central bank digital currency is one way to make that happen.
00:47:25.390 - 00:47:37.760, Speaker A: And another part of the article that I found really interesting was you said that if people adopted crypto assets that could prompt a shift from credit money to commodity money. What does that mean exactly?
00:47:38.770 - 00:48:41.486, Speaker D: So modern monetary system was banking system money is created by uncredited relationships, right? So central bank money for example cash is a liability of the central bank or commercial bank deposit is a liability of the commercial bank. These are based on claims or credit relationships whereas commodity money is not liability of anybody. Gold for example is a commodity money. It no longer really serves any monetary function. But traditionally, for example, in the old age in the gold standard, gold was used as a currency but it was not the liability of anybody. Now if you think about what cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Bitcoin is not the liability of anybody.
00:48:41.486 - 00:49:55.420, Speaker D: So that's a type of commodity money if serves some monetary function. So you could envisage in the future there will be multiple private cryptocurrencies or commodity monies being created and they could be denominated in different unit of accounts. So that's not necessarily a desirable situation because money is really a very important utility that the government should provide to ensure that the economies functions very well. We need to have price stability. So if you have a lot of currencies competing and also in payment economics we have the so called economies of scale. So you may end up with a couple of private cryptocurrencies dominating the payment landscape and they behave as a monopolies. So that's not necessarily a very ideal situation.
00:49:55.420 - 00:50:13.070, Speaker D: So we need to have a central bank that's the monopoly issuer of the legal tender or the fiat currency and that can maintain price stability which is really for the benefit of the whole of the economy.
00:50:13.410 - 00:50:49.610, Speaker A: And one other piece of this that I wanted to ask about was you mentioned that if crypto assets become more widely adopted and the scenario that you just outlined, that could cause central bank money to no longer be the main unit of account, and then you said that that could make central bank monetary policy irrelevant. And a good analogy is dollarization in developing economies. So can you describe what happens there when a developing economy does undergo dollarization and how you think that would play out if crypto assets became more dominant?
00:50:50.210 - 00:52:16.690, Speaker D: So if in a country that's highly dollarized, it's not only that citizens hold a lot of their deposits in dollars, they also denominate their transactions in dollars. So instead of paying wages or paying wages in local currency or the prices are quoted in local currency, if you have a big chunk of the economy, like 30%, the prices are actually denominated in US. Dollars. So even if it's not United States, you would still buy pizza for $2 instead of, let's say, 100 local currency units. Then of course then it's very hard for the central bank of that particular country to influence the inflation level or to ensure price stability of that country because a lot of economic activities are outside the scope of their influence. They are now denominated in foreign currency. So you can imagine that if a lot of the economic activities are instead of denominated in the fiat currency, they are denominated in cryptocurrencies.
00:52:16.690 - 00:52:28.010, Speaker D: But it's very hard for the public authority like the central bank to ensure price stability in that economy. So that's really what I meant earlier.
00:52:28.350 - 00:53:00.950, Speaker A: And so do you think that that's what governments should try to do, to try to kind of I don't know if prevent is the word, but stall the adoption of crypto there I'm sure most of my audience probably would love to see more adoption. So I'm just curious, is this something where for the IMF and the different central banks that for them, it would be definitely something that they should try to prevent?
00:53:01.530 - 00:54:05.014, Speaker D: So it really depends on the specific country circumstances. I think across the IMF membership we have seen country authorities reacting differently. Some countries have banned the use or development of cryptocurrencies, others have legal systems or laws that allow them to be developed. But you want to have other regulation to ensure, for example, financial integrity is not compromised. They should pay taxes. These are some of the basic requirements that would ensure, let's say, a level playing field. I think the basic premise here is really that a currency, a fiat currency that's properly managed, that has monetary policy, that's based on economic science, that is really for the good of the majority of the population, right? That's something desirable.
00:54:05.014 - 00:54:58.970, Speaker D: As I mentioned earlier, economies cannot be left alone without monetary policy because we know that in a market economy, if you don't have a public authority like the central bank who manages either the price or the quantities of money, then the economies tend to fluctuate a lot. You have financial stability problems, you have business cycle fluctuations that are very large, so that's not necessarily welfare improving. So the basic premise is really public policy has a role to play to ensure price stability so the economy doesn't fluctuate so wildly or financial stability is insured. So that's why we need a central bank.
00:54:59.390 - 00:55:54.198, Speaker A: And what about for that goal of financial inclusion? Because I know a lot of people in the crypto space are one of their missions with the work that they do is to promote financial inclusion. And they are quite well aware that there's a large segment of the world's population, they don't make good candidates for customers. Like they're basically not who the types of people that banks could make money from. And so I know that for instance, some of the charitable efforts are around giving people direct access to cryptocurrencies that they can then convert into their local currency. So in that way, do you see cryptocurrencies helping to achieve some of the IMF's goals around financial inclusion or any of the other ones in a mean.
00:55:54.224 - 00:56:17.430, Speaker D: The reason why we are thinking that central bank digital currency can help financial inclusion is precisely to play that role, right? If we have a digital version of cash that's easily obtainable, not necessarily through a bank, because these people are not banked, then that could help foster financial inclusion.
00:56:18.010 - 00:56:57.780, Speaker C: But I guess what we're saying is that absolutely we think it can help with your financial inclusion, which is a very important mandate for the fund. But at the same time, we do caution the countries that when we really design the central bank digital currency, we need to also be careful with respect to a couple of issues that don't mention. For example, they have to have legal basis, clear and certain legal basis. They need to have proper measures put in place to ensure the financial integrity concerns or risks would be mitigated. So I think they kind of go hand in hand.
00:56:58.630 - 00:57:17.800, Speaker A: And I also wanted to ask about Libra in this regard. This is Facebook's proposed digital currency. Are you seeing that that's spurring any interest among the central banks to issue their own central bank digital currency? Like they see that as competition and it's making them realize they need to step up their game.
00:57:18.830 - 00:58:19.100, Speaker D: So our acting managing director David Lipton has recently written an article in the Financial Times. Our colleagues have also published a new paper. It's entitled the rise of digital money. So these issues are all being analyzed here in the fund. I think given really the scale of the proposed cryptocurrency Libra by Facebook and the Libra sort of consortium, this is a whole different ballgame because it's a very large enterprise. Facebook has more than a billion users, more than 2 billion. So this is of systemic importance in the sense that it's going to affect how the global payment system works.
00:58:19.100 - 00:59:26.340, Speaker D: So we need to ensure that it's properly regulated, the financial risks are properly managed, for example, whether these are redeemable at real time, in real time to the currencies that back the Libra units. So some of these issues are not the details are not yet disclosed, but as a matter of principle, regulations should really be in place to ensure the safety and soundness of this enterprise. But overall, I think this certainly has prompted a lot of interest for the official sector to understand what's going on, but also to respond in terms of the payment system. How do we ensure that the global payment system will still be able to meet the demand for the digital age?
00:59:27.350 - 00:59:33.170, Speaker A: But do you think that Libra could pose a threat to some of these fiat currencies?
00:59:34.230 - 01:01:00.510, Speaker D: Well, for weaker currencies, for example, for economies that still suffer high inflation, I think that danger is more apparent. Whereas for more mature economies where monetary policy has a lot of credibility or the price stability is achieved, I don't see necessarily a very large challenge or threat from Libera. I think the challenge there is more a financial stability issue in the sense that whether they are suppose it's a very large money market fund and whether that would distort how the financial industry works, those are the issues that one needs to be concerned about. Also issues with financial integrity, with privacy protection, those issues are very much on the agenda. I don't necessarily see the threat in terms of a new currency that has more credibility, certainly not for countries that have price stability already achieved.
01:01:01.090 - 01:01:06.740, Speaker A: And just to go back to that goal of financial inclusion, do you think that Libra could help in that?
01:01:08.870 - 01:02:04.610, Speaker D: I mean, in a way I've already answered the question. I think in some respect, when you have a cryptocurrency that can be easily obtained, it can make payments easier for those non banked citizens. On the other hand, it really depends on the desire of the currency. Right. If the currency is very volatile, its value fluctuates, it doesn't provide a stable store of value, then the demand for that particular cryptocurrency will not necessarily high. So we'll have to see how the proposed cryptocurrency works. So I don't think you can make a blanket statement whether it helps or discourages financial inclusion.
01:02:05.110 - 01:02:17.240, Speaker A: Yeah, plus we're not sure if it will launch. All right, well, this has been such a great discussion. I really enjoy talking with you both. Where can people learn more about you and the.
01:02:18.990 - 01:02:55.702, Speaker D: Know? The IMF website has a huge amount of material for people who are interested in how the IMF works. What this is about the work I do. I am a monetary economist, so I work a lot on central banking issues, on financial stability issues. So I have written papers and those are posted in various places. For those who are interested, they can always find my papers. Yeah.
01:02:55.756 - 01:03:20.780, Speaker C: Similarly, I think for the work that I'm doing. So I basically oversee the legal department's work on AML, CFT and also Fintech. I just took over Fintech. I think, as Dong said, you can go to WW. imf.org. There you can really find a lot know reports and articles on Fintech issues.
01:03:21.790 - 01:03:25.626, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, thank you both for coming on Unchained.
