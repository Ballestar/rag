00:01:43.142 - 00:01:44.574, Speaker A: I'm glad to be back.
00:01:44.772 - 00:02:45.218, Speaker B: It's unusual to have a guest back right after their last appearance, but after the first declaration from new FTX CEO John Ray in the company's bankruptcy case, we definitely need to unpack this. For listeners who didn't get to read or hear about this yesterday, here is the section that set the tone for the rest of the document. Ray starts by saying, I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience, and he references his participation as the chief Restructuring officer in what he calls several of the largest corporate failures in history. And here he mentions a few, including, most famously, Enron. Then he says that almost all of these situations were, quote, characterized by defects of some sort of internal controls, regulatory compliance, human resources and systems integrity. Now, here's the money. Quote, Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.
00:02:45.218 - 00:03:12.060, Speaker B: From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated, and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented. Wasi, when you read the document, did you have the same reaction? Is the FTX bankruptcy quite possibly worse than many of the most notorious bankruptcy cases in history?
00:03:12.430 - 00:04:05.206, Speaker A: I mean, can you really blame CZ for walking away from trying to buy this dumpster fire. Yeah, it's kind of insane, right? Because like, two weeks ago, genuinely, everyone looked at FTX and Lumita as untouchable. And you kind of thought that they were just giga geniuses, arbiting every inefficiency, making billions of dollars, stock hunting us, et cetera. But they are not, and their controls are terrible. There's a quote I kind of want to pick out here. When John Ray goes through every single balance sheet of the sort of four silos that he's identified, and in every single one of those financial statements, he says, however, because this balance sheet was produced, what adapters were controlled by Mr. Bank? Freed? I do not have confidence in it, and therefore the information therein may not be accurate as of the date stated.
00:04:05.206 - 00:04:16.190, Speaker A: So effectively, for large bits of this filing, he's basically telling us, this is what we've been told. This is not audited. This is what SBF gave me. I have no faith in this whatsoever.
00:04:18.690 - 00:04:55.766, Speaker B: Yeah, that line stuck out at me as mean. It's sort of a more bureaucratic and polite way of saying, do not trust this person. And another thing that shocked me was you're right. So for people who haven't read it, basically he divides the enterprise that's going into bankruptcy into kind of what he calls four silos. And it's like some of the different corporate entities. Then what he does is he breaks out the assets and liabilities of each. Interestingly, I noticed every time he presents those balances, he will write, balances of customer crypto.
00:04:55.766 - 00:05:08.800, Speaker B: Assets deposited were not recorded as assets on the balance sheet and are not presented. And it would be in bold and underlined. So, yes, can you break that down for listeners? What does that mean?
00:05:09.730 - 00:05:32.520, Speaker A: It means that when SBS said, oh, we have more than enough assets to cover all the liabilities and all the customer deposits, he didn't even know what the customer deposits were because he just straight up wasn't recording them. So when you deposit money to FTX, deposit anything FTX, it should have recorded an FTX, just wasn't. So he was literally just talking off his.
00:05:34.250 - 00:06:23.190, Speaker B: And you know, this puts comments around things like internally poorly labeled fiat account in new light. Because essentially, as we saw in his text messages with the Vox reporter, there were no separation of accounts when it came to Alameda and FTX. When customers deposited money into FTX, they were actually literally just putting it right into Alameda's Bank account, which that just absolutely blows my mind. There was no attempt whatsoever to keep customers money safe, and some notion that they might give the money back to them, at least. Granted, I'm not in SEF's head, but based on that, that would be maybe a logical conclusion.
00:06:23.530 - 00:07:13.240, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, just to sort of backtrack a bit, the four different silos which we identified is essentially for, in layman's terms, FTX US, FTX International, the Ventures Portfolio, and Alameda. So that's the four silos that's identified and he's still in the process of actually figuring out what's going on. He has shown us the balance sheets, which he says is not reliable whatsoever, but that's probably a starting point. Interesting point to note is in the US balance sheet, which we're told are reliable, whatever, there's still a line called customer custodial funds, which is probably good for customers if there's certain funds that are being kept in custody. Whereas you don't see the same in FTX International balance sheet, which again we've been told is not.
00:07:14.890 - 00:07:25.034, Speaker B: So are you saying that FTX US customers have a greater chance or even that it's very likely that they'll have a better claim on their assets and.
00:07:25.072 - 00:07:46.098, Speaker A: Maybe even yeah, I think it is my view, and it has been from the start, that FTX US is in a probably much better state, strangely enough, because of regulations than FTX International. Because like we discussed previously, Laura, all the Dgen stuff was happening, all the Djen stuff was happening between International and Alameda, okay?
00:07:46.264 - 00:08:04.550, Speaker B: And so for some of those other groups, alameda research, so anybody I guess who had loaned money to them, or the Ventures silo or the.com group, what would you say are more likely outcomes for those creditors?
00:08:05.130 - 00:08:27.962, Speaker A: To be honest, we still don't know. It's obviously not looking good. FTX the.com silo we're referring to is obviously the FTX International silo. Apparently there's 2.2 billion of assets, which is reasonable amount of assets. We have no idea what the customer liabilities are, so we have to look at that in terms of what sort of monies you can get in from Alameda.
00:08:27.962 - 00:09:02.854, Speaker A: Like we identified on the structure chart, it seems to be intercompany loan, maybe you can get some recovery there. But again, it's almost too early to say at this point because the sort of new CEO is still going through the books, he's still trying to figure out what the position is. And he's actually mentioned that the accounts are so poorly capped that they basically have to start from scratch all over again. To sort of cite from paragraph 52, because of historical cash management failures, the debtors do not yet know the exact amount of cash that EFTs Group held at the point they filed the Chapter Eleven.
00:09:02.982 - 00:09:11.466, Speaker B: Just so I understand, this first day declaration, was there some deadline to post this or why wouldn't he just wait until he had some of that information?
00:09:11.648 - 00:09:33.090, Speaker A: I mean, it's a first day declaration, right? So I'm not a US bankruptcy lawyer, as you know, I'm a UK bankruptcy lawyer. Done a bit of Chapter Eleven, couldn't recite the actual US codes to you. But I think generally what happens is that you kind of get a sort of early statement from the new death in possession is still to be used. Death in possession.
00:09:33.990 - 00:10:28.182, Speaker B: Okay, so let's pull out a few of the other maybe shocking details. I don't know, you can tell me. But some things that stuck out at me were, for instance, that the company used an unsecured group email account as the root user to access confidential private keys and critically sensitive data for the FTX Group companies around the world. There was the absence of daily reconciliation of positions on the blockchain, the use of software to conceal the misuse of customer funds. That one, to my mind, has alarm bells around it. The secret exemption of Alameda from certain aspects of FTX com's auto liquidation protocol, which okay bombshell. And then the absence of independent governance between Alameda and to.
00:10:28.182 - 00:10:30.600, Speaker B: Can you just comment on any of those?
00:10:31.210 - 00:11:13.506, Speaker A: I mean, the comment on all of those is the same, which is, what the fuck? It's like any one of them on your own, you have been like, what the heck is going on here? But all of them together? Jesus. So Alameda gets to Djen and trade without fear of being liquidated by the engine. Everyone has access to private keys by some sort of unsecured group. You get a backdoor. Although at this point, given how everything's been done, it looks like he was literally just shoveling cash out of front door straight into Smida. But the back door that allows you to commingle customer funds? Insane. Everything's just insane, right? And that's kind of know it's a burning dumpster fire.
00:11:13.608 - 00:11:47.630, Speaker B: I just almost have no words. The more that I learned one last bit that seemed it raised my eyebrows, was referencing two of the audits that he was able to find. One was from a company Armanino, which he said it's a firm that he's professionally familiar with. Then he says that the second audit was by Prager Metis, with which he says he is not familiar. And then he says, quote, whose website indicates that they are the first ever CPA firm to officially open its Metaverse headquarters in a Metaverse platform. Decentraland.
00:11:49.010 - 00:12:32.800, Speaker A: I mean, I'm sometimes actually asked about what sort of auditor, what sort of accountant should I use just for people in the space? And sometimes I tend to say, look, just go for the more legitimate ones. Because when it comes down to it, someone looks at because some people say that accounting and auditing is an art rather than a science, right? Some people are perhaps more creative than others, or perhaps more negligent than others. But it's quite clear here that new CEO Mr. Ray clearly does not have any faith in the integrity of financial systems has been provided. Which is why I said, can you really blame CZ for walking away with it after looking at the documents for, like, 30 minutes?
00:12:34.930 - 00:13:22.486, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk about another wrinkle in the bankruptcy case. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible. For years, you've heard about the promise of blockchain technology, and yet high fees, security risks and unreliable chains have been the reality. It doesn't have to be this way. Avalanche believes innovators deserve Web Three infrastructure they can count on with the flexibility and tooling to build anything they want, any way they want.

Back to my conversation with Wasi lawyer.
00:14:05.770 - 00:14:36.738, Speaker B: Another bit of news that got revealed today is that FTX's Bahamas unit, FTX Digital Markets is seeking protection from creditors in the US under Chapter 15 of the US bankruptcy Code. And the way that Reuters describe it is that this allows a foreign debtor to shield assets in the country. And they say non US companies use the measure to block creditors who want to file lawsuits or tie up assets in the United States. What would you say is the significance of this move?
00:14:36.904 - 00:15:14.994, Speaker A: Right, so this is actually far more interesting to me than the first aid declaration. Not because the first day declaration isn't interesting, it's got a lot of zingers in there. But in terms of information, there's not that much simply because it's all unverified. But this development is a very big one and a very interesting one to me. And I can say, look, I've done restructurings of insolvencies a lot. I've never really seen something like this, especially because of what's in this emergency motion that's been filed by FTX I E, the new CEO of FTX. So just to provide a bit of background, chapter Eleven is a bankruptcy proceeding in the US.
00:15:14.994 - 00:15:36.550, Speaker A: When you enter into Chapter Eleven, you get a worldwide moratorium which says that your creditors around the world can't enforce against you and you have time to reorganize and sort of reorganize your assets, whether it's just to liquidate, whether it's to sell it on basically to realize value for the stakeholders involved.
00:15:36.890 - 00:15:37.254, Speaker B: Good.
00:15:37.292 - 00:16:19.720, Speaker A: That's chapter eleven. What's Chapter 15? Chapter 15 is a recognition proceeding where you recognize a bankruptcy proceeding that's happened in another part of the world. Now, you can have multiple bankruptcy proceedings in different parts of the world, of course, but you can only have one, what they call a main proceeding, which is the main bankruptcy. So what we're having here is a clash. We're having a jurisdictional battle between the US. And the Bahamas. The Bahamas entity has been put into provisional liquidation, which is also a bankruptcy process where professionals have been appointed professionals taking control of the company.
00:16:19.720 - 00:17:05.970, Speaker A: And their role as provisional liquidators is they're going to preserve the assets of the company to see if there's anything you can do with it, how to liquidate it, how to restructure it, if possible. So that's happening in the Bahamas, but at the same time, the same thing's happening to the US. And what's happened with the Chapter 15 is that the guys in the Bahamas have gone and fouled in the US. In a different court, the State District of New York rather than the District of Delaware, which is where the Chapter Eleven is held, to recognize the Bahamas proceedings. And if you recognize the Bahamas proceedings, that means that you are saying, all right, all the assets the Bahamas can be sort of adjudicated according to the process of the Bahamas. But that doesn't fly, right? Because, wait, you're kind of trying to educate the same assets in the US. At the same time.
00:17:05.970 - 00:17:17.880, Speaker A: So that's what I mean by a jurisdictional battle is going on between two jurisdictions as to who gets to control perhaps not the whole process, but at least part of the process, and from what we can tell, valuable parts of process.
00:17:18.330 - 00:17:45.250, Speaker B: Well, okay, wait, so unpack this a little bit, because the first filing, the Chapter Eleven, deals with certain entities, but this second filing deals with a separate entity, the Bahamas unit. So I don't really understand how there can be a jurisdictional battle. So I understand when you say there can only be one main proceeding, but in this case where it's different entities, how would that be considered as them battling each other?
00:17:45.400 - 00:18:24.718, Speaker A: All right, so look, you look at the digital markets, which is the Bahamas entry, entered into provisional liquidation. So you enter into process before the Chapter Eleven itself, and I think it sits under the FTX trading entity. So it's in the FTX International Group. And what we seem to understand from here is that there are sizable assets sitting in this Bahamas entry allegedly under control of the Kempahan government. But let's go to that later. Now if you're an FTX us. And you have put a whole group to Chapter eleven, right, I think I'm fairly certain the Bahamas entity is meant to be.
00:18:24.718 - 00:19:15.834, Speaker A: The Chapter Eleven as well, should be. But assuming you're administrating the bankruptcy of the entire group, obviously you want to have all of the assets of the group so that you can run the restructuring in the US. Now, if certain assets are in a sort of ideal world, what happens is you do a Chapter Eleven. The Bahamas government, the Bahamas legal system, recognizes the Chapter Eleven and says, all right, we're going to cooperate with you in any way, shape, or form, right? You're running the chapter eleven, you tell us to go ahead and do all this stuff, we're going to go ahead and enforce your will into bahamas. So that's generally how cross border insolvency works with other jurisdictions. Obviously, I'm very familiar with the UK. You have this thing known as sort of mutual recognition, mutual recognition treaties.
00:19:15.834 - 00:19:43.506, Speaker A: And a lot of it starts looking a lot like international diplomacy, right, because when you're looking at companies that span the entire globe, your insolvency will span the entire globe as well. And for insolvency in restructuring to be somewhat sensible, someone has to lead it. And there is first of all, there's a lot of money in leading it just for the country itself. And that's why you see certain countries sort of start developing as what you call restructuring hubs. The US. Is obviously one of them. Chapter Eleven the UK.
00:19:43.506 - 00:20:14.046, Speaker A: Is another one. Singapore is starting to become more of a restructuring hub as well. There's this issue of cross border recognition because it only works if you all recognize each other's efforts and each other's ability to administer assets which are within the jurisdiction and also sort of without, because we recognize that you are the main proceeding, what I call is the center of main interest, especially using the sort of UK. Terminology, center of main interest, which means you get to run this insolvency.
00:20:14.238 - 00:20:18.434, Speaker B: And so how does it get decided kind of which one becomes the main one?
00:20:18.552 - 00:20:53.902, Speaker A: Good question. This has happened before. It's this case called bahamar, which I tweeted about earlier. Someone should look at it because in this case, bahamar, we had pretty much, I would say exactly the same thing. It wasn't as much a dumpster fire, but I think it was a real estate development in the bahamas. And chapter eleven was filed, but the bahamas entity also entered into process in the bahamas. And in that case, the bahamas sort of won jurisdiction because the US.
00:20:53.902 - 00:21:58.386, Speaker A: Said, look, it's pointless for us to do anything here because all the assets in the bahamas and even if we made any decisions with regards to the assets, they're, the bahamas and the Bahamas are not going to recognize us. So we just dismissed the chapter eleven filing. Very, very different case, of course, because now we're looking at a completely different situation with a company with assets sort of worldwide, and at least part of it is in the US. Perhaps the more interesting thing is that there are certain allegations being made in this emergency motion regarding the role of the Bahaman government in india. Now, if you recall, sam was saying, look, we're going to let bahamas people withdraw their money because the Bahamas regulators told me to do so. The bahamas, I think it was the securities commission came on and said, we never say anything like that. But now this is being repeated by the new CEO of FTX that the bahamian government may have had in all of this.
00:21:58.568 - 00:22:05.458, Speaker B: And when you say that, you mean like in the malfeasance at FTX, is that what you're saying?
00:22:05.544 - 00:22:32.700, Speaker A: Yeah. Let me read this out here. In addition, in connection with investigating a hack on Sunday, November 13, Mr. Bankman Freedom, mr. Wang stated in recorded verified text that Bahaman regulators instructed that post petition transfers of debtor assets be made by Mr. Wang and Mr. Bankman freed who the debtors understand, were both effectively in the custody of Bahamas authorities and that such assets were custodied on fireblocks under control of the Bahamian government.
00:22:32.700 - 00:23:07.970, Speaker A: The adapters have credible evidence that the Bahamian government is responsible for directing unauthorized access to the debtor system for the purpose of obtaining digital assets and data that took place after the commencement of these cases. I e the chapter eleven. The appointment of the joint provisional liquidators and recognition of Chapter 15. Place asked us in serious question. It appears that the automatic stay has been flaunted by a government actor, no less. This is no time to be arguing over venue. So that's a direct quote from something that the news filed in the US courts.
00:23:07.970 - 00:23:09.746, Speaker A: It's pretty damn, isn't?
00:23:09.938 - 00:23:25.040, Speaker B: Wow. Okay, so but then in that kind of situation, what, do they force fireblocks to return the money or I don't know, once the money has been transferred, what can be done?
00:23:25.810 - 00:23:51.958, Speaker A: I really just couldn't answer this question. It's absolutely wild to me. Right, because if you're saying that it's one thing to say that, to say that someone in the Bahamas or the Bahamas Company isn't cooperating. Right. Because if they're not cooperating, what do you do? You go ahead as long as you get it recognized in Bahamas. You do your Chapter Eleven, do whatever the hell you want of it. You go to the Bahamas and call order, and you're going to recognize this.
00:23:51.958 - 00:24:11.366, Speaker A: So please carry out on what's been agreed. But now what we're saying is that the Bahamas government is involved. That's a whole different ballgame, man. It's a whole different ballgame. So what are you actually going to do if you're the United States Bankruptcy Court here? Okay, cool. We're going to have the Chapter Eleven anyway. Fuck your chapter.
00:24:11.366 - 00:24:24.386, Speaker A: 15. We're not going to screw this. We're not going to recognize your thing going on in the Bahamas. Wait a minute. The Bahamas isn't going to recognize the thing you have going on in there either. Shit. Where does that leave us? Yeah.
00:24:24.408 - 00:24:26.210, Speaker B: And now they have all these assets.
00:24:26.790 - 00:24:28.174, Speaker A: Yeah, because they're sitting on the assets.
00:24:28.222 - 00:24:32.660, Speaker B: Right, right. So what do you think happens next?
00:24:33.990 - 00:24:51.750, Speaker A: I think we grabbed the popcorn and wait and see, to be honest. It's not something that you can't have, like, a lot of historical precedent for. Right. Where allegedly a government authority seizes assets and refuses to cooperate with another government or another jurisdiction.
00:24:51.910 - 00:25:03.360, Speaker B: I think. Did I say earlier, I have no words because I feel like I'm in the same position again. But in terms of kind of formal procedure type stuff, what would be the next step?
00:25:04.210 - 00:25:47.926, Speaker A: They're trying to get the sort of Chapter 15 sort of transferred to the Delaware, which is where the Chapter Eleven is filed. And then they're probably going to sort of have a bit of a fight over it and then we'll see what the US court says. In all the circumstances, we wait for a bit more information to come out from the Bahamas. But the interesting bit sort of takeaway from us, I think for sort of listeners, I guess, and just general people, is that Sam seems to really want the Bahamas to win. He wants for jurisdiction to be in the Bahamas. And this is interesting to me because it sort of shows you what he seems to have in mind. And Sam does not seem to have given up altogether.
00:25:47.926 - 00:26:26.694, Speaker A: And he seems to think from some messages that believed or published, that he thinks he can still save the company. That is likely the reason why I'm not sure if this Chapter 15 thing is being driven by him or being driven by the government, being driven by the provisional liquidators. But for him, what happened to the Chapter Eleven is that he's out because he's resigned. He could have stayed on, but thank Christ he's out. So he's out. He's got professional in. He's got professional in who says that he's unsophisticated, complete out of his depth and it's a complete shit show, right? And everything that he is saying is not on behalf of the company.
00:26:26.694 - 00:27:01.140, Speaker A: He's completely out. That's what John Ray has been saying. Truly speaking in the Bahamas, he's kind of in a similar position because you've got a joint provision liquidator in there. It's a professional, it's obviously professional coming in here to sort of secure the assets of the company and keep things running along. But in a sort of provisional liquidation, it's still not completely over and it's open. If for Sam to suddenly come up with, hey, I've got like $8 billion and I can now take this company out of joint provisional liquidation. And that seems to be what he is trying to do.
00:27:01.140 - 00:27:09.620, Speaker A: He seems to be trying to save his company outside of the US. Because he's been disenfranchised in the US.
00:27:10.710 - 00:27:18.150, Speaker B: Okay? And so just to connect the dots, so you're saying that you think the Chapter 15 is being driven by Sam?
00:27:19.530 - 00:27:36.910, Speaker A: I'm not sure who's driving it. It's been noted here in this statement that John Ray has spoken with the John provision liquidators and they didn't tell us they were going to do a Chapter 15. So I think it's sort of hit them by surprise as well. And in many ways it sort of hit everybody by surprise.
00:27:39.010 - 00:27:40.462, Speaker B: Like everything else in this story.
00:27:40.516 - 00:28:29.390, Speaker A: Yeah, but we can see from the messages that Sam has come out right, which is said, you know, what was the biggest single fuck up and the guy, whoever his corresponding says, oh. And he says, the one thing everyone told me to do, everything would be about 70% fixed right now if I hadn't chapter eleven. And he says, we get there. If both either Gary on the shot comes back, presumably he needs a bit more support on the side right now. And B, we win a jurisdictional battle versus Delaware. So it looks like he really wants the Bahamas to win because he thinks, rightly or wrongly, that he can somehow fundraise and get a deal done outside of the chapter eleven, which seems a bit insane to me. It could well be the case that he's just completely off his rocker.
00:28:29.390 - 00:29:13.294, Speaker A: I was going to say who knows? But it's very unlikely because he was a very successful entrepreneur, right. His face was on all these magazines, he was a media darling, et cetera. For someone like that, it's incredibly easy to raise money. And he probably still has that in his mind because I saw this sort of leaked term sheet that was going around. I think it was on the Financial Times or something, where it was like pretty amateur kind of crappy terms, where he sort of still felt like he was in charge. Because he's just used to that, right? You're used to people throwing money at you when money is cheap, obviously in the previous years when you're one of the fastest growing businesses in the world, where you're the face of crypto in the west, essentially. But it's now very different.
00:29:13.294 - 00:29:36.342, Speaker A: It's a very different ballgame when now you're insolvent the way you do fundraising is different, the way you structure a deal is different. You can no longer go out doing structuring a deal, going, promising someone infinite upside, et cetera, because they know that you're in trouble. Now there's a whole new balance sheet. The way you fix it, the sort of financing you're looking at, the sort of funding you're looking at is very, very different.
00:29:36.476 - 00:30:10.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I commented to someone that when everyone thought he was the golden boy, he raised 2 billion. So now that his reputation is definitely in a different place, I was like, how does he think he's going to raise 8 billion? But anyway, who knows? There have been so many crazy twists to this story. I'm not going to say it's impossible. Well, wasi this has been such an amazing discussion. I'm sure that you're going to be back soon because apparently there's all kinds of twists and turns with this bankruptcy. Thanks again for coming on unchained.
00:30:10.570 - 00:30:18.210, Speaker A: No worries, happy to chat and I'm sure we'll speak in soon as more information comes out. Hopefully in like a week and not tomorrow.

Recap alameda CEO confesses to using customer funds and SBF may have used a backdoor the New York Times reported that Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, declared in a company wide meeting that the trading firm used customer funds from the now bankrupt FTX to repay its loans. Ellison stated that the earlier crypto collapses caused some of Alameda's loans to be recalled.
00:31:23.874 - 00:32:14.280, Speaker B: According to her, the firm didn't have enough money to repay those loans, so it agreed with FTX executives to transfer FTX customer funds to repay them. Reuters reported that Sam Bankman Free, the founder of both Alameda and FTX, built a backdoor to FTX to change financial records and move funds to Alameda without triggering internal compliance checks. The news agency said that SBF could also use the tool to modify records so the state of affairs wouldn't be visible to external auditors. Bankman Fried denied the allegations. In an interview with Vox, SBF blamed messy accounting and margin exchange for the collapse of FTX. Based on the first declaration in the bankruptcy and SPF's admission to Vox that customer deposits went straight to Alameda. The commingling may have begun far earlier than several months ago.
00:32:14.280 - 00:33:07.382, Speaker B: FTX Failure Sparks Crypto Lending Contagion FTX's collapse quickly spread to the rest of the crypto lending market. Genesis Global Capital, the lending arm of Genesis Global Trading, paused withdrawals, citing unprecedented market turmoil. Genesis is one of the largest institutional lending companies that services crypto platforms, offering yields to retail investors. If Genesis fails, customer funds held on these platforms could be at risk. For that very reason, gemini, one of the more well regulated crypto exchanges in the US, warned its customers that they might suffer delays when withdrawing their assets from its Earn product, which lets users earn yields on their crypto. However, Gemini reassured customers that all funds on the exchange are safe. Retail crypto lender BlockFi paused withdrawals and deposits after FTX filed for bankruptcy and is preparing to file for bankruptcy proceedings on its own.
00:33:07.382 - 00:34:14.586, Speaker B: According to the Wall Street Journal, the lender received a 400 million dollar line of credit from FTX US in July. The Block revealed that back in July, crypto lender Nexo Disclosure, a former sponsor made an offer to acquire Blockfly and a deal worth $850,000,000 contagion spreads across the globe. Japanese crypto exchange Liquid Global, which is owned by FTX, halted fiat and crypto withdrawals from the platform. Salt Lending, a crypto lender also paused withdrawals and bank, to the Future scrapped its deal to buy the company. Plenty of major investors in FTX, including Paradigm, Sequoia and Tomasic, have written down their investments, in some cases to zero. Others affected include hedge fund Multicoin Capital, which held a $25 million stake in FTX through its $430,000,000 venture fund bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, whom Alameda owes $12 million and troubled Crypto Exchange Vault, which had $10 million of funds in FTX. The Ontario Teachers pension plan also held $95 million in FTX but said it will have a limited impact.
00:34:14.586 - 00:34:50.914, Speaker B: House to call hearing on FTX as regulators announced investigations lawmakers and regulators haven't ignored the exchange's startling collapse. The House Financial Services Committee calls on bankman free to testify about the fallout of FTX in a hearing to take place in December. The hearing will examine how FTX blew up and to work out the broader consequences for the digital asset ecosystem. California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation also announced an investigation into the failure of FTX, as did prosecutors from the Department of justice. U. S. Authorities are also investigating the role Binance played in the collapse of FTX.
00:34:50.914 - 00:35:37.366, Speaker B: Changpang Zhao or CZ, the CEO of Binance, triggered a liquidity cris on FTX when he announced that he would sell the company's holdings of FTT. FTX's exchange token binance is reportedly cooperating with authorities on the case. Lawmakers use FTX's example to regulate the industry in addition to tanking the markets. The implosion of FTX grabbed the attention of American lawmakers, who said that it proves that the industry needs stricter regulations to protect retail investors. The anti crypto US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the collapse of FTX must be a wake up call for Congress and financial regulators to hold this industry and its executives accountable. Additionally, Warren, together with Senator Dick Durbin, sent a letter to SBF demanding information on its shocking collapse. U.
00:35:37.366 - 00:36:22.610, Speaker B: S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, known for her hardline stance against crypto, also called for more effective oversight over the crypto markets. Senator Pat Toomey, a former guest on Unchained who has been vocal about his opposition to the SEC's enforcement actions on crypto, said that the crypto industry has been operating with ambiguity because regulators don't provide a proper framework and lawmakers refuse to act. After spending months talking to regulators and lawmakers, SPF told Vox, Fuck them. They make everything worse. He later apologized for his comments and said that some regulators command impressive knowledge. Binance forms a recovery fund as exchanges rush to prove reserves Exchange giant Finance announced it will form a recovery fund to stem the contagion from FTX's implosion.
00:36:22.610 - 00:37:09.266, Speaker B: Crypto exchange Okx plans to fill another fund with $100 million to provide struggling projects with liquidity, CZ said. The exchange also plans to implement a new proof of reserves protocol developed by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Last Friday, Finance disclosed that it held $69 billion in assets, but it didn't use Buterin's protocol to prove the figures. Nine other exchanges announced similar plans after Zhao published his proposal. The effort should bring more transparency to exchanges, but proof of reserves only shows how much an exchange holds, not how much it owes to other people. Without that information, it's impossible to know whether the exchange has enough liquidity to back customer assets. Speaking of exchange, CoinDesk reported that Binance US is preparing to bid for bankrupt crypto lender Voyager.
00:37:09.266 - 00:37:38.618, Speaker B: After the news broke, Voyager's token VGX jumped by over 50%. Audit Provides Transparency on LFG and TfL funds The Luna Foundation Guard, or LFG, the nonprofit created to develop the Terra ecosystem, published an audit on how the foundation and TerraForm Labs fought to defend the Ustpeg. During Terra's Crash in May. According to the report from auditor JS. Helt, LFG spent $2.8 billion, mostly in Bitcoin, to defend the UST. Peg.
00:37:38.618 - 00:38:35.650, Speaker B: The audit showed that TerraForm Labs spent $613,000,000 of its own money in its failed attempt to prevent UST from falling into a death spiral. The founder, Do Kwan, said, it is natural to suspect fraud when something goes wrong, but if we sweep all failures in crypto as scams and say, there are some bad apples, but everything else is fine, then we never have opportunities to learn from our mistake. FTX hacker becomes a Whale last Friday night, after FTX announced its bankruptcy, an unknown person that many suspect as an FTX insider hacked the exchange's systems. The wallet tied to the attack on FTX swapped some BNB tokens and stablecoins for ETH. The hack doesn't appear to have been well thought out. The attacker lost significant amounts of their holdings on several transactions. They've hastily tried to do whatever they can with the funds, seemingly without much of a plan, Miguel Morel, CEO of Arkham, a crypto intelligence firm, told CoinDesk.
00:38:35.650 - 00:39:29.870, Speaker B: Despite that, they became the 31st largest ethereum holder, currently holding 241,000 ether, worth about $300 million at press time. Was DFI the only winner? Chaos is the latter used to say famous Games of Thrones character littlefinger, even though the effects of FTX have been catastrophic for many, there were also some winners. This week, decentralized Exchange uniswap beat Coinbase and became the second largest venue for ETH trading. And Ledger, a hardware wallet provider, saw its biggest sales day ever following the collapse of FTX. Both achievements perhaps signal that users are finally moving to non custodial and decentralized platforms. Time for fun bits. In a morning brew video on TikTok, the Tale of SBF and FTX, he plays every character from SPF himself to an everyday investor, to a crypto bro named Captain Laser, who snorts ice crystals to bolster his credentials to the investor.
00:39:29.870 - 00:40:10.734, Speaker B: SBF sets himself apart from Captain Laser by saying, now take a look at me. I don't sleep or bathe. The investor is increasingly confused as he watches numerous investors put money into FTX, and he's absolutely baffled when he hears Sam's pitch for face tissue tokens, or FTT. As the frenzy increases until SPF is seen testifying in front of Congress, saying, i, and only I, can save crypto, a shadowy figure appears, and it's Binance, saying, oh, only you. I created you. And the hooded Binance figure lights his face tissue tokens on fire. All right, thanks so much for joining us today.
