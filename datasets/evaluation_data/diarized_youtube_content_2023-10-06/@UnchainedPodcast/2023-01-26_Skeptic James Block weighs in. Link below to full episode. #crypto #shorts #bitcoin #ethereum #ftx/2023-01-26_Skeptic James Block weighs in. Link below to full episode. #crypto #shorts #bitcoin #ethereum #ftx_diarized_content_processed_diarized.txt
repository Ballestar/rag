00:00:00.570 - 00:00:35.734, Speaker A: The interesting part for me is that this is probably the first time in history where you can track fraud in real time, publicly, right? Like I can see every transaction they make, at least on chain. Obviously there's a lot happening outside of that, but you can still learn a lot. And that's never happened in history, as far as I know. So there are cool aspects to it. But again, what's the activity on the Ethereum blockchain doing? It's trans acting in Ponzi schemes and frauds. You have software as a service, which is a major category of business to me. Ethereum and other blockchains like it are scam as a service.
00:00:35.734 - 00:00:54.620, Speaker A: That's what they're offering. But really, I mean, like, let's be fair. I mean, look at all the tokens listed on Ethereum. How many of them, even to someone who believes in, say, something like, Bitcoin, how many of them have intrinsic value even to that degree? They don't and used for that's what most of the volume on that blockchain is for. So what is it then?
