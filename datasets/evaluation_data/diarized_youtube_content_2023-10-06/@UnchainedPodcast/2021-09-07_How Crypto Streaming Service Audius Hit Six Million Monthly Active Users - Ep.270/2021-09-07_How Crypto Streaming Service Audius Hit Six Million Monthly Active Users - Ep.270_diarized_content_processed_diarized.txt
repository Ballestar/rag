00:01:42.794 - 00:01:45.280, Speaker A: Hey, Laura, thanks so much for having me.
00:01:45.650 - 00:02:00.930, Speaker B: Audience has made some headlines recently, having recently scored a deal to enable artists to directly upload their music to TikTok soundkit. But before we get into all the details on that, let's start at the beginning. What is Audius?
00:02:01.830 - 00:02:56.946, Speaker A: Audius is a digital streaming service that connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music. And we really see that direct piece of the equation being the key differentiator here. But when you use Audius, it looks and feels like any other music player, right? You can sign up, make an account, follow your favorite artists, and start listening to their tracks without knowing anything about crypto, anything else. But of course, under the hood, the way that Audius operates couldn't be more different from the traditional kind of SoundCloud or Spotify or something like that, right? There's a network of third party node operators, artists and fans that together collectively and collaboratively run this network for the benefit of the community and for their own benefit, I guess, too, in the case of the node operators.
00:02:57.138 - 00:03:01.240, Speaker B: And what problem is Audience solving that other music platforms have?
00:03:04.010 - 00:04:19.214, Speaker A: You know, I guess really where the initial inspiration for Audience came from was my co founder, Forrest and I are just big dance music fans, right? We're not native to the music industry or from the music industry, but we were native to crypto a little bit. So he and I started mining litecoin and Dogecoin and some of the other escript coins in 2013 or so onward. And we just started to see, I guess in really around 2014, 2015, a lot of our favorite artists choosing to leave SoundCloud, or getting kicked off of SoundCloud in some cases. And all this great music that we had favorited and followed over the years started disappearing. So when we started to ask ourselves why that was happening, was really when we started to understand this broader set of issues that at its core I would summarize as artists don't know who their fans are, where their fans are, or have any ability to engage or interact directly with them. Like on Spotify, for example, you as an artist can message your fans once per year. There's a specific email template that you have to follow.
00:04:19.214 - 00:05:07.070, Speaker A: Spotify exercises some editorial control over it, and that's it. That's like your ability to reach your fans so you can't link them out to a third party merch store, for example. You can't do just very much at all with that fan base. There are all these downstream effects of artists just not controlling or having any ownership of their distribution, which included them getting deplatformed, them choosing to depart platforms like SoundCloud and Mass. So, yeah, that's really the core problem we're solving is to give artists control and access to those relationships that they have with their fans.
00:05:07.650 - 00:05:10.750, Speaker B: And so how do you do that on audience?
00:05:11.490 - 00:05:55.494, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's really by decentralizing that whole stack and tool chain. So even the question of what is audience is not a simple one to answer just because it doesn't cleanly fit into the bucket of like, oh, it's a so called DSP in music parlance, or a digital service provider. It's also not a distributor per se. It kind of has aspects of a number of these things. But what it really looks like is a set of tools that allow an artist to build an audience and engage directly with them with no intermediaries. Right. Our company or any company included.
00:05:55.494 - 00:06:44.702, Speaker A: Right. Like for the first time, there's zero parties intermediating that interaction. And it's led to a lot of really neat emergent behavior within the network that we haven't really seen before in other music streaming services networks. But yeah, it really does come down to us being decentralized. That's why even to launch the first version of Audius in late 2019, which was not economically incentivized, it was a testnet, but it was decentralized from day one and fully open source. So that was what I think among the artist community, allowed this audience network to start to build trust with them, right. That the rules aren't going to change on them.
00:06:44.702 - 00:06:57.138, Speaker A: This API that their whole workflow is dependent on is not going to get pulled out from under them. All of these sort of qualities that just had never been possible in music before.
00:06:57.304 - 00:07:02.850, Speaker B: And do you have examples of what they are doing on the platform that they can't do on something like a Spotify.
00:07:03.350 - 00:08:12.300, Speaker A: Yeah. So one of the coolest emergent behaviors that our community ended up deciding to double down on with some more product features is this remix competition feature. So it was actually an artist named Lido was the first one to kind of create this behavior, but he uploaded a track and then uploaded all the constituent little pieces of audio that went into creating that track as separate tracks that he flagged as downloadable so anyone could go download that raw audio. And then he went and posted on Instagram and told his fan base, hey, if you all remix this track using those stems that I uploaded and tag your track with just the hashtag, I forget exactly what he did. I think it was like the name of the track or something. He could then go search that hashtag, find everything that remixed it, and then he did a twitch stream, like, going through and listening to them live and giving feedback and then engaging. So it was really fun.
00:08:12.300 - 00:08:57.602, Speaker A: And we were like, this is so cool. There has to be a way to kind of better enable that. So we kind of built out a little bit of UI for this. And then RAC, I think, was the next one that ran a remix competition with this. But now, by that time, there's actually a way to formally tag a track as being a remix of another track. And he actually ended up signing, I think, five of the tracks that remixed his track to an official release under his label. So these were just fans of his that loved Andre's music or RAC's music and wanted to just get noticed by their favorite artist.
00:08:57.602 - 00:09:54.060, Speaker A: Right. And some of them actually are now on an official release of his, which is so cool, right? So when you break down all of those kind of, I guess, like, the barriers that exist between artists and fan, it starts to become possible to just do these weird, neat things, right. That had never another example that comes to mind is we've seen a few artists upload works in progress of a given track, so they'll upload draft, get feedback on it from the community. Iterate on it, upload a new one, see how people like it, do that a few times, and then the final release, like, two or three months later, maybe makes it to a Spotify or to other services. But the superfans that are like, I want to hear everything this person makes, and I want to engage with it and hang out. There's no better place to be right now.
00:09:54.590 - 00:10:29.346, Speaker B: Wow, I love this. It sounds so cool. I mean, it just sounds really fun. It's like a little DJ mixing party on the Internet or something. So something that's interesting to me about your platform is at this moment in time, I feel like people typically think of anything that brings together culture and crypto as involving NFTs and that's actually not the main way you're using blockchain technology, at least I believe so based on my research. So talk a little bit more about the crypto aspects of Audius.
00:10:29.538 - 00:11:37.222, Speaker A: Totally. No, you're spot on there. The only integration of NFTs today in Audience is as an artist you can run like a little storefront page on your profile if you'd like to. So some artists like Blau or RAC have these collectibles tabs that they've turned on on their profile and they just put all the NFTs they've minted and that they've owned there. So it's kind of like this directory that links out to whatever market might exist in that like on OpenSea or Super Rare or wherever it may be. But yeah, no, we aren't a native NFT platform by any means what Audience uses blockchains plural for, and I can get into more of the technical detail around that is effectively a coordination layer for this network. So there are these off chain nodes that host content, host metadata and kind of do the work that is required to keep the network functional and alive.
00:11:37.222 - 00:12:33.206, Speaker A: Right. The way that the network is set up, our company could go away tomorrow and the vast majority of us here would continue to work just fine. Right. It's because it's being operated by the community, but there's what the kind of ethereum at the center on the node operator side and then solana on the content engagement side provide are this sort of unified source of truth for a number of questions. Right? Like who are the nodes on the network? Are they in a healthy or valid state? And then on the content side, what is all the content in this network? Who has engaged with it, who has the ability to update or modify it? So by doing that we can kind of like anchor trust with these small pieces of data on chain that refer out to data being stored off chain on these community operated nodes.
00:12:33.398 - 00:12:56.486, Speaker B: Okay, so for the metadata it's just like kind know who wrote this track or who performed it and does that include kind of like royalties? The way know a spotify will pay you for streams so every time it gets played then different people who participate in that song will get paid or how does that work?
00:12:56.668 - 00:14:07.834, Speaker A: Yeah, so it includes everything from the title of the track and the COVID art for the track and the name of the artist and things like that to things like revenue splits as well. So the network doesn't natively split revenue today, although it does allow you to define those splits within the metadata because that's something that I think our community had always planned or wanted to build towards over time. Right? Yeah. Even in the absence of that, there is quite a bit of content that both independent labels have uploaded and a few of the larger players have uploaded and basically they handle the splits on their end right now. So there's one address that's getting paid out royalties and then that company can decide, hey, I need to split this however I do, or what have you on the metadata side. It's really more just like all the things that go around the audio file itself to make it have meaning or make it interesting.
00:14:08.032 - 00:14:14.000, Speaker B: And then you also have the audio token. So what functions does that perform in the audio system?
00:14:14.610 - 00:15:09.002, Speaker A: Yeah, that has three core functions. It secures the network. So the people who run the nodes that actually do all the work that makes the network functional, they stake the token to be able to run that node, and then they earn fees back from the network proportional to the size of the stake and the number of nodes that they run. So one of the kind of strange things about the audience network's needs, compared to a lot of, say, layer one blockchains that have their own nodes, is that the need for storage grows forever. Right? Like, the more people upload, the more people engage, the more you need. So the way that the node infrastructure is set up, it's not like there's a fixed kind of processing capacity. It's like the more nodes there are, the more can be stored, the more can be served, et cetera.
00:15:09.002 - 00:16:08.740, Speaker A: So the crypto economic structure has to kind of incentivize a much larger amount of storage to be on the network than the network actually needs at any given time anyway. Yeah. So secures the network. The token also is used in governance. So from the time the token launched in October of 2020, our team was no longer capable of making any changes to the code that powers audience both all the on chain smart contracts for engaging with content and all that good stuff, as well as in the off chain node software. So the nodes actually monitor one another to see that they're running the most up to date version and they can get slashed if they're running too far behind and things like that. But to actually accept within the network a new version of the code as being canonically correct, there has to be a governance vote that happens.
00:16:08.740 - 00:16:58.690, Speaker A: It's not one token, one vote, but one token staked within the network is able to vote. So if you just hold tokens passively, you're not able to participate. But if you're delegating to a node, or you're running a node yourself, you get to vote on how this goes. And then the third pillar there is feature access. So as an artist, if you hold and stake some number of tokens, you get access to additional distribution features that may consume more resources at the network level. So the NFT feature is actually one of those. So if you hold more than 100 audio tokens on your Audius account, you're able to set up that collectibles tab and connect external wallets and stuff.
00:16:58.690 - 00:18:23.040, Speaker A: The reason for that limitation actually is that it costs the network resources to go index all those wallets and basically keep track of all the changes to any holding of NFTs or things like that they have. Those are the three primary functions. I think the one misconception that I always like to clear up around this though is the audio token is not used for payments within the network, right? So users aren't purchasing this to consume content or things like that. We talked to many artists about this as we were kind of working through the testnet and artists want food and shelter, right? They don't necessarily want like when they are charging for access to their music, conflating control of the means of distribution with their basal needs to function as a human being in the world I think is a very dangerous sort of game. Right. Based on all of that feedback, I think the intent with a lot of that design was to separate these things to say your ability to control your distribution should not come in direct conflict with your ability to feed yourself and support yourself. Right.
00:18:23.040 - 00:18:47.140, Speaker A: And mixing them creates some kind of weird dynamics right, where the artists that are, say, selling what they earn to support themselves, that means they're losing control of the distribution that they're making valuable right, which is not, we felt, not the right sort of incentive structure to create.
00:18:47.670 - 00:18:50.130, Speaker B: So then are they earning stable coins?
00:18:50.810 - 00:19:37.074, Speaker A: Monetization in audience is not fully live right now. So there are folks that are earning in stablecoins in very ad hoc ways. So on Audius, every user has a wallet. They're able to receive anything to that wallet they might please. So there's kind of this ad hoc economy that's emerged around that just because there are so many people now on the network that have these wallets. But no, the more formal features on monetization are still, I think, being iterated on and worked on by the community. I think the first goal was always to build a meaningful enough audience within the network that it actually started to make sense for someone to think about monetizing it.
00:19:37.074 - 00:20:20.020, Speaker A: And for the first time, I think, in the last three or four months, there are some accounts on audience with tens of thousands of followers like 2030, 40,000 that for the first time became enough that someone could think, about, hey, if two or three or 5% of my audience might convert to a paid engagement, like a paid subscription to me or something like that, that's now like a real amount of money for them, right? Like 3500 600 people engaging on something like that could really move the needle. You'd be surprised how many artists actually just because of how little they earn for the most part on traditional streaming services.
00:20:21.110 - 00:21:07.940, Speaker B: Yeah, I have some friends who are musicians and it's not pretty. One thing I wanted to ask about was for the staking. I realized that because of the price of the audio token that at the moment it would cost half a million dollars to become one of those node operators that can stake. Actually, I think compared to just trying to remember what the dollar amount was when Staking launched on the beacon chain on ETH two, I think it was like 16,000 or something. But I was wondering, is there a reason why it's so much more? Are you going after some kind of professional operation or what's the thinking behind that level? Or is it just like you didn't anticipate the price would go up this much?
00:21:09.270 - 00:22:21.770, Speaker A: Yeah, so the level was intentional. Although I think if we could go back and redo history, something that varied a little bit more with the current market dynamic, rather than being a fixed number, would likely make more sense. But the barrier to entry here was intentionally very high and the reason for that is to run a node on the audience network and have it be able to meet the minimum specification and requirement for a node is pretty expensive. It's not a straightforward thing to do and requires a level of expertise today that's not broadly accessible yet. So that's actually why there's a separation between you can delegate tokens and you can delegate as little as 100 tokens at a time. So there's a much, much longer tail of people delegating tokens to people who run nodes professionally. But the goal was for the folks operating nodes to be really professional hosting businesses.
00:22:21.770 - 00:23:31.050, Speaker A: The other side of this that is worth touching upon is that because those node operators are professional, real, legitimate hosting businesses, there's some responsibility that comes as a node operator with respect to the content that gets stored on your node. So if someone uploads something that they don't own the rights to, for example, right, as a node operator, you are responsible for when kind of rights holders, file DMCA notices and things like that to respond to them. And I think that's something worth calling out is that decentralization does not need to mean mass sort of infringement of rights. Right. And that's why the incentives around the network were structured this way. Right. The node operator archetype that is on Audius, someone who has the level of resources that you just mentioned to be able to come on here, has no interest in hosting things that draw the wrong kind of attention.
00:23:31.050 - 00:24:14.298, Speaker A: Right. So that's actually why audience has not really had run ins or issues on that front. Our goal with designing this network was to help artists get paid more, right. Not to defraud them or to take away their livelihood through people putting stuff up that paying the right person. Yeah, I think that it was really those two aspects. Right. It's like the complexity of running a node and to be able to provide a high quality of user experience and service to end users that are fetching content from those nodes.
00:24:14.298 - 00:24:51.660, Speaker A: And then just the nature of music attracts some not so great behavior. That we wanted the people who are running nodes to be known named businesses or individuals that actually have a presence and exist in the real world. Right? Which again decentralization, both decentralization and kind of decentralized control can go hand in hand with respecting the rights of content.
00:24:52.750 - 00:25:34.120, Speaker B: I love it. I think that's just really cool and smart. So a couple of things. So first of all, just for listeners who don't know what DMCA takedown is, if I remember correctly, it's something like Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Okay, thank you. Because I've sent these out before where someone stole my writing and I was like you need to take that down. So I think that's great that you are seeking these professional operators who would abide by the law if they were to receive a request by that request like that.
00:25:34.120 - 00:26:15.720, Speaker B: And it's interesting that you just raised this issue because I was going to ask you like I noticed two years ago the Verge wrote an article calling your service a copyright nightmare and said it was at that time full of pirated material. And the truth is actually when I first started learning about it I was like oh, it's like Napster with a token. Is it just because basically all the node operators are kind of more centralized that they're handling it? Or you kind of said it's not even really been an issue. So are you noticing that already? Or these node operators aren't even getting people uploading? Pirated stuff.
00:26:16.250 - 00:28:07.174, Speaker A: Great questions all around. So there definitely are things getting uploaded to audience that shouldn't be in the same way that they do to YouTube or to SoundCloud or to really anywhere, right? If you give users the ability to upload things there will be some small number of people that sort of misbehave. The reason it's not become an issue though, more broadly is that whenever rights holders have approached operators in the network and in the community at least, the feedback we've heard is that 100% of the time those things have been addressed in a timely fashion. So I think one thing that is really unfortunate, right, is sometimes folks who write and produce content on the internet don't necessarily fully understand the mechanics of what they're writing about. And I think that specific press piece there were just a lot of things that unfortunately I think that reporter got a little bit wrong about the actual situation with respect to the network, right? If that narrative were true there would have been a lot more anger and lawsuits and who knows what else that would have started flying around from the broader music community. But I think we've been fairly warmly embraced by the broader music community and I think it's because we took this approach that I just described to you, right, by being decentralized but still aligning incentives around positive behavior. You can, I think, get the best of both worlds here.
00:28:07.174 - 00:28:54.040, Speaker A: Right. You don't have to trust our company when using audience. But there are laws and rules that exist for good reason and allowing people to hide behind the shields of anonymity in some cases, like you might be able to if the requirements were much lower or much smaller, I think we felt would lead to a misalignment around those incentives. Right. We want all the folks who run nodes on the Audius network, which today they're, I think, like 60 or 70 nodes, last I counted. Those should all be known quantities in the world. Right.
00:28:55.610 - 00:29:24.660, Speaker B: Okay. A couple of other things I want to ask about this. One thing is, and I think I might already know the answer to this, but I did notice that the audio token is set to inflate at a rate of 7% a year. And I was wondering, as I'm sure you're well aware, a lot of people in the crypto community like coins that have caps or not caps, but like maybe low inflation. But I was curious to hear about why you're inflating at a somewhat high rate.
00:29:25.190 - 00:30:42.300, Speaker A: Yeah. So we felt that it made more sense to distribute the token supply over a very long period of time to the community members that were creating the most value in the ecosystem. That effectively meant that rather than distributing a very large amount of tokens up front when the network launched by delay, basically having that happen over a period of really for perpetuity, that would lead to a better kind of distribution of power and control in the community. A lot of the design around audience was sort of inspired by a lot of the ideals that Karl Marx and some of those early philosophers around capitalist economic structure laid out, that it should be possible for folks who make use of capital to earn some of that capital back over time from the work that they do. Right. And for that to be possible, there needs to be some amount of inflation perpetually. Right.
00:30:42.300 - 00:31:27.320, Speaker A: But the way that the staking side of audience is set up, if you stake and actively participate with your tokens, your percentage of control of the broader network doesn't get diluted over time. Right. As it stands right now, by staking, you can grow your percentage of ownership over time just by function of the participation in staking. And what it basically means is the network heavily disincentivizes, passive holding and incentivizes active participation. Right. Because if you just hold those tokens and do nothing with them, you get diluted down at an aggressive rate over time. Right.
00:31:27.320 - 00:32:15.622, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the interesting things is that about designing these sort of crypto economic systems is that we could sit in a room and try and do the best we can, but ultimately, once it's out in the world, it is in the hands of the community. Right. The decisions that our team made prior to launching the network are now only changeable by the community. So all of what I just said aside, there is a growing contingent within the audience ecosystem that wants to change that inflation rate, I think for the reason that you just laid out. So it will be interesting to see how that plays out. I mean, I think this is the community's property and the world's property, so at least I personally would be supportive of whatever they decide here.
00:32:15.622 - 00:32:28.330, Speaker A: But that was at least the initial intent here was that over time, the network should be controlled by the people who are actively using it, not by kind of like passive holders of that capital.
00:32:29.310 - 00:33:28.042, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk a little bit more about the decentralized and centralized aspects of running crypto networks.

00:34:35.990 - 00:35:30.806, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Ronel. So we were just talking about how you started as a centralized service and now governance is in the hand of your token holders. And so I was so curious earlier today when I had trouble logging into the app. I was wondering because apps are typically run by centralized services and. I sent you a message saying, oh, hey, I'm having trouble logging in. And you said, oh, I'm going to ask the team. So I was wondering, is that a centralized company that you were referring to there? And is it a centralized company that's running this app on the decentralized protocol? Or is it because Ethereum has this foundation and the foundation funds these different teams working on different clients or whatever.
00:35:30.806 - 00:35:38.230, Speaker B: I mean, it can be outside companies too. So it's kind of curious what is centralized in Audius and what is decentralized?
00:35:38.830 - 00:36:37.738, Speaker A: Yeah, so there is a Audius foundation that controls the project's treasury and allocates those funds out to companies like my company. So there are a few other companies that now exist in the Audience ecosystem as well that get similar kind of grants from the foundation. But specifically, to your question and for everyone's context, this was around Twitter. OAuth. So there's a mechanism that Audience used to kind of prevent name squatters from registering en masse, like verified usernames on other platforms. The network will prevent you from registering a handle that is verified on Twitter or Instagram. So when Laura tried to sign up with her verified Twitter handle, the front end was like, you can't do that or whatever.
00:36:37.738 - 00:37:35.534, Speaker A: Right? So that is one aspect of the network's behavior that is centralized today. There are a couple others that I can mention, but it's not possible to authenticate with Twitter in a decentralized way. However, your wallet when using Audience is still custody with you, so your account is actually controlled by you. The only aspect of that flow that our company is able to affect is adding that checkmark next to your name. And the only way that that happens is if a user, either during sign up or afterwards, is able to authenticate with a verified account on another platform. That's one thing that we haven't really and it is a trade off of usability versus decentralization. So there are strategies that people use around this.
00:37:35.534 - 00:39:02.790, Speaker A: Like Keybase will have people tweet a message like, I'm setting up my let's be, let's be real here, right? Dead Mouse or Steve Aoki signs up for Audius and both of them use like, are they really going to tweet, I am setting up my Audius account, proving that I'm verified? Probably not. Right? So a trade off had to be made there. And then there are a couple of other places where kind of day to day engagement with the network touches some centralized services. So, for example, if you send audio tokens from your wallet, even though your wallet has custody and control of those tokens and the signature around the transactions happening on your browser, we have a relay that will pay the gas for that transaction on your behalf. So you could still transact if you put Ethereum into your wallet to send it. But the vast majority of our users don't know or understand things about crypto so I think where we've tried to make these trade offs is with the goal of usability in mind, but with a hard bright line around the network's. Functionality cannot be dependent on us as a central know, Laura, like you still could sign up for an account, you just wouldn't be verified.
00:39:02.790 - 00:39:30.722, Speaker A: For example, like if our company was not doing that little verification service, for example. Similarly, you could still send and engage with the tokens within the product, but the usability around it would be degraded, of course. So that's kind of how we went about it. Those are really the two primary things that are centralized right now, the remainder of the network. Yeah.
00:39:30.776 - 00:39:53.370, Speaker B: So when you said that you were going to ask your team, that was the centralized company that you were asking. And then so when you say there are other companies that are working on Audience, the protocol, then would there be cases where we might end up with more than one audience app or more than one audience website? Okay, that's a great question.
00:39:53.440 - 00:40:24.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm nodding for everyone listening. Yes. Actually, this isn't, I think as broadly known, or people are always shocked when I tell them this. The majority of listening on Audience doesn't come from the Audience product. I think there are over 50 apps now that exist in the ecosystem, some of which are dedicated music players, but many of them are just random other things. Like someone made this music racing game, which is super fun. I would recommend everyone try it.
00:40:24.424 - 00:40:26.070, Speaker B: What is music racing?
00:40:26.970 - 00:40:42.886, Speaker A: So you're in a race car following a track, and there are obstacles in the track that are synchronized with the beat of the music. So you sort of hear around them or you can get these bonuses by hitting them.
00:40:43.068 - 00:40:48.310, Speaker B: And is it only for songs or is it like some kind of algorithm so you can do it to any song?
00:40:48.390 - 00:40:59.646, Speaker A: Yeah, it's algorithmics. You can do it to any song. There are over half a million tracks on Audience. Right? So this developer was like, I've always wanted to make this game, but I never had enough tracks to do it with.
00:40:59.748 - 00:41:00.958, Speaker B: Sounds fun.
00:41:01.124 - 00:41:55.666, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyone can build their own audience app. There are even some kind of institutional players in the music ecosystem that want to build customized streaming experiences, for example. Right, or some artists are wanting to build kind of like a fan club structure around their streaming kind of front on audience. Yeah, it's a really neat ecosystem that's kind of sprung up around this. But yeah, the cool thing here is because any programmatic interaction that happens with the network from the core app that our team puts out can be replicated by or even co opted by any third party product too. Right? Like there's no special permissioning or something.
00:41:55.666 - 00:42:12.120, Speaker A: And when you use the Audius app on your phone, your phone is actually going and talking directly to nodes on the network. There's no interaction happening with our company for normal use of the product. Outside of the couple of exceptions that I mentioned.
00:42:14.490 - 00:42:18.794, Speaker B: It's like my Ether wallet or my crypto. Yes, exactly right.
00:42:18.832 - 00:42:23.610, Speaker A: Where those apps are able to talk directly to Ethereum and do what they need.
00:42:23.760 - 00:43:20.858, Speaker B: Well, it's funny actually that we're ending on this note because my next question is really relatable to this my Ether wallet session, my crypto thing. So when signing up, the service also sends an email to the user saying, audience cannot reset your password. By the way, I'm sure this is ultra confusing for non crypto people. I understood what you were saying, but I should just point out right underneath that is a big button saying reset my password or reset your password or whatever. So I was curious. So I didn't click it because I was like, this is like some emergency button and I'm not in an emergency, so I'm not going to click this right now. But I was curious, if I were to click it, what would happen? I'm assuming it's not something that goes through your company.
00:43:20.858 - 00:43:25.020, Speaker B: Well, I have no idea what goes on at that point.
00:43:25.550 - 00:44:59.226, Speaker A: What you're interacting with is this kind of novel account management solution that our team developed called Hedgehog, which is sort of a reference or homage to there's this parable of the Fox and the Hedgehog, right? And the Fox is quick and agile and can do many, many different things, whereas the hedgehog is only really good at becoming a ball and then it's spiky and predators can't get it. Right. So what we were trying to say with the parable there is like MetaMask is this amazing Swiss Army knife, but for an end user, it's very difficult to set up and use, whereas this Hedgehog solution is dead simple from a user's perspective. But it makes a significant number of trade offs that may or may not make it make sense in other applications. But we felt around Audius it made sense. So, long story short, what it does is when you sign up for Audius, you put in a username and password in the app, either on your phone or on desktop, and then your browser is actually using that input to encrypt a locally generated entropy that secures your wallet, basically, right? So there's locally generated private key encrypted locally with that data, and then that encrypted Blob is actually what gets emailed to you. That email that you get is actually a self contained ability to recover your account.
00:44:59.226 - 00:45:44.774, Speaker A: It's not even password reset per se, because you could just re encrypt the same wallet with a different thing. But we actually were able to set up a mail relay service with no logs enabled and no retention of the messages that it sends. So basically, that mail relay is your browser at the time you sign up, sends your key to this mail relay, which sends it to your email. And then that's effectively the backup of your private key is in that email. So it's literally like embedded in the link that when you click that button, could let you recover your account. Like if you forget your password. Basically calling it Password reset was a misnomer.
00:45:44.774 - 00:46:06.900, Speaker A: We actually have tried three or four different sets of verbiage on that button, but all of them confused users more than this one, which is why we kept it there. Even though it's not resetting your password. Right. It's like you can just set a new password on the same information. Yeah, people just got so confused by it.
00:46:07.830 - 00:46:31.974, Speaker B: I would suggest that the email sees something like audience, the company cannot reset your password. You can reset it yourself using this button or something, because to say Audience can't reset it, and then right underneath is a button saying reset it. I think just like from user experience, I'm not these things, but anyway, not like you don't have to.
00:46:32.012 - 00:47:31.754, Speaker A: No, you're absolutely right. And I think it just shows how challenging usability in crypto still is, right. The fact that the basic questions of how do you access your account don't have well accepted solutions that the whole world follows is like it's also so cool because it means that you're still super early to this if you're listening to this, right, and thinking about questions like this. Right. But we need to do better as a community, right? So Audience Today has over 6 million people listening every month and over 100,000 artists have uploaded. We do feel strongly that it would never have been possible to get to this level of usage without making some trade offs around. I think we can all agree that storing a private key in your email is not a super secure way to do that.
00:47:31.754 - 00:48:08.834, Speaker A: But we also go to great lengths to instruct users not to store any meaningful amount of funds in their audience wallet. And then there's also a mechanism to connect third party wallets. So you can connect a MetaMask wallet as well. You can connect a number of other anything that's like wallet connectable. Right. Again, there's trade offs, I think, with all of these things. But I think I am very proud of the work that our community has done to try to make this accessible to a broader audience.
00:48:08.834 - 00:48:19.498, Speaker A: Because the majority of users of Audience today have no idea there's any crypto there, which is pretty cool, right? They just want to come listen to cool music and hang out with their friends.
00:48:19.664 - 00:48:52.390, Speaker B: Yeah. And I have a bunch of questions for you about building a crypto product for non crypto people. But just because this is a crypto show. I do want to ask one question, because this is something I think my audience cares about for whatever reason, just how tribal crypto can be so obviously solana and think, you know, for a lot of people are seen as somewhat competitive, and you've kind of embraced both. And I was curious why that is. And just as a builder, what you thought Ethereum was good for, what Solana was good for, et cetera.
00:48:52.730 - 00:49:34.954, Speaker A: Totally. And at a super high level, I think this tribalism is really damaging. Unfortunately, these are tools, right? The Hammer tribe doesn't get mad at the Mallet tribe because one is slightly better at some things and one is slightly better at other things. Money is involved, I know, and I wish it could be that pure and straightforward, as I just put it. But that genuinely is how I, as a builder in the ecosystem, think about it. These are tools. They are built for a purpose and you can use them for various purposes.
00:49:34.954 - 00:50:28.114, Speaker A: And with that aside, I'll give the feedback that's probably going to get me flamed by both sides afterwards. Right. I think the network effect around Ethereum is just so powerful. And that's the first community in crypto that I really became part of and got excited about. Prior to Audius, I was a full time investor at Kleiner Perkins, and what really got me excited about crypto more broadly was this ability to program anything with you know, I like Bitcoin. I thought it was cool, but ethereum in my mind, just especially as a software engineer, thinking about it just opened up this whole world of really cool stuff you can make right. And the network effect around that persists.
00:50:28.114 - 00:51:31.514, Speaker A: Right. Everything from the ecosystem, around tokens and wallets and everything. The moment that the audience network launched, it was supported by hundreds or even thousands of third party applications without any of them asking us or us asking them to do anything right. Like just, you know, by contrast, I think, rather than trying to be everything to everyone, took the approach of being really damn fast and good at a specific set of use cases, which so happens to overlap really well with what audience needs, as well as it overlaps with some things like the CRM decks and other things. Right. From a usability perspective, solana lets us confirm things to users far, far faster. It lets us just do much more.
00:51:31.514 - 00:52:23.774, Speaker A: The average audience user never actually touches Ethereum, right? Like, if 6 million people were touching Ethereum every month from audience, I think we would be creating a lot of problems for the ecosystem. It would also probably be costing, know, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in gas. Right. So I think what I love about Solana is that by being focused, by know, we're not going to try and be everything to everyone, but we're going to be really great for the people who need a significant amount of scale or have usability constraints that Ethereum can't serve. It's a fantastic solution for that. Right. So I think they both have a place in this world, as do many other tools.
00:52:23.774 - 00:52:34.560, Speaker A: Keep in mind, these are tools and different tools can be good at different things. Right? That's where I'd finish off on.
00:52:35.010 - 00:52:59.830, Speaker B: All right, now let's talk about the user growth, because I do think, as you said, it's not obvious at all when you go to this website or the app that it's a crypto project. And I would be curious to hear, from your perspective, how did you get the community to grow to the point where you now have more than 6 million monthly users?
00:53:00.490 - 00:53:59.174, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the credit all lies with that very community. Right. Our little project team that built the first version of Audience and now has a much more diminished role in the ecosystem, just given the size and the scope of all the various work that's going on that the foundation supports and other things. For our little team of 20 people to be supporting 6 million users just would never have been possible without the community's kind of embrace and support and active work being done to do that. Right. I've been explaining this a lot to traditional tech people lately because, as I mentioned, that's, like, the world that I kind of came from before working on Audius, and people are just shocked when they hear that our team is so tiny. And we're not that tiny compared to other crypto projects.
00:53:59.174 - 00:54:29.120, Speaker A: Right. Like, everyone here listening knows that. But when the community is effectively the marketing team, the hosting team, and infrastructure team, they are like an extended developer team. There are more community people building with audience than there are people at my company. You can do so much more by opening up those floodgates. Right.
00:54:29.670 - 00:54:42.920, Speaker B: Were there any pivotal moments where you felt like, oh, that is what really got? Were there kind of like bursts of new users that came to the platform?
00:54:43.530 - 00:55:20.098, Speaker A: Yeah, so I can just talk quickly through our history. The product launched publicly in September of 2019, and that was in like an incentivized testnet capacity, right. From 2019 to mid 2020 or so, we grew in these little fits in starts, but we're mostly going sideways. Right. The thing that was growing was the base of content uploaded to the network, because content doesn't go away. Right. As new users come, they upload more content.
00:55:20.098 - 00:56:12.290, Speaker A: Content can grow linearly even if usage is, like, flat over time. Right. And in retrospect, I don't think we realized this at the time, but there was an inflection point that the network hit around like 80 to 100,000 tracks where there was enough music here. That when a random user showed up from the dance community, which was really where our early bread and butter in terms of usage was, they would find stuff that they liked, right. And then they would engage and they would stay and do more. Around August or so of 2020 was really when we saw those metrics all kind of shift in lockstep. And my only guess as to why that happened was because there was, like, enough content here from then.
00:56:12.290 - 00:56:54.486, Speaker A: So that was in August of 2020. There were around, I think, 100 to 120,000 monthly users on Audience. Today there are over 6 million. And it hasn't been that long since then. Right? I think it's just when a viral feedback loop around a kind of network driven product starts to work, it has this runaway effect, right, because it's self reinforcing. Like, if more content increases user engagement and retention, the increased user engagement and retention means more artists see that and say, oh, there's an audience here and I want to serve them. Which leads to more content, which then leads.
00:56:54.486 - 00:57:50.530, Speaker A: So it's like this virtuous cycle that kind of is self perpetuating, but it's really hard to get started. The analogy I like to give people is think about, like, pushing a rock up a hill and at some point you crest the hill and the rock starts rolling away and then you're just chasing it and doing the best you can to keep up with it, right. Because it goes faster and faster as it goes down. I think the community has been able to scale the level of support and work that they do for one another in a way that our company never could have. Right. And I think that's what allowed us to grow so quickly. If we had been a centralized company that controlled all this infrastructure, controlled all of this, even the cost of hosting all of this, let alone the cost of just basic customer support.
00:57:50.530 - 00:58:24.942, Speaker A: Like, people ask questions all the time and stuff. We would need to be like hundreds of people to service the amount of demand that exists here. I do think the community owned aspect of the network allowed growth to multiply and to reinforce itself. But ultimately, it's just the nature of a network, I think, that led to this. Right? It was just crossing over some critical mass or like a tipping point or whatever, however you want to describe it. At some point, things clicked and started.
00:58:24.996 - 00:58:42.900, Speaker B: Working for the big name artists on the platform, like Skrillex or Dead Mouse Diplo. Like, how did that happen? Did they just hear about it through word of mouth? Or did you approach them directly? Or how do you get these artists with this level of name recognition to.
00:58:45.850 - 00:59:32.062, Speaker A: You know, I'll talk about those three and then talk about artists more broadly. So Dead Mouse was actually one of our earliest supporters at Audience. We started talking to his team in late 2018. That was like a few months. Yes. So we got in touch with him and his team and he had specifically been looking for something around this. I mean, actually, one of the early theses, like, when we were thinking about Audius, was really looking at what Tidal did or tried to do early on, which was to say, we're going to make all of the artists that use Title like owners of Title.
00:59:32.062 - 01:00:14.738, Speaker A: They literally went and issued stock warrants to those early artists that were on Title, the early kind of target list that we went after because we took a lot of inspiration from that. Right. I think they fumbled a lot of things along the way. I'm hopeful that under new ownership, they can find their footing and find their way to some cool stuff. But dead mouse Joel was one of the earliest supporters of title. So I think when our little email intro crossed over their plate, they kind of pattern recognized, like, oh, we've seen this before. This is interesting.
01:00:14.738 - 01:01:07.966, Speaker A: We want to learn more. So, yeah, he was an interesting case. Skrillex and Diplo are more kind of the typical case, which is a mix of us messaging them for months and years or whatever, and then eventually they hear about it from enough of their own community of fans as well as other artists that they follow. Right. So a lot of neat content has broken out on Audience or been shared on Audius exclusively or for the first time. So a lot of folks were just forced to start engaging and hanging out on the platform, not necessarily uploading their own stuff, but just to stay on top of what trends are emerging. And this has always been like niche by niche, and those niches aggregate and slowly roll up to larger and larger audiences.
01:01:07.966 - 01:02:01.620, Speaker A: One of the earliest niches that got really excited about Audius was this Jersey Club community, which is like a specific they have a specific sound of music that they produce. There are a few really influential and notable folks in that community, like Rel and a couple of others that kind of anchor it. And a few of those really early folks just happened to come across some press. We got around the product launch, like, in 2019, and we're like, oh, this is cool. We're going to try it. And that was enough to get the whole community on and those people retained and engaged really well for a Diplo or a Skrillex, I think the sentiment that needs to exist for them to want to engage with a new product is that enough of their peers and enough of their fans are already there. Right? Yeah, we slowly rolled up to that.
01:02:01.620 - 01:03:04.578, Speaker A: And today most of our work on artist advocacy is just fielding inbound, which is just the tables turn very dramatically. Right. We stopped being able to do outreach, but in the early days, I would just sit in DM and cold email people and be like, please try this today. We just couldn't keep doing that given the scale that we were at. So even starting to rely on the community more to educate one another and advocate this more broadly more publicly. So our artist advocacy work today is really focused on helping audience appeal to new and different types of music creators and music listeners. So as I mentioned, our early user base has been mostly dance musicians.
01:03:04.578 - 01:03:56.040, Speaker A: There are a lot more folks in hip hop coming on now, and Latin music is the other area. We've seen a ton of growth more recently. A lot of that has been driven by kind of, I think, those communities being functionally similar in a lot of ways to the way dance communities are, right? It's less top down, structured, organized content and much more this grassroots things emerge from this diaspora of crazy things happening or whatever. And Audience is much more well suited, I think, to that kind of grassroots bottoms up sort of approach than the very top down institutionalized content kind of approach, right? Yeah.
01:03:56.730 - 01:04:11.920, Speaker B: So it's kind of amazing we went this far without getting into the TikTok deal. So we have to do that now because we're already overtime. So Audience was selected as TikTok's partner to enable song transfers on the platform. What does that mean and why is this such a big deal?
01:04:12.530 - 01:05:33.318, Speaker A: Yeah, so just setting some context to kick us off. It's actually not very easy to upload audio into TikTok. You'd be surprised the ways that people do it because how do you get an audio file, like an MP3 file or something, onto your phone, right? People will email it to themselves and then put it into the Files app on iOS and then, depending on your permissions, TikTok may or may not be able to access it. It's actually not very simple to a point that there are artists in our community that will hold their phone up to their laptop and play the track and record it into TikTok because it's easier to do that than to go through this rigmarole. So what the audience integration enables is a solution to this problem. So in Audius, on any track that you yourself uploaded, there's a one click share to TikTok button, and if you click that, the content gets pushed into your TikTok account. So basically, if you're using the Audius mobile app and then assuming that you have TikTok installed, it just opens TikTok and pushes the content over.
01:05:33.318 - 01:06:39.674, Speaker A: So the reason that's I think exciting for the audience network and community, right, is that it now, for the first time lets artists kind of draw on the audience that they have on TikTok. There are some folks in Audience, like Wookie, for example, and Dylan Francis is another one. I mean, there are people with millions of followers on TikTok, right, that they haven't been able to monetize very well to date. They now have a chance to kind of start to draw some of that audience over to Audius because the sound when it's in TikTok actually shows as, oh, it came from Audius and whatnot. So we actually, even as a result of that, there's been a significant kind of uptick in usage metrics just from people seeing those sounds starting to float around on TikTok. On the TikTok side, of things. I think the reason they were excited about this was it made it easier for artists to upload stuff.
01:06:39.674 - 01:07:15.000, Speaker A: And it's also worth saying we're not the only application that has that functionality. So, like, Ableton and some other sort of audio production tools have this natively as well. But we are the first streaming service to have it. So I think for the kind of average creator, this has been a much lower kind of friction way to get content into TikTok than to go into their Ableton and set up a new export and do all this sort of.
01:07:17.450 - 01:07:52.930, Speaker B: Know. Obviously, Audience doesn't have the artist base or even anywhere near the number of songs that like a Spotify or Apple Music has. And I did read you have close contacts, I guess, at TikTok, but I'm sure also you must have had something in your pitch that they found compelling or maybe it doesn't matter to them the number of songs that are available. Do you have a sense of what it was that appealed to them about choosing a platform that really is still so much smaller than these other ones that could have been selected?
01:07:53.750 - 01:08:40.226, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think a couple of things there. I don't think this is like a mutually exclusive sort of thing, right? Like TikTok is within their rights to enable other platforms to do it too. However, I don't think Spotify, for example, has the rights to redistribute content that's in Spotify. Right? So a lot of folks don't realize this. For everyone listening, you actually can't upload things to Spotify yourself. If you're a musician, you have to sign up for a third party distributor service and you give them your content and they push it into Spotify. So it would actually be the distributor's kind of role to push it into TikTok as well.
01:08:40.226 - 01:09:37.298, Speaker A: Not, you know, all that said, who knows, maybe they will strike some new licensing structure that allows them to do that. But in the case of Audience, the user who uploads and manages the account has the full control of that content. So if they are the ones, that's why only the person who uploaded it is able to actually push it into TikTok. That's the equivalent of them, like doing a drag and drop upload just directly to TikTok. It just so happens that TikTok doesn't really have a good user experience or workflow around. Yeah, I think it was just a matter of there aren't really I kind of referenced this earlier, like, Audience is some parts distributor, some parts streaming service. There's no other hybrid kind of approach that covers both sides.
01:09:37.394 - 01:09:58.060, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like because it's just a flatter structure. That's fascinating, actually. I mean, there's so many things about how crypto networks will change business models that I find really fascinating, but this is like a prime example. Okay, so we're well over time, but I just want to ask what's next for Audience? What do. You have up and coming over the next several months.
01:09:58.910 - 01:10:54.080, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's so much coming up and so much that I don't even know is coming up because there are just people in the community working on cool stuff. But the things that I'm personally most excited about at least, are monetization tools being much more fleshed out over the coming months. There's a lot of interesting stuff in the pipeline that will help artists better understand and segment their audience. So a lot of artists today just don't really have good answers to basic questions like, who are my fans? How do they find my content? Stuff like this. So all of that raw data exists in audience right now, but you need tools to be able to explore it and understand it. Think like bi tools for artists. So really excited about that as well.
01:10:54.080 - 01:11:46.880, Speaker A: And then, yeah, I think you're going to continue to see more and more artists in new and different genres or areas of music onboarding and getting excited. I think the best time is yesterday, but the next best time is today to get started on a new platform and building a new following. And yeah, you don't have to be a musician to use Audience. There's actually a very robust sort of curator ecosystem as well. So if you want to help make playlists, if you want to help curate content by reposting and engaging with it, there's a whole kind of ecosystem of folks on that side as well. So I think we're just going to see more of all of that, I guess. But yeah, the concrete features I mentioned are things that I'm super excited about.
01:11:46.880 - 01:11:47.902, Speaker A: Great.
01:11:47.956 - 01:11:52.030, Speaker B: Well, this has been so fun. Where can people learn more about you and audience?
01:11:52.610 - 01:12:25.066, Speaker A: Yeah, so you can learn more about Audius@audius.org or at Audius Co. So audience is kind know the information put out by the foundation. Audius Co is the company that I work on and there's a user experience there that lets you play with the product and engage and then, yeah, go follow the project on Twitter. It's just at Audius. A-U-D-I-U-S project. P-R-O-J-E-C-T.
