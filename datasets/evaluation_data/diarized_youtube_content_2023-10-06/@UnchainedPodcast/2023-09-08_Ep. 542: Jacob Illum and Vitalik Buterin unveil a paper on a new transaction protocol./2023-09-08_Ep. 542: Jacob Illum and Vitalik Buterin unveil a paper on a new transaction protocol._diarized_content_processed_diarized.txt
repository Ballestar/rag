00:00:00.410 - 00:00:31.702, Speaker A: Yeah. So association set providers is the concept of people that can assign some kind of properties to these deposits that are flowing into the pool. Right. If you are a regular user, you don't know who else might be using this privacy pool. You don't know where all the other deposits are coming from. So how do you pick and choose what you want to be part of and what you don't want to be part of? That's not going to be something an average user can do. You need kind of blockchain forensics or blockchain analytics kind of background and capability to be able to do that.
00:00:31.702 - 00:00:53.900, Speaker A: And so what we propose in the paper is that somebody that has that kind of capability could actually provide that insight. So they could, for instance, look at the blockchain, look at the deposits that are coming in and saying, hey, these deposits here appear to be coming from very legitimate sources and we are providing a set around those. So now everybody can use that.
