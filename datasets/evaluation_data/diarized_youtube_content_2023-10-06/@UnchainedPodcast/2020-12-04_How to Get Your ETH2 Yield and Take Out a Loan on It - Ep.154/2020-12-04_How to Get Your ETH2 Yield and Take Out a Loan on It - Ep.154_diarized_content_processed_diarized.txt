00:00:51.014 - 00:00:52.218, Speaker B: Welcome, James.
00:00:52.394 - 00:00:54.574, Speaker C: Hi there. Great to be with you.
00:00:54.772 - 00:00:56.874, Speaker B: The big news this week was Ethereum.
00:00:56.922 - 00:01:01.294, Speaker A: Two point zero's beacon chain launching, which happened on Tuesday, December 1.
00:01:01.412 - 00:01:03.226, Speaker B: As exciting as this was, it presents.
00:01:03.258 - 00:01:08.546, Speaker A: A little bit of a conundrum for people who may want to participate. How would you describe that challenge and.
00:01:08.568 - 00:01:10.900, Speaker B: How does Liquid Stake propose to solve it?
00:01:11.510 - 00:01:25.800, Speaker D: I guess the difficulty of the challenge is that as somebody stakes the Ether, they are unable to remove it for the next and we're not undetermined amount of time, but let's say it's 18 to 36 months.
00:01:26.170 - 00:01:27.866, Speaker C: So you don't have any access to.
00:01:27.888 - 00:02:10.390, Speaker D: That, but you are earning rewards as you're staking. And so what we did at Dharma Capital and Liquid Stake is basically just come up with an offering that enables people to stake through what I would just call world class validating service providers. And then we provide loans or a swap contract that enables them to then gain liquidity so they can continue to use that asset, let's say for DeFi projects or call it pay your rent. It just basically means that they're able to be able to stake and then be able to have liquidity.
00:02:11.130 - 00:02:17.590, Speaker A: And so walk me through how it works from the perspective of a customer who comes to Liquid Stake.
00:02:19.070 - 00:02:24.906, Speaker D: We have two different types of customers. The first Liquid Stake would be an.
00:02:24.928 - 00:02:29.478, Speaker C: Individual, and they want to stake.
00:02:29.574 - 00:02:46.834, Speaker D: They may or may not have chosen a service provider. And a service provider is a team that's created the software so that you can actually validate blocks. And so they would go into our.
00:02:46.872 - 00:02:55.334, Speaker C: Website, go through an AML KYC process after they're approved, then they would either.
00:02:55.372 - 00:03:03.750, Speaker D: Choose this validating service provider we've partnered with Bison Trails Consensus and Figment.
00:03:06.090 - 00:03:08.234, Speaker C: So they would send the Ether in.
00:03:08.432 - 00:03:11.414, Speaker D: We would stake it through that validating.
00:03:11.462 - 00:03:15.654, Speaker C: Service provider, and we would hold those keys.
00:03:15.782 - 00:03:26.110, Speaker D: I'll explain why we do that. And we would then go and stake the ether, go into the deposit contract, onto the Beacon.
00:03:28.770 - 00:03:29.086, Speaker C: Know.
00:03:29.108 - 00:03:47.734, Speaker D: So then it's Dharma or Liquid Stake, basically holding that ether and being responsible for all the validating of the blocks. And then from there they would go to a dashboard that would say, here's how much your assets are worth. And they would be able to then.
00:03:47.932 - 00:03:49.640, Speaker C: Gain a loan from that.
00:03:50.170 - 00:04:13.280, Speaker D: And how much can they take? 35%. Basically, over time, as the market moves, there'll either be a margin call or as the asset grows in value, let's say either from price or from additional accrual of rewards. Then they can take out additional monies if they want.
00:04:14.930 - 00:04:20.720, Speaker A: For that instance of when the dollar value of someone's stake drops below the amount that they've borrowed, what happens?
00:04:21.250 - 00:04:28.610, Speaker D: So that's the difficult part here. So as I was alluding to that, we hold the keys to the Ether.
00:04:29.030 - 00:04:31.346, Speaker C: So we have to be able to.
00:04:31.368 - 00:04:34.894, Speaker D: Do that so that we can actually control this staked Ether.
00:04:34.942 - 00:04:37.542, Speaker C: In the deposit contract, if the market.
00:04:37.596 - 00:04:48.694, Speaker D: Had dropped and we had sent out different margin call requests, the user was unable to supply any more collateral.
00:04:48.822 - 00:04:50.570, Speaker C: It would go through a liquidation.
00:04:51.070 - 00:05:12.240, Speaker D: And liquidation for this type of contract is a little bit different. And it does sound severe. And it's basically that if the market goes down to that level, we have an immediate liquidation event. And the reason for that is that.
00:05:12.770 - 00:05:14.706, Speaker C: The Ether is all locked up.
00:05:14.808 - 00:05:20.114, Speaker D: There isn't a trading market for this. And so once it touches that goes.
00:05:20.152 - 00:05:21.300, Speaker C: Down to that level.
00:05:21.830 - 00:05:27.282, Speaker D: What we're having to do is we're having to basically journal over those assets.
00:05:27.426 - 00:05:30.354, Speaker C: To our fund, meaning that we're purchasing.
00:05:30.402 - 00:05:36.870, Speaker D: Them and then we're in the open market potentially selling freely traded Ether.
00:05:37.290 - 00:05:39.094, Speaker C: So it's a little bit different than.
00:05:39.132 - 00:05:45.546, Speaker D: If you had a freely traded asset that goes down to the liquidation level. Then they're able to work it out.
00:05:45.568 - 00:05:47.494, Speaker C: A little bit easier.
00:05:47.542 - 00:05:51.550, Speaker D: Like you would see different prints on an exchange or over the counter.
00:05:52.130 - 00:05:54.670, Speaker A: So their entire stake is liquidated.
00:05:56.610 - 00:05:56.974, Speaker C: The.
00:05:57.012 - 00:06:27.190, Speaker D: Amount of whatever their loan is, basically. It's not that they lose their assets. When I say severe, I just mean that it happens immediately at that price level. But obviously we're only entitled to get paid back the loan amount. So it would just be that the rest, obviously would get delivered back to them once we reach Phase 1.5. Or basically Ether is able to be removed from the deposit contract.
00:06:28.110 - 00:06:32.330, Speaker A: Okay, so Dharma Capital gets the ETH. That is liquidated.
00:06:33.150 - 00:06:33.706, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:33.808 - 00:06:39.738, Speaker D: So we purchase that during that liquidation process.
00:06:39.904 - 00:06:46.990, Speaker A: And is that the main way that liquid stake and Dharma Capital are making money from this? Or do you also charge fees in addition?
00:06:48.050 - 00:06:53.826, Speaker C: Yeah, we don't expect to make much.
00:06:53.848 - 00:07:03.730, Speaker D: Money off of that on both sides of it. We're not looking to have all these great liquidation events.
00:07:04.550 - 00:07:17.330, Speaker C: I would say our perspective is that as East Two gets validated that's going to be very positive for Ethereum.
00:07:17.410 - 00:07:51.074, Speaker D: It's going to continue to grow the ecosystem. And I would assume that that would mean you'd have a market appreciation so rather than thinking that we're going to have a severe downturn, I think that this should actually, as this gets validated more and more, it will increase the value for us. We just charge an interest rate. So currently we're charging 13 and a half percent. The difference in how we're lending the.
00:07:51.112 - 00:07:54.946, Speaker C: Money is that typical lenders in the.
00:07:54.968 - 00:07:57.618, Speaker D: Market receive assets, they give out a.
00:07:57.624 - 00:08:00.262, Speaker C: Loan and they take those assets then.
00:08:00.316 - 00:08:12.266, Speaker D: And lend them out to somebody else and then they earn a rate off of that. For us, obviously, because these assets are all locked up into the contract can't be lent out, we're not doing that.
00:08:12.288 - 00:08:13.034, Speaker C: Other side of it.
00:08:13.072 - 00:08:27.600, Speaker D: So rehypothecation isn't occurring. Essentially what that just means is one, we don't have that other counterparty risk, but also we don't gain the benefits of being able to charge earn a reward interest rate off of that.
00:08:27.970 - 00:08:34.050, Speaker A: And how do you determine the price of ETH to both make a loan as well as to liquidate?
00:08:34.630 - 00:08:38.242, Speaker D: So obviously the biggest driver is the.
00:08:38.296 - 00:08:42.194, Speaker C: Cash market of Ether and what we.
00:08:42.232 - 00:08:56.982, Speaker D: Do is we take a discount to that cash market. So we use a 15% discount to that. What that is, is basically because the Ether isn't tradable and whoever does buy.
00:08:57.036 - 00:09:01.260, Speaker C: That has to hold it until phase 1.5.
00:09:01.710 - 00:09:17.514, Speaker D: There's these encumbrances on it. Currently that's what we do is we take the spot, discount it by 15% and then that's the value of the staked Ether collateral.
00:09:17.642 - 00:09:20.480, Speaker A: And how are you determining what the spot price is?
00:09:22.470 - 00:09:43.126, Speaker D: So what we do is we take the midpoint of four different exchanges. So we take Binance, Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken and we use that, the midpoint price, as the value for what Ether is trading at.
00:09:43.228 - 00:09:47.190, Speaker A: And what if there's like a flash crash or something on one of those exchanges?
00:09:48.490 - 00:10:14.930, Speaker D: If there is a flash every long tail event, it's part of what we have to look at. I mean, if all four of those exchanges all did go down to a low level, we would have to liquidate, I would say inherently in our structure because we have that immediate liquidation.
00:10:15.270 - 00:10:18.398, Speaker C: If it were to go down severely.
00:10:18.574 - 00:10:23.506, Speaker D: Let'S just say 99%, somebody's already been.
00:10:23.528 - 00:10:26.134, Speaker C: Liquidated much earlier than that, right?
00:10:26.172 - 00:10:37.654, Speaker D: They've been liquidated at that 15 point decline. So it is a risk actually that we take on for doing that.
00:10:37.852 - 00:10:40.666, Speaker C: But obviously if we saw something where.
00:10:40.688 - 00:10:45.370, Speaker D: It was like this in few seconds and basically comes up, that's something that.
00:10:45.520 - 00:10:48.394, Speaker C: We'Ll have to look at as what.
00:10:48.432 - 00:10:49.500, Speaker D: Goes on in the market.
00:10:50.590 - 00:11:08.162, Speaker A: So in a moment we're going to discuss the institutional offering. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:11:29.766 - 00:11:34.490, Speaker A: What types of institutions can stake using liquid stake? And Dharma Capital.
00:11:35.310 - 00:12:29.606, Speaker D: An institution under the CFTC guidelines is called an ECP. An Eligible Contract Participant. And it basically equates to a similar idea of what accredited investors are. And the institutions, from a jurisdiction standpoint, obviously, as long as it's not a restricted jurisdiction, any institution would be able to participate. Dharma goes through the process of reporting to the regulators. We use the CME's swap data repository as a way that we supply all that data to the CFTC. And I would say that the differences of why one might use liquid stake versus Dharma Capital is that we offer to the institutions a swap contract.
00:12:29.798 - 00:12:34.542, Speaker C: And so swaps have been around for a number of years, and they have.
00:12:34.596 - 00:12:38.810, Speaker D: Good clarity on regulatory and tax treatment.
00:12:38.970 - 00:12:42.000, Speaker A: Can you define what a total return swap is?
00:12:42.390 - 00:13:00.178, Speaker D: A total return swap is essentially just you have two counterparties, one's paying a return, and the other one is paying, let's call it a competing return, and the net of those two makes the payment flows.
00:13:00.354 - 00:13:07.266, Speaker C: So in this scenario, you would have that someone is staking their ether, let's.
00:13:07.298 - 00:13:09.178, Speaker D: Say, paying an interest rate on a.
00:13:09.184 - 00:13:12.780, Speaker C: Loan amount so that's their pay side.
00:13:13.550 - 00:13:34.770, Speaker D: From the Dharma Capital side, we're paying out the return of the ether staked. And so what we do is essentially just have that contract, those two payments net out each other, and we obviously assume that there will be a larger amount of payment out of the rewards that are earned from staking.
00:13:35.590 - 00:13:43.170, Speaker A: And you mentioned that there's more tax and regulatory clarity for these total return swaps. Can you describe.
00:13:45.830 - 00:13:51.974, Speaker D: The obviously staking and rewards is a very new topic for.
00:13:52.092 - 00:13:56.998, Speaker C: Treasury, IRS, and so there's a lot.
00:13:57.004 - 00:14:00.746, Speaker D: Of different groups within the community. I would say one, the proof of.
00:14:00.768 - 00:14:04.726, Speaker C: Stake association, Posa has been called leading.
00:14:04.758 - 00:14:07.690, Speaker D: The charge of being able to help define that.
00:14:07.840 - 00:14:12.554, Speaker C: And today, as you stake, it isn't.
00:14:12.602 - 00:14:14.494, Speaker D: Actually clear that if you move from.
00:14:14.532 - 00:14:18.926, Speaker C: Ether one to ether two, is that a taxable event? Right?
00:14:19.028 - 00:14:27.300, Speaker D: So you can just imagine people owning ether at a dollar. That's a huge impact if that becomes a taxable event.
00:14:27.670 - 00:14:28.770, Speaker C: Additionally.
00:14:30.470 - 00:14:55.798, Speaker D: When are rewards treated as income or are they treated as income even? So, is it as you earn them the next taxable year or when you dispose of them again, there isn't clarity today. That was really the genesis from the institutional side of why we came up with the swaps.
00:14:55.974 - 00:15:00.060, Speaker C: It was basically to say, we can take that on.
00:15:01.010 - 00:15:09.598, Speaker D: And for Dharma Capital, we're based in Puerto Rico, so we actually don't have a capital gains tax.
00:15:09.764 - 00:15:15.346, Speaker C: And so we're able to take on that side of the risk and then.
00:15:15.368 - 00:15:19.010, Speaker D: We provide that format to the institution.
00:15:19.750 - 00:15:26.280, Speaker A: And why did you decide on USDC as the stablecoin that your loans will be denominated in?
00:15:26.730 - 00:16:03.522, Speaker D: And I would say today it is USDC. We're definitely looking at other ways of providing the financing for us. It's really been a lot from a regulatory perspective. Everything that drives us is first what's the regulatory clarity and then we start to look at the asset itself. So USDC, we felt very comfortable. I would just say that it hasn't been clear. And with Tether, so even though it has a larger market cap and maybe.
00:16:03.576 - 00:16:06.626, Speaker C: Used more, it was easier for us.
00:16:06.648 - 00:16:09.278, Speaker D: To do that with our funding groups.
00:16:09.454 - 00:16:11.986, Speaker A: And so what other stablecoins are you.
00:16:12.008 - 00:16:16.086, Speaker C: Looking at adding potentially there may be.
00:16:16.108 - 00:16:40.438, Speaker D: Something with MakerDAO and Dai. I would also say given call it the Stable Act and things that are going on there, I assume we'll see a lot more banks being involved in the stablecoin market. We actually have an initiative that is enabling banks to do this that we'll be bringing online.
00:16:40.624 - 00:16:43.614, Speaker C: And so I think that you'll have.
00:16:43.652 - 00:16:55.314, Speaker D: Those kinds of stable coins being issued more from federally chartered institutions versus people spinning up a different kind of just a stable coin group.
00:16:55.432 - 00:16:55.714, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:55.752 - 00:17:07.218, Speaker A: And just to be clear, for listeners, the Stable Act was just proposed by Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. And yes, it would put a lot of different requirements on stablecoin issuers, but.
00:17:07.304 - 00:17:09.026, Speaker B: It'S just a bill, it's just a proposal.
00:17:09.058 - 00:17:23.500, Speaker A: At this point, nothing's been passed aside from liquid stake and other centralized solutions. There are also decentralized ways for people to get a loan on their staked. E two, what are the pros and cons of a centralized solution over a decentralized one?
00:17:24.510 - 00:17:27.580, Speaker C: And we looked at how to solve this.
00:17:28.590 - 00:18:08.026, Speaker D: Obviously we were looking at this well before the Genesis block. And so it was essentially how do we ensure that we reach that 259,000 ether to launch Genesis? We looked at this and saying, okay, we know that the time period is going to be a year and a half, maybe it's three years. So in my mind it would be a shortened trade and how to just help facilitate people to get in. And that's where we just said here's a centralized solution, it enables people to.
00:18:08.048 - 00:18:13.446, Speaker C: Be able to stake early and can go forward. That centralized.
00:18:13.558 - 00:19:16.350, Speaker D: I would say basically it got us to market quickly the decentralized versus centralized side of things. So Dharma is a regulated entity and so for us to touch decentralized type of products is basically non existent, minus our underlying asset itself. And so as we work with different institutions again, it becomes for them to be able to invest in these types of products makes it more difficult. So as you have different decentralized products, it's great from, I would say, the individual community being able to have different choices on how can I get this done? As we have different groups that are much larger institutions, being involved in the market again, having that regulatory clarity, being able to invest in certain types of assets.
00:19:18.610 - 00:19:20.126, Speaker C: It was fairly easy for us.
00:19:20.148 - 00:19:21.822, Speaker D: To say, well, great, here we have.
00:19:21.876 - 00:19:25.038, Speaker C: A standard swap contract that, you know.
00:19:25.124 - 00:19:28.570, Speaker D: It'S under an ISDA agreement through open law.
00:19:28.740 - 00:19:32.414, Speaker C: Very, almost very commonplace.
00:19:32.462 - 00:19:33.794, Speaker D: Just the underlying is different.
00:19:33.912 - 00:19:37.380, Speaker A: And what does that mean, an ISDA agreement through Open law?
00:19:38.170 - 00:19:52.086, Speaker D: Sorry, so I'm a derivative head, so I skip a lot of those type of things. So ISDA is the International Swap Dealers Association agreement.
00:19:52.198 - 00:19:54.714, Speaker C: And so you can look at this.
00:19:54.752 - 00:20:05.850, Speaker D: As lots of swap dealers have gotten together and standardized a document that drives this swap agreement. So that ISDA.
00:20:08.050 - 00:20:08.858, Speaker C: I don't know, it's.
00:20:08.874 - 00:20:23.458, Speaker D: Probably 40, 50, 60 pages. That agreement basically is a driver for everybody to start from a common ground and then obviously the terms are changed. What we've done with Open Law is.
00:20:23.544 - 00:20:28.374, Speaker C: That OpenLaw is a group that has.
00:20:28.412 - 00:21:03.630, Speaker D: Been codifying legal agreements. So it's basically taking all of those terms and then you can have smart contract functionality. I-E-A margin call if price hits here and it can be driven right off of the contract. And so Aaron Wright, who had set up, has been fantastic. We've put together a great structure that drives this from an onboarding process and then an ongoing process with what the agreement writes.
00:21:04.150 - 00:21:13.540, Speaker A: And there are other crypto systems that you are partnering with, Filecoin, Figment Networks. And Luca, can you just briefly describe how you're using those as well?
00:21:13.910 - 00:21:19.110, Speaker D: So what we reference as VSPs validating service providers.
00:21:19.530 - 00:21:23.170, Speaker C: So today we work with Bison Trails.
00:21:23.330 - 00:21:51.678, Speaker D: Consensus's, Codify, and figment for that software that actually stakes the ether. So they're the ones that are really managing that process of validating blocks. And we've already even seen not from those three, but we've already seen slashing events occur because people have been trying to validate on the ETH chain and.
00:21:51.764 - 00:21:54.686, Speaker C: Basically had tried to propose two blocks.
00:21:54.718 - 00:22:25.482, Speaker D: At the same time. We work with filecoin. Filecoin basically takes the Open law agreements and then puts an encrypted hash onto their network. And in addition to that, we actually have a swap facility for Filecoin and it's basically to help encourage miners to be able to borrow Filecoin because today.
00:22:25.616 - 00:22:28.042, Speaker C: The rates are astronomically high.
00:22:28.096 - 00:22:45.282, Speaker D: And so we basically are trying to help that network to continue growing and not be so expensive. Another partner of ours is Luca. Luca really has been driving a ton.
00:22:45.336 - 00:22:48.962, Speaker C: Of our regulatory reporting side of things.
00:22:49.016 - 00:23:28.298, Speaker D: And that's basically, again, as we start to touch all of these different regulatory issues, they've just been key for helping us in navigating that. And I would have to absolutely say that probably one of the biggest partners that we've leaned on a lot is balance our custodian. And I actually think to my knowledge, they're the only ones in North America that are able to hold the BLS keys, the withdrawal keys in the deposit contract. For US staking, Ether is a little bit more complicated.
00:23:28.394 - 00:23:32.542, Speaker C: You have this validator key, you have.
00:23:32.596 - 00:23:46.514, Speaker D: The withdrawal key and that withdrawal key obviously isn't going to be touched for the next year and a half to three years or so. So they have also been phenomenal in helping with us.
00:23:46.712 - 00:23:58.950, Speaker A: Liquid Stake is not registered with the CFTC, nor is it a member of NFA, the self regulatory organization for the US. Derivatives industry. How are you able to do this from a regulatory.
00:24:02.890 - 00:24:23.418, Speaker D: So Dharma Capital issues? So those derivatives, they all come from Dharma Capital liquid stake isn't entering into any swaps. They are basically just loan contracts to individuals.
00:24:23.594 - 00:24:28.802, Speaker C: So we make sure to, I guess.
00:24:28.856 - 00:24:50.166, Speaker D: Call it bifurcate, which is the counterparties and the loan documentation or the swap documentation. And then what we do is we provide these USDC loans in jurisdictions where it doesn't have to be a registered.
00:24:50.278 - 00:24:54.938, Speaker A: Entity and how much money has been staked via Liquid stake so far.
00:24:55.104 - 00:25:23.170, Speaker D: So we won't start lending until the 15th. And so currently it's just been Dharma putting Ether in to be a part of the Genesis block. But what we've done is we've allocated $50 million to the lending facility and that'll be a component both of swap and loan contracts.
00:25:23.990 - 00:25:24.882, Speaker B: All right, great.
00:25:24.936 - 00:25:27.590, Speaker A: Well, it's been great having you on Unconfirmed.

The Ethereum 20 beacon chain, launched after years of anticipation, ushering in the blockchain's next era. The beacon chain launch is phase zero of Ethereum's multistep upgrade to a more scalable blockchain. There are still many technical hurdles to surpass including Sharding and Rollup adoption before the chain will be fully operational. However, as of press time there are almost 1 million ETH staked, almost double the number that were required for the launch. If you're wondering about Staking's risks and rewards for Staking One ETH validators are currently earning around zero point 14 ETH per month or $8.50
00:26:22.738 - 00:27:20.038, Speaker B: with the amount expected to decrease as the number of participants rises. However, any Ether staked on the chain will be locked up for months and potentially even years. Staking also entails software risks as well as the possibility that you could lose your initial deposit if you fail to keep up with the network. Despite some suggestions that current DFI rewards may be a better bet, exchanges are already intending to support Ethereum Two staking. Coinbase has announced it will support East Two staking and trading to eligible jurisdictions starting early next year while also allowing customers to convert east to East Two and earn Staking rewards. Finance likewise announced an ETH Two Staking service that would be live on December 2, with daily rewards distributed in the form of beast tokens.

00:27:20.038 - 00:28:21.600, Speaker B: Chainalysis attributed the rise to institutional investors purchasing steadily over time and then taking the money off exchanges to hold. An analysis by CoinMetrics beginning in November illustrated that the recent upwards price movements have been occurring mostly during US market hours. Further supporting thesis that institutional investors are the ones pushing the price up. When tracking the bitcoin price against notable events of institutional interest such as microstrategies and square's purchases of bitcoin PayPal's, integration of bitcoin and well known traditional investors bill Miller and Stan Druckenmiller expressing confidence in bitcoin, a clear trendline emerges. Another data point showing or supporting theory that institutional investor interest is driving the price up is that there is a lack of public interest in bitcoin compared to late 2017. The amount of bitcoin related tweets is far below levels at that time and has been relatively flat for the last two years. Media mentions and searches are also at lower levels than during the previous bull run.
00:28:21.600 - 00:29:22.638, Speaker B: Neil Ferguson, writing in Bloomberg, cited the pandemic as a catalyst for increased adoption in bitcoin this year. He noted that the explosion of stimulus dollars underscored bitcoin's value due to its scarcity, and he said that this was all happening already amidst a shift towards digital payments. He went on to say that the incoming biden administration should not seek to develop a quote, Chinese style digital dollar, but instead quote should recognize the benefits of integrating bitcoin into the US.

Stablecoins in particular have more than tripled in 2020, with Stormac citing DFI and Tether collateralized derivatives as main factors. A study by Blockchain Capital survey by Blockchain Capital also shows increasing awareness and adoption among the general public. More than one in three Americans interviewed said they're likely to buy bitcoin in the next five years, and 41% of Americans found it likely that most people will be using bitcoin in the next ten years.

Circle co founder and CEO Jeremy Alair responded to the news on Twitter, saying quote Forcing crypto fintech and blockchain companies into the enormous regulatory burdens of Federal Reserve and FDIC regulation and supervision is inconsistent with the goals of supporting innovation in the fair and inclusive delivery of payments that comes from Stablecoins. Next headline visa Partners with Circle Internet Financial to Connect to USDC. Next year, Visa's Card network of 60 million merchants will be connected to stablecoin USDC. Visa will be the first corporate card to allow businesses to spend a balance of USDC. Visa does not plan to custody the Stablecoin at this time, although effective immediately. Circle will begin working with Visa to integrate USDC software with its platforms.
00:31:18.446 - 00:32:24.022, Speaker B: According to Visah head of crypto Kui Sheffield, quote we continue to think of Visa as a network of networks. Blockchain networks and stablecoins like USDC are just additional networks. So we think that there's a significant value that Visa can provide to our clients, enabling them to access them and enabling them to spend at our merchants.
