00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.680, Speaker A: Bitcoin, which is flirting with its biggest weekly gain in almost two years. We've been in the bear market for almost 18 months now.
00:00:08.370 - 00:00:11.710, Speaker B: Name a date. Don't name a price. Name a price, don't name a date.
00:00:11.780 - 00:00:22.910, Speaker C: Science of a bull market or bull trap. Bitcoin serving 34% since last Friday for its best week since January 2021. All right, where do you think the crypto markets will go for the rest of the year?
00:00:22.980 - 00:00:30.434, Speaker D: What I'm really hopeful in the crypto markets is that first of all, they're going to break the correlation with the TradFi markets.
00:00:30.482 - 00:00:45.462, Speaker C: The year started off with an upward trend in crypto prices. However, the collapses of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the last couple weeks, plus the continued concern about the banking system, have really supercharged the markets. Does all this mean the end of crypto winter?
00:00:45.526 - 00:01:05.742, Speaker E: I think if the macro markets do not go crazy or something catastrophic doesn't happen, like Fed increasing rates again, which looks highly unlikely, I think it will be like stabilized and we will have slow kind of movement upwards itself. That's what I feel. Not financial advice, of course.
00:01:05.796 - 00:01:07.650, Speaker C: What can we expect in 2023?
00:01:07.720 - 00:01:20.454, Speaker B: So I'm going to go ahead and say I think we end the year somewhere between 20 to 40K for Bitcoin, so I think we're going to stay fairly flat. Don't see any huge new inflows coming into the crypto space this year.
00:01:20.492 - 00:01:32.762, Speaker A: In the next few months, we probably retest the base with rates looking to go higher and things looking a bit edgy with events like Silvergate, but otherwise I remain bullish and think we'll recover in the second half of the year.
00:01:32.816 - 00:01:57.538, Speaker D: I have always been very uncomfortable with the idea that major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum trade up and down with the Nasdaq or with the S and P 500, that if they are an alternative system, they should be an alternative system. And guess what? That's exactly what we're starting to finally see in the last couple of weeks as people are starting to see crypto go up. Why the TradFi market struggles? That's good.
00:01:57.624 - 00:02:14.914, Speaker B: I think retail, we've seen some action around the recent price movement and the debanking in the United States, but we haven't seen any major institutional flows materialize and I don't see any new onramps materializing that are going to drive large scale, multibillion dollar institutional flows.
00:02:14.962 - 00:02:26.822, Speaker E: I think Q Four, when the next Harboning is going to come in and all that, all those things, those conversations start happening, then I think we can probably start going back to normal.
00:02:26.886 - 00:02:45.314, Speaker C: We're also coming off 2022, which was one of the most tumultuous years for crypto. Still, 89% of American crypto users have not lost their trust in Intermediaries to hold their digital assets. This includes banks, exchanges and mobile payment apps, according to a survey conducted by Paxos in early 2023.
00:02:45.432 - 00:03:05.314, Speaker A: I think you can see there's been a lot of washout of negativity over the last year and a lot of the large positionings out and the market's really set for a lot of consolidation. And that consolidation phase means we probably would go higher on the back of things like release of heat, staking, et cetera.
00:03:05.442 - 00:03:19.838, Speaker D: Yeah, this is somewhat encouraging, what I've been seeing out of crypto that it is starting to show that it is something more than just a three Xqqq ETF, which is unfortunately what it looked a lot like in 21 and 22.
00:03:19.964 - 00:03:21.806, Speaker B: Money, say, going back to normal. What do you mean?
00:03:21.908 - 00:03:35.710, Speaker E: Normal means like good projects, doing good work, their price discovery and their communities are more happier. Instead of everything going to imploding almost.
00:03:35.780 - 00:03:40.830, Speaker C: What do you think is going to happen in the crypto markets over the next several months? Let us know in the comments.
