00:00:00.170 - 00:00:56.860, Speaker A: So the charges I think there are seven counts. There's charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud with respect to customers of FTX, defrauding customers out of their funds. There are charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud as to Lenders on Alameda, that is, lenders of Alameda, the sort of affiliate, the trading affiliate of FTX. The exchange there are charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud on investors of FTX, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud on customers of FTX and money laundering. Conspiracy charge conspiracy to commit money laundering as to funds that were misappropriated from FTX customers. Now, in terms of where do I think the government's case is the strongest? I would say that that is with respect to the fraud charges on customers.
