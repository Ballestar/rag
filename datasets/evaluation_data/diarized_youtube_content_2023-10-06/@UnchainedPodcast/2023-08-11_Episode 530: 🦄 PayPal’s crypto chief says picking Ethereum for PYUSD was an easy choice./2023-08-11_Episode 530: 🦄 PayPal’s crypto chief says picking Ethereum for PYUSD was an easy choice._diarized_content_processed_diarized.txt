00:00:00.170 - 00:00:54.654, Speaker A: The very beginning of the process we had to think, hey, we're going to go to open source protocols and traditional permissionless environments or do we want to do something that is proprietary? And we very quickly went the open way because as we have said in the past, we believe that you follow developers. You don't tell developers what to do, they tell you what to do. And it was a very clear decision to go to Ethereum because the developer community was already there. The way that Pyusd was designed is to be multi chain. So there is absolutely no reason why we would not do other protocols later or other layers on the same protocols later. Ethereum has many advantages, also has obviously higher fees than some other protocols that for some use cases like we said in terms of micro payments or high speed, high throughput could be expensive. So we will definitely expand from there.
00:00:54.654 - 00:00:57.770, Speaker A: But Ethereum was the clearly first choice to deploy.
