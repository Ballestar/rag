00:00:00.330 - 00:00:25.762, Speaker A: Incredible news. The FTX creditor list is out. This is like the release of a Taylor Swift album for people who have never heard of Taylor Swift because she doesn't yet have an NFT. In a court filing from Wednesday, FTX's Financial Advisors released the lists of all the companies that were owed money by FTX. This does mark the first time in history that Santa doesn't have to compile his own naughty list. He can just use FTX's. The list includes companies like Apple, Netflix, and WeWork.
00:00:25.762 - 00:00:50.922, Speaker A: I know, right? You thought that the $15,000 an hour shaman was the worst financial decision Adam Newman ever made. The airlines were not safe either. American, Southwest, and Spirit Airlines are all owed money from FTX. I, for one, cannot possibly believe that Spirit Airlines is about to have less money. They're going to have to start charging for flights. Also included on the list of creditors, giselle's Charitable foundation. Giselle was famously invest in FTX.
00:00:50.922 - 00:00:59.420, Speaker A: And I bet you $10, which I have to gamble because I was not invested in FTX, that SBF releases a substac about it. And the main photo on the post is this one.
