00:01:15.246 - 00:01:17.300, Speaker B: Hi there. Nice to be back with you.
00:01:17.770 - 00:01:25.910, Speaker A: What I didn't say when I introduced you is that this week you announced a new venture. Why don't you tell everyone about the new company you're founding?
00:01:26.410 - 00:02:05.410, Speaker B: Avanti bank is a company that's been formed to apply for a Wyoming special purpose depository institution license. Under the law that was passed last year in Wyoming to create a new type of bank to service the digital asset industry. It will be a 100% reserve bank, and it will provide custody services for digital assets. There are several products that this new type of license will enable that the market currently is not providing and that will hopefully help bring more and more investors, especially institutional investors, into crypto assets.
00:02:05.830 - 00:02:12.520, Speaker A: And when you talk about those products and services that are not being offered, what are you thinking of? What will your bank offer?
00:02:13.210 - 00:03:05.570, Speaker B: The most obvious example, which a number of folks have noted is something missing from the market right now, is a particular type of legal regime for security token custody right now. When the SEC came out with its joint guidance with FINRA last year, it noted that under the SEC customer protection rule, it's required that the custodian have what's called a good control location. But the SEC has not defined what that means. However, it did note that under the customer protection rule, a bank has a safe harbor for good control location. The challenge in the United States is that FDIC insured banks are not allowed to provide custody services for digital assets. So it was a perfect catch 22. The only way to get good control location is with a bank.
00:03:05.570 - 00:03:21.054, Speaker B: And yet banks couldn't provide the custody services. Well, now a particular type of bank that being a Wyoming special purpose depository institution is allowed to, and we just need to get through the process along with a couple of others who are applying as well.
00:03:21.172 - 00:03:23.680, Speaker A: And what does good control location mean?
00:03:24.130 - 00:04:11.610, Speaker B: It just has to do with the custodian having control over the asset. Actually, the question you're asking is exactly the question everyone else is asking with regard to a digital asset, what does it mean? And the SEC hasn't explained it. It just said that a bank has a safe harbor for it. And it turns out that trust companies do not qualify as banks under the definition of bank. They are excluded from the securities exchange act of 34. And there are requirements that to be a bank, you have to, number one, take deposits, and number two, provide fiduciary services. Well, trust companies aren't doing either because it turns out, unless they're also doing something else, that custody of digital assets is not a fiduciary service.
00:04:11.610 - 00:04:52.620, Speaker B: And because trust companies aren't banks, they can't take deposits. So it was a perfect catch 22 in the regulations where the regulators in DC were all pointing at each other saying it's their responsibility and Wyoming is the one that stepped forward and broke through. I saw lots of attempts, by the way, over the fall to form these SPDIs. The applications for the licenses opened October 1, and this got a lot of fanfare. About a year ago when it became law, more than 100 people, according to the Wyoming banking division, inquired about starting one of these. Most of them fell away. And a lot of the reason for it was that the capital requirement is so high.
00:04:52.620 - 00:05:12.240, Speaker B: A bank has a very high capital requirement. And as a result, what I started to see was that it wasn't going to happen if someone didn't step up and kind of do it. As a consortium for the industry, this is a need that needed to be filled, but the individual protocol projects were not in and of themselves willing to step up and fund it.
00:05:13.250 - 00:05:36.120, Speaker A: That's interesting. And when you say a lot of these things haven't even been defined yet for the digital asset industry, I think it's great that in a way you can be pioneering and help standards with this because Wyoming is your home state, so it's very fitting. So one other question I want to ask you was, who do you expect your customers to be?
00:05:36.650 - 00:06:28.882, Speaker B: Well, for Avanti, we're going after the institutional market. There are a couple of others that are hanging around the hoop in Wyoming who are going after the retail market, and we hope to be able to do some things with them if we all make it through the process and get our licenses. But there wasn't anybody stepping up for the institutional market, which is where I saw a need. And in particular, the best example is the universities that would like to receive digital asset gifts from alumni but are not in a position to accept them because there isn't a third party that's willing to work with them to provide the services that they need. For example, in the US. Under the custody rule, asset managers are required by law to have a third party store their assets. The management of the assets has to be separated from the custody of the assets.
00:06:28.882 - 00:06:38.490, Speaker B: And again, the big custodians are FDIC insured banks. So as a result, we're in that catch 22 where there was a log jam that needed to be broken.
00:06:39.630 - 00:06:58.514, Speaker A: So I was going to ask you who your competitors would be, but I realized in a way maybe it's that you're sort of forming a new category or would you say because I guess Coinbase does serve some institutions right with Coinbase custody and stuff like sure, sure.
00:06:58.712 - 00:08:05.282, Speaker B: I think the difference is the definition of institution. There are a lot of folks in the crypto world who look at a small $25 million crypto fund and say that's an institution. And technically it is. But what I'm looking at is the markets that I came from earlier in my career, the pension funds, the endowments, the foundations, the sovereign wealth funds, these are the really big money investors for whom the asset class up until this point has actually just been too small and not investable well. Now we're getting to the point where to the extent that bitcoin does continue to go up, it becomes a bigger asset class. It starts to become too big to ignore and then they start looking around and saying where's the infrastructure? One of the other points that I've noticed is that the institutional infrastructure in this market isn't ready for primetime with these very big traditional big asset owner institutions. Again, it's more aimed at the smaller, more risk taking institutions like hedge funds or small funds that already exist.
00:08:05.282 - 00:08:40.670, Speaker B: And most folks, when they say there are institutions in crypto, that's what they mean. Again, the big guys really are not there. They have a much higher standard of professionalism that they require. And when I looked around at the folks that are serving the institutional market right now, first of all, they're trust companies from a regulatory perspective. And there are two issues with trust companies for the big investors. One is that they're not directly connected to the Fed because they're not banks. And there's a reason why State Street and bank of, you know, in the securities industry are banks.
00:08:40.670 - 00:09:31.518, Speaker B: They're connected to the Fed and that's what the institutions want to see. And then the other is that the trust companies are that you don't know what your status in bankruptcy is. And again, this is another one of the reasons why the banks win from a regulatory perspective. But there's also another issue that I started looking at the terms and conditions of the folks that are serving the institutional market right now. And to be honest, in some cases it's a joke. There's one that's serving the institutional market that defines bitcoin as, quote, a digital asset. If they all of a sudden wake up and decide that bitcoin is suddenly bitcoin cash and the customers go to sue them, they would have no claim in court because the contract was so vaguely drafted, there was really nothing promised.
00:09:31.518 - 00:10:31.874, Speaker B: The fork policy is another one where I was looking at one again, institutional firm and the fork policy said that they had in their sole discretion the ability to follow a fork, if any. And again, what's the legally enforceable promise in the language there? There's nothing. So when an institutional attorney, and again I'm talking about a pension fund type of attorney, starts looking at the terms and conditions in the contract, they're going to say, look, that's not even close to the standards that I need. And lastly, there's another piece of this. You alluded to it in your question. Wyoming defined the status of digital assets. Under Wyoming's commercial law, we're the only state to have done that and therefore we're the only state that would be allowed to start a bank because you have to know what the status of those assets would be in a legal dispute.
00:10:31.874 - 00:11:14.610, Speaker B: And again, this gets back to institutions needing to have clear rights and obligations in the transactions. And if you don't know what the status of the asset class is in a legal dispute, you're taking a lot of risk that a judge is going to determine a lawsuit against you rather than in your favor. And institutions just can't take that risk. They also can't take the bankruptcy risk. And again, if a judge doesn't know what the exact status of the assets are under the law, then you don't know what your outcome is going to be in bankruptcy. So all these things are important building blocks that had to get put in place before we really go primetime.
00:11:15.430 - 00:11:42.042, Speaker A: Yeah. So we're going to dive a little bit more into some of the regulations that made this possible as well as some of the technical details. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto law is run by crypto OGS in New York who understand crypto and fintech. They were already operating in the space back in 2013 and they accept crypto as payment. One of the partners, Zachary Kellman, is known for drafting a bill submitted to the US. Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting onchain bitcoin transactions from US.
00:11:42.042 - 00:12:23.898, Speaker A: Regulations. The other founding partner, his brother Daniel Kelman, became well known in the crypto law space for his work in the Mount Gox civil rehabilitation. So if you operate a fintech business or have a dispute with some person or business involving crypto, or you just need legal advice related to crypto, info at kelman law, that's Kelman law. Or just go to their website at WW crypto law. When you think crypto, think Kelman are you interested in getting into the cryptocurrency markets but don't know where to start building your portfolio?

00:12:49.620 - 00:13:13.180, Speaker A: back to my conversation with Caitlin Long. So actually, before we get into some of the details around the regulatory and technical details, I actually also wanted to ask another thing because you had this great Tweet storm about Avanti Bank, and one of the things is that you said that the bank will have the not your keys, not your coins Ethos built in. How so?
00:13:13.710 - 00:14:06.650, Speaker B: Well, we'll be providing services around digital assets. So, yes, it's a bank, which of course makes some folks heads explode in this industry. Aren't we trying to get away from banks? Yes, but it's a regulatory tool to allow us to deliver services around digital assets. So one example might be the key signing multi SIG key signature services. There may be some institutions that for control reasons, want to have a bank even if the assets are not actually custody at the bank, if they're not on deposit at the bank, but they actually want a bank to be providing, as a fiduciary or not the services around multi SIG. So that's one example. And in the Wyoming law, as you may know, there are different levels of custody that you can choose.
00:14:06.650 - 00:14:24.142, Speaker B: So you can choose a non fungible bailment or a fungible bailment. A non fungible bailment would be literally where the bank is actually holding your Trezor or your ledger or your HSM for you and you get it back because it's literally held in a vault.
00:14:24.286 - 00:14:27.666, Speaker A: And actually, Caitlin, can you define bailment for people?
00:14:27.848 - 00:15:09.150, Speaker B: Yes, a bailment is a common law legal concept that has been around for centuries but just hasn't been applied to financial services for a few decades in the US. And that is akin to valet parking for your car or coat check. When you turn your asset over to the service provider for safekeeping, they're just providing a service. You're not actually turning over legal title to the asset. It turns out. The way that the financial markets are structured in the US and the UK and many other developed countries is that when you turn your financial asset over to a bank or a broker dealer, you're actually giving them legal title to the assets. And what you get back is an IOU.
00:15:09.150 - 00:15:23.780, Speaker B: In the Wyoming structure, you're not giving up legal title, you're just giving temporary possession. And the only thing that the service provider can do is store that for you, keep it safe until you want it back.
00:15:25.110 - 00:15:29.330, Speaker A: So I interrupted you. You were going to also then describe fungible bailment.
00:15:29.830 - 00:16:22.546, Speaker B: Yeah, a fungible bailement would be where you're actually sending the asset in for safekeeping, but you're not going to get your same UTXOs back or you're not actually sending in hardware, you're actually transferring the asset in for safekeeping. It is more of a custodial relationship. But what's interesting is that even though the keys in that case would be kept by the custodian, so it doesn't comply with not your keys, not your coins, you still have legal title to the asset. What's the impact of that? It means that if the custodian goes bankrupt that your asset is outside of the bankruptcy estate and you don't have a problem like you did in the Lehman or MF Global situation where you have to wait years to get it back. You have to go through the bankruptcy process to get your asset back with a bailement. It's legally outside of the bankruptcy estate. Therefore the bank is just a service provider, not a counterparty.
00:16:22.546 - 00:16:28.300, Speaker B: You're not in a debtor creditor relationship with the bank as you are in traditional financial services.
00:16:29.310 - 00:16:50.640, Speaker A: So I also want to highlight one other part about these special purpose depository institutions under the Wyoming law, which is that you tweeted that the banks who obtain this, and correct me if I misunderstood, but they could potentially get around the Bit license in New York with that. What do you mean by that?
00:16:51.010 - 00:17:17.558, Speaker B: Well, so this is a very good question and for those who are not familiar with the hierarchy of financial regulations, there are basically in the US four different types of financial institutions. And at the bottom of the barrel is money transmitters. It's really easy to get money transmitter licenses. That's a state by state licensing regime. And in some states, I think in Alabama all you have to do is put up a $5,000 bond. It doesn't cost much. Up above that is trust companies.
00:17:17.558 - 00:17:44.254, Speaker B: And you can get a trust company for $100,000 in capital. And the trust companies serving this industry really are not well capitalized. Then above that is a bank. Now you're talking a minimum $25 million. So big step up in capital. But because you're a bank, you get direct access to the Fed. And then at the top of the pyramid is the primary dealers that deal with treasury auctions and the like.
00:17:44.254 - 00:18:24.574, Speaker B: And they obviously clear most of the payments in the banking system. The Bit license in New York is kind of between a money transmitter and a trust company. So here we come in with a bank from Wyoming with much much higher capital requirements. And because it's a bank and of course it has direct access to the Fed because it's a bank, there's a whole history of litigation on how state chartered banks are treated by other states. And there's actually federal law that precludes other states from discriminating against other state state chartered banks when they want to open a branch. So what we have is another state state chartered bank, I. E.
00:18:24.574 - 00:18:48.040, Speaker B: Wyoming special purpose depository institution wanting to come into a state like New York. It's one of the few states that actually will require a Wyoming speedy bank to apply to come in. But lots of legal precedent that they cannot deny the application to come in and open a branch in New York. So it's yet to be done. This is going to be fun to watch.
00:18:50.410 - 00:19:41.462, Speaker A: Yeah, I wonder if the New York listeners are going to get really excited by this. But anyway, one other thing that I wanted to ask about was the law for the SPDIs. It goes into quite a bit of detail around things like the airdrops and forks and staking, which you kind of alluded to earlier, but I wanted to talk a little bit more. So essentially what's going to happen is that under this law, all of those will accrue to the customer, not to the institution. How do you expect to handle that on the back end? Because as far as I understand, anytime you deal with a new chain, whether it's a fork or an airdrop, I mean, there can be issues like if there's not replay protection built in or even just adding any new chain can take quite a bit of work. So is that where your partnership with blockstream comes in or how are you going to handle that?
00:19:41.596 - 00:20:31.282, Speaker B: Yes, well, the partnership with blockstream is obviously starting with bitcoin. That's the one that the institutions are obviously most demanding right now. It's the most institutionally investable chain among the big institutions that we're targeting. But the next piece is if we step back, the philosophy of the Wyoming law is that this bank should be a service provider, not a counterparty, unless you choose for it to be. And so one of the implications of that is you have to define the asset very clearly upfront. So I alluded earlier to one of the institutional players who calls bitcoin, quote unquote, a digital asset. Well, the Wyoming law requires these speedy banks to define the asset by reference to the source code version on GitHub in your contract.
00:20:31.282 - 00:21:32.282, Speaker B: So you actually have a contractual right to an asset based on that version of the software. So when you get to things like forks and airdrops, it basically says the customer has a property, right? The bank has to deliver that property. However, if there is a fork that the bank considers insecure, the bank is not required to support it. But because it's a property rights based approach. Let's take the example of the ETH ETH classic fork, where the new coin became the ongoing chain. And ETH classic, the original one was not the ongoing one. In that case, the bank has an obligation to get actual approval, actual consent from each customer, to change the nature of the property that they have a contractual right to deliver, or they have to give it back.
00:21:32.282 - 00:22:07.446, Speaker B: So the bank is not in a situation where it has to take undue security risk. That makes no sense. All it has to do is treat its customers like their institutions, like it has a contractual obligation to actually deliver something. And when that asset changes character, then the bank can either decide to support it or not support it. But if it doesn't support it, it has to get consent or give the original asset back. So in that case, it would be the ETH Classic. It would actually have to give the ETH Classic back to the customer.
00:22:07.628 - 00:22:26.940, Speaker A: If it doesn't support wow, that's really interesting, because that's very different. We won't get into all the details of what happened at that time, but yeah, that's quite different from what actually happened. All right, well, when will Avanti be open?
00:22:27.710 - 00:22:42.560, Speaker B: This is a long process, so managing everybody's expectations, it's at minimum a six to nine month process to get a bank license, and we'll be one of the first ones through the door. So we said early 2021.
00:22:43.010 - 00:22:50.462, Speaker A: Okay, great. Well, we look forward to seeing that when that happens. It's been great having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
00:22:50.606 - 00:22:52.660, Speaker B: Thanks. It's nice to speak with you again.

Download the crypto.com app now. Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this week's News recap. First headline close to half of Square cash app's Q four revenues came from bitcoin payments.
00:23:35.886 - 00:24:29.822, Speaker A: Company Square reported fourth quarter revenue results on its cash app. Bitcoin revenues totaled $178,000,000, while nonbitcoin revenue came to $183,000,000. The amount of bitcoins sold was up about 20% from the previous quarter and almost two and a half times what it was the previous year. The block reported that on the earnings call, CEO Jack Dorsey said, quote, bitcoin actives, generating two to three x annual revenue compared to other cash customers. Next headline how DeFi can survive a world with flashed attacks haseeb Qureshi of Dragonfly Capital wrote a great piece on the significance of the BZX attacks and how DeFi should live in a world where they exist. As he writes, quote, with Flash loans, attackers no longer need to have any skin in the game. Flash loans materially change the risks for an attacker.
00:24:29.822 - 00:25:31.522, Speaker A: He says DeFi protocols should mitigate these attacks by using market based price oracles that involve a weighted average over the previous X number of blocks, requiring that governance tokens be locked up for the voting period to prevent flash attacks on governance and implementing governance timelocks, meaning instituting a delay on any governance decisions. Finally, he warns that all flash attacks could be stolen by miners, though he notes that that would not be the case in Ethereum 20, since transaction finality is not possible in a proof of work system. I highly recommend this essay. I know people are still chewing on the lessons from the BZX attacks, and this is a good one. Next headline Compound introduces a governance token lending protocol. Compound takes one step toward fully decentralizing itself by introducing a token called comp. For now, the way it will work in governance is that anyone with 1% of comp can propose a governance action and proposals are subject to a three day voting period.
00:25:31.522 - 00:26:39.980, Speaker A: If a majority of voters are four, then the proposal goes into a timelock and can be implemented after two days. Next headline iota Shutdown Still among the top 25 coins by market cap Iota has been turned off since February twelveTH, and the market cap still ranks at the time of writing 24th amongst all coins. The three part blog post from the Iota Foundation is a bit difficult to follow, but basically they can't yet say for sure how the attack happened. But the attack did obtain passwords and seeds, and the foundation is working on a way to migrate tokens to new seeds. Eric Wall tweeted quote this whole clusterfuck seems to have been overlooked because people are still processing the fact that Iota shut down for more than twelve days and that the founders are publicly fighting over tens of millions of dollars of the unclaimed funds they stole from the ICO. All I can say is that Iota has now successfully become tangled up in so many outrageous messes simultaneously that it is apparently no longer possible for the public to follow. Along with each different part of this multiplex train wreck, each disaster distracts from the other.
00:26:39.980 - 00:27:33.502, Speaker A: Lee Quinn of CoinDesk also had an entertaining story called Iota Being Shut Off is the latest chapter in an absurdist history which covers some of the previous scandals. Next headline ripple paid MoneyGram $11.3 million MoneyGram received $11.3 million from Ripple during the last half of 2019. In an earnings call, lawrence Angeli, MoneyGram's CFO, said, quote as we've discussed in the past, MoneyGram receives a market development fee based on the volume of foreign exchange that we transact on Ripple's platform. Ripple had previously also invested $50 million into MoneyGram. Speaking of Ripple, Compound general counsel Jake Shavinsky tweeted quote the judge in the XRP securities class action has granted in part and denied in part Ripple's motion to dismiss the case.
00:27:33.502 - 00:28:23.562, Speaker A: There's a lot going on here but overall it's a victory for the plaintiffs. The securities claims survive. XRP stays in the crosshairs. Fun Bits Bitcoin Intro Slideshow Steve Lee of Square Crypto created a great presentation on Bitcoin that might be useful in using to explain these concepts to your non Crypto friends. It breaks down mining Bitcoin's monetary policy and ends by saying that there is a small probability of a massive shift which would be the complete reinvention of global finance and would introduce Bitcoin as a global currency and unit of account and a savings oriented economy and consumption oriented and promote a savings oriented economy versus a consumption oriented one. Nicely done and thought provoking too. Thanks for tuning in.
