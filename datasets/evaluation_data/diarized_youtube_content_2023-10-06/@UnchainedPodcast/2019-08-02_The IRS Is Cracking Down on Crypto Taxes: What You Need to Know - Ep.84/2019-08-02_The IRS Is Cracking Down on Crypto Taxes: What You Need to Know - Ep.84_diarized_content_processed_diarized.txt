00:01:32.790 - 00:01:34.586, Speaker C: Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:01:34.768 - 00:01:41.760, Speaker A: Last week, the IRS sent letters to 10,000 cryptocurrency holders. What did the letters say?
00:01:42.130 - 00:02:05.940, Speaker C: Yeah, so the IRS is basically ramping up enforcement of virtual currency tax compliance. And they sent out these letters in three flavors IRS letter 61 73, IRS letter 61 74 and 61 74. A three letters basically outline different kinds of scenarios with varying levels of severity for folks who may be out of compliance with their virtual currency tax report.
00:02:06.630 - 00:02:09.860, Speaker A: And is there any particular reason that they're sending them now?
00:02:10.390 - 00:02:38.320, Speaker C: It's hard to say why it's exactly now, but this is actually part of an ongoing effort that's been going on for several years, so it's not something that's out of the blue. For example, the IRS subpoenaed Coinbase back in 2016 for records of all US. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency transactors, and they ended up actually getting the records of over 14,000 users. So they've actually been doing this compliance for a long time, and it's now that we're starting to see these letters come out.
00:02:38.850 - 00:03:14.166, Speaker A: Yeah, and actually that was pretty remarkable at the time for the initial request because they literally wanted every single record of every Coinbase user across three years. And it was even down to things like chat logs that they wanted. So it wasn't like they had identified certain people that they thought were sort of sidestepping their taxpayer duties, but just kind of all the data they could get. So then for these letters, is that connected to the Coinbase thing is that how they identified who should receive one of these letters?
00:03:14.358 - 00:03:29.920, Speaker C: It's hard to say for sure. In their press release they sort of outline that they have IRS compliance efforts but they don't detail exactly what they are. But a lot of people are speculating that that is definitely one of the major sources of the data that they have for who are they sending these letters to?
00:03:30.770 - 00:03:43.620, Speaker A: And so for those people, did they only send them to cryptocurrency holders who haven't been paying any taxes on their gains in crypto or just to anybody who holds cryptocurrency in general?
00:03:44.230 - 00:04:30.734, Speaker C: So this is where it might be useful to dive into the three different letters and what they mean. The least severe of the three is the IRS letter 61 74. And that letter basically says that you may not be aware that cryptocurrency is taxed. So it's basically a user education letter. There's no action and you might be perfectly in tax compliance but they're still telling you because they have reason to believe that you have cryptocurrency. If you receive that letter and you've been filing your taxes following all the cryptocurrency guidance, there's nothing you need to worry about. The next letter is the 61 74 A which says that you may not have properly reported your transactions, which means that they have reason to believe that you have virtual currency and maybe you made some reporting but they don't think that you reported it properly.
00:04:30.734 - 00:05:11.470, Speaker C: Maybe you submitted the wrong form, maybe you accidentally treated crypto to crypto transactions as non taxable when they in fact are or maybe some other reason. Again in this case it's a no action letter. If you believe you've done everything correctly, you don't need to take any action. But if you haven't been reporting your cryptocurrency taxes you should definitely go back and amend your returns. And then the third and final letter that's the most aggressive is the 61 73. And in that letter it is an action letter. They're basically saying you haven't reported your cryptocurrency transactions properly and if you don't respond with updating your returns and specifically addressing the concerns that they've brought up then they are going to examine your tax returns.
00:05:11.810 - 00:05:52.462, Speaker A: And so let's start with the group maybe that has the least to worry about. Where the 61 74, I think you said. Essentially. I know we don't know how they targeted these people, but assuming that it is sort of related to the coinbase records, then those would be people where maybe they've cross checked that. Okay. Indeed, they're a coinbase holder and the coinbase records sort of match up with their tax returns of recent years. I'm just trying to figure out why some people would get different know, right?
00:05:52.596 - 00:06:46.240, Speaker C: So one possibility is that they basically have this large group of people that they have found out have cryptocurrency and some of them have reported nothing about cryptocurrency. Some of them have reported some stuff but it's not completely accurate or complete. And then some people have reported a bunch of things and so based on how much reporting they've seen versus the fact that they know whether or not you have cryptocurrency, they might have split out these different letters. So this is a bit speculative, but for example, for the 61 74, the one that you're saying that you're referring to, which is the least severe of the three, they might say that, okay, we did actually get the right tax form, the 89 49, showing all the capital gains transactions. But we're still going to send this letter just as an educational notice, in case the person wasn't fully aware, and also as a signal to the rest of the market, even for folks who didn't receive the letter, that the IRS is actually paying attention. And this is just phase one of their compliance program.
00:06:47.090 - 00:07:07.720, Speaker A: So I read a Wall Street Journal article about this issue and they reported, quote, the Sternist version of the letter asks recipients who believe they have followed the law to sign a statement declaring under penalty of perjury that they are in compliance with tax laws. And it just got me wondering, are the tax laws around cryptocurrency totally clear?
00:07:08.570 - 00:07:37.710, Speaker C: Definitely not. There's actually one of the biggest complaints from cryptocurrency users, accountants, CPAs, tax lawyers, many people have been asking for more clarity since the IRS original guidance on virtual currency transactions back in 2014. And in fact, even the IRS Commissioner Chuck Reddig, said that I think in May of this year that the rules are unclear and that they will be issuing further clarity perhaps as soon as in the next 30 days. But it's been a couple of months since then we haven't heard. So that's definitely a source of frustration for a lot of folks.
00:07:38.130 - 00:07:53.010, Speaker A: Okay, so for those people who receive that letter, if they're being asked to sign a statement declaring under penalty of perjury that they're in compliance with tax laws, but the laws aren't totally clear, then how can they know whether or not they're in compliance with the laws?
00:07:53.350 - 00:08:17.820, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's a bit of a catch 22 and a bit of a ridiculous situation, which is why the IRS really needs to clarify all these rules for folks who are in this situation. Our recommendation is to get in touch with the tax professional who can help you interpret the tax rules to the best of their abilities, given the guidance that's currently available and using some kind of system, tax software or tax professional to help you get all your records in order, if you haven't already.
00:08:18.270 - 00:08:28.382, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to discuss a little bit more about the different types of transactions and how they should be taxed in a moment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:08:28.516 - 00:08:40.178, Speaker B: Crypto.com is the place you can buy crypto at true cost. You can buy over 40 coins at the lowest possible prices with no fees and no markups@crypto.com.

Download the crypto.com app on iOS or Android now. Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors. Privacy Enhanced Compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations.
00:09:35.986 - 00:09:52.682, Speaker B: CypherTrace is working on this vision of the future. Sign up to stay up to date on the Privacy Enhanced Compliance Initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly. WW, cyphertrace.com, slash keepcrypto clean.
00:09:52.816 - 00:10:06.986, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Chandan Lotha of cointracker. So let's just walk. Know you mentioned the three categories of so what should people do if they received the different letters?
00:10:07.178 - 00:11:05.490, Speaker C: So it depends on what you've been doing with regards to filing your cryptocurrency taxes. If you've been really diligent, you've been filing them to the best of your abilities, and you believe that your returns are all accurate and you received either the 61 74 or the 61 74 A, then you don't need to take any action. There are no action letters. They're reminders, and they may not necessarily require any action. If you've been following the rules already, if you've received any of the letters and you haven't been filing your cryptocurrency taxes, you should definitely either get in touch with a tax professional or on your own, or using some tax software, get all of your transaction history reconciled, and amend any previous returns that might apply where you have cryptocurrency transactions. In addition, if you have the 61 73, the most severe of the three letters, you do need to take an action, because the IRS is requiring you to complete the statement and follow up with particular records by a respond by date. Otherwise your account will be put up for examination.
00:11:06.230 - 00:11:29.698, Speaker A: So let's just walk through kind of the different types of transactions people can have in crypto and which of these are taxable events and which ones are not. There's many different examples you kind of gave some a bit earlier, but I know there are certain ones where, for instance, that's not a taxable event. So can you just walk us through like mining or buying or trading, et cetera?
00:11:29.874 - 00:12:15.286, Speaker C: Sure. I'll try to give a high level overview, and we can also link maybe later a more detailed guide in the show notes. So at a high level, when you dispose of a cryptocurrency asset in the United States, you're triggering a taxable event because the IRS has outlined that cryptocurrency like bitcoin is treated as property. So for example, if you buy a cryptocurrency asset, for example, if you spend $100 to buy a bitcoin, that is not a taxable event because there is no disposal of the cryptocurrency asset. If you sell a bitcoin, that is a disposal and that is a taxable event. Similarly, if you trade a bitcoin for another cryptocurrency asset, you are disposing the asset you're selling. So again, a crypto to crypto trade is a taxable event in the case.
00:12:15.388 - 00:12:51.170, Speaker A: Just a question about that one though. Has that always been clear? Because I feel like there was some period of time when it was thought that perhaps the law the like kind I can't remember the exact phrasing of this, but if you trade a crypto for a crypto, there was some thinking that this was like a, like kind trade, which I think at that know, it wasn't clear if that totally was a taxable event. And then later the IRS eventually did come out and say like it is not. And so from that point forward, it was definitely very clear that that was taxable.
00:12:51.910 - 00:13:44.846, Speaker C: It's a good point and you're hitting on an important issue. So basically, like you said in 2018, the IRS clarified that like kind exchanges do not apply to cryptocurrency or any kind of non real property. Meaning that starting in 2018, it's very clear if you had a crypto to crypto trade, it is a taxable event. Before that there is ambiguity because there was no clear guidance. So if you had already been filing form 88 24 specifically for every single crypto to crypto trade, you may be in the clear, but it's a gray area. If you didn't previously already file those forms, then you definitely need to amend your returns to include those transactions as either taxable events or as like kind exchanges, again knowing that you're taking on risk in a gray area where the rules have now changed and are clearly taxable events.
00:13:45.038 - 00:13:53.030, Speaker A: Okay, right. And so obviously we don't give financial advice, but maybe better to be safe than sorry. Okay, so keep going with the transactions.
00:13:53.530 - 00:14:48.130, Speaker C: Okay, so then you asked about mining, airdrops forks. Mining is the clearest of these probably where the IRS has basically said that when you receive a mined coin, you are getting income, you're realizing ordinary income, and then from that point onwards, you have a capital asset. So let's take a scenario where you mine a bitcoin and it's worth $100 at the time you receive it, that's $100 of income. And then in addition, when you sell that bitcoin or you trade that bitcoin, there's a capital event happening where you look at the capital gain or loss between the fair market value at the time that you get rid of that coin compared to the basis of the coin, which is the $100, the fair market value at the time you received it. In the case of a fork it's a bit unclear. There's not super clear guidance here. The sort of conservative approach here is to say that the forked coin is also income.
00:14:48.130 - 00:15:27.218, Speaker C: Again, like mining. You're basically receiving the amount of income at the fair market value at the time you receive the coin and there's a capital event when you dispose of that coin. And the more aggressive option here would be to treat that as a zero basis income. Meaning that when you received the forked coin you didn't necessarily want to receive it, it was out of your control, it just happened to show up in your wallet or in your exchange account and therefore you have zero income. The basis is zero and when you dispose of the coin you basically realize the full capital gain from the entire fair market value of the coin at the time. Then in the AirDrop scenario, again a bit unclear. There isn't clear guidance here.
00:15:27.218 - 00:15:55.790, Speaker C: But you can take the more conservative approach and say that the Airdropped coin was income and that you realize the gain between the fair market value at the time you receive it and the fair market value at the time that you sell the coin or trade the coin. Or the more aggressive position which is that I didn't want to receive this AirDrop coin, it just appeared in my wallet, someone sent it to me outside of my will and therefore it's zero income. And then you realize the full capital gain at the time that you sell or dispose of the coin.
00:15:56.290 - 00:16:05.618, Speaker A: And so I'm assuming those last two issues, the Airdrops and forks are the ones that the IRS needs to release guidance on.
00:16:05.784 - 00:16:10.100, Speaker C: Those are two of the most common scenarios that are pretty unclear and definitely need.
00:16:11.910 - 00:16:24.440, Speaker A: Mean. Not that the crypto community gets to decide these things, but just among, I guess like tax professionals who work in the crypto space, is there any consensus around what would make the most sense?
00:16:24.890 - 00:17:23.580, Speaker C: Different people have different opinions. The position that I've heard that I think seems to be the most reasonable is sort of taking into account the intent of the user. So for example, if you receive an AirDrop that you had no intention of receiving, some random person sent you a coin, you don't know who they are, you don't know why they sent it to you, maybe it was spam, maybe it was marketing, maybe it was some random giveaway. Then it is pretty strange to have to pay income on income that you didn't want to receive in the first place. So in scenarios like that where you have no intent to receive a coin, it seems more reasonable to have the zero basis apply and then only if you choose to realize the gain meaning you actually trade the coin, then you have taxable event. Whereas there's other scenarios where users do have intent to receive a coin or get a forked coin or maybe they get a distribution or inflation rewards from Stellar or staking rewards, things like that where if the user is actually intending to get those rewards then it would make sense that they're getting income at the time that they're receiving those.
00:17:25.390 - 00:18:21.358, Speaker A: Hmm. I'm just trying to figure out how you would determine intent because obviously there are things like the LockDrop situation, which Edgeware did, where you had to signal or send coins in order to receive coins and obviously lock them up for a certain period of time. So that's a pretty obvious case where you're signaling intent. Right, but then for something like the Bitcoin cash hard fork, where maybe if I had bought my Bitcoins on Coinbase and then I moved them to my own personal wallet in order to receive the Bitcoin cash coins okay, sort of maybe that's intent. But then what if I had a blockchain info wallet where they just showed up? So how would you determine that? Is it like literally if you move them from Coinbase to your own wallet, then that's intent, or do you see what I'm getting at?
00:18:21.524 - 00:18:22.282, Speaker C: Totally.
00:18:22.426 - 00:18:31.258, Speaker A: Because then some of the people who received Bitcoin cash would be said to have shown intent and then others would be said to not have shown intent.
00:18:31.434 - 00:18:48.150, Speaker C: Totally. It's definitely not a clear cut issue. There's certainly a lot of messiness here, which is why we need guidance from the IRS. Certainly we can speculate here what would make sense and what would be easy to measure and not. But that's exactly why people are pushing the IRS to provide clarity.
00:18:49.050 - 00:19:06.810, Speaker A: Right. All right. So I did notice in your blog post on this issue that there were a few other kind of like weird edge cases that I was wondering about. One was you mentioned this thing about foreign exchanges. So for paying taxes on crypto, does it matter where you hold or trade your crypto?
00:19:07.390 - 00:19:47.634, Speaker C: Again, it's a gray area, but yes, it might matter specifically for US. Taxpayers if they're using US based exchanges or foreign based exchanges. So for example, Coinbase is US based, binance is not US based, at least not right now. And the reason why it matters is because fin and other financial regulators in the United States want to make sure that they're keeping track of US. Taxpayers foreign assets. So for example, there's this tax compliance form, FBAR Finsen Form 1114, which requires US. Taxpayers who have over $10,000 of assets outside of the United States to report that they have those assets.
00:19:47.634 - 00:20:15.520, Speaker C: So people typically do this when they're using different kinds of foreign bank accounts or different kinds of foreign exchanges. And now again, there's sort of regulatory uncertainty and a gray area around whether users need to do that if they're holding crypto in non US. Based exchanges. Similarly, there's a fatka form which has a higher bar for reporting. But again, if you're holding assets in foreign exchanges, you may need to fill that out as well. But again, it's a gray area.
00:20:15.910 - 00:20:27.538, Speaker A: And then there was another one where you said if your crypto was lost or stolen, do this one thing, but only if it occurred before 2018. So can you describe what that case is?
00:20:27.704 - 00:21:05.460, Speaker C: Right, so many users in the crypto world will be familiar with the concept of exchange hacks and losing crypto, having crypto stolen, things like that. So a common question comes up which is how do I actually take advantage of how do I report this on my taxes? Do I have to pay taxes on crypto that I've lost or stolen? So there basically is a tax form for lost or stolen property. Again, we can link to that. The thing is, in the 2018 tax code changes, they changed the rules about what you can do with regards to lost or stolen property and whether you can claim them. So that form, specifically the one that you're mentioning, which we can link to, applies to the pre 2018 lost or stolen property.
00:21:05.910 - 00:21:17.818, Speaker A: Wait, so what does that mean? That if you lost your bitcoin in 2018 or later, that now you might still have to pay taxes on something that you don't even own anymore?
00:21:18.014 - 00:21:24.680, Speaker C: It would mean that you wouldn't be able to claim a property loss on them, you wouldn't be able to have a tax write off on the lost property.
00:21:25.130 - 00:22:08.290, Speaker A: Okay, so for people who don't want to lose their crypto, I recommend an interview that I did on this phone hijacking situation that's been going on where people are losing their crypto. You should listen to that. I'll link to it in the show notes. So let's now also just talk about the new guidance that the IRS has been promising. We talked about which issues remain to be resolved, but I think even for some of the areas that are settled, a lot of people want to see changes. So you're somebody who works in this world day in and day out. What changes do you think make the most sense in your ideal world? What would you like to see in terms of taxation of crypto?
00:22:08.710 - 00:23:17.738, Speaker C: The main thing is we want this to be clear for users so that they know how to comply. So I think the most important things like you mentioned are very clear guidance on how to deal with forks, how to deal with airdrops, and then the other big one that we didn't talk about that's still a little unclear is how to deal with which kind of cost basis accounting methods are allowed. So for example, with securities like stocks, the IRS details that you can either use first in, first out accounting FIFO or specific ID in certain situations where you can choose which stock you're selling at any given time and therefore decide how much capital gains you're having on a particular trade rather than just the first. Google stock I bought is the first Google stock I sold. So similarly, we need that same kind of clarity and guidance for cryptocurrency. Can users use FIFO or FIFO or LIFO specific ID what's allowed and what's not? And similarly, from the SEC and or IRS, we need clarity on which assets are going to be securities and which ones aren't, because then things like wash sales would perhaps apply to some coins, but not others. Right now, the sort of default view in the community is that wash sales don't apply because Bitcoin is not a security.
00:23:17.738 - 00:23:23.290, Speaker C: But we need clarity on the cost basis, method and clarity on things like wash sales and securities.
00:23:23.790 - 00:23:36.530, Speaker A: And I'm surprised you didn't bring up the issue about de minimis exemptions, because I feel like I hear that one a lot. Do you have an opinion on whether there should be some threshold under which transactions would not be taxed?
00:23:36.950 - 00:24:07.510, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good one too. That makes sense. So for other folks, basically for people who are making small purchases, like, for example, let's say you go to a coffee shop and you buy a coffee with a small amount of Bitcoin, do you really want to be figuring out the taxes on that when people are using this as currency rather than property? And I think that one makes a lot of sense. Some other countries, like, for example, in Germany, they have these exemptions, and I think that one makes sense too. Again, we'd love to get clarity from the IRS around letting people actually use cryptocurrency as currency.
00:24:07.670 - 00:24:11.370, Speaker A: And do you have a particular dollar amount that you think makes sense for the threshold?
00:24:12.110 - 00:24:23.040, Speaker C: I don't have a particular amount that I thought ahead of time. For example, in Germany, I believe the amount is around 600 euro, something like that. Some reasonable limit I think would make sense. I'm not exactly sure what the right amount would be.
00:24:23.970 - 00:24:30.882, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll see if that goes through. I know a lot of people are agitating for it. Okay, well, thanks for coming on the show.
