00:00:56.960 - 00:01:02.490, Speaker A: Today's guest is Mike Winkleman, aka Beeple. Welcome, Mike.
00:01:02.650 - 00:01:04.100, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going?
00:01:04.630 - 00:01:19.590, Speaker A: Great. Nice to have you. So you're a digital artist, and you've worked with Apple, Louis Vuitton, nike, justin Bieber, and Katy Perry, and you've been producing one digital artwork a day for over 13 years. How did you get into crypto?
00:01:20.170 - 00:01:59.300, Speaker B: So a bunch of people just sort of started telling me, you should check out this NFT stuff. And so really, only like, two months ago, I looked into the space a bit closer and saw a bunch of names that I recognized in my sort of motion design area. And so it's like, oh, there definitely seems like there's something here. And so I dove in, and I have a computer science degree. I'm not a programmer, but that piece of it really sort of interested me. So the possibilities, I thought, were just endless and that there was just a bunch of things people hadn't tried yet that I thought sounded really fun to try.
00:01:59.910 - 00:02:07.698, Speaker A: And you ended up having a big digital art sale last weekend that raked in $3.5 million. Congratulations.
00:02:07.874 - 00:02:42.110, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, it was just crazy to see. But I also think it truly is sort of the start of people really kind of like, collecting this digital art. I think the physical token paired with the NFT, I think makes it something people can really understand and sort of speaks to their inner sort of collecting voice. And I think it's just the system that will be the future of sort of like, collecting artwork.
00:02:42.690 - 00:02:50.082, Speaker A: So tell us more of the details about that sale. What did you offer, how did you offer it, and what happened? Sure.
00:02:50.136 - 00:03:39.250, Speaker B: So the biggest thing that I think is different from this sale than previous sales is that each of the pieces included a physical token that was a digital screen that was very closely sort of tied to the blockchain. So it wasn't sort of like a prize that could be separated easily from the NFT. It's something that's very meant to be looked at as one piece. And so I made peoplecollect.com, which sort of like, houses the collection. And then there was an open edition that was on sale for just five minutes, which also included the physical token. And then there was 21 auctions throughout the weekend that sold single edition sort of pieces to the highest bidder.
00:03:39.250 - 00:04:10.650, Speaker B: And so that was sort of like the components of the drop. So all weekend, we sold $600,000 worth of the open edition in five minutes. And then the everydays themselves and the auction were going for over $100,000 on average. And then the last piece went for $777,000. So I think it just shows that there's, like, a huge appetite for a tightly sort of connected, digital and physical sort of like collectible.
00:04:11.310 - 00:04:16.014, Speaker A: And there were some pieces that were also available for a dollar as well. Why did you do that?
00:04:16.212 - 00:04:58.940, Speaker B: So that was sort of like a promotional thing. Yeah, there's these pieces that are available for a dollar. Those don't include, obviously, the physical token, and they're an addition of 100. And even those are going for if you want to buy them, they sold out absolutely instantly. Like less than a second, they sell out. And so even those, if you want to buy them, they're like 17 or eighteen hundred dollars to buy just that sort of video. So I think there is a huge sort of demand for collecting digital artwork, and I'm just excited, looking forward to, first off, get these into people's hands and get them enjoying digital art in their sort of room, just like I am able to kind of do with these.
00:04:58.940 - 00:05:06.510, Speaker B: And then, secondly, moving forward, what additional possibilities they are to make these cooler and sweeter.
00:05:07.890 - 00:05:13.966, Speaker A: What were your expectations going into this sale? Did you expect to raise this kind of money?
00:05:14.148 - 00:05:55.118, Speaker B: I knew it could be big. I will say that I did not think it would be this big, but I knew it could be big because it was like I was just having them in my room. It was like, these are freaking sweet. These are just really, like, they make the room much cooler. So it was like, I think if I can communicate that to people, people will be as excited as I am. And the people I sort of showed beforehand, everybody was just like, oh, my God, you're very excited. And again, this is just literally something that we came up with, like my wife and I in a month, because again, I've only been in this whole space two months.
00:05:55.118 - 00:06:16.210, Speaker B: So this was not something that's only been thinking about this for the last two years. This was literally like, in a month. It was like, oh, man, this would be perfect for the everydays. And that's where I feel lucky that I have this sort of collection of work that's very digital and very kind of meant to be collected, almost in hindsight.
00:06:16.630 - 00:06:27.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to link to the instagram video that you did that shows the box and the I guess it reminds me of one of those digital photo display things.
00:06:27.628 - 00:06:39.962, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like a physical kind of video display token thing, but it's kind of got this nicer glass feel to it that makes it feel kind of almost like a little floating video in your space.
00:06:40.096 - 00:06:45.022, Speaker A: Yeah. I have to say it amazes me that you pulled all that together in two months, because it does look very nice.
00:06:45.076 - 00:07:24.060, Speaker B: I'm going to be honest, I'm actually a little amazed myself, too. And that's the weird thing, too, about these auctions, which I'm very new to it. I've been around in the space before. There's a lot of concert visuals. Like I did the last two Super Bowls I was at and was part of the concert visuals and stuff. So it's not like I haven't done some stuff, but the auction piece of it and how final and immediate it is, it was like after the weekend, it was like I immediately had $3 million or whatever. It's just very super weird and totally in public is also just something I'm not used to.
00:07:24.430 - 00:07:29.626, Speaker A: So prior to selling your art this way, how did you make money from the art that you were creating every day?
00:07:29.728 - 00:08:26.622, Speaker B: So the way any artist there's no real digital artist that makes money, sort of, or very few that none that I know of that sort of make money directly from selling their artwork. It's all freelance, sort of like design work. Like somebody has a design problem and it's like, we need graphics for the Super Bowl, so it's like, okay, I'll do that and work together with them to sort of solve that problem. But this is obviously more like art sales, where it's sort of I did whatever I want sort of on SPAC and somebody bought it or whatever. So there hasn't been a path for digital artists to make a living as a quote unquote artist where they're selling their own work. And I feel like that's about to change. I feel like this is just the beginning of digital artists being able to sort of like a painter or somebody like that who can sell works for significant amounts of money.
00:08:26.622 - 00:08:52.840, Speaker B: And it's hard, but you can make a living like that. I feel like we're just at the beginning of sort of looking at that, and I look at graffiti and banksy or cause with final collectibles. And again, I think it's easy to forget that those were know, sort of art forms that people didn't really respect and didn't sort of value in more of like a traditional art sense.
00:08:53.690 - 00:09:03.420, Speaker A: And so previously, when you were dealing with collectors, how would you make a sale and how did the payment happen and everything?
00:09:03.790 - 00:09:43.734, Speaker B: Honestly, it was sort of like anybody else. It was just like a print. I would sell prints, and it was not the best way to view my art because it's meant to be sort of viewed on, like a screen, to be honest. And so selling them at shows and stuff like that, just like any other artist, and it wasn't the right fit for my artwork. That is so digital. And that's where I think this caught such sort of fire, is because this is the best way to view this artwork is you're viewing it on the screen. It's got all this extra information.
00:09:43.734 - 00:09:54.822, Speaker B: It's sort of slowly animated. So it feels like the best way to view this very digital sort of artwork.
00:09:54.966 - 00:10:08.542, Speaker A: And when you would sell it at Get, I'm sure there was some cut taken out of that. And I'm curious to know how that compares to what it was like working with Nifty Gateway, which was the NFT site you worked with.
00:10:08.676 - 00:10:44.140, Speaker B: Yeah, so there was a cut. I mean, to be honest, I had done very little shows. Again, because there isn't that much sort of in the art world. There's not a whole lot of outlets for people who are making digital art like this. If you're a painter, obviously there's tons of galleries that will, oh, you're a painter, they will show your stuff. Whereas if you're a digital artist, they're kind of like, why don't you use a computer? And that's not like, well, what are we going to do? They got to set up a projector. They got to do know this or that.
00:10:44.140 - 00:11:31.980, Speaker B: And so, honestly, I had very few shows before this. I threw one show kind of sort of myself, almost in Toronto, not myself, but it wasn't through very established kind of gallery or whatever. But, yeah, we put on an awesome show, and it had a really good attendance. But again, it's still sort of wasn't the best way to view the art because, again, it wasn't sort of this digital thing. And I think that now the pieces are together with the blockchain, with the physical tokens that you can view in your house and with the website that I think all the pieces are sort of there to kind of make it a much stronger sort of collecting experience.
00:11:32.750 - 00:11:51.598, Speaker A: Okay. This is so interesting talking to you, because it just makes me realize that essentially the art you were putting out every day, essentially, it seems like, wasn't really Monetized and that most of you almost like it was like free advertisements for yourself, for your commercial work. All right.
00:11:51.764 - 00:11:53.230, Speaker B: Exactly what it was.
00:11:53.380 - 00:12:17.554, Speaker A: Wow. That's just beyond interesting to me as a creator myself. So in a moment, we're going to discuss how crypto can change business models for artists like you. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Today's episode is brought to you by Block Native. Block Native is the easiest way to build and trade with Mempool data. Hundreds of the top DeFi projects and traders have integrated Block Native's API.
00:12:17.554 - 00:12:58.100, Speaker A: They even have Mempool Explorer, the industry's first no code environment for working with Mempool data. Mempool Explorer truly brings Blockchain data to life, letting you watch mainnet transactions as they happen through the first quarter of 2021, unconfirmed listeners get double the transaction volume on all Block native commercial plans, as much as $25,000 in value. Visit blocknative.com. Unconfirmed to get started and claim this offer. Back to my conversation with Mike winkleman. So something I've been so curious about is, since people can also just get a JPEG of the art, why would they pay a lot of money to own these?
00:12:59.350 - 00:14:10.682, Speaker B: So, and that was one of the questions I got the most when I was after the first release that I had, which didn't really have that much of like a physical component, is how is this different from Instagram and why would I buy an MP4, a video? And so those were the two sort of questions I wanted to sort of address with this next drop. And so the first thing is the video itself that you get for each one of these everydays is different than Instagram. It looks like a collectible and it looks like different. So you can easily just glance at it and see that it's different because, yeah, you'll always be able to view these things on Instagram, just like you can pull up a picture of the Mona Lisa, but that's very different than owning the Mona Lisa. Like, you can pull up a picture of a bunch of different sort of famous paintings or this or that, but you don't own those paintings. And if you did own those paintings, then it would feel very different than just looking at it on a thing. So with the physical piece, that's where I'm kind of trying to bring it back a little bit more to the traditional world of art, of like, okay, you don't even need to don't worry about any of the Blockchain stuff.
00:14:10.682 - 00:15:02.094, Speaker B: You own this physical piece and it's signed by me and it's got authentication markers so that you can look at this thing and know that it's like, okay, you were given this thing because you own the NFT and so you have this and you can prove you're the only one who has this thing. And you kind of almost really don't even need to worry about the Blockchain piece of it. And that's where I think Blockchain will be the most interesting and useful moving forward. Like, you look at credit card sort of technology, nobody understands how that works. They don't give a crap. Either it's like, does it work or not? When I sign my thing and that's, I think how NFTs are going to be super useful and the ones that will be the most successful are the ones that make things easier for people. I feel like this is a better way, an easier, more transparent way to collect art.
00:15:02.094 - 00:15:08.560, Speaker B: And so that's where I think it could have a really huge sort of impact on the broader art world.
00:15:09.330 - 00:15:31.080, Speaker A: So the person who bought that final piece that went for $777,000 777 sorry, all seven? Yes. He was named Tim King. And I just wondered, do you know him? Is he like a super fan of yours? Do you have some kind of relationship?
00:15:31.450 - 00:16:08.382, Speaker B: So I knew him. I had met him earlier in the week and I had just sort of talked to him and we kind of DM'd on Twitter and I showed him the box and sort of like, I didn't know him super well, but it wasn't, like, totally somebody I have no idea. I definitely talked to him. I'm, like, DMing him the whole time and he was kind of like, I'm going to stop at, like, 300,000. And then it was like, big freaking thing. So it was like, yeah, I knew who it was. It was somebody.
00:16:08.382 - 00:16:34.918, Speaker B: I was literally DMing. Well, this was happening, playing out, like, in real time. So it's it's super. And the other guy, too, he was who he was DMing. I had, like, talked to that guy beforehand. So it's like, you know, that's been kind of interesting, too, like, meeting the different sort of collectors in the space and sort of learning about that. And it's such an interesting relationship because our interests are very much aligned.
00:16:34.918 - 00:16:49.406, Speaker B: If their pieces go up in value, that's great for me and it's great for them. So it's the really win win sort of thing. So, yeah, I will definitely never forget that. I can tell you that that amazes me.
00:16:49.428 - 00:16:52.800, Speaker A: You only just met him, but it sounds like he'd been following your work for a while.
00:16:53.730 - 00:17:11.640, Speaker B: Honestly, I don't think he had. But it just is interesting that a lot of our sort of interests and what we're trying to do and different things we're trying to do align very well. So it was sort of know, I think we're going to be friends now. I'll say that. I'll say that.
00:17:12.490 - 00:17:20.626, Speaker A: Yeah. I just realized, actually, because his Twitter handle says Tim ETH. So he must be an Ethereum.
00:17:20.738 - 00:17:40.286, Speaker B: Yes, he's been around Ethereum for a while and done well for himself. And he's just very smart, just super nice. Nice kid, lives out in La now and just very nice. I don't know how much I'm supposed to be, like, telling him, this kid.
00:17:40.468 - 00:17:54.210, Speaker A: He'S a good guy, we don't have to DOX him further. So there are a whole bunch of digital artwork, digital collectible sites right now. So how did you end up deciding on Nifty Gateway?
00:17:54.630 - 00:19:00.102, Speaker B: The one thing I will say I really like about Nifty is just that you can use credit card payments because, again, I'm trying to make this as accessible as possible for people. So with super rare, to be honest, getting ETH loaded up into a wallet is a lot of work that I don't think people quite recognize that have been in the space. They don't understand, like, you got to connect a coinbase account, you got to fund the account, you got to understand Ethereum, then you got to load a MetaMask Chrome extension, you got to understand how wallets work, you got to transfer it's a lot. And so if the other option is you just load a credit card in and you're good to go, it's like, well, that's ultimately what it needs to be. It needs to be much easier to bring in a bunch of people. And that's what I'm really trying to do, is like, okay, the space has been on fire, but there's a lot of artists coming in. We need a bunch more collectors coming in to sort of keep the party going here.
00:19:00.102 - 00:19:05.610, Speaker B: So that's what I was really trying to do with this sort of drop.
00:19:06.430 - 00:19:31.300, Speaker A: So the amount of money that you took in in 48 hours is actually the same amount that was taken in by all the artists on Super Rare in eleven Months. So do you think that this auction went so well for you because you already have an established audience, like you have 1.7 million followers on Instagram? Or do you think that NFTs and auctions are a promising way for lesser known artists to sell their work?
00:19:31.750 - 00:20:23.266, Speaker B: I think it went so well because I was offering something different and I was solving a problem. I think since then they just had a little yachty coin on Nifty and I think it's cool and I think there's some sort of market for that type of stuff. But I think that guy's way more popular than me and his coin sold for like 16,000. So I don't think it's just the popularity. I think I was doing something new and different that people were like, oh, that's actually a sweet thing, versus just like, he's a popular guy. I honestly think it was mostly just because I was offering this physical token and people could see like, oh yeah, that's actually a way sort of like better product. And especially even with the open edition for $1,000, you got the physical token too.
00:20:23.266 - 00:20:40.460, Speaker B: That I think that was why it was so successful versus me being popular that helped. But I think it was mostly just the fact that it was like, oh, this is actually a product that seems new and different is like pushing the space forward more.
00:20:41.070 - 00:21:13.970, Speaker A: So you kind of talked about this a little bit, but I just wondered exactly how you thought business models would change for digital artists going forward. And I also wondered whether or not that you thought this model could apply to other kinds of creatives such as writers, musicians. Actors who? Well, maybe actors. It's a little bit difficult, but writers, they can obviously make ebooks or whatever and musicians can make MP3. So do you think that this is something that can only apply for visual artists or do you think other types of artists can also take advantage?
00:21:16.010 - 00:21:53.374, Speaker B: I think it will depend on if adding an NFT to that thing adds more value. If it doesn't, then I don't know that it will be that popular. You know what I mean? Maybe I'm wrong again. I'm so new to this space, I hate to make, oh, this is what's going to happen. I don't know. I don't want to oversell my sort of whatever theories here too much, but I feel like the things that are not like I mean, you can add an NFT to anything. Here we go.
00:21:53.374 - 00:22:27.050, Speaker B: Here's, chapstick. I want to get that NFT of this, but what does that do? That doesn't make it better. So I honestly think the projects where adding an NFT adds value, I think those are going to be the most successful, where it's sort of like not really solving a problem. Which I think, to be honest with some of traditional art. It's sort of like if there's a painting or whatever and you have an NFT. Well, it proves I have the painting. But the painting proves you have the painting.
00:22:27.050 - 00:23:04.840, Speaker B: You have the painting. You know what I mean? I am not sure what problem it's solving. The painting itself proves you have the painting. Why would you need an NFT on top of that, you know what I mean? So I think there's going to be the things where it doesn't actually provide that much new value. I think those I'm not sure they'll last a super long time. I think it will be the things where it's sort of like, oh, this NFT makes this ownership experience better or more valuable or easier or whatever, that I think those will be the ones that will see much more success.
00:23:05.450 - 00:23:11.786, Speaker A: Does that make sense? Yeah. And any last hints you want to give us on what you might do with crypto in the future?
00:23:11.968 - 00:23:22.010, Speaker B: Oh, I can tell you we're just getting started. We got a lot planned. We got a lot planned. Now you got the whole FAM activated and the FAM is we're hungry.
00:23:23.550 - 00:23:29.118, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, I look forward to seeing what you do next. Thank you so much for coming on. Unconfirmed awesome.
00:23:29.204 - 00:23:29.982, Speaker B: Thank you.

First headline bitcoin price breaks new records.
00:24:14.294 - 00:25:35.282, Speaker A: Bitcoin has spent the week reaching new all time highs, breaking through $20,000 and $21,000 on Wednesday and then breaking through $22,000 and $23,000 on Thursday. Bitcoin options daily trading also surpassed $1 billion for the first time on Thursday as the price of bitcoin surges. Guggenheim Investments global chief investment officer Scott Minard said on Bloomberg TV that he believes the fair value of the cryptocurrency is far from being achieved, pointing to Quote rampant money printing and bitcoin scarcity as reasons to think the price could eventually reach $400,000. Meanwhile, UK based Rougher Investment confirmed that it had accumulated $744,000,000 in bitcoin and what it is calling a hedge against, quote, some of the risks that we see in a fragile monetary system and distorted financial markets. Also a us. Hedge fund that specializes in volatility bets has quietly purchased more than $600 million in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, with plans to bring its holdings of bitcoin and ethereum to $1 billion by 2021. Eric Peters, CEO of One River Asset Management, foresees a generational allocation to crypto assets, saying Quote COVID-19 provided the ultimate catalyst for that transition.
00:25:35.282 - 00:26:31.238, Speaker A: This is the most interesting magotrade I've seen in my career. On Wednesday onchain Bitcoin, analyst Willie Wu tweeted that based on his charts, $100,000 for the bitcoin price is, quote, a ridiculously low target at the current trajectory. Wu said he views $55,000 bitcoin as the next landmark, which would turn the cryptocurrency into a $1 trillion macro asset. Next Headline Coinbase takes first step toward IPO After reports this summer that it planned to go public, Coinbase filed a draft form S One to the securities and Exchange Commission, the first step to having an initial public offering. If it's approved, Coinbase will become the first crypto company to go public, a huge milestone for the industry. This week, the company also welcomed a new board member, Kelly Kramer, who was previously executive vice president and chief financial officer at Cisco. She will chair the Audit and Compliance Committee.

Next Headline Ethereum touches new yearly high as CME Group announces futures CME Group plans to list Ethereum futures in February, pending regulatory approval. CME's announcement comes as Ethereum reaches its highest price since May of 2018, briefly hitting $672 on Thursday. CME, which has previously said it was focusing solely on bitcoin futures, seems to have had a change of heart due to the growth of its futures and options market. Next Headline Paxos pulls in $142,000,000 to expand services the day after bitcoin surpassed $20,000, Paxos announced a $142,000,000 Series C investment led by Declaration Partners, an investment advisor to the family office of billionaire David Rubenstein of the Carlisle Group.
