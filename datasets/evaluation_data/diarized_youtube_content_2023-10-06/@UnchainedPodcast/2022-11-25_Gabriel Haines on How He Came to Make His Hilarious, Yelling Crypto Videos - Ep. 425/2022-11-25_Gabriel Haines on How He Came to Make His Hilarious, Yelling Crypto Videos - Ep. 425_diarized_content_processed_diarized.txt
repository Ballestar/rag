00:01:09.438 - 00:01:22.546, Speaker C: In this Thanksgiving edition of Unchanged or Black Friday edition, our guest is Gabriel Haynes, a crypto content creator, or as he likes to call himself, a crypto genius. Welcome, Gabriel.
00:01:22.738 - 00:01:28.780, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. Thank you for the title. Much appreciated. Well deserved, if I might say.
00:01:30.750 - 00:01:46.858, Speaker C: So. You're famous for your videos in which you make funny commentary or say outrageous things about crypto in a distinctive, mostly yelly voice. Can you yell something in that voice for people listening who can't see you and may not recognize your normal voice?
00:01:47.034 - 00:01:48.000, Speaker D: Good morning.
00:01:48.930 - 00:01:51.760, Speaker A: I hope you didn't sell your shitcoins today.
00:01:53.910 - 00:02:00.178, Speaker C: Awesome. So people love your goofy videos, and I was curious, how did you get started doing them?
00:02:00.344 - 00:02:46.238, Speaker A: Yeah, it was a very organic process, I would say. I started out my crypto journey very early on. I started making content about crypto, mostly tutorials explanations about different DeFi applications. Actually, I'm wearing the sweatshirt you can see it says Yearn year two, which is just commemorating the early people who worked on urine. And my name appears on this sweatshirt. So I was very involved very early in 2020, 2021 in DFI, making tutorials explanations and doing a lot of interviews. But actually, then my daughter was born and I didn't have a lot of time to do any long form content.
00:02:46.238 - 00:03:25.550, Speaker A: I don't have a time to sit down for an hour and have a conversation. So it had to be a lot more condensed, a lot more short form. And I don't know if you have kids, but when you have kids, you don't sleep a lot, and that contributes to a sort of a psychosis maybe frustration. So I started to maybe vent a little bit, express myself loudly on crypto, Twitter, and it kind of resonated with people, and people really liked it. So I kept on doing it and yeah, that's how we got here.
00:03:25.700 - 00:03:31.946, Speaker C: Wait, are you saying your first videos were about your lack of sleep or were they about crypto?
00:03:32.058 - 00:03:57.480, Speaker A: Oh, no, the tone was because of the lack of sleep. I was yelling because I was not sleeping. I was frustrated and I need to get that out there. But it was about crypto. It was always about crypto through the entire time. Just the style, the tenor came from that particular emotional state that I was in and maybe continued to be.
00:03:58.090 - 00:04:00.602, Speaker C: Got it. And when was that exactly?
00:04:00.656 - 00:04:01.530, Speaker A: A year ago.
00:04:01.680 - 00:04:10.780, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Okay, so you said that you started by just making content about DeFi and stuff like that. What did you do? Before?
00:04:15.650 - 00:04:49.778, Speaker A: I was just making content. Even before that. Before crypto? Before I got into crypto, I was doing a hummus review. So if you right now, anyone who's listening, type in Chickpea challenge in Google and you will find a hummus eating competition hosted by my wife in which I'm competing to eat as much hummus as possible. Now I was living in Israel and I would go around to different hummus places and review them. Like in United States you have kind of like pizza places, like a cultural fast food type. In Israel, in the Middle East.
00:04:49.778 - 00:05:13.440, Speaker A: You have hummus. It's like fast food very quick. You get it, you go but I love hummus. And there's not a lot of review, there's not a lot of breakdown of the whole environment. So I would go to all these different places and just talk about them. That was my very early days in content creation, which I've been doing now for about four years or so.
00:05:13.810 - 00:05:42.342, Speaker C: Wow, I love it. I will have to check these out. I had a famous road trip. It wasn't a road trip, it was like a backpacking trip in Europe with friends where somehow chickpeas favored or appeared. They were a theme of the trip, let's say. Anyway, so for your current videos, how do you come up with the ideas for them? Because they're kind of I mean, they're really funny. They're generally about crypto news, but sometimes they're also about other things.
00:05:42.342 - 00:05:45.980, Speaker C: So curious, how do you decide what you're going to make a video about?
00:05:46.430 - 00:06:29.500, Speaker A: A lot of it is just reaction videos. I'm scrolling on crypto, Twitter often and I see something that just begs for a video to be made about it. And yeah, most of my videos I do in one take. I don't write anything down, I just kind of like just start talking. Maybe I have one or two words that I want to get in a rant. But yeah, it's all about reaction. I think that my best stuff will come from seeing something outrageous going on and being even more outrageous in the way that I do.
00:06:30.030 - 00:06:33.260, Speaker C: What would you say are your most popular videos so far?
00:06:33.790 - 00:07:25.610, Speaker A: Well, I mean, last week or yeah, I think last week maybe a week and a half ago, but the whole FTX drama was coming out and I actually had one video that was extremely popular, a million views on Twitter. Actually, that's the first time I've ever had anything, any video of mine get a million views. I was talking about the orgies. I don't know if there was orgies, but maybe I don't know. But just kind of like talking about that. And yeah, I think that a lot of people are not willing to talk in that way and not willing to address these topics. But I think it's very fun and I do it in a funny way and kind of a light hearted way that also kind of gives a point of truth, but also is entertaining.
00:07:26.030 - 00:07:38.526, Speaker C: That was the one where you are shirtless and if I recall correctly, you're wearing jeans and there's snow on the ground and you have, like, an axe and you are yelling about this. Is that the one?
00:07:38.708 - 00:07:53.060, Speaker A: Yeah, almost. I'm actually wearing cool cats pants, which I'm wearing right now. Yeah, I was wearing, like, sweatpants and not an axe. It's machete. Please. I take my work very seriously. So we need to get these things.
00:07:53.060 - 00:07:57.654, Speaker A: But yeah, basically what you're describing, I.
00:07:57.692 - 00:08:03.126, Speaker C: Actually, as a journalist, I appreciate the fact check. I'd love to play a little clip of that.
00:08:03.228 - 00:08:14.890, Speaker D: Caroline and SBF having sex on those goddamn beanbags. Picture that in your mind. That is disgusting.
00:08:15.630 - 00:08:26.480, Speaker C: So you said you only do one take, so do you set everything up yourself or do you have somebody videotaping you? Or what equipment do you use? And how professional of an operation is this?
00:08:29.010 - 00:09:22.880, Speaker A: It's quite not professional. My wife will sometimes film me, but most of the time I just put my phone even on the floor, just wherever it can be propped up. Actually, the most recent piece of equipment that I purchased was a tripod for my phone. And that's it. You don't need anything. I think that a lot of the reason also, that the reason I do it this way is because I recognize that I'm not a good editor and I don't like spending a lot of time editing. So if I'm able to present something that is just a scene and my voice and given an idea, that's the easiest way for me to convey my message with not a lot of production, not a lot of help, but just put up the phone, press record, say whatever it is and post.
00:09:22.880 - 00:09:29.860, Speaker A: No need to go crazy with any sort of edits or filters or whatever.
00:09:30.390 - 00:09:38.440, Speaker C: And I did see that you recently sold some of your videos as NFTs. Before that, had you ever made money from these videos or was it always just for fun?
00:09:39.130 - 00:10:11.614, Speaker A: Yeah, before selling? No, I mean, when you get started in content, you know better than I do. You've been doing this way longer than I have. When you get started, you're not making any you're not nobody cares about you. You're just out there yelling into a camera on your just you can go back. Anyone can go back and look at my oldest videos on YouTube or Twitter or whatever. There's like five views on them. So, yeah, of course at that time I was not selling anything.
00:10:11.614 - 00:10:40.950, Speaker A: And yeah, NFTs have been a very interesting route. Usually what happens is that people will actually ask for me to mint an NFT. I won't just go ahead and just take every video and mint it. I'd like someone who wants like, I'm not forcing it on anyone. If someone wants to collect it and wants to support me, that's awesome and I'm happy. But most of the videos are just for fun. I personally will go back and watch my videos and laugh.
00:10:40.950 - 00:10:45.450, Speaker A: That sounds weird and narcissistic, but I think it's funny.
00:10:47.310 - 00:11:05.380, Speaker C: I love it. I think if you find something funny, then for other people to like it is sort of just gravy. All right, so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the NFTs and kind of some other aspects of the videos, which are super fun. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:11:05.830 - 00:11:36.090, Speaker B: DeFi Saver is an all in one management app for the top lending protocols on Ethereum, including Aave, Maker, Liquidy and Compound.

00:11:36.510 - 00:11:55.746, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Gabriel. So I know you started as like a crypto. I wouldn't say started, but you obviously have been doing crypto content creation, and I was curious, with your experience with the NFT sales, do you feel that this is kind of a good solution for creators like you?
00:11:55.928 - 00:12:39.914, Speaker A: I think it's a tool in the toolkit, for sure. An NFT on its own is just it's nothing. I mean, you have to incorporate it under some brand. You have to use it as part of your creator toolbox. Being a crypto, being someone who is in crypto and talks about crypto, it's a very obvious fit for me to have NFTs video NFTs. And as crypto grows and as the market cap continues to grow, number go up, then I think more and more people will be able to utilize this. Right now, it's a very niche thing focused mostly on crypto creators.
00:12:39.914 - 00:13:17.420, Speaker A: You don't see a lot of people who are outside of crypto making NFTs for obvious reasons. It's very difficult. But, yeah, I think it's super important. And the NFTs have been way more profitable than YouTube payments or even Twitter has, like, super followers. Those have been minuscule minuscule. I mean, it's maybe a hundred times more in. Like not that the number of NFT sales is deep a level, but it's something and it feels good.
00:13:17.420 - 00:13:21.450, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm liking it. I'm enjoying I like the NFTs.
00:13:21.950 - 00:13:48.120, Speaker C: So you were saying that you go back and watch your own videos and they make you laugh, and for anybody who's followed you, they have seen that some people have made comments about you or your body, the fact that you do yoga. You then will kind of clap back at them through videos. And I was curious how you felt about all that and if you were surprised by it, or if you were hurt, if you thought it was just all in good fun or what.
00:13:49.770 - 00:13:59.542, Speaker A: I also want to say specifically, that was Bitboy who said that I did some sort of yoga pose in one of my videos.
00:13:59.596 - 00:14:04.870, Speaker C: And he pose. I'm a former yoga instructor. Nice job on the crow pose.
00:14:04.950 - 00:14:11.002, Speaker A: Thank you. And his reply was so weird. It was like, yoga is for girls, or something. Like, okay.
00:14:11.136 - 00:14:16.574, Speaker C: Oh, please, there's so many guys that do yoga. I know tons of guys who do yoga well.
00:14:16.612 - 00:14:56.138, Speaker A: Yeah. And then the next video was like, bit boy, can you even touch your toes? I don't think so. Right? So a lot of people feel like they have an outlet to say, I have a big belly, man, boobies, whatever it is. And listen, I am overweight. I mean, I have a belly, what am I going to do about it? But I don't think there's any reason to be ashamed of it. If you go on TikTok right now or Twitter, whatever, you'll see 100 guys with their shirts off. Most of them, 99% of them have these ABS, like they're like Thor or something.
00:14:56.138 - 00:15:25.890, Speaker A: But that's just not realistic. That's not a real person. There's very few people that actually have that type of body, but we see it on TikTok as if it's every single person. So I think it's kind of interesting. It's kind of funny, like, to put a guy who's not in the best shape doesn't have six pack ABS or shirtless. Why? It's just it's all part of the agree.
00:15:25.960 - 00:15:35.894, Speaker C: I would agree. So your wife, Lee Eller, has gotten in on this and she's been posting funny videos of her own, and I was curious how that all got started.
00:15:36.092 - 00:16:11.762, Speaker A: Yeah, Lee has been she is an artist, she's a musician, an actress before we even met. And she made songs for many, many years ago, music videos. So she knows about making content. So it's not something that is foreign to her. But yeah, I've just been making videos and she's always been supportive and she's always happy to tag along and do her own thing and join in on the fun. So it's been awesome. And I like that it gives a different perspective to the videos I make.
00:16:11.762 - 00:16:34.460, Speaker A: Like, you can see a guy in the snow with a machete yelling about something, but then you see it from outside the window and my wife is talking about it. It's very funny. It gives that alternate view, which I think adds another dimension to the universe of Gabe, of the Haynes family, if you will. But yeah, it's been awesome.
00:16:35.070 - 00:16:56.770, Speaker C: Yeah, between the two of you, it gets very meta watching the videos. It's super fun. So we talked a little bit about how NFTs could be beneficial for creators, but your actual job is around Web Three media, and I was curious to hear a little bit more about that. What's your vision there? How do you think Web Three will change media? What does it offer that people can't get on the traditional version of the Internet?
00:16:57.750 - 00:17:40.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of empowerment in being able to be directly supported by your fans. I mean, just even a couple days ago, I made a video about someone posted a TikTok video of SBF running down the street in the Bahamas. And I very quickly made a kind of a reaction video to that. Someone asked, this is just a couple of days ago, someone asked, can you mint this? Can I collect this? So I said, sure. I put up ten NFTs for 0.5 E each and it sold out within an hour. Okay, now that's a few hundred dollars.
00:17:40.320 - 00:18:57.702, Speaker A: I'm not going to be rich from it, but if you are a content creator in any other industry outside of crypto, if you're a chef, whatever it is, you're not going to be making a few hundred dollars from a video that you just made a couple of hours ago. It will be almost impossible. Unless you have sponsors or whatever, you're not going to get that support natively from any platform. Not TikTok, not Twitter, not YouTube, nothing. And the ability for fans who support my work to support me directly, it feels really good and it gives me the confidence and the support to be able to keep on doing this. Because a few hundred dollars, it could be today, but it could be a couple of years from now, if I keep growing, could be a million dollars for an NFT. Why not? If someone sees the value? So I really think that the future of Web Three allows is that connection between the creators and the audience, and it's that direct, no intermediary connection, which is very powerful and which allows the market to actually decide who is bringing value and who is not.
00:18:57.702 - 00:19:04.838, Speaker A: Not an algorithm doesn't have to decide, just individuals who find value in what is being created.
00:19:05.014 - 00:19:19.760, Speaker C: Awesome. I love it. As a creator myself, I think there's a lot that Web Three hopefully will bring to creators. So this episode will come out the day after Thanksgiving in the US. I was wondering if there's any crypto related holiday message you want to give people?
00:19:20.290 - 00:19:40.680, Speaker A: Buy turkey coin? No, I don't know. Enjoy the time with family. Enjoy the time with friends. You're probably going to be not going to be treated very well by the people that you convinced to buy Crypto over the past year. But, hey, that's okay. It comes with the territory. Just have a nice time, relax, enjoy.
00:19:43.050 - 00:19:50.978, Speaker C: I totally agree with everything you said. All right, Gabriel. Well, it's been so fun having you on Unchained. Thanks for coming on the show.
00:19:51.164 - 00:19:52.890, Speaker A: My pleasure. Thank you for having me.
