00:01:04.158 - 00:01:05.858, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:01:06.024 - 00:01:20.440, Speaker A: This has been a crazy week in stock trading, particularly for the video game retailer, you know, has been a mainstay of suburban shopping malls not traditionally thought of at the moment as like a hot stock. So what happened?
00:01:20.970 - 00:02:02.370, Speaker B: Yeah, no, totally. I mean, this has been a completely wild week and what happened was basically a sort of string of events that played out maybe exactly as you would have expected if you sort of thought about it very well. But certainly not as anyone did expect going in. Or at least not as most people did. Which is that some hedge funds got pretty short GameStop because it was basically thought overvalued relative to sort of like earnings or dividend stream or fundamentals. A group of day traders on Wall Street Bets was not happy with that and decided instead to get very long GameStop.
00:02:02.790 - 00:02:06.178, Speaker A: Yeah, with Wall Street bets being a subreddit.
00:02:06.354 - 00:02:07.030, Speaker B: That's right.
00:02:07.100 - 00:02:11.110, Speaker A: And they describe themselves as like four chan with a Bloomberg terminal.
00:02:11.610 - 00:03:28.590, Speaker B: That's basically right. This is very much think the target audience of Robin Hood. And so basically, I don't know if a tug of war is quite right, but I think it's like about right as for how to think of it, which is that over the course of the know, traders on Wall Street Bets just bought more and more GameStop and I mean probably like a billion dollars of it. And at the same time the Bearish hedge funds sold more and more GameStop and got shorter and shorter and the size of the shorts kept getting bigger and the volume kept going up and eventually after about a week of that, it just sort of boiled over. And the resolution, as it turns out, was that there is more buyers than sellers. Wall Street Bets was buying more than the short sellers could short sell and eventually stock price went from 20 to 40 to 60 to 80 to 100 and somewhere along the way, a lot of the hedge funds that were short started getting liquidated, basically, and they started getting margin, called a few of them very prominently. So I think Melvin was maybe the biggest.
00:03:29.410 - 00:03:30.618, Speaker A: Melvin Capital.
00:03:30.794 - 00:04:14.206, Speaker B: Yep. And you know, all of a sudden now you've got Wall Street Bets buying. You've got hedge funds that are buying because they are now basically buying back their shorts forcibly. And so then the price goes to 102 hundred, and it touched 500, I think, at the peak right around the open today, which is an absolutely insane rise. I mean, it's up more than ten X in the last week. And knock is the fundamental news because of the sort of tug of war that happened who ended up ultimately winning it. And so anyways, pretty crazy, but that's what happened.
00:04:14.206 - 00:04:20.480, Speaker B: And the result of this was a lot of hedge funds lost a lot of money.
00:04:21.570 - 00:05:31.174, Speaker A: Yeah, so just some little facts to shore up this tale. Vox reported that there was one Wall Street Bets subredditor who claimed he or she had turned $50,000 into $11 million. And then meanwhile, for this multibillion dollar hedge fund, Melvin Capital, they had to be bailed out with $3 billion from Citadel and point 72 because they had such massive losses. And also, it's just really interesting to see how the establishment financial world is reacting to this because Nasdaq CEO Adina Friedman said on CNBC that if something like this happened in a stock trading on Nasdaq, she would like halt trading in that particular stock. So it was kind of interesting also because on CNBC, the billionaire tech investor Shamath Pala habitilla said that basically the only difference between what Wall Street Bets did versus hedge funds is that they did it transparently in a forum rather than at a quiet dinner in the Hamptons. And he said, quote, what this proves is this retail investor phenomenon is here to stay. There are 2.7
00:05:31.174 - 00:05:53.994, Speaker A: million people inside Wall Street bets. I think they are as important as any hedge or collection of hedge funds. And then, like referring to what has traditionally been called the Wall Street edge, he said, quote, that edge is gone. Now all of a sudden, retail can be on the same footing and they don't have to be the bag holder to Wall Street. So do you agree with that assessment that this is just sort of like upending kind of the traditional way finance works?
00:05:54.192 - 00:06:46.220, Speaker B: I think I agree some pieces of it, and in particular, I definitely agree that this is a really new and powerful phenomenon that doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon. And that really has been brewing for a long time. And I think you can start seeing this with Tesla, where a sort of similar phenomenon played out except over two years instead of two days. And Tesla stock gets up many, many hundreds of percents in the last few years on the back of enormous amounts of buying from, among others, a lot of retail traders and a lot of sort of outsiders from the traditional financial world, a lot of short sellers from the traditional value investors. And eventually, again, one of those sites just won that tug of war. The short sellers had to buy back and it went up even more. And you see this in crypto a lot.
00:06:46.220 - 00:06:52.090, Speaker B: It's sort of interesting. This is the most crypto like behavior I've ever seen from stock markets.
00:06:52.170 - 00:06:56.058, Speaker A: Yeah. So can you actually elaborate on, like, what are the ways in which this.
00:06:56.084 - 00:07:41.982, Speaker B: Is similar to, you know, one way that you can think about a stock if you want, right, is you take Apple and you're like, what is this Apple stock worth? Well, it builds products and it gets revenue from those products and it has expenses. You sort of calculate earnings from that and then those will eventually turn into dividends and you use some time discounting rate or inflation rate or something like that, and you're like, all right, what are 20 years worth of earnings going to be? And you're like, yeah, $1.5 trillion is our estimate of that, of the dividends over the next 20 years. And so that's what the stock is worth. And obviously I'm sort of like oversimplifying it. But at its core, that's sort of one way that you can think about pricing a stock. And if that's the way you're thinking about it, right, if Apple stops trading at $100 billion, you just buy it all.
00:07:41.982 - 00:08:25.120, Speaker B: You're like buying it and getting 15 times the dividend stream. That's great. And if it's trading at $20 trillion, you short sell it because it's trading at way too high of a price, like a sort of price that makes no economic sense and it's probably a bubble and going to fall back down. And there's sort of a group of firms that think in a way that has a lot to do with that, and obviously there's more nuances to what they're doing, but that's sort of the core approach. Another way that you can think of it is it's a ticker, it trades, there are buyers and sellers and it goes up if there are more buyers, and it goes down if there are more sellers. And say what you will about fundamentals or dividends or revenue or whatever, those are just words. If there's a lot of buyers, it goes up, and if there are a lot of sellers, it goes down.
00:08:25.120 - 00:09:02.940, Speaker B: Both of those are important effects for markets. But you look at crypto markets, right, and for most tokens, there's not dividends or revenue. It's not like bitcoin is a yield bearing token. It's a different sort of thing and it's much more akin to the order flow based thing, where the use case of Bitcoin is people wanting it and the failure case is no one wants it and so it goes up if people buy it, and down if people sell it. And so that's very much the order flow based version of it. And that's what we've seen some stocks start to turn into more of a representation of.
00:09:03.950 - 00:09:18.142, Speaker A: Yeah. What it reminds me of is how people do like to look at that network value to transaction value ratio, but there is like a band within which the price tends to go. That's right.
00:09:18.196 - 00:09:35.394, Speaker B: And it's also asymmetric. And I think this is a really interesting part of it. If you look at Apple, right, so I told this story about if it went down to 100 billion, market cap on, no news. I think buying it's just great. Right. You're just buying this valuable company and you just get its dividends and you make money. Right.
00:09:35.394 - 00:10:06.286, Speaker B: The other side doesn't work so well, necessarily. If it goes to $20 trillion and you short it because you're like, okay, this is only ever going to make $2 trillion, there's no reason for it to trade at $20 trillion. Well, it's not like you can just sit there short forever owing dividends. That's not going to help you. Right. If you're shorting it, you're sort of hoping that the market corrects to what you think fair value is. And so while there's this sort of arbitrage on the buy side where if you buy something below its economic underlying value, it's just good.
00:10:06.286 - 00:10:13.140, Speaker B: If you sell it above that, I don't know, maybe there's additional value because people like buying it, knowing it, and maybe that's not going to go away anytime soon.
00:10:13.830 - 00:10:24.210, Speaker A: Yeah. When you short, your losses are infinite because if it just keeps going up and up but what you can gain is limited.
00:10:24.710 - 00:10:31.880, Speaker B: And that's not to say you should never short something, but you can't sort of have this rock solid proof that shorting something is ever good.
00:10:32.650 - 00:10:52.982, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk a little bit more about how this relates to crypto. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn and spend crypto all in one place.

00:11:11.886 - 00:11:34.106, Speaker A: Bankman fried. So another factor in this is that the hedge funds had actually shorted 136% of GameStop shares, which meant that they needed to buy back more of the stock than existed to cover their losses. And so that just kind of further drove up the price. How would a financial system that's built on blockchain technology affect the ability for investors to do that?
00:11:34.288 - 00:12:33.242, Speaker B: It's a really good question, and the answer is sort of like it depends on how it's built. And in particular the sort of thing that plays the role of Goldman Sachs's borrow lending desk in crypto is something like Compound or Ave or one of the other sort of borrow lending type protocols where you can see a similar effect of people want to get leveraged long or leveraged short. So if you want to get long you buy it and then you can lend it out and other people can borrow it and short sell it. And you can actually get a similar thing where it just cycles through a lot and you get this mountain of shorts building up and sort of like mountain of longs building up. But it depends on the parameters of the protocol and what it allows, what sort of leverage it allows, what its liquidation parameters are, how much collateral people have. You can build the same structures in DeFi and people will. But there's this question at the end of the day of what actually happens in practice.
00:12:33.242 - 00:13:36.882, Speaker B: And one interesting thing is let's sort of ignore short selling without a borrow just generally only a thing you can do very temporarily in financial markets. In order for the world to be able to get very short they need to be borrowing, right? Somehow they need to actually be finding a physical person with a bunch of GameStop shares that they can go short sell, that they can borrow and short sell and then have a debt of them. And where are they getting it from? Like whose shares are they selling exactly? The answer probably is Wall Street bets, probably. And I don't know what's going on behind the scenes but if I had to guess to tie this story up, something like a lot of traders are buying GameStop. They're buying it with one of these various retail platforms, whether it's Robinhood or E Trade or something like that. They get credited within their account. The platform as one way make money, engages with some borrow lending desk, loans out the shares that they have on their platform and then the hedge funds on the other side of the trade borrow those and short sell them.
00:13:36.882 - 00:14:06.220, Speaker B: And so it's a very bespoke, mysterious process in traditional finance where these shares come from, it's often quite surprising. In crypto it's much more transparent. And there's just a question that people getting long, what would they do? Would they in fact take whatever they're getting long and put it in a borrow lending protocol to get interest? And if they do, then someone could borrow them to short sell. If they don't, then all of a sudden there's a lot less available supply for people to borrow and short.
00:14:08.190 - 00:14:16.640, Speaker A: Okay, so what you're saying is just depending on how these DeFi protocols are built, that would influence whether or not.
00:14:17.250 - 00:14:32.866, Speaker B: It would influence a lot and depending on what the buyers if the buyers chose to lend out their tokens or if they chose just to put it in their MetaMask account. And that would also have a big impact on whether how big of short positions people could put on.
00:14:33.048 - 00:14:42.294, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just trying to think about how this would interplay with something like the yield farming craze where people were being incentivized to do that.
00:14:42.412 - 00:14:47.686, Speaker B: It's super interesting and probably a lot of people will lend them out right.
00:14:47.788 - 00:14:49.746, Speaker A: Because they're getting especially if they're big incentive.
00:14:49.778 - 00:15:06.400, Speaker B: Yeah, right, exactly. It's like we'll pay you and trust me, I think that they could get a lot for this. At the peak, how much do you think people were willing to pay to short GameStop? I bet a lot of people were paying a percent a day or something. I don't know if it quite got that high, but very high.
00:15:07.010 - 00:15:08.618, Speaker A: You're talking about the hedge funds?
00:15:08.714 - 00:15:43.846, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. What they're paying now, I don't know if they actually work because again, this market is really weird and in fact it's not like an open order book. It's like they call up Goldman's like, yo, what's the borrow rate? And some guy's like five bips and that's like how it's what's it who's loaning out people on Robinhood who aren't getting paid any interest and aren't even aware of it. So it's like a sort of arbitrary market in DeFi. It's a lot more transparent. And there's a sort of negotiation between buyers and borrowers about how much interest do they have to be paid in order to loan out their shares.
00:15:43.958 - 00:15:56.830, Speaker A: Right. So there's kind of more knowledge for the two people in the negotiation and it's more direct. So that maybe would potentially lead hopefully would lead to more rational outcomes.
00:15:57.170 - 00:16:06.974, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it might. And at the very least it would probably lead in interest being paid to the people poor long instead of just being entirely soaked up by the middlemen.
00:16:07.102 - 00:16:19.240, Speaker A: Right. Which is also in my mind at least, to benefit a nice democratization of finance, which is supposedly the goal of crypto, although I don't know if it's been borne out yet.
00:16:20.090 - 00:16:29.370, Speaker B: Maybe it's making some progress in some places. I wouldn't say it's drilling straight towards that goal. It's taken some detours on food token lane.
00:16:31.710 - 00:16:43.550, Speaker A: Vegetable farming lane. So FTX actually then quickly moved to list a tokenized version of GME. Yeah. What are you seeing with that? And tell me a little bit about what led you to do that.
00:16:43.700 - 00:17:16.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, in the end when we think about what products to offer on FTX, we want to offer what people want to trade. That is like the most fundamental answer to what we want to offer. We want what our customer wants and we could design our favorite product in the world. Super cool. In a lot of ways. No one wants to use it. It's just taking up space on the site and there could be a product we think is stupid and we don't get why anyone cares about this, but if it's what everyone cares about, then that's where we say no.
00:17:16.310 - 00:17:49.710, Speaker B: And so when we sort of woke up today, you can probably guess what social media feeds were saying. You can probably guess what messages we were getting. No one was saying, like, hey guys, here's some 2018 all coins that you haven't listed. Could you kind of round that out a bit? And there are days where people ask for that, right? Because there are days when that's what's happened. Not today. Today everyone was asking for GameStop. And then once we list that, everyone was asking for BlackBerry, everyone was asking for AMC, for Nokia.
00:17:49.710 - 00:18:36.638, Speaker B: We were really just thinking, what is the product that would make people most excited to use our platform? And can we offer that in a reasonable way? And as it turns out, we can. Because of this partnership with Dag and CM Equity, we can offer stocks to our users. Super exciting, and so we could just go ahead and launch them. And we're not a huge organization in terms of people. We're way smaller than many other exchanges, but we're way leaner and quicker moving. And so it's a lot harder for us to take on things we don't think are important and just kind of grind out mediocrely designed pieces to the site. We're very limited on that.
00:18:36.638 - 00:18:47.554, Speaker B: But if there's a few big things that we think are super valuable to get out today, we can just get on a zoom call and quickly repurpose everyone in like five minutes to churn something out. Yeah.
00:18:47.592 - 00:18:53.080, Speaker A: And then so how does that work on the back end? You mentioned this partnership, so how does that enable this?
00:18:53.930 - 00:19:39.318, Speaker B: So there are sort of two pieces to this. One is the customer facing piece, and the other is like the actual stocks, the customer facing piece. One of the cool things is they're actually not really that different. It's just another ticker trading on a market on Know. What's the difference between AMC March features and Link March features? From the technological point of view, they're the same thing, right? A market order book, matching engine, risk engine, GUI API. And that's one of the super powerful things about exchanges. And something that we sort of realized somewhat early on is that almost every part of FTX can be repurposed to trade almost any product.
00:19:39.318 - 00:20:59.146, Speaker B: And it's just, tech wise, super simple. And so whether that's crypto stock, fiat, currencies prediction markets, or anything else and so then there's the back end, which is, all right, sure, we labeled it GME. Why does that have anything to do with GameStop? It can't just be three letters that sort of evoke memories of a stock. And that's the tricky part, obviously, with this. What we did is over the summer formed a partnership with a regulated German financial institution, which basically has the licensing to offer, among other things, equities to global customers and so they have all of the licensing necessary to offer the equities. They don't have the venue, but they have the licensing and they have the equities accounts and in fact, they have the licensing to offer tokenized equities and we have the exchange. And so basically they custody the actual equities and potentially they and us face customers in these trades and then tokens are issued which basically represent those equities.
00:20:59.146 - 00:21:33.242, Speaker B: And then it's those tokens that you can trade on FTX and what ultimately ties them is that you can create and redeem them. So you can create your account with Dag and CM Equity and then go buy tokenized Apple on FTX and then transfer that to CM Equity and then actually get it credited as literal Apple stock in your brokerage account and vice versa. And so it's a little bit clunky of a process right now, but you can do it, you can sort of know, convert between the tokens on FTX and equities in your brokerage account.
00:21:33.376 - 00:21:44.026, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. And then also with your index for the Wall Street that's favorites. So then if you were to cash that in, you would get individual shares of each of the companies in the index.
00:21:44.138 - 00:22:27.830, Speaker B: If it were a spot product, that's how it would work as it turns out, for simplicity's sake. Instead it's a cash settled future, which settles to a weighted index of the FTX markets on those markets. So it settles. Know the average of the Nokia market and know AMC market and the GameStop market and things like that, but you can still basically do that full trade eventually, where you buy the future, you hedge it at Expiration by buying the basket on FTX. And that sort of guarantees that you actually get the price you paid for the future. And then you go take those and you redeem them. And so it is in the same way that bitcoin futures ultimately can sort of be turned into a bitcoin because they expire to the value of a bitcoin.
00:22:27.830 - 00:22:34.090, Speaker B: You could ultimately kind of do that arbitrage to convert these futures into the actual underlying equities.
00:22:34.250 - 00:22:48.338, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. All right. Yeah, well, just one other development that I wanted to note here was that Robinhood now is restricting trading and things like GME. And do you what do you think that move says?
00:22:48.504 - 00:22:55.042, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm obviously super interested in what's going on behind the scenes and what they're being told and I mean, maybe they're just things we're not seeing.
00:22:55.096 - 00:23:00.438, Speaker A: Right, but you mean some kind of like regulatory exactly.
00:23:00.604 - 00:23:39.682, Speaker B: I'm sure the SEC is talking to them and I don't know what's happening in those conversations, but it's a weird move and it's particularly so whole thing trading is the thing that happens in stocks and in some cases can be reasonable. Right. Some stock is going through completely wacky price movement and I think a reasonable approach you could take is look, people should be able to trade what they want. But sometimes bots have bad parameters and just go haywire and get in these feedback loops and just turn it off and on again and give a hard reset to the market for five minutes just to break any sort of unnatural feedback loops that no one wanted. And then if people really do just want to keep buying, they can just keep buying. Right?
00:23:39.736 - 00:23:51.426, Speaker A: Right. Actually, the way I phrased it was wrong because it's not that they restricted trading, it's that they prohibit people now from purchasing. But you can still sell. That's very weird.
00:23:51.458 - 00:24:08.042, Speaker B: It's very different than what you normally see. Right? Yeah. The five minute circuit breaker is totally defensible. This only go one direction. Trading is not something that I've encountered really before. And when you see it, it's always because of weird. Okay.
00:24:08.042 - 00:24:26.830, Speaker B: You hit a price band, right. It's up so much on the day they can't go up anymore for 15 minutes. Okay. Those rules have their issues in a lot of cases, but at least after 15 minutes, it gets lifted and then you could do whatever you want again. And it's like an automated thing. This was not that at all. This was clearly like a human judgment call unrelated to specific price points or amount movements.
00:24:26.830 - 00:24:28.914, Speaker B: Like, all right, no more buying. Yeah.
00:24:28.952 - 00:24:31.214, Speaker A: It feels like somebody putting their thumb on the scale.
00:24:31.342 - 00:25:02.282, Speaker B: Yeah, it does. And it's weird. This is not something I was on Wall Street for three and a half years and traded a bunch of equities, and I don't think I've ever seen this before. I can't remember having seen it, at least not in the United States. And a lot of people took issue to it. And I kind of see why they it's sort of like biasing markets in a particular direction. It's sort of like not normally what regulators or exchanges are meant to do.
00:25:02.282 - 00:25:31.074, Speaker B: And it's not clear there's like a principled reason for it. I sort of think I can guess why they wanted to do it. But it's not something you usually see people doing because they kind of think it's what they should do or something. It's not usually how markets work, I will note. So one thing I will notice that they didn't do the really bad thing. The really bad thing that you could imagine them having done in a different directional thing is like some people have shares of it and restricting selling so they can't sell their shares. And that's terrifying.
00:25:31.074 - 00:25:50.666, Speaker B: Right. So you've invested in something and then there's banned from selling it out. And I mean, that's like a super scarce investor. This was just stopping people from opening up positions. I still don't want to defend it. It's not the worst thing they could have done, but it doesn't feel great at all.
00:25:50.768 - 00:26:33.046, Speaker A: No. Because I just noticed just from today alone, the price of GameStop had an open of 265. It hit that high you mentioned of it was actually 482, at least according to one of my apps, and then it plunged to a low of 112 and it's currently at about 230 something. And by the way, we're recording at like noonish or 01:00 p.m. For listeners on Thursday, 01:00 p.m. Eastern, but I'm a little bit like, wait, is that part of why you know what I mean? It had that crazy crash because think about it, from 42 down to 112, is it only because people could only sell and there weren't people on the other side that could buy? And I don't know, and I don't know how big of an influence Robin.
00:26:33.078 - 00:26:46.478, Speaker B: Hood would be, but anyway, yeah, I think the straightforward answer to that, yeah, very well may have been that would be a pretty straightforward answer and that'd be my next guess, is that is what was going on and it went down. People weren't allowed to buy, but they were allowed to sell.
00:26:46.564 - 00:26:49.200, Speaker A: Yeah. So people got screwed, which I feel.
00:26:50.850 - 00:27:19.974, Speaker B: Not it's not a good look on the part of Robin Hood or the Raiders or whoever it was who sort of ultimately made this call, and it's not a normal one, and it's also not something where they kind of preannounced ahead of time. Like, this is how this works. Something goes up too much, we're going to stop buying. If they'd announce that, at least they're sort of like everyone understood the informed risk, right? It's not even what you would guess might happen here.
00:27:20.092 - 00:27:29.446, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, so last bit, I just want to know, how do you think this is going to end? Do you think the hedge funds or the retail investors will ultimately be the winners?
00:27:29.638 - 00:28:42.174, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an interesting question and one thing that I do want to say is that Wall Street is not a singular entity. There's a lot of different types of firms there and this is sort of a classic thing where you look at an industry from the outside and you sort of average it together and you're like, that's what it's like, right? And then you go in there and you talk to someone in there and they give this rant about someone else in the industry and you're like, you two are the same. In my mind, I was putting you in the same group, but apparently you cannot stand this other guy and think they're scum of the earth. And now I'm trying to figure out what's going on and the answer is, like, I mean, everyone has their own frame of reference and ultimately, what do I think here? It's going to have really different effects on different players in Wall Street. We've been talking about a particular type of financial entity there, or a few particular ones, one of which is this value investing hedge fund that sort of looks at revenue streams, prices equities off of them and then gets long or short based on that and. This is not a great trend for that type of hedge fund. Like, this is further dislodging stocks from their model of them and making it more based on supply and demand.
00:28:42.174 - 00:29:08.970, Speaker B: So that's one side that certainly is not looking so good right now. It's not looking good necessarily for some intermediaries, robinhood being an obvious example. I mean, this could have been their best day ever. And there's actually a little bit of a pattern right now, like the last four days, that could have been their best day ever. How did they end? They all ended quite poorly for Robin Hood. She's pretty. I'm, like, actually kind of surprised.
00:29:08.970 - 00:30:03.550, Speaker B: So remember the busiest day ever on the retail buying craze of hertz and stuff back in spring and Robin Hood just crapped out and was off for the day. And as soon as crypto gets very busy, they run out of crypto for the day and turn it off. And I mean, today should have been their best bidet ever in history. They should have made, like, $50 million today of revenue and certainly is not a great ending for them. And I think it's, like, starting to create this pattern. And I don't really know exactly what the sort of root cause that leads to all of those are, but this has been a great year for Robinhood, but it's not been a great follow through on the biggest moments. And I keep saying Robinhood is emblematic, but I think similar things are happening with a lot of products in the space.
00:30:03.550 - 00:30:47.066, Speaker B: This, I think, bears a lot of resemblance to something we saw in late 2018 with crypto derivatives exchanges where they were making a crap ton of money. Still are. More than half of all volume was flowing through two exchanges. In fact, more than half of all crypto volume was flowing through the derivatives components of two exchanges and they were completely incapable of handling it. I mean, one of them would just crash whenever volume got large, which is exactly when they're most important and when they could be doing the best and making the most money. And the other couldn't handle big market moves. They lost $300 million to improperly liquidating accounts in a single year.
00:30:47.066 - 00:31:04.270, Speaker B: Or rather, they didn't lose it. They imposed that loss upon their customers. And those are pretty big fuck ups. It was late 2018. We were sort of staring at this and feeling like, geez, these are like, probably the two most central entities to crypto.
00:31:05.090 - 00:31:06.382, Speaker A: Which two are you talking about?
00:31:06.436 - 00:31:08.638, Speaker B: Yes, it's BitMEX and OKEx at the time.
00:31:08.724 - 00:31:09.118, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:09.204 - 00:31:53.774, Speaker B: And these are processing more than half of all volume in the entire industry and they're really struggling with it. And why is that? Is it endemic to the task? And it is a tricky task, but I think that wasn't all of it. And obviously, eventually we're just like, Fuck it, I think we can do this. I think we can do it. Better and that's the reason FTX exists. It was the sort of day after the biggest fiasco of 2018 with derivatives exchanges, which was the worst settlement of a future I've ever heard of. On bitcoin cash features hilariously bad on 1 hour notice, expired a future two days before it was scheduled to expire, and they expired it to the futures price instead of the index price.
00:31:53.774 - 00:32:34.746, Speaker B: And the index was the wrong index and it was a limit up price. There's like six reasons why it was. Anyway, so I just moved to Hong Kong, and that happened and sort of sitting there and I mean, we've been playing around with this idea in our heads for a little while, but that was actually the final straw and called up Gary and flew him out. And that's when we started making like I don't know, I think there's some of that going on here where this is legitimately putting a ton of stress on these businesses. But also, I don't know, I kind of think they could be handling it better than they are and I think there's an opening there.
00:32:34.928 - 00:33:12.060, Speaker A: Yeah, this has just happened time and time again in Crypto where things blow up and then they bump up against the scaling limits of whatever it is that they're using, whether it's ethereum and the ICO craze or the CryptoKitty craze or the actual exchanges. Know, Coinbase even recently has been having a lot of outages. All right, okay, well, super interesting what you just said about the history of FTX or the inspiration for it. All right, well, I think we're going to have to see where this goes. And by the way, crypto people, I also want to let you know that Dogecoin is somehow involved in this.
00:33:14.110 - 00:33:19.980, Speaker B: And they turn off buying on Dogecoin. That can't have been the SEC, right? I don't know.
00:33:20.670 - 00:33:26.622, Speaker A: Anyway, all right, well, you know, we're well past time, but thank you so much for coming on and confirmed this was super fun.
00:33:26.756 - 00:33:28.334, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:34:05.590 - 00:34:48.070, Speaker A: Get started today@sunexchange.com. That's Sunexchange.com. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline. As revealed in mid December, coinbase will go public later this year. On Thursday, the Crypto Exchange stated it intended to do so via a direct listing rather than an IPO in a direct listing instead of new shares being created and sold to the public, only existing outstanding shares will be sold. This is not only a less expensive process, but also enables Coinbase to avoid certain restrictions that must be followed with an IPO, such as lockup periods that keep insiders from selling their shares.
00:34:48.070 - 00:36:00.222, Speaker A: Next headline. More institutional investors pile into Bitcoin. Bill Miller of Miller Value Partners and the former chairman of Leg Mason wrote for Miller Value Partners Q four 2020 letter that it had purchased shares of MicroStrategy's zero point 75% convertible bond after a detailed analysis of why it believes in Bitcoin's promise as well as a rebuttal of common criticisms of the cryptocurrency. He writes that the MicroStrategy bond offered, quote, very little downside and an almost free call option on bitcoin. Meanwhile, CoinDesk reports that the Harvard, Yale, Brown and University of Michigan endowments have been buying bitcoin directly on Coinbase and other exchanges, a fact that was alluded to in Coinbase Institutional's 2020 Year in Review because of the institutional demand for bitcoin exposure. Pantera Capital, one of the oldest funds in the space, is launching a new fund in the next few months for institutional bitcoin investors, the block reports. Next headline ethereum 2020 Year in Review transferring more value than Bitcoin Josh Stark of the Ethereum Foundation and Evan Van Ness of the Weekend Ethereum newsletter published a 2020 year in Review for the second largest blockchain by market cap.
00:36:00.222 - 00:37:05.150, Speaker A: The first takeaway was that 2020 was the year was the first year in which Ethereum transferred the most value $1.6 trillion worth of assets 60% more than bitcoin's $1 trillion worth of assets. Transaction fees on Ethereum, at more than $600 million were also almost double that of bitcoin's. Another trend cited was the growing creator economy on Ethereum, with crypto art volume totaling $23 million, which sounds small but makes it about 5% of the $500 million paid out by Patreon to its creators in 2019. The report also noted the rise in decentralized exchanges, with volumes averaging between $17 billion and $26 billion in the fall. Coinbase's Institutional 2020 Year Year in Review report also saw an increased number of institutional clients investing in Ether, which will also get a boost next month when CME launches Ether futures contracts. CoinDesk quotes Dennis Vinakurov, head of research at Digital Asset Prime broker Bequan, who says that many see ETH as a way to get indirect exposure to DeFi protocols.
00:37:05.150 - 00:37:53.330, Speaker A: He says, quote, not everyone is comfortable with the risks that are still associated with DeFi, but the hypergrowth of these projects boosts activity on the Ethereum network and thus supports capital appreciation. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation and Reddit announced a partnership to, quote, help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large scale applications like community points on Ethereum. Next headline. Grayscale files for several new trusts, including some in DeFi. On Wednesday, Grayscale Investments, the largest digital asset manager filed for five new trusts for crypto assets ave, Cosmos, Polkadot, Monero and Cardano. Over the weekend. CoinDesk reported that Grayscale had also registered trust for chainlink decentraland Livepeer tezos and filecoin.
00:37:53.330 - 00:38:50.274, Speaker A: It's perhaps not surprising that a few of these are DeFi. Related the block reports that OTC desks are seeing an uptick in interest in DFI. Genesis is seeing trades in DFI coins such as uni, CRV and sushi, richard Rosenblum, the founder of GSR Trading, said quote now that Bitcoin has had time to calm down, people are looking for the next thing to invest in. Similarly, volumes on DEXes hit $45 billion in January, more than double compared to December. Next Headline Paradigm's Guide to Optimistic Rollups Paradigm published an in depth explainer on how optimistic roll ups work. It starts with the problem of the system wanting to scale without losing its properties of low cost and low trust, both of which help keep the system decentralized. It explains that the route optimistic rollups take in scaling is to limit onchain transactions and to use fraud proofs to cancel invalid.
00:38:50.274 - 00:40:14.980, Speaker A: Quote state transitions or changes to the state of the blockchain since fraud proofs are onchain. It also has a method to decentivize fraud called a fidelity bond that's required from so called sequencers, who store and execute the off chain transactions and submit a minimal amount of data about them, called merkel routes to the Ethereum blockchain. If a sequencer's data is proven to show fraud, then that bond would be slashed and distributed to the so called verifiers, whose role is to watch out for fraud. It's a complex system, but Paradigm does a great job of explaining how it works for those inclined to learn more about what is likely to be the short to medium term scaling solution for Ethereum. Next Headline for the math minded Vitalik's Introduction to ZK Snarks Another potential scaling solution for blockchains is ZK snarks, which Vitalik Buterin the creator of Ethereum recently cited as the most promising long term solution as the technology improves. This week, in a new blog post dedicated specifically to ZK snarks, he explains how they make possible solutions to two problems that blockchains face scalability and privacy. As he describes it, quote A Zksnarc allows you to generate a proof that some computation has some particular output in such a way that the proof can be verified extremely quickly, even if the underlying computation takes a very long time to run.
00:40:14.980 - 00:40:56.910, Speaker A: Also, he adds, and this is the part that makes it a potential privacy solution. Quote the ZK, or zero knowledge part adds an additional feature the proof can keep some of the inputs to the computation hidden. He says that this would make it possible to prove that you have the right to transfer some asset without revealing which asset you received. He says quote this security without unduly leaking information about who is transacting with whom to the public, those are the main takeaways. But for those interested in the details about how this works. He does go into more detail, but just a warning that it does require a fair bit of math. Time for fun bits.
00:40:56.910 - 00:41:24.360, Speaker A: Crypto Twitter can't stop with GameStop. If, like me, you can't get enough of this game of chicken between redditors and the zero 1%, here is a roundup of choice tweets from Crypto Twitter. Author and speaker Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted time to regulate outsider trading lol. Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs. Tweeted 2008. Too big to fail. 2021 too small to win.
00:41:24.360 - 00:41:59.790, Speaker A: Jake Sharvinsky, general counsel at Compound Labs, tweeted imagine the SEC denying a Bitcoin ETF proposal because of market manipulation concerns. After all this, Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, tweeted if I was the CEO of GameStop, the next move would be to purchase Bitcoin and put it on the balance sheet. Many took the opportunity to promote DFI with Ryan Adams tweeting. Robinhood just banned GameStop and AMC. The wrong people are winning, so they delisted the assets. Here's what they don't know. They just recruited another 1 million people into DFI.
00:41:59.790 - 00:42:14.022, Speaker A: Uniswap. Not Robinhood. Protocols, not banks. This is why we go bankless. And finally, Suna Amaz of Vault Capital. Tweeted robinhood isn't fit to be called that anymore. All right, well, thanks for tuning in.
