00:00:00.490 - 00:00:03.582, Speaker A: When I spoke with John in person at a debtwire event.
00:00:03.636 - 00:00:04.382, Speaker B: In New York.
00:00:04.516 - 00:00:06.298, Speaker A: He was pretty candid that, hey, we're.
00:00:06.314 - 00:00:07.518, Speaker B: Going to look into all this stuff.
00:00:07.604 - 00:00:30.662, Speaker A: But at the end of the day, I don't really care if we restart or not. I just want to get 100% repay for creditors, and I'm going to try whatever means I can to get that. I think, of course, they're entertaining it if someone's going to make $200 million cash in the balance sheet and we'll run everything and there's high confidence around that, I think he's going to be very open to that.
00:00:30.716 - 00:00:31.446, Speaker B: So the.
00:00:31.468 - 00:00:32.214, Speaker A: Process right now.
00:00:32.252 - 00:00:33.154, Speaker B: Is a little ad hoc.
00:00:33.202 - 00:00:52.250, Speaker A: It's not very streamlined. What will happen, Laura, is if you get one bid very similar to Celsius, that kind of sets the tone for the structure that people want to see or what the estate's willing to accept. Then you'll see people reading that offer and saying, like, oh, that's really good. We can do better than that. And so you'll see topping offers.
