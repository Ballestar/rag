00:01:05.278 - 00:01:07.940, Speaker B: Hi, Laura, thanks so much for having me here.
00:01:08.470 - 00:01:17.762, Speaker A: You recently wrote a report on Asia's crypto landscape. Can you give us a broad overview of why and how Asia is such an important geography in crypto?
00:01:17.906 - 00:02:12.630, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Actually my background is traditional finance and I spent maybe about 15 years focused on equities in terms of all the companies or sorry, all the countries in Asia Pacific. So I was always very well acquainted with the cultures and also the different politics and macroeconomic structures of the different countries. Sometimes what I take for granted in terms of understanding the market, I find that a lot of my colleagues or a lot of my friends in the US or Europe might not necessarily know what's happening in Asia. And so I think a couple of interesting pointers is that, for example, by December last year, 42% of the market cap of the top 20 tokens that actually had a headquarters basically was from Asia. I think chain analysis also said that 43% of global transactions are from Asia. And then also a lot of Asian companies basically dominate the future space.
00:02:12.630 - 00:02:40.430, Speaker B: So 98% of futures is based in Asia. I think people don't understand that Tether is based in Asia. Polka Dot has a lot of supporters in Asia, and so a lot of tokens might see a lot of funding from Asian investors and Asian companies, although I think the media mostly picks up US and Europe. And so I think this, I guess, report tries to cover some of the stuff that we might miss in Asia.
00:02:41.170 - 00:02:56.126, Speaker A: Yeah, something that struck me in your report was you said that Asia accounts for 98% of ETH futures volumes and 94% of BTC futures volumes. Why does Asia so completely dominate the trading volume in futures?
00:02:56.318 - 00:03:29.898, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess that probably is like part human capital and part like the genesis. So if you think about it, so, like for, you know, FTX, these are big companies that are in Hong kong. And I think you have a huge concentration of financial services in Hong Kong, probably second to New York City. And you also have, I guess, a lot of regulation shaping how companies know. Until November. Last year, regulation was optional in Hong Kong. So now the SFC has made a proposal where that would no longer be optional.
00:03:29.898 - 00:03:51.910, Speaker B: But as a result, you see a ton of companies have extremely exciting products. For example, like BitMEX created the first auto deleveraging product. FTX is very innovative and very quick also to introduce new products. And I think that's just a background of where Hong Kong is in terms of being a financial hub.
00:03:52.410 - 00:04:10.250, Speaker A: Yeah, we saw how quickly FTX moved to capitalize on the GameStop momentum. That was know, obviously I just called out the difference in the futures volumes. And would you cite any other different trading behaviors that seem to be different between east and west?
00:04:11.150 - 00:04:41.950, Speaker B: I think in terms of trading know, I think in the US. And Europe, you see a lot of the decentralized movements, especially DeFi coming from there. You really saw a lot of developers in China are on the back foot in terms of DeFi applications. And I think that's really because there are cultural differences. So, for example, I think in Asia, people are a lot more comfortable with centralization. If you look at Japan, it's okay to like politicians. It's great.
00:04:41.950 - 00:05:26.120, Speaker B: Bankers are seen as great. This is not the same narrative as the west. I think you see, for example, a lot of support of ripple in Japan, in Philippines, because people have no problems with centralization. Yeah, there's a little bit of nuances in terms of different styles and different cultures. Of course, these are just generalists, generalizations of the culture. But yeah, I think you can see where for example, another thing is that privacy tokens are generally not allowed in Asia by regulators. Whereas Zcash might be super popular with my colleagues in the know, among my friends in that we don't really see a lot of talk about privacy tokens on this side of the world.
00:05:26.490 - 00:06:16.386, Speaker A: All right. Yeah. And one other thing that I noticed was it seems like in Asia as well, certain things just around the general culture in tech and investing are different. Like, you cited how Wi Fi penetration there is extremely high and even just technology know, I have relatives who live in Korea, and my parents get annoyed when they come to the US. And then they're like, everything's so backwards here and whatever. But yeah, it was just really interesting reading some of these cultural differences and also the propensity toward gambling in. So, you know, even though we've been talking about Asia just in these generalities, obviously it is a very diverse place.
00:06:16.386 - 00:06:24.758, Speaker A: And reading your report, I was really struck by the differences in regulation across the region. So do you want to just kind of give us an update about that?
00:06:24.924 - 00:06:48.666, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So I think generally, regulation is cautious. So the first to regulate was so if you look at who tried to ban bitcoin so in 2013, Thailand banned bitcoin, china banned bitcoin, 2014, vietnam, 2017, korea, 2018. So now regulation softened, but has been a little bit wait, I'm sorry, korea.
00:06:48.698 - 00:06:50.590, Speaker A: Banned bitcoin in 2018?
00:06:51.010 - 00:07:41.742, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically in January 2018, the ministry of justice banned bitcoin trading, and then they investigated six banks that basically were service providers to crypto exchanges. There was such a big backlash on this that they had to retract their ban, and so they softened it, and they said, okay, in January 2022, there'll be a 20% profit tax on crypto trading. So I think especially this is probably really important for people to realize that the people do have a voice. Like in India when they tried to ban, basically, banking for crypto enterprises as well. The supreme court eventually overturned the reserve bank of India's statement, basically because of lobbying of crypto enterprises and the people there. So people aren't powerless to just accept what regulators are saying.
00:07:41.742 - 00:08:26.670, Speaker B: They are responding, and regulators are also understanding that they have to keep up with the times. I think an example of that is Japan. So Japan was the first to regulate in 2017. Japan has been hacked the most in the world. So you had mount gox, you had coin check, they've been hacked almost a million bitcoin in the past few years, which is a tremendous amount. And despite that, you see a lot of regulation still coming out, and Japanese support is pretty strong, even amongst banks who tend to be sitting on the sidelines and investors and major investors in these crypto exchanges. I would say the biggest difference for all these regulations is probably Hong Kong, because every country has always created a new framework for crypto.
00:08:26.670 - 00:09:03.302, Speaker B: Hong Kong has done something different, where they took the existing financial framework and they actually injected crypto, crypto companies that are licensed, they have to follow all the regulations of other financial companies. Plus they have the added layer of being a crypto company and having to do extra regulations for perhaps being a safe showing that they're safe showing that their leverage requirements are met. So it's actually doubly hard to be, I guess, licensed in Hong Kong. But at the same time, that means that STOs are wide open for digital.
00:09:03.366 - 00:09:09.434, Speaker A: Asset exchanges in, oh, interesting. Security token offerings, you mean?
00:09:09.472 - 00:09:11.130, Speaker B: Yeah, security token offerings.
00:09:11.290 - 00:09:30.814, Speaker A: Okay. And I also was curious, china seems to have a pretty complex relationship to bitcoin. Can you just break down what is discouraged there? What at least, if not outright encouraged, at least flourishes anyway, and just explain what the Chinese regulatory approach is to bitcoin?
00:09:30.862 - 00:10:06.894, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So China, in 2014, they closed down exchanges, banking services, and then they banned finance companies from engaging in bitcoin and other crypto. And in 2017, they banned bitcoin trading and ICOs. So right. Now bitcoin trading is banned, but you can see like hobby and Okx are obviously some of the largest. The way that they structure it is that it's kind of like an Ebay where it's a matching service, but they're not supposed to take custody. So really seller and buyer are supposed to match with each other.
00:10:06.894 - 00:10:16.050, Speaker B: And you have reviews as well, like, oh, this person is really honest and trustworthy and therefore you might get better execution if you have better reviews and five stars rating.
00:10:16.550 - 00:10:18.846, Speaker A: Sort of like a local bitcoin style.
00:10:18.958 - 00:10:19.940, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:10:20.870 - 00:10:25.140, Speaker A: They use an escrow as well, and so people don't necessarily have to meet in.
00:10:26.390 - 00:11:10.338, Speaker B: So, you know, there's lots of different channels in India. This is what they did as well. So, for example, they know we will transact between you two and then I'll do the payment know, maybe through WeChat or through bank transfer, and then I'll click confirm onto the exchange and then they'll let the transaction through. Of course, me not being part of an exchange, maybe I can speak freely that this is obviously not really what happens, that obviously these exchanges take custody, which is not really a letter of the law, but these guys have basically been doing that, which is okay.
00:11:10.424 - 00:11:14.930, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that's how things are done in the world in many places.
00:11:15.350 - 00:11:15.858, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:11:15.944 - 00:11:51.566, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we're going to explore more of what's happening in crypto in the rest of Asia. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Join thousands of people from around the world who are earning bitcoin while creating a more sustainable energy future.

So as you noted earlier, Japan has been through some of the biggest ups, well, sort of ups, but definitely downs in the crypto space with some of the largest hacks in crypto. And also it was the first country to regulate. So right now what would you say is kind of the state of things and how are companies being affected in the markets being affected there?
00:12:25.952 - 00:13:05.702, Speaker B: Yeah, so the state of things right now is that Japan is actually like a world, like two halves, where you've got crypto native companies like Bitfire, for example, and you've got securities broker companies that are trying to enter the crypto space. So these security brokerage companies are big companies. You've heard of SBI SoftBank investment? Although SoftBank, I divested many years ago. GMO is also big. FX trader DMM Rakuten. Rakuten is kind of like the Amazon of Japan. So if you can imagine, say, Amazon going into a crypto exchange, what is different is that these guys aren't really getting market share.
00:13:05.702 - 00:13:45.582, Speaker B: It's really like the crypto native companies that are still gaining market share. So I think adoption is still relatively slow, especially if you think about it. Japan has the largest and most active retail FX trading in the world. So I think there is a lot of potential. But right now penetration isn't there yet. In terms of regulations, I think after the hacking in 2018, coin checks, hacking of like half a billion dollars, regulations and licensing has been quite slowed down. But basically with a new license right now they are making a little bit more difficult for Japanese companies to become licensed.
00:13:45.582 - 00:14:11.520, Speaker B: But that said, there's a ton of lobbying going on by major companies like Daiwa Asset Management to maybe create a bitcoin ETF. I don't want to single out Daiwa because I don't think it's official, but there are a lot of major asset management companies that want to enter crypto and if they do, then the banks will definitely follow because they have to support some of these big companies.
00:14:12.690 - 00:14:31.838, Speaker A: And what about South Korea? This country has the highest per capita involvement in crypto. You said that one third of the workers have invested in crypto, which that's pretty amazing. So what else is happening in the place of the Kimchi premium?
00:14:32.014 - 00:15:30.290, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think different in Korea is that people of all ages, so people's grandmothers, grandfathers, are invested in crypto that you don't really see elsewhere. So people are quite forward. I think that's because Samsung is a big part of Korean, I guess, development in terms of the tech sector, you don't really see any other country that has more police investigations and raids than Korea. They are basically quite cautious because they want to develop, regulators want to develop this market slowly and basically curate it to be a more mature and I guess controlled market. But what happens is that they haven't officially licensed companies yet. They have created a framework. But what they do right now is kind of softly, I guess, creating a license by seeing which companies have proper KYC, which companies have proper AML, and they will be the ones to be able to get official banking partners.
00:15:30.290 - 00:15:46.902, Speaker B: The companies that don't have this, it's kind of an indication that they haven't really perhaps gotten to that level for proper banking relationships. And so I guess softly we might see that the ones with official banking partners might be the first ones to be licensed.
00:15:47.046 - 00:15:49.900, Speaker A: And is the Kimchi premium still a thing there?
00:15:50.210 - 00:16:21.030, Speaker B: Yeah, Kimchi premium is a thing because, for example, any countries that have the capital controls like China, Korea, India, Vietnam, Malaysia, they will all have a premium or they all trade in a lag. So in Vietnam, if you see a selldown in the US or the rest of the world for bitcoin prices, vietnam tends to kind of not move for a few days and then they'll catch up later. There's always a lag, but all due to capital restrictions.
00:16:22.250 - 00:16:31.046, Speaker A: Okay, so, yeah, let's talk a little bit more about Southeast Asia. What are you seeing there in terms of Southeast Asia?
00:16:31.078 - 00:17:16.200, Speaker B: I think that regulations are starting to come through. So, for example, the first one that is most sophisticated is obviously Singapore. So Singapore has they haven't outright licensed a company yet, but they've grandfathered 107 companies under their Payment Services Act by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. So these companies don't need a license because they've been grandfathered. What happens then is that they will slowly be contacted for licensing. So Singapore, you actually see a ton of companies flock to Singapore to set know, either offices or regional offices to start. Companies there know, if they can get the banking relationships, then it would make their lives easier as well.
00:17:16.200 - 00:18:02.194, Speaker B: Secondly, second most sophisticated is probably Thailand. So Thailand, they've licensed about 13 companies. But the problem with Thailand and I think they're unofficially relooking to this, is that they've separated kind of like the crypto versus the digital tokens. So that's kind of like layer ones versus, say, for example, ERC, 20 tokens. So you need licenses that are different for those, and then you need a different license if you're exchange, if you're a broker or if you're a dealer. That makes it a little bit hard sometimes because if you want to execute, where are you going to get the assets from? So I think they might relook at this. Philippines has been extremely forward in terms of licensing and in terms of adoption of crypto, I think because they have, like, a developer mindset.
00:18:02.194 - 00:18:30.320, Speaker B: So last year in July, the government actually created a portion like $10 million of their government bonds on Ethereum. I mean, it's still early days, and even if it's on Ethereum, they'll actually just swap it with Fiat. But I think it shows that basically the government is looking at different ways to get basically all the Filipinos around the world involved, and this is another way for the sto market to help with.
00:18:31.570 - 00:18:38.850, Speaker A: Right, let's yeah. Well, did you want to talk about any other I know Indonesia is a big country there, but I don't know how active it is.
00:18:39.000 - 00:18:58.486, Speaker B: Indonesia is a big country in terms of indonesia is a big country in terms of population, but it's not that active. Gold is actually usually the first investment that people go to, not equities. I think people have not really discovered bitcoin, but they are slowly I think there's about, like, 2 million clients in Indonesia.
00:18:58.678 - 00:19:02.490, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I'm interested in Indonesia because I used to live there. I love it there.
00:19:02.560 - 00:19:06.998, Speaker B: Oh, really? Where's your name? In Jakarta?
00:19:07.174 - 00:19:11.322, Speaker A: No. In 3 hours. Southeast? Yeah.
00:19:11.456 - 00:19:12.090, Speaker B: Beautiful.
00:19:12.240 - 00:19:25.060, Speaker A: And the weather's much better than in Jakarta. And let's do a quick tour through India. I know there's been kind of a lot that's been seesawing back and forth. I feel like there yeah, absolutely.
00:19:26.390 - 00:20:09.630, Speaker B: In 2018, they tried to ban bitcoin trading. In 2018, also, the RBI banned banking for crypto enterprises. So obviously last year, I don't know if you recall, but around March, the Supreme Court overturned what the central bank said, and within two months, crypto trading went up five X. Right now there's still a ban to ban trading and to ban mining. I think this is like an ongoing process, so it's still on table, but there's no real news on it. I think that there's not a lot of funds in India, even if it's a very sophisticated investor base. Yeah, I think that's due to regulatory confusion as well.
00:20:09.630 - 00:20:47.690, Speaker B: I think what is interesting is that just like Indonesia in 1946, in 1978, in November 2016, they did this demonetization. So basically overnight, they said all $10 bills are basically void. So this is to increase transparency. The effects of that was that bitcoin trading doubled basically overnight because people started to understand that they wanted to be responsible for their own money, and you couldn't just void their own cash overnight. So, yeah, I think it's still a work in progress, but I think the focus there is more on regulatory clarity.
00:20:48.670 - 00:20:58.298, Speaker A: And then just to circle back to China, you mentioned mining and how India might be banning that. And I wondered in China, kind of what is the state of mining?
00:20:58.474 - 00:21:35.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I think when I hear Americans talk about bitcoin mining in China, bitcoin like it's 65% mining in China compared to the whole world. I think people think that China is like one entity. What's really happening is that they're all super competitive. All these mining pools, they are cutthroat against each other because they want the best rates, they want the best pricing, they want the earliest machinery, they want the best locations. So these guys, they don't work in tandem. You can't say this is all one China. They're really completely separate entities that will do anything to kill each other off.
00:21:35.450 - 00:22:02.386, Speaker B: So you know how competitive Chinese businesses are. So this is no different in China as think. You know, there's this saying in China where the mountains are high and the emperor is far away, especially in mining. In mean, these are in rural provinces, typically, where energy cost is cheap. So if you have a mining hub, it's really hard for the government to crack down on it because you are a private entity after all.
00:22:02.568 - 00:22:22.054, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. Yeah, I've heard that saying before. It must have been from somebody in kind of like, I guess Chinese crypto Twitter, like maybe dovey won or I don't know. I've definitely heard that saying before. Anyway. All right, well, this has been super interesting. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:22:22.182 - 00:22:32.780, Speaker B: Yeah. Laura, I have a question for you if you don't oh, uh huh, sure. So I've actually know a ton from your podcast, but I saw on your Twitter profile that you're a no coiner. Why is?
00:22:33.790 - 00:23:01.240, Speaker A: Oh just for journalistic ethics reasons. Like, some publications I might want to write for wouldn't let me write for them if I owned the stuff that I cover. I'm not like philosophically, I'm a no Coiner. I'm a no coiner because I would rather write about bitcoin than own it, I guess. Although I really would like to own it. But if that's going to prevent me from writing from certain publications, then I won't own it.
00:23:01.930 - 00:23:05.846, Speaker B: That's good. Well, thanks for your contribution anyway, for the dispersion of information.
00:23:05.948 - 00:23:19.814, Speaker A: Oh yeah, no, I love doing what I do. Super fun. I've just been having so much more fun professionally than I could ever have imagined. Anyway. All right, well thanks again for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:23:19.942 - 00:23:20.954, Speaker B: Great, thank you.

First Headline coinbase chooses Nasdaq for direct listing the block reports that Crypto exchange Coinbase, which will be going public via a direct listing later this year, has chosen Nasdaq as its venue.
00:24:12.954 - 00:25:27.720, Speaker A: The selection is somewhat surprising given that the New York Stock Exchange, a Nasdaq rival, is an investor in Coinbase. However, Nasdaq tends to be the home for technology stocks. On January 25, Nasdaq private market, which allows secondary trading for shares in private companies, launched trading for Coinbase stock. According to the block, shares were matched at a price of $200, which implies a roughly $50 billion valuation for the largest crypto onramp in the US. That figure is lower, however, than the implied $70 billion valuation based on the pre IPO futures contracts that have been trading for Coinbase on derivatives exchange FTX. Next Headline MicroStrategy's bitcoin for corporations event draws more than 5000 at the Bitcoin for Corporations event held by MicroStrategy on Wednesday and Thursday, chief Executive Michael Saylor said that more than 5600 people had registered and 1400 companies had signed up for the conference session on legal considerations regarding buying bitcoin. At the conference, Ross Stevens, CEO of Stone Ridge Asset Management and executive chairman of NYDIG, its bitcoin subsidiary, estimated that there would be $25 billion in institutional bitcoin assets by year's end.
00:25:27.720 - 00:26:37.690, Speaker A: Watch this space for the impact this event has on bitcoin over the same time frame. In other corporate bitcoin news, Ruffer, the multibillion dollar investment management firm in the UK that had invested in bitcoin last November, sold 40% of its holdings, netting $650,000,000. Next Headline january C spike in crypto metrics total adjusted onchain volume, which is another measure for economic throughput, nearly doubled from December to January, hitting $529,000,000,000. That's 72% higher than the previous alltime high of $308,000,000,000 in January 2018, the top of the last bubble from December 2020, bitcoin's onchain volume jumped by 57% and ethereum's by 181%, though bitcoin's onchain volume is still 30% larger than ethereum's. However, when stablecoins are added, the 30 day moving average of onchain volume on ethereum is about 1.6 times that of bitcoin. The stablecoin supply alone grew 34% from December to $37 billion in January.
00:26:37.690 - 00:27:22.710, Speaker A: Meanwhile, bitcoin minor revenues hit $1.1 billion, the second highest monthly revenue of all time. Just after December 2017, ethereum miners saw revenue of $830,000,000, a new alltime high. Next Headline ETH hits new Record at One $700 CME ETH futures are launching next week, and that's made quite a number of investors bullish on ETH. According to Business Insider.
