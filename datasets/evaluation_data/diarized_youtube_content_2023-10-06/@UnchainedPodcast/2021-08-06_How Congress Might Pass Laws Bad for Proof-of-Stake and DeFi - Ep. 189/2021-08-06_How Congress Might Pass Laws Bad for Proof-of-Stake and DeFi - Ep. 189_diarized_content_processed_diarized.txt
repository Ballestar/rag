00:01:03.994 - 00:01:05.370, Speaker B: Welcome, Kristen.
00:01:05.530 - 00:01:07.250, Speaker C: It's great to be back, Laura.
00:01:07.990 - 00:01:10.066, Speaker B: The crypto industry has been up in.
00:01:10.088 - 00:01:11.954, Speaker A: Arms about a provision in the $1.
00:01:11.992 - 00:01:17.918, Speaker B: Trillion infrastructure bill that would have the effect of raising $28 billion from the industry in taxes.
00:01:18.094 - 00:01:20.070, Speaker A: Before we get into the latest news.
00:01:20.140 - 00:01:22.258, Speaker B: On the competing amendments and the nitty.
00:01:22.274 - 00:01:34.490, Speaker A: Gritty of what happened last night, let's just first set the stage for people who haven't been following the play by play. Why was the crypto industry concerned about the crypto portion of this bill from the beginning?
00:01:34.830 - 00:02:58.370, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I'm going to even back up a little bit further before I get into this specific bill just to provide some background. For about two years now, the IRS has been working with the industry and other stakeholders to try to figure out how to do an information reporting requirement for the traditional crypto exchanges. And this is something that the IRS would like because at the end of the year, customers of these crypto exchanges don't get a 1099 in the mail like they would from Charles Schwab or somebody else and they want to have information to help people pay their taxes. The IRS wants that information and the customers want that information and the centralized crypto exchanges want to provide that information. The problem has been that there hasn't been regulations for how to do that, but that is a process and discussions that have been ongoing and we believe the IRS is very close to doing this. So when the White House and the Senate and the House started looking at an infrastructure package, they were trying to find ways to pay for it that didn't involve raising taxes. And so what they did is they included a small provision in this legislation that would essentially do what the IRS is already doing and make it clear that the IRS had to create an information reporting requirement for exchanges.
00:02:58.370 - 00:04:00.360, Speaker C: But the problem is when the language emerged, I guess about a week and a half ago, now maybe closer to two weeks. The provision expanded the definition of the broker to go far beyond covering information reporting for centralized exchanges and captured all sorts of other participants in the crypto ecosystem like stakers and miners and software developers and others and tried to also impose those reporting requirements on those entities. And so in the beginning when I first saw this, I said, oh well, that's a mistake, let's get them some language changes. They don't know what they've done because this is complicated. But it became pretty clear on Tuesday last week that our efforts to provide some technical assistance to them weren't going to work and that we needed to fire up the base and sound the alarm. And it's been a pretty intense battle for, I guess the past eight or nine days now to try to fix it.
00:04:01.790 - 00:04:14.698, Speaker A: Why do you think that there was resistance to what you initially viewed as just offering technical assistance? Does that now seem that there are particular reasons why they want the language.
00:04:14.874 - 00:04:16.830, Speaker B: To capture those entities?
00:04:17.250 - 00:05:17.934, Speaker C: Well, this is being driven, we believe, largely by the Treasury Department and the White House and whether or not it know, if we wanted to be generous, we can say there is a knowledge gap there and they don't understand what they're asking for. If you want to be more suspicious, it's that this is a hard attack on crypto and an attempt to bring it down. I think it's probably somewhere in between. I think what treasury is trying to do is capture activity going on in the DeFi world, but they don't fully understand the DeFi world. But the bigger problem has been legislation is not written by the White House and treasury, it is written by Congress. Right. And the Senators Portman and Sinema have been the lead on this bill and they very early on, sort of before sharing the language, struck a deal with the White House that hey, we will push this bipartisan bill forward and here are the provisions.
00:05:17.934 - 00:05:56.894, Speaker C: And so instead of negotiating with the House, which would be sort of the customary path, the Senate is negotiating with the White House on this. And so when this bipartisan group struck a deal, there has been resistance to making changes to it. And so from the very beginning of this, when this started about ten days ago, there's been a tremendous amount of resistance to making changes not based off of the substance but based off of the process. That's where we stand. Well, we stand a little further than that today, but yeah, that's part of the thinking as to why they don't want to move. They've cut a deal and they don't want to break their deal.
00:05:57.092 - 00:06:14.274, Speaker A: Okay, so let's maybe then go into the details of what's happened over the last few days and let's start with that amendment by Senators Ron Widen, Cynthia Lemmis and Patumi. What did that amendment say and why was this an important suggested change.
00:06:14.472 - 00:07:17.240, Speaker C: Yeah. So the Widen Lemus Toomey amendment is even in itself, actually, I will say not perfect, but goes a long way towards solving some of the underlying certainty in the Portman Cinema Bill that was the broader 2700 page infrastructure package, the Wyden amendment. And by the way, the fact that Ron Wyden has emerged as a champion on this issue is remarkable. This is the most active and vocal he has ever been on these issues. And it is wonderful because he's the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which is the tax writing committee. And so when he weighs in on something that's incredibly powerful, he's also been a longstanding champion for the Internet. And so the industry should applaud his emergence on the scene, along with Senator Lemmas, who's been a longtime champion, and Toomey, who has really stepped it up this year.
00:07:17.240 - 00:08:42.370, Speaker C: Those three are the heroes here, and crypto industry needs to celebrate them because they are going to bat for the crypto ecosystem. But what their amendment does is it provides some clarity. That stakers and miners, that software developers, that wallet manufacturers or developers of software wallets, that those entities aren't captured in the definition of a broker. And the way it's written is that there's room to argue that there are other types of participants in the ecosystem that we could argue down the road are also not intended to be included. This language itself was negotiated over multiple days. This was conversations that happened between Lumis and Toomey and Wyden and a core group of industry people who we've been working together with to try to influence this process. And so even though the original language that is in the Portman Cinema Bill that came out of really nowhere with the expanded broker definition, there was a tremendous focus in figuring out how can we fix this? Because it was very clear early on that they would not accept simply striking the language that they would not accept just striking the definition of broker, but that we needed to find some alternative definition of broker.
00:08:42.370 - 00:09:37.266, Speaker C: This is language that all of the stakeholders have signed off on, and we were starting to gain traction on this amendment. I think that the crypto community really rallied. There is an organization called Fight for the Future who put together a grassroots website that helped people to call their senators. And as of last night, we had hit about 10,000 calls into Senate offices over the past maybe a period of about 18 hours, which is remarkable, absolutely remarkable. We have an extended team of professional lobbyists who are working Senate offices on this bill. Some of those are blockchain association lobbyists, some of those are Coin Center lobbyists. Some of those are, you know, DCG has lobbyists.
00:09:37.266 - 00:10:14.894, Speaker C: Stellar Development Foundation has lobbyists. It's really been kind of an all hands on deck, like ground game on the lobbying front. We've also been doing digital advertising. We're doing LinkedIn ads targeted at Senate and House offices. We did a buyout of the Washington Post homepage yesterday to try to influence the vote in favor of the amendment. So what was remarkable is that this amendment came in and the industry was able to, within the matter of hours, start pouring out support for this amendment into these. You know Jesse Powell from Kraken emailed.
00:10:14.894 - 00:11:11.700, Speaker C: All of his US. Users to support this. It was this remarkable turnaround and we were winning. We were getting close to winning, I should say, because we needed to get to 60 votes because that was the threshold procedurally for what we needed for this amendment at the time. And then yesterday, as we were starting to approach and realize we're actually starting to pick off members and get people in support, we have a whip count and everybody's adding all of their intel there so we know where everybody's at. Then I think what happened is Portman and the White House and treasury started to get scared because they realized that the crypto industry was actually a sleeping giant and they had awakened it. And so they worked with Senator Mark Warner from Virginia and Portman himself, who was the lead on the broader infrastructure bill.
00:11:11.700 - 00:12:40.494, Speaker C: And they put together language that I believe is actually worse than the underlying bill language because what it does is it picks proof of work as being the only sort of protected consensus mechanism and leaves out proof of stake or proof of spacetime or any other type of model that's developed there. So it's incredibly short sighted. It was not veted with anyone in the industry. This all came together very quickly yesterday and yesterday afternoon, late last night, the administration endorsed the Warner Amendment, which is sort of another battle there. And throughout the day yesterday, there were very senior people within the administration and even the independent agencies that were picking up the phone and calling Democratic senators urging them to oppose the Wyden amendment and support the Warner amendment. So we are getting pushback from the highest levels of government, which in some ways it is a complement to how effective we have been over the past 72 hours or even into the past week. But it's incredibly scary because this is the highest levels and the industry doesn't have the full capability yet that other more established industries have.
00:12:40.494 - 00:13:17.610, Speaker C: And so we are trying to be as efficient as possible, as effective as possible, and working together as closely as possible, not just within the industry, but with our allies like Coincenter to make sure that we are putting all of our efforts and resources into the same strategy in the same course. So we're not out of the woods yet, obviously. And the vote on both of these amendments will be on Saturday. And so it is turning out to be they could make a movie out of this stuff, right? This is a lot of drama.
00:13:19.310 - 00:13:30.320, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we'll discuss why it is that the White House is pushing its weight behind the new proposed amendment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:14:07.070 - 00:14:46.422, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Kristen Smith. So, as you mentioned, it seems that this new version, the Warner Portman version of the amendment, would put a thumb on the scales for proof of work systems over proof of stake systems. And upon learning this felt this seemed logically inconsistent because the Democrats have tended to be more on the side of those who express concern about the environmental impact of proof of work coins. So do you think it's that the White House doesn't understand the implications of this amendment that they support or do you think that it is that they do want to favor proof of work.
00:14:46.476 - 00:14:48.250, Speaker B: Over proof of stake?
00:14:49.390 - 00:15:54.606, Speaker C: I think that this is largely a lack of understanding about how crypto networks work. Largely. I mean, I think if they understood that argument and they would maybe think twice about this, but the people at the White House and at the Treasury Department that are behind this aren't the ones that are the leaders on climate issues. These are people that care very much about financial surveillance, quite frankly. Right? They want to have insight into transactions. They want to know where individuals money is moving. And I also think that there are a small group of people over there that are worried about the emergence of DeFi, they're worried about the emergence of stablecoins and that there are probably some there that see this as an opportunity to know go after crypto in a way I don't think that's universal over there.
00:15:54.606 - 00:16:40.220, Speaker C: I think some are just trying to solve the tax compliance problem and they think DEXes should be left out. Jerry Rito with Coins Center always reminds me that decentralized exchange is a verb, not a noun and that you can't go after sort of these DEXes if they're truly decentralized. Yeah, this is like then they fight you. Stage right crypto has had such a miraculous past six to twelve months that it has arrived in the economy in a way that I don't think anybody saw coming. And I think they're scared and I think they don't know how to regulate it and that this is an opportunity to prevent it from getting out of hand too quickly.
00:16:40.690 - 00:16:54.930, Speaker A: And so just to draw out kind of what the implications would be for DeFi essentially this new version of the amendment, the Portman Warner version, because it does not have that carve out for proof of stake coins.
00:16:55.670 - 00:16:57.858, Speaker B: And I guess for the developers who.
00:16:57.944 - 00:17:10.294, Speaker A: Write protocols that that's why that's seen as especially bad for DeFi because those developers or the people who validate in those systems would have to report on.
00:17:10.332 - 00:17:11.254, Speaker B: Who their users are.
00:17:11.292 - 00:17:13.000, Speaker A: Is that what that would mean?
00:17:13.450 - 00:17:59.926, Speaker C: Quite frankly, it's impossible for them to do that kind of reporting, right? So if those types of regulations were imposed, they would either have to operate out of compliance, leave the United States or just simply shut down. And so those are not three great options. What's wonderful about the Widen lumits to me amendment is that it's inclusive. It encourages the innovation to stay here in the United States. It encourages software developers to have the freedom to do what they should be able to do under the First Amendment right. They should be able to write code. And it's, I think, very forward looking on Wyden and Slummos and toomey to step in.
00:17:59.926 - 00:18:46.214, Speaker C: And do know we've got some people in the industry that have a good relationship with Senator Warner on a staff level. They're not the easiest people to get in touch with. They don't want to engage, they don't want to be helpful. We have had a lot of outreach to them in the past and for them to come in and do this last minute without consulting anyone, it's just shocking and it's not how policy is supposed to be made. But again, the reason they're going to Warner is he is sort of known as being technologically savvy. He is close with the administration and the White House wants somebody to come in and save them and he was.
00:18:46.252 - 00:18:50.406, Speaker B: Their so okay, so it seems like.
00:18:50.588 - 00:19:08.426, Speaker A: You do maybe give some credence to that hypothesis that the drive for all this comes from treasury. I did see other people on Twitter hypothesizing that this was going to end up as an attack on the industry altogether. That first the administration would try to.
00:19:08.448 - 00:19:10.710, Speaker B: Regulate proof of stake and then later.
00:19:10.800 - 00:19:16.746, Speaker A: Attack proof of work through ESG or environmental, social and governance regulations.
00:19:16.858 - 00:19:18.430, Speaker B: What do you think of that theory?
00:19:19.250 - 00:20:29.362, Speaker C: It's interesting. I saw that as well. It's not a bad one two punch, right? I mean, if you could take out proof of stake that's where a lot of the innovation is going on, then, you know, we've already seen the proof of work arguments play know, even with Senator Elizabeth Warren and the Senate Banking Committee. And that is a narrative that has emerged this year in a way that we've never seen before. So whether or not I am suspect that there's somebody in the White House that has such a master vision that they are plotting all of the pieces of crypto and figuring out how to go after them. But I do think there is an underlying sense that this crypto stuff is getting out of control and we need to find every opportunity we can to try to rein it back in. And so I think it was more opportunistic for them to try to expand this definition of broker because you have to remember in the original language that they circulated, it specifically included in the definition of broker decentralized exchanges, which again, was totally undefined.
00:20:29.362 - 00:20:57.150, Speaker C: And peer to peer, that's where their thinking was eventually. And we've been able to pull that back a little bit, but it's still not super clear that miners stakers, software developers are excluded. And so that's why the widened amendment is so important. So here we are. It's going to be a big showdown on Saturday.
00:20:58.050 - 00:21:18.962, Speaker A: So you said that there's going to be a vote tomorrow on Saturday. What happens today at this point? Do you have a sense of which amendment is more likely to garner the necessary number of votes? And also what would you suggest people who are listening to this show and care about this bill do before tomorrow?
00:21:19.106 - 00:21:52.078, Speaker C: Yeah. So the goal today is we need to let the community know and we need to let the Senate know that we need to support the Wyden amendment and oppose the Warner Amendment. What the White House is going to try to do in treasury is they are going to try to say, oh, the Warner Amendment is the compromise between the original language and the Widen amendment. It is not a compromise. It is bad. We need to make sure votes are no. So as I mentioned before, we have a team of extended lobbyists that we got them all talking points last night.
00:21:52.078 - 00:22:32.010, Speaker C: They're being deployed to those offices today. We are actively updating our whip count trying to figure out where people are on each of these amendments. What we need the community to do is sort of twofold. So the crypto industry has two superpowers. We have the ability to communicate really quickly with each other, which is great because that was one of the reasons that we were able to activate all of these grassroots. We also have really large user bases. I mentioned before that Jesse Powell with Kraken emailed his users.
00:22:32.010 - 00:23:31.214, Speaker C: If you are operating a platform with millions of users, we need you to get the word out for them to weigh into Congress and Fightforthefuture.org has a campaign going right now that's going to be updated this morning, I believe, to also discuss the Warner Amendment. So we need to use our superpowers, we need to communicate via Twitter and we need to get word to our user bases to weigh in with the Senate because I think that will help. I think going forward, there are two kind of underlying problems that we need to fix within the industry in order to prevent these types of things from happening to begin with. One is we need to unify. And there are different sort of factions within the crypto policy world. It's become very clear within the past week that there is a main group of us that can work together really well.
00:23:31.214 - 00:24:20.334, Speaker C: I would like to give kudos to the coinbase policy team, most of whom are new and just showed up. And if anybody knows me, coinbase is not my favorite because they're the only member to have ever left the blockchain association. It has been a delight working with our team and they have been incredibly effective and they're wonderful to work with. So we need to make sure we continue to work with coinbase. We need to make sure that we get everybody under one umbrella because we can't have different voices putting out different messages. Everybody needs to work together. The other problem we need to solve and I saw some discussion on this on twitter this morning, and this has been kind of a personal project, though it quite frankly, often gets pushed to the back burner because so many other problems pop up.
00:24:20.334 - 00:24:53.338, Speaker C: But we need to give to members of congress and members of the senate who support us. We need to give large financial donations. What members of congress need to know is that, hey, if I go to bat for crypto, crypto will go to bat for me. And we need to find a way to organize the political giving and make it so that we work together in a way that makes sense. There's a lot of people that have supported cinema. There's a lot of people that have supported Warner. They have not helped us.
00:24:53.338 - 00:25:21.538, Speaker C: And it is unfortunate that all of that effort has led to really them doing what is single handedly like the worst amendment to ever been voted on in all of congress related to crypto. Right? So that's a problem. We need to stop rewarding bad behavior and we need to reward good behavior. And it shouldn't matter if they're republican or democrat. If they're helping us, we should be helping them. And so that's something that I know a lot of people are getting passionate about right now. I've got a lot of ideas about that.
00:25:21.538 - 00:25:54.382, Speaker C: And so going forward, we need to unify. We need to be politically active, meaning we need to give political contributions. But today, for Friday and Saturday, we need to fire up the user base. We need to get the word out. We need to get our celebrity friends tweeting about this. We need to get the fight for the future campaign in front of as many possible eyeballs as we can so that we can get the word into the senate that biden is good, warner is bad. And listen, we can still win this thing.
00:25:54.382 - 00:26:20.600, Speaker C: It's not over yet. We are up against the white House, we're up against the treasury department, we are up against the managers of this bill. But I think that we can still win this fight we just need to not give up and we need to keep pushing and going forward, I think this will be looked back upon as the moment that crypto really woke up, they understood Washington. And going forward, I think we're going to be a force to be reckoned with.
00:26:21.530 - 00:26:23.526, Speaker B: Great, well, so people should look for.
00:26:23.548 - 00:26:35.660, Speaker A: Those campaigns and I'll be sure to put the link to the fight for the future and whatever else you think is good in the show notes. And yeah, we'll see what happens.
00:26:36.270 - 00:26:38.854, Speaker B: Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:26:38.982 - 00:26:40.450, Speaker C: Yeah. Thanks, Laura.
00:26:40.630 - 00:26:43.390, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly News recap.
00:26:47.730 - 00:27:41.182, Speaker B: Thanks for tuning in to this week's News Recap. First headline ethereum's London hard fork hits mainnet on Thursday, Ethereum's long awaited London Hard fork went live, bringing with it five ethereum improvement proposals, each featuring code changes aimed at optimizing the network. Notably, Lenton includes EIP 1559, which has two components. First, it adds a base feed to every transaction on Ethereum, intending to make gas fees less volatile and perhaps just slightly less expensive. Secondly, EIP 1559 has begun burning those base fees, sending Ethereum to an inaccessible address, leading to an Ethereum. First, as tweeted by Alexander Fisher, quote we just had our first deflationary ethereum block. Block 1296-5263 had a block reward of two ETH but burned 2.78
00:27:41.182 - 00:27:50.162, Speaker B: ETH. ETH is ultrasound money. Fisher's excitement about Ether as ultrasound money stems from the belief that by taking.
00:27:50.216 - 00:27:52.862, Speaker A: ETH out of circulation and therefore limiting.
00:27:52.926 - 00:28:59.590, Speaker B: Supply, ether's investment thesis as hard money, or what many in the Ethereum community are calling ultrasound money will be very appealing to investors, especially in light of Bitcoin's dominance as a hard capped asset. Such deflationary pressure on the asset, one could argue, is likely to be good for those long ethereum. Or as Jeff Benson from Decrypt put it, quote the less of something there is, the higher price it should be able to fetch. And indeed, it appears investors were buying the Ethereum hype in the days leading up to London, with Ether gaining about 17% over the past week, shooting up from the two two hundreds to the two seven hundreds in the seven days prior to the Main net launch. As of press time on Thursday afternoon, Ethereum has burned over 1000 ETH, while the price has hit a daily high of $2,818. In related news, Zuko Wilcox, founder of Zcash, wants the privacy coin to be more like Ethereum. In a blog post, he proposed that Zcash ditch its proof of work consensus algorithm in favor of proof of stake, just as Ethereum plans to do with the shift to Ethereum 20.
00:28:59.590 - 00:29:59.594, Speaker B: Zuko wrote, quote While there are many who prefer proof of work, I believe that proof of stake would make Zcash more valuable to more people.
