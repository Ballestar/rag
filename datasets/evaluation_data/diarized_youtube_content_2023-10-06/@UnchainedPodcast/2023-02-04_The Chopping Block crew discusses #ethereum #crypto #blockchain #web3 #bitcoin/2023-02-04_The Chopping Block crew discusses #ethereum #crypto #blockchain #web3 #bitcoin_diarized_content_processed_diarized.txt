00:00:00.170 - 00:00:29.090, Speaker A: Well, I don't think it's a fertile ground for DeFi. Yes. Any Bitcoin maxi Listening can find some possible way that it could be used to build anything. Right. Theoretically, like almost any low level language, like assembly, at a certain point, you can make a Turing complete system with it and therefore build anything. But it's not the right tool for the job. If you're going to build DeFi or something complicated, bitcoin is not the blockchain to build it on, in my opinion.
00:00:29.090 - 00:00:50.250, Speaker A: I think it's great for the one use case it has, which is transferring value between parties, and that's the value proposition. That's the narrative. That's the value of it. Right. I don't think it's going to be using this as the foundation for complex systems beyond just transferring diet.
