00:01:05.678 - 00:01:11.662, Speaker B: Today's guest is James Block, the author of the Dirty Bubble Media newsletter. Welcome, James.
00:01:11.806 - 00:01:13.666, Speaker A: Hi, glad to be here.
00:01:13.848 - 00:01:26.242, Speaker B: So you are actually a doctor, but you publish this extensive and actually fairly frequent newsletter on crypto. How did that even happen? How did you even get into crypto?
00:01:26.386 - 00:01:38.282, Speaker D: I learned about it probably a year and a half ago, so I'm relatively new to it. I've always had a fascination with financial fraud and finance in general, going back to when I was a young kid.
00:01:38.336 - 00:01:40.634, Speaker A: Even, and it was difficult to choose.
00:01:40.672 - 00:01:46.558, Speaker D: Between medicine and finance. But I ended up going into medicine for my career. But I've always kind of kept an eye on things.
00:01:46.644 - 00:01:49.406, Speaker A: And when I learned about crypto, one.
00:01:49.428 - 00:02:05.090, Speaker D: Of the first things I learned about was the Tether Stablecoin and some of the companies that were associated with them. I saw a lot of red flags that made me concerned that there might be something nefarious going on with these companies. And it kind of was organic. It wasn't like I was planning to do this.
00:02:05.240 - 00:02:06.898, Speaker A: It went from me just being on.
00:02:06.904 - 00:02:11.430, Speaker D: Twitter, following people and learning to doing my own research to eventually writing things.
00:02:11.500 - 00:02:15.830, Speaker A: And actually trying to make a contribution. So it's kind of grown over those.
00:02:15.900 - 00:02:17.640, Speaker D: Months into what it is now.
00:02:18.250 - 00:02:38.830, Speaker B: Wow. I have to say I'm super impressed that you only started getting into crypto a year and a half ago because your newsletter will go into blockchain analytics and you have this understanding of I mean, I guess you said you already had an interest of finance, but still yeah, I'm actually very impressed. And when did you launch the newsletter?
00:02:39.170 - 00:02:55.406, Speaker D: I think it was in January. I actually started it. I was concerned that my Twitter account was going to get taken down or hacked or something, which actually ended up happening at one point, and I wanted to have a place to save the things I had done so far, so I started basically copying threads I had done on Twitter over to substack.
00:02:55.438 - 00:02:56.930, Speaker A: And then I think the first actual.
00:02:57.000 - 00:02:59.910, Speaker D: Article I wrote for Substack was in February.
00:03:00.650 - 00:03:06.486, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Wait, but why did you have that fear that your Twitter account would be hacked? Because you can secure it?
00:03:06.668 - 00:03:17.066, Speaker D: Well, so I was getting targeted by bots a lot. I was posting a lot about a few different things. I was focused a lot on the Celsius network, and I don't know, I just had a few interactions that made.
00:03:17.088 - 00:03:19.338, Speaker A: Me think that my account might be.
00:03:19.344 - 00:03:22.666, Speaker D: Targeted either for like mass reporting or something. So I figured I might as well.
00:03:22.768 - 00:03:28.094, Speaker A: Put the stuff somewhere else safe, actually. And then in May of 2022 or.
00:03:28.132 - 00:03:33.246, Speaker D: Sorry, it would have been June of 2022, my account actually was hacked and I lost control of it for about.
00:03:33.268 - 00:03:34.480, Speaker A: Two and a half months.
00:03:34.850 - 00:03:42.354, Speaker D: And my substac was also targeted by fraudulent copyright claims and actually taken down for a little bit as well. So I had a fun summer trying.
00:03:42.392 - 00:03:44.866, Speaker A: To preserve what I had already been working on.
00:03:45.048 - 00:03:51.270, Speaker B: Wow. And wait, is that simply because of your involvement in crypto? That all that happened?
00:03:51.420 - 00:04:11.642, Speaker D: I mean, that's all I write about, so I assumed that I had made somebody upset. Whether it was related to my work on Celsius or certain other things I had been working on, I'm not sure. But the timing was interesting because it was right around the same time as Celsius froze withdrawals, and I was publishing a lot of real time tracking of some of the things they were doing in terms of moving money around, and that was when things happened.
00:04:11.696 - 00:04:12.382, Speaker A: So I don't know.
00:04:12.436 - 00:04:17.070, Speaker D: I think the copyright stuff against my blog was actually a separate thing, but that's just me speculating.
00:04:17.570 - 00:04:37.346, Speaker B: Okay, we'll talk offline because I have some thoughts for you. I don't want to make my thoughts on this topic, but anyway okay. You said that you had an interest in financial stuff, but I don't know if you have any training or anything like that, but I was curious to hear exactly what your finance background is.
00:04:37.448 - 00:04:57.946, Speaker D: My finance background amounts to growing up with an accountant for a grandfather and a lawyer for a dad, and they would argue about investing every weekend when we would go and visit them. And so I picked that up. I don't know, I didn't have a lot of video games and stuff, so I ended up reading the Wall Street Journal and things. I was a weird kid. So that's really my background is just.
00:04:57.968 - 00:05:00.726, Speaker A: Like piecemeal, sort of like reading books.
00:05:00.758 - 00:05:21.182, Speaker D: About history of different light frauds and other companies and things. Have a few of them on my bookshelf and you start to pick up sort of how things work. You don't necessarily have to have a formal understanding of everything. Like my accounting skills are abysmal, but can I recognize how a company works and kind of piece together kind of the broad strokes.
00:05:21.246 - 00:05:21.714, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:21.832 - 00:05:47.910, Speaker B: Wow, okay. Like I said, very impressive that it's kind of more self taught, I guess, than I would have expected. So at least for me. I think the first post of yours that I remember seeing was the one is Alameda Research and Solvent. It's the one that came out a couple of days after the CoinDesk article on Alameda's balance sheet. So I was curious. You said you launched in February of last year, your newsletter.
00:05:47.910 - 00:05:55.040, Speaker B: What was your experience in terms of the trajectory of that newsletter and how it really started getting around?
00:05:55.570 - 00:06:14.982, Speaker D: I mean, I just started writing about the things I thought were interesting. So in addition, when I was doing I did a medical degree and a doctorate in research during my graduate training. What I learned was about research and learning how things work is you really have to almost force yourself to write about things, to really understand something. You have to force yourself to try.
00:06:14.996 - 00:06:16.518, Speaker A: Try to explain it to other people.
00:06:16.684 - 00:06:27.686, Speaker D: And so that kind of grew out of that was like, okay, well, I found this interesting thing. How about I try to write it in a way that anybody can understand it? Then that way I know that I understand it. So that's really how it started. And yeah, I don't know, it just.
00:06:27.708 - 00:06:29.320, Speaker A: Kind of grew from there.
00:06:30.090 - 00:06:40.922, Speaker D: I got some attention because of the Celsius stuff. A couple of things I wrote about NFTs and celebrities and things got a little bit of attention. But really the Alameda thing was really what got a lot of people looking.
00:06:40.976 - 00:06:42.240, Speaker A: At what I had been doing.
00:06:42.770 - 00:06:45.534, Speaker B: Was that your first viral post, the one that I mentioned?
00:06:45.652 - 00:06:46.960, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say so.
00:06:48.530 - 00:07:21.366, Speaker B: As I alluded to earlier, your articles can be somewhat long and the analysis sometimes is pretty detailed. And given that you have this completely different job in a totally unrelated field, I was wondering how you even have time to do this. You just said that you did it because you wanted to force yourself to understand, and writing does that. But is that really the main reason at this point? You basically have this entire other career. So why is it that you're spending so much time and effort publishing this newsletter?
00:07:21.478 - 00:07:22.380, Speaker A: It's fun.
00:07:24.990 - 00:07:37.374, Speaker D: I almost quit doing this a few months ago, actually. I had done a lot of stuff with Celsius. I'd actually found some original things that were cited in other papers and CoinDesk and things. And I kind of thought, like, well, I've made my contribution to this.
00:07:37.412 - 00:07:38.650, Speaker A: I can just quit.
00:07:38.810 - 00:07:47.854, Speaker D: I just have too much fun doing this. I've met so many interesting people and learned so many interesting things about real finance in addition to crypto.
00:07:47.902 - 00:07:51.186, Speaker A: And literally I know people all around.
00:07:51.208 - 00:07:52.354, Speaker D: The world now because of this.
00:07:52.392 - 00:08:00.214, Speaker A: Right? So I can't really stop now, unfortunately, maybe. But in terms of time, I find.
00:08:00.252 - 00:08:14.250, Speaker D: Time nights weekends, whatever. When this is your hobby, when you have a hobby that you really like and care about. I don't really watch a lot of Netflix. I'm way behind on reading books. I'm way behind on other things I like to do because this is basically.
00:08:14.320 - 00:08:15.660, Speaker A: What I do for fun.
00:08:17.630 - 00:08:21.062, Speaker B: I love it. And now the crypto world is benefiting.
00:08:21.206 - 00:08:23.086, Speaker D: Maybe. I don't know if everybody thinks they're.
00:08:23.108 - 00:08:34.370, Speaker B: Benefiting, but okay, well, even if they don't realize they're benefiting, they're benefiting. And I was curious, how do you create the graphics of the blockchain flows in your articles? Like, it looks like you easy.
00:08:34.440 - 00:08:38.354, Speaker D: No, that's a free tool called wow.
00:08:38.472 - 00:08:40.222, Speaker A: Bitquery explorer.
00:08:40.286 - 00:08:53.510, Speaker D: Bitquery IO. It's very easy to use and it's very accurate. From what I found. I've actually gone through and aggregated transactions and made sure that the numbers they're saying are accurate. I mean, there are certain limitations, obviously.
00:08:53.580 - 00:08:55.666, Speaker A: But yeah, it's free software.
00:08:55.698 - 00:08:58.502, Speaker D: I actually wrote an article about how to do this a few months ago.
00:08:58.636 - 00:08:59.126, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:08:59.148 - 00:09:00.566, Speaker D: Basically how to do everything that I.
00:09:00.588 - 00:09:03.706, Speaker A: Do, because I figured it really isn't that hard.
00:09:03.888 - 00:09:15.902, Speaker D: It just takes the time of clicking through a bunch of stuff and trying to figure out who owns what. That's the hard part. But in terms of actually doing the math and understanding what's happening, that's not that difficult once you spend a little.
00:09:15.956 - 00:09:18.766, Speaker A: Time familiarizing yourself with it.
00:09:18.948 - 00:09:29.540, Speaker B: Okay, great. I'm definitely going to check that article out. I don't know how I missed it because I was obviously reading a ton of your posts. Then I also was wondering why you chose the name Dirty Bubble Media.
00:09:29.910 - 00:09:30.466, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:09:30.488 - 00:09:53.846, Speaker D: A lot of things just sort of happened. I don't remember when I came up with it exactly, but it was fairly early on, I think it was when I encountered, I think it's Jim Chanos who calls this the golden age of fraud. And I had this thought pump into my head that it's really just a dirty bubble. And then I'm a millennial, so I watched SpongeBob, so it was like a natural. That's a villain from SpongeBob.
00:09:53.878 - 00:09:55.338, Speaker A: So it's like a perfect like, I.
00:09:55.344 - 00:09:57.722, Speaker D: Don'T know, it worked out and I thought I could make a cool little.
00:09:57.776 - 00:09:59.260, Speaker A: Thing out of it, so I did.
00:09:59.630 - 00:10:01.094, Speaker B: So I don't know SpongeBob.
00:10:01.222 - 00:10:07.534, Speaker D: So it's just like a minor character in that show that's like a villain, like a supervillain that's just like a.
00:10:07.572 - 00:10:10.462, Speaker A: Bubble that goes around and grabs people.
00:10:10.516 - 00:10:13.562, Speaker D: With its bubble, literally. It's a dirty bubble.
00:10:13.626 - 00:10:14.062, Speaker A: That's it.
00:10:14.116 - 00:10:23.006, Speaker D: It's a kids show. This is not sophisticated, but it worked because of the idea that what this is, is a vast economic bubble that's filled with fraud.
00:10:23.038 - 00:10:27.186, Speaker A: And that's kind of the idea there. Okay.
00:10:27.368 - 00:10:29.906, Speaker D: Also, he's a villain, and a lot of people see me as a villain.
00:10:29.938 - 00:10:31.362, Speaker A: So I figured it was fitting.
00:10:31.506 - 00:10:47.866, Speaker B: Well, actually, that was kind of my next question for you, because your newsletter calls out a lot of problems with crypto. So I just wanted to hear your overall take on the space. Like what do you think the main issues are and how do you think it needs to change?
00:10:48.048 - 00:10:51.718, Speaker A: What I can say is that I've spent a lot of time and I'm.
00:10:51.734 - 00:10:59.790, Speaker D: A pretty single minded person and when I have an opinion, I usually will defend it. So I can definitely get one sided at times.
00:10:59.860 - 00:11:02.302, Speaker A: That being said, I haven't really found.
00:11:02.356 - 00:11:13.310, Speaker D: A single project that's at least a project that's facing consumers and selling tokens in a project or selling some sort of investment scheme or whatever to consumers.
00:11:13.470 - 00:11:17.700, Speaker A: That ever seems to really be legitimate. And that's a problem.
00:11:19.130 - 00:11:27.946, Speaker D: Look at the crypto lending industry. Not one of those companies as far as I can tell, operated in a forthright and legitimate fashion. The only one that's left now is.
00:11:27.968 - 00:11:29.978, Speaker A: Nexo and they just got raided in.
00:11:30.064 - 00:11:33.530, Speaker D: Bulgaria for apparently helping Russians invade.
00:11:34.590 - 00:11:45.086, Speaker A: Know there's, there's problems with all of, you know, I'm agnostic about whether there are certain potential applications for the technology.
00:11:45.188 - 00:11:52.754, Speaker D: I'm sure there are, but the problem is any opportunity that's offered to retail investors to actually invest in these things.
00:11:52.792 - 00:11:54.686, Speaker A: To me seems to be like smoke.
00:11:54.718 - 00:12:00.180, Speaker D: And it's, it's sad. But that's just the reality of the.
00:12:01.990 - 00:12:08.934, Speaker B: So you're differentiating that from just like kind of a straight up exchange where you can just buy and sell well.
00:12:08.972 - 00:12:11.558, Speaker D: So even they here's the thing, what.
00:12:11.564 - 00:12:12.834, Speaker A: Are you buying and selling?
00:12:12.962 - 00:12:43.006, Speaker D: Right? Theoretically it's like Coinbase an example, and I have been short Coinbase in the past, so I'll disclose that I actually never really write about. I mean, theoretically they're operating in a legitimate fashion. Obviously they've had some problems with KYC, they've had some problems with following regulations and they may have additional problems in the future. But at least theoretically it seems like they're doing things in an above board fashion. They're not FTX right. They're not like stealing people's money or anything. But at the end of the day, if all you're doing is helping Ponzi.
00:12:43.038 - 00:12:47.182, Speaker A: Schemes sell investment contracts that are unregulated.
00:12:47.246 - 00:12:49.858, Speaker D: To consumers, what is your business?
00:12:50.024 - 00:12:52.194, Speaker A: Right? I mean, even if you're doing that.
00:12:52.232 - 00:13:07.862, Speaker D: In a legitimate and honest fashion, you're still facilitating vast scams. And coinbase in particular is an example where they've listed all sorts of things. Know, any rational person would say this is not good for anybody. So I don't know, I haven't found.
00:13:07.916 - 00:13:10.674, Speaker A: Anything yet that really catches my attention.
00:13:10.722 - 00:13:19.882, Speaker D: And makes me think this is a sustainable business that generates cash flow that's going to actually end up surviving for more than a couple of years and make something positive for the world.
00:13:19.936 - 00:13:21.360, Speaker A: I haven't found that yet.
00:13:21.970 - 00:13:34.598, Speaker B: And out of curiosity, when you talk about the different assets that Coinbase lists, would you put things like, well let's start with bitcoin. Would you put Bitcoin in that same category?
00:13:34.794 - 00:13:38.414, Speaker A: I think that bitcoin, to me it's irrelevant.
00:13:38.542 - 00:14:20.142, Speaker D: And the reason why it's irrelevant is that the price of all of these tokens is determined by exchanges and operators who are offshore, unregulated, and using variety of market manipulation tactics to control the price, right? So like for example, the bitcoin ETFs that have been denied by the SEC and everybody's up in arms about it. There's a very clear list. I think it's like seven or eight things that the SEC lists every time they reject one of these applications about the problems with bitcoin markets and why they can't allow one of these things to be registered in the United States. And that's a laundry list of problems that has not been. So, like, my thing is, again, I'm agnostic about things like bitcoin because to me it's irrelevant. The price is what is important right now.
00:14:20.196 - 00:14:21.886, Speaker A: The price is what's sucking people in.
00:14:21.908 - 00:14:26.562, Speaker D: And having them spend their money on it. And they're vastly overpaying, almost certainly because.
00:14:26.616 - 00:14:30.066, Speaker A: The price is determined by fraud. And that's the problem.
00:14:30.248 - 00:14:46.422, Speaker D: I focus on that. It's like sort of like arguing about religion or something. It's like you can set things aside and say, okay, well, there are certain problems that we have to focus on before we can talk about these more philosophical questions of what the value is when we don't have any way to tell right now because the entire value.
00:14:46.476 - 00:14:48.730, Speaker A: Is based on largely on fraud.
00:14:49.710 - 00:14:56.026, Speaker B: Okay, so you're like agnostic on whether bitcoin intrinsically has value?
00:14:56.208 - 00:15:03.046, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know what that even means. Here's the thing. I tend to buy assets that generate.
00:15:03.078 - 00:15:05.966, Speaker A: Cash flow or assets that I can use.
00:15:05.988 - 00:15:07.182, Speaker D: So for example, I buy a house.
00:15:07.236 - 00:15:08.478, Speaker A: Because I can live in it.
00:15:08.644 - 00:15:25.086, Speaker D: I buy stocks and companies that I think are honest. I mean, obviously they can lie to you and you can get tricked. But I try to buy companies that I think are going to survive for more than a couple of years and make profits. I try to buy bonds that generate returns, that sort of thing. So, like, something like bitcoin that doesn't.
00:15:25.118 - 00:15:29.934, Speaker A: Generate returns and also at least gold.
00:15:29.982 - 00:15:38.694, Speaker D: You can bury it in the backyard or something and it'll sit there forever and it's an element. It literally was made by stars. It's not going to go anywhere. Right, but bitcoin depends on certain things.
00:15:38.732 - 00:15:41.830, Speaker A: Like a network that operates continuously, right?
00:15:41.900 - 00:15:54.238, Speaker D: There are certain things it has to have. So I would say I'm skeptical that I would ever invest in it myself. But whether or not it has intrinsic value is a question that I don't think anybody can answer because it's one of those philosophical questions that I don't.
00:15:54.244 - 00:15:58.794, Speaker A: Think has an answer, right, meaning there's just opinions.
00:15:58.922 - 00:16:17.986, Speaker D: Yeah, those are opinions. Frankly, markets are opinions. Right? Like this idea of efficient markets. I could get people mad at me and say, look at GameStop or something. But even in supposedly real regulated markets, there's all sorts of I mean, there's real fraud too. And that's the problem, I think with a lot of the people in crypto.
00:16:18.018 - 00:16:19.478, Speaker A: Is that you'll point out and say.
00:16:19.484 - 00:16:24.742, Speaker D: Well, look at all the fraud happening here and they say, well, but look at the real markets or the regulated markets and look at all the fraud happening there.
00:16:24.796 - 00:16:26.566, Speaker A: And that's true, there is a lot.
00:16:26.588 - 00:16:27.778, Speaker D: Of fraud in those spaces but it's.
00:16:27.794 - 00:16:30.134, Speaker A: Like an order of magnitude less and.
00:16:30.172 - 00:16:33.734, Speaker D: At least they're trading things that have some intrinsic value that you can prove.
00:16:33.782 - 00:16:33.946, Speaker A: Right?
00:16:33.968 - 00:16:35.482, Speaker D: Like cash flow is intrinsic value.
00:16:35.536 - 00:16:37.386, Speaker A: To me that's intrinsic value.
00:16:37.568 - 00:16:53.358, Speaker B: Okay, but I think then actually the way I was starting to characterize it is correct that you are agnostic on whether Bitcoin intrinsically has value. You're saying the question is around how these markets operate, am I right?
00:16:53.524 - 00:17:03.906, Speaker D: That's the problem that I'm interested in. Yeah, that's the problem that I think is because that's the problem that's relevant right now, right? The problem that's relevant is all these people across the world are investing their.
00:17:03.928 - 00:17:05.106, Speaker A: Money in this stuff.
00:17:05.288 - 00:17:11.766, Speaker D: And if it's not a fair system for determining prices, if the prices don't represent whatever the intrinsic value may or.
00:17:11.788 - 00:17:17.014, Speaker A: May not be right, then that's the problem that we have to address before.
00:17:17.052 - 00:17:20.646, Speaker D: We move forward with arguing about what the actual value or use cases of.
00:17:20.668 - 00:17:23.338, Speaker A: These things may or may not be. Okay?
00:17:23.504 - 00:17:29.770, Speaker B: Because I was going to ask you for your opinion on Ethereum next, but I don't know if it's basically the same as what you just said.
00:17:29.840 - 00:17:42.846, Speaker D: I mean, I think that it's interesting almost exclusively. I look at the Ethereum blockchain, right? The interesting part for me is that this is probably the first time in history where you can track fraud in.
00:17:42.868 - 00:17:44.702, Speaker A: Real time publicly, right?
00:17:44.756 - 00:17:46.366, Speaker D: Like I can see every transaction they.
00:17:46.388 - 00:17:47.830, Speaker A: Make, at least on chain.
00:17:47.850 - 00:17:49.266, Speaker D: Obviously there's a lot happening outside of.
00:17:49.288 - 00:17:50.946, Speaker A: That, but you can still learn a.
00:17:50.968 - 00:17:56.066, Speaker D: Lot and that's never happened in history as far as I know. So there are cool aspects to it.
00:17:56.168 - 00:18:03.350, Speaker A: But again, what's the activity on the Ethereum blockchain doing? It's transacting in Ponzi schemes and frauds.
00:18:04.490 - 00:18:22.702, Speaker D: You have software as a service, which is a major category of business to me. Ethereum and other blockchains like it are scam as a service. That's what they're offering. But really, I mean, like, let's be fair. I mean, look at all the tokens listed on Ethereum. How many of them, even to someone who believes in, say something like Bitcoin, how many of them have intrinsic value.
00:18:22.756 - 00:18:24.970, Speaker A: Even to that degree? They don't.
00:18:25.130 - 00:18:29.342, Speaker D: And that's what it's used for. That's what most of the volume on that blockchain is for.
00:18:29.396 - 00:18:31.358, Speaker A: So what is it then?
00:18:31.524 - 00:18:48.946, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think probably for some of the crypto entrepreneurs that listen to my show, they're probably listening to this and they're thinking, well, I'm building something legitimate. We're actually trying to do XYZ. So for those, how would you categorize those?
00:18:49.048 - 00:19:21.454, Speaker D: So here's what I think. Right. And this kind of goes back to what I was saying before about theoretically there are use cases for blockchains, right? There are banks playing around with them. Theoretically, maybe you could use it for tracking inventory or something. Whether or not you need a public decentralized blockchain for that versus a private blockchain that has nothing to do with Bitcoin or Ethereum or any of the other public blockchains that we see, that's one question that I think needs to be answered. But regardless, there may be legitimate projects happening, but the problem is that none of those projects are selling tokens to.
00:19:21.492 - 00:19:26.562, Speaker A: Customers or to consumers because it's almost certainly illegal, right?
00:19:26.696 - 00:19:33.998, Speaker D: Like securities laws say that these things are almost certainly securities. So anyone who's trying to do this in a legitimate fashion is not selling.
00:19:34.014 - 00:19:37.374, Speaker A: This stuff to people. So it's not even relevant.
00:19:37.422 - 00:19:43.794, Speaker D: Again, these are projects that I even see as related to the question of what's happening in crypto.
00:19:43.922 - 00:19:46.114, Speaker A: They're doing their own thing that's completely separate.
00:19:46.242 - 00:19:47.878, Speaker D: They don't need the Ethereum blockchain because.
00:19:47.884 - 00:19:49.594, Speaker A: They'Re building their own. Right?
00:19:49.632 - 00:19:54.022, Speaker D: I mean, name one project using the Ethereum blockchain that actually generates cash flow.
00:19:54.086 - 00:19:57.946, Speaker A: Or generates something of value. I haven't found it yet.
00:19:58.128 - 00:20:09.258, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I guess for some of what you said, it almost feels like you're saying, like, literally every ERC 20 token is a ponzi or a scam.
00:20:09.354 - 00:20:16.366, Speaker D: I mean, they either are or they're used to transact in them. I mean, I don't think like, USDC, I don't think is a fraud, but.
00:20:16.388 - 00:20:18.560, Speaker A: I think that what is it used for?
00:20:19.590 - 00:20:21.666, Speaker D: It's used probably to do things that.
00:20:21.768 - 00:20:23.058, Speaker A: It'S used to move money in a.
00:20:23.064 - 00:20:30.626, Speaker D: Way that can't be moved through banks legitimately. So maybe there's some questions there that need to be answered. But I don't think, like, USDC is.
00:20:30.648 - 00:20:34.630, Speaker A: A ponzi, but, like, most of the tokens that are sold on there just.
00:20:34.700 - 00:20:56.830, Speaker B: I do think there are a lot of legitimate payments that are made in USDC, and I don't think they're only the ones that can't be made via banks. Because I can think of plenty of instances of people who either get paid in USDC or people who have asked me to pay them in USDC or whatever, that they're just normal payments.
00:20:57.570 - 00:21:05.934, Speaker D: Sure, but those are just transferring money to people. That's not what actually people are investing their money in. Right. Like people aren't like, investing in stablecoins.
00:21:05.982 - 00:21:11.250, Speaker A: Thinking they're going to get rich. They're buying stablecoins to do other transactions on the right.
00:21:11.320 - 00:21:18.770, Speaker B: Right, okay. But for some reason I thought you were saying that every USDC transaction was one that couldn't be done legitimately through.
00:21:18.840 - 00:21:23.494, Speaker D: No, I don't think every one of them is, but I think you can find a lot of examples of ones.
00:21:23.532 - 00:21:25.942, Speaker A: That are and that wouldn't be possible.
00:21:25.996 - 00:21:33.246, Speaker D: In the traditional finance system. And that's going to be a problem when regulators, now that they're finally aware of what's happening here, it's going to.
00:21:33.248 - 00:21:35.574, Speaker A: Be interesting to see if these stable.
00:21:35.622 - 00:21:37.338, Speaker D: Coins are able to function in the.
00:21:37.344 - 00:21:38.714, Speaker A: Way that they function currently.
00:21:38.912 - 00:21:42.298, Speaker D: I don't know if that's going to be possible if regulators really start to.
00:21:42.384 - 00:21:44.266, Speaker A: Get digging their teeth into it.
00:21:44.448 - 00:21:54.080, Speaker B: Okay, but what do you mean by that? I mean, the way they function currently is like you can just transfer them on a blockchain. And you were saying that somehow regulators won't allow that to happen.
00:21:54.530 - 00:21:57.346, Speaker A: I guess we're going to see. I don't know.
00:21:57.448 - 00:21:59.906, Speaker D: I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with all.
00:21:59.928 - 00:22:01.698, Speaker A: Of this stuff in about a year.
00:22:01.864 - 00:22:08.918, Speaker B: Okay, meaning, like, you think that maybe they'll require intermediaries to send the money and that will take ky, I have.
00:22:08.924 - 00:22:26.986, Speaker D: No idea what those regulations, what form they'll take. But I think what's going to happen is that a lot of the companies that have been facilitating the banking side of the stablecoins are going to face problems. And the problem is, if you can't find a bank to do the transactions or to hold the money for you or to facilitate transitioning it in and.
00:22:27.008 - 00:22:30.166, Speaker A: Out of the crypto ecosystem, then that's.
00:22:30.198 - 00:22:32.090, Speaker D: Probably where the regulations are going to come.
00:22:32.160 - 00:22:33.562, Speaker A: But we'll see.
00:22:33.616 - 00:22:33.834, Speaker B: Okay.
00:22:33.872 - 00:22:34.702, Speaker A: Who knows? Yeah.
00:22:34.756 - 00:22:39.674, Speaker B: I do have a question for you about banking because I did notice you tend to write about that a lot recently.
00:22:39.722 - 00:22:40.320, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:41.090 - 00:22:56.190, Speaker B: But one other question I wanted to ask about your general stance is that do you think that crypto will take off as a technology or is that just still a separate question from what you like to even tackle?
00:22:56.270 - 00:23:05.794, Speaker D: I mean, I think it is a separate question from what I like to tackle. That being said, blockchain technology has existed for what, 30 years now or something? I remember exactly when it was invented.
00:23:05.922 - 00:23:07.734, Speaker B: No, 2008. 2008.
00:23:07.772 - 00:23:08.834, Speaker D: Well, that's bitcoin.
00:23:08.882 - 00:23:09.314, Speaker B: Bitcoin.
00:23:09.362 - 00:23:13.900, Speaker D: But in terms of private blockchains, that's been around much longer. That technology has been around for a long time.
00:23:14.270 - 00:23:17.206, Speaker B: Well, as far as I understand, I think bitcoin is the first blockchain.
00:23:17.318 - 00:23:33.374, Speaker D: No, bitcoin is the first decentralized blockchain. There are early instances of blockchains, I remember the name of them, but that's been developed since the it's not like private blockchains are not a new technology. So the fact that they haven't been.
00:23:33.412 - 00:23:36.526, Speaker A: Adopted in any broad, I mean, they.
00:23:36.548 - 00:23:40.942, Speaker D: Would have been adopted by now, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. Do I think bitcoin has certain advantages?
00:23:41.006 - 00:23:41.970, Speaker A: Sure it does.
00:23:42.120 - 00:23:43.714, Speaker D: Again, I guess I don't know.
00:23:43.752 - 00:23:49.678, Speaker A: I haven't seen what it's really used for beyond selling drugs and saying it's.
00:23:49.694 - 00:23:51.046, Speaker D: A store of value, which I don't.
00:23:51.068 - 00:23:52.438, Speaker A: See the argument for that.
00:23:52.604 - 00:24:08.394, Speaker B: And so earlier when you were talking about how you feel like it's really the markets that are the main issue here, what do you feel would need to happen to make this space something more legitimate or to just resolve some of these issues that you talked about?
00:24:08.512 - 00:24:17.802, Speaker A: Well, I mean realistically the space won't exist the way it does if there's regulation, right? Like if these things are considered securities.
00:24:17.866 - 00:24:25.086, Speaker D: And the SEC is very strict about that and says, hey, any token that's issued by a company is a security, they won't be issued because the whole.
00:24:25.108 - 00:24:28.270, Speaker A: Point of doing this was regulatory arbitrage.
00:24:28.630 - 00:24:46.326, Speaker D: That's why they did it the way they did it. That's why all these VC firms got so interested in it was that this was a way to basically offer securities contracts to consumers without having to go through all the rigor moral of actually following regulations or offering something that had any kind of link to anything in reality. Because none of these tokens confer any.
00:24:46.348 - 00:24:48.658, Speaker A: Kind of legal right to any it's.
00:24:48.674 - 00:24:50.742, Speaker D: Not like they're debt instruments or their stock or anything.
00:24:50.796 - 00:24:53.110, Speaker A: They're just pieces of code on a blockchain.
00:24:53.190 - 00:24:59.130, Speaker D: I don't even know if the space will exist in a similar fashion to what it is right now with true regulation.
00:24:59.550 - 00:25:03.020, Speaker A: I mean the question would be what is it going to be used for? Right?
00:25:03.810 - 00:25:05.518, Speaker D: Could I see theoretically like here's an.
00:25:05.524 - 00:25:12.400, Speaker A: Example theoretically could you have stocks on the blockchain? Sure you could but.
00:25:14.930 - 00:25:23.074, Speaker D: It would be a completely different thing and I don't know how much of a difference it would make between having it set up on a blockchain versus the way it is currently. I don't know what difference that would really make.
00:25:23.192 - 00:25:25.058, Speaker A: And then the final point would be.
00:25:25.224 - 00:25:29.206, Speaker D: Just because blockchain is a good technology or not let's say it is, that.
00:25:29.228 - 00:25:31.110, Speaker A: Doesn'T mean they're going to use Ethereum.
00:25:31.450 - 00:25:39.990, Speaker D: It doesn't mean they're going to use Bitcoin. It doesn't mean they're going to use Solana or whatever. Anybody can set up their own blockchain to do whatever they want.
00:25:40.060 - 00:25:43.626, Speaker A: They could copy the code. They literally can copy the code.
00:25:43.648 - 00:25:51.074, Speaker D: I mean that's what Signature Bank did for their private blockchain. They largely copied the code for Ethereum and modified it. Anybody can do that and set up their own blockchain.
00:25:51.142 - 00:25:54.222, Speaker A: So I just don't see the case.
00:25:54.276 - 00:26:03.918, Speaker D: That you have to invest in Ethereum or Solana or whatever when anybody else who's well resourced and motivated can create their own blockchain to do whatever it.
00:26:03.924 - 00:26:05.106, Speaker A: Is they want to do.
00:26:05.288 - 00:26:22.150, Speaker B: Yeah, just to go back to using blockchains to trade stocks. Paxos is working on something or frankly they already have a product like that and the advantage is shorter settlement times. So that became an issue with Robinhood and GameStop.
00:26:22.650 - 00:26:33.834, Speaker D: Well I don't want to talk about that because I'm not an expert but I know that there were certain other issues with the failure to delivers on that that actually do sort of bail out the whole short squeeze thing.
00:26:33.872 - 00:26:36.826, Speaker A: But that's probably a topic for another mean.
00:26:36.848 - 00:26:43.786, Speaker D: I don't know. Yeah theoretically sure, theoretically it's possible. But again, if the Nasdaq wanted to do it on a blockchain they could.
00:26:43.808 - 00:26:48.810, Speaker A: Just make their own blockchain and set it up. On there. They don't need to go buy Ethereum.
00:26:48.970 - 00:26:55.774, Speaker D: That's my problem, is like, you can buy Ethereum thinking, well, this is going to be the future and maybe you're right. I don't think you are, but maybe you're right.
00:26:55.892 - 00:26:58.194, Speaker A: But that doesn't mean that Ethereum is the future.
00:26:58.312 - 00:27:04.034, Speaker D: It's sort of like buying stock in MySpace thinking that that's going to be the only social media network in the world.
00:27:04.232 - 00:27:08.180, Speaker A: Right. I mean, it's the same problem, right.
00:27:09.530 - 00:27:14.886, Speaker B: Is that like an admission that one of these with the token will eventually take off?
00:27:15.068 - 00:27:17.510, Speaker D: No, it's a statement that could happen.
00:27:17.660 - 00:27:18.562, Speaker A: Theoretically.
00:27:18.706 - 00:27:21.586, Speaker D: I don't think it will could, but I don't think any of the ones.
00:27:21.628 - 00:27:24.266, Speaker A: That currently exist will be used because.
00:27:24.288 - 00:27:35.534, Speaker D: There'S no motivation to. Why would you like if you're the Nasdaq or you're Morgan and you want to set up your own blockchain to do whatever or you want to use a blockchain, why would you go use somebody else's when you can just make.
00:27:35.572 - 00:27:38.414, Speaker A: Your own and control it from day one?
00:27:38.452 - 00:27:39.806, Speaker D: I mean, there's no motivation for that.
00:27:39.828 - 00:27:41.678, Speaker A: So that's why I don't see the.
00:27:41.684 - 00:27:45.682, Speaker D: Point of owning any of these projects because they can be easily replaced by.
00:27:45.736 - 00:27:50.740, Speaker A: Somebody else's project that's used for whatever purpose it is they're using it for.
00:27:51.190 - 00:28:05.474, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the private ones, in order for them to make sense, it needs to be consortiums. But because these are private companies that are used to competing with each other, they haven't really taken off realistically.
00:28:05.522 - 00:28:31.578, Speaker D: Who actually wants to have all of their transactions public? Do I want people knowing where I spend every dollar? I mean, that's the whole CBDC thing, right? Would you want that to be legible to everyone? No, I don't want that. Does a company want their competitors to be able to see where they're moving inventory or something? No, they don't want that. Privacy and secrecy are valuable assets when you're doing real business. So that's another argument about public blockchains.
00:28:31.594 - 00:28:33.998, Speaker A: I've never really understood is that a.
00:28:34.004 - 00:28:40.334, Speaker D: Lot of people want privacy and there's no advantage to using a blockchain that's public especially. And in fact, there's a disadvantage.
00:28:40.462 - 00:29:02.314, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see what happens with zero knowledge technology, which could make things private but also have public guarantees. I feel like that could maybe change things, but we're going to move on from some of this theoretical conversation and talk about pretty specific things in the news.

00:30:33.370 - 00:30:50.300, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with James. So let's talk about FTX. You had that breakaway post about Alameda, and I was just curious for your kind of overall general thoughts on what happened there and what the crypto industry can learn from that situation.
00:30:51.310 - 00:30:53.774, Speaker A: So I focused when I wrote this.
00:30:53.812 - 00:31:00.430, Speaker D: Article because obviously we only found out a few days later the extent of the fraud that had been happening there.
00:31:00.500 - 00:31:02.670, Speaker A: But the part that I focused on.
00:31:02.740 - 00:31:26.678, Speaker D: Was how they had used various tokens to create billions of dollars in fictitious value, which they then borrowed money against and also showed to their VC investors and said, look how much money we have. Please give us some more money for us to continue to build our elaborate scheme here. I think that part of the reason I was able to recognize what they were doing is that that's what a.
00:31:26.684 - 00:31:28.326, Speaker A: Lot of these guys are doing, right?
00:31:28.428 - 00:31:46.714, Speaker D: If you go back to I focused a lot on Celsius network, they were doing the same thing with their token. They had created a token. They were going to do what they call the flywheel, which is this idea that somehow their token would be used to capture or value and basically create this virtuous cycle of almost like perpetual motion in finance.
00:31:46.842 - 00:31:48.718, Speaker A: And if you really think about what.
00:31:48.724 - 00:31:54.574, Speaker D: Was happening, it didn't make any sense. What was actually happening was they were spending their own customers money to drive.
00:31:54.612 - 00:31:56.334, Speaker A: The price of this token up and.
00:31:56.372 - 00:32:02.300, Speaker D: Then marking it to their market on their balance sheet and saying, look how much money we have going to pension funds and saying, please invest with us. And that.
