00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.942, Speaker UNK: As they always say.
00:00:00.996 - 00:00:41.606, Speaker A: If at first you don't succeed, be a rich dude in crypto. Su Zu and Kyle Davies, the founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three AC, are back. They're launching an exchange for insolvent crypto claims, which feels a little bit like giving people paper cuts and then charging for overpriced. Bandaids one of the premises of their company, open exchange, is to offer claimants for bankrupt funds like FTX and celsius the chance to be made whole. Given that Ft s claims right now are trading at, it's possible that their definition of whole is the same as SBF's. The venture successfully raised $25 million from investors, which does make me wonder if the vibe in VC right now is like, what's there to lose? CEO Leslie Lamb has said that.
00:00:41.628 - 00:00:41.718, Speaker UNK: The.
00:00:41.724 - 00:00:59.740, Speaker A: Goal of the new fund is to help the crypto industry. And let me just say, we love a pivot. Three AC case is not settled, and US. Authorities have actually issued a subpoena to Kyle Davies via Twitter. You know that Twitter could be used to issue subpoenas. He didn't. But to me, it's no crazier than the idea that FTX claimants could be made whole.
