00:00:00.170 - 00:00:26.150, Speaker A: I think this makes the theory for the Coinbase lawsuit very difficult. The theory there really was based on some sort of version of the embodiment theory that Tokens embodied the securities transactions and that is really what was squarely rejected here. So I think that there will be some effort to sort of recast some of the allegations. But I think this is a direct hit on theory that was being caused by the SEC there.
00:00:26.220 - 00:00:53.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, honestly, I think the big winner of this decision is Coinbase. I think even more so than Ripple Coinbase. I will note immediately, a few hours after the decision came out, decided to relist XRP. And I think that says everything. I think that the industry is viewing this decision as just as we've been saying, as rejecting the SEC theory that the assets themselves are securities.
