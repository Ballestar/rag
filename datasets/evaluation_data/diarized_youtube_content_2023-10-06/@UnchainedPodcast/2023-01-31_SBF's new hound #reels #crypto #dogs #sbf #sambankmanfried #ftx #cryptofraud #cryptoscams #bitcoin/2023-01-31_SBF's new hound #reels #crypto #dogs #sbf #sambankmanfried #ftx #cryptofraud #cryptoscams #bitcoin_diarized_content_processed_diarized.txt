00:00:00.410 - 00:00:21.054, Speaker A: Amazing news. Sam Bankman Freed is alone no longer. He now has a Sam Bankman friend. Man's best friend, to be exact. SBF has enlisted the services of Sandor, a 75 pound dog who's trained to attack on command when he hears a secret word. SBF's parents bought him Sandor because, apparently he was getting death threats. I don't find it so hard to believe, though.
00:00:21.054 - 00:00:59.050, Speaker A: I mean, SBF recently had to fight off a stalker, which is wild. I mean, after years of failed Hinge wipes for SBF, finally, somebody's after him. Sandor lives with SBF at his parents $4 million Palo Alto mansion, the mansion his dad bought with the money he earned as a law school professor, even though he gave legal advice to SBF. That would be like if Elon Musk were a professor of running a successful social network. Sandor is a welcome companion for SBF, who's expressed a lot of sorrow at not having anyone to talk to any more because all of his friends were work friends. You know how rough it is when all your friends choose the feds over you? It's like the adult crypto scam version of getting stuffed in a locker.
