00:00:00.730 - 00:00:41.014, Speaker A: Most layer ones. And when I say most layer ones, I mean, I think, I think at this point there's certainly dozens and there's probably hundreds because I don't know them all. The ones that don't have enough demand, they're probably going to become roll ups, right, because they built duplicative data centers that they can't maintain, that they're going to bleed out value from. And then people are going to eventually give up and be like, well, why am I eating all this annual supply inflation when there's no transaction fee demand on the horizon? And so some will die. Maybe they'll shut off their validator sets. I don't know. We've talked before about how protocols don't die the way companies do and that's kind of a murky thing that I'll leave there to the side.
00:00:41.014 - 00:00:59.260, Speaker A: But they'll certainly fade into irrelevance unless they kind of give themselves a second life by moving to a roll up system where a roll up system, you're going from having a pretty costly validator set to a few sequencers or a shared sequencer. And there's teams working on shared sequencers now.
