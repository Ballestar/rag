00:00:00.170 - 00:00:41.650, Speaker A: So the FBI has seized a bored ape, which, now that it's mired in government bureaucracy, is an extremely bored ape. Going to a recent report, the FBI seized the ape a doodle NFT about 87 ETH and a $40,000 watch, all from an infamous crypto scammer named Horror. By far the most shocking part of this story is that when the government seized the assets, the ETH was worth about $116,000, and today it's worth about $144,000. That is a twist for the ages. Of course, the FBI themselves did not actually find Horror doing things, achieving goals, helping people, that's not really like what the government's all about. Independent blockchain investor Zach XBT to the rescue. We don't know the real identity of Zack XBT.
00:00:41.650 - 00:00:59.500, Speaker A: He is not, as his name suggests, one of Elon Musk's children. But get this horror was discovered because of a $40,000 watch that he bragged about on social media. Doesn't he have anything normal to post about, like an avocado? All of which is to say, if you're going to steal a shit ton of crypto, have the decency to use your iPhone to keep track of time.
