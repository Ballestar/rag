00:00:00.250 - 00:00:52.170, Speaker A: One of the things John said to me that I thought was quite interesting and again, I think this is newsworthy. That's why I'm sharing it is he said not only does he anticipate getting to 100% recovery by trying to increase the numerator, but really it's by decreasing the denominator. I think he really means it. And one of the things he highlighted was KYC AML on the denominator, meaning all the claimants. Like who hasn't in KYC daymld, like who's got funny money floating around on our a big I think that's going to be a big issue with claimants. And one of the other things he highlighted was people treasuries with really alt projects that have treasuries that are with FTX and now have claims instead of dollarizing those claims like you would traditionally do. I think he was basically saying to me, like, I'm just going to give that person and back their crappy coins.
