00:03:13.602 - 00:03:26.506, Speaker A: The topic of today's episode is the crypto scene in Asia. How is it faring during the crypto winter? Here to discuss are Eric Meltzer and Dovey Wan, founding partners of Primitive Ventures. Welcome, Eric and Dovey.
00:03:26.618 - 00:03:27.354, Speaker C: Hey Laura.
00:03:27.402 - 00:03:29.166, Speaker D: Thanks Laura. It's great to be here.
00:03:29.348 - 00:03:41.934, Speaker A: Before we dive into questions about Asia and there is a lot to discuss there, let's quickly discuss your backgrounds. Can you each tell me how you got into crypto and came to start Primitive Ventures? Why don't we start with you, Debbie?
00:03:42.062 - 00:04:43.318, Speaker C: Yeah, so I was born and raised back in China and moved to US to pursue my master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University at the age of 20. So I worked at Ebay for like four years as a product manager and move on to traditional venture investment. Back in venture I've been doing blockchain investment, fintech investment, AI investment, and got into crypto when I was doing blockchain investment. And I remember I met with Eric just during the Zcash time. So that was back in early 2017. And Eric and I, we were both the community board elector for Zcash. And so that's how we get to know each other and we hang out quite a and like, Eric became my crypto buddy and so we literally just talk every day and afterwards, because I do like venture investment, there's a lot of just a legacy problem.
00:04:43.318 - 00:05:09.226, Speaker C: Say for instance, it's very hard to maintain your just asset liquidity. Basically I have to hop between both traditional Venture and crypto. Crypto is already twenty four seven and so it's pretty tiring. And so that's why me and Eric, we were thinking, what about we probably just start our own thing. I can be a full time crypto, so like, that's my background.
00:05:09.418 - 00:05:13.200, Speaker A: And for your venture you were at Danhua Ventures, right?
00:05:13.810 - 00:05:15.054, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right.
00:05:15.172 - 00:05:18.782, Speaker A: And just describe who they like.
00:05:18.836 - 00:05:54.282, Speaker C: Danhawa Capital has to be it has been a pretty major Asian background venture fund in Silicon Valley. I think at the top, our AUM, the total AUM was over half a billion. And so it is actually backed by some of the very top strategic money, like Alibaba Baidu, Tencent, et cetera. So that's why it has been like a leading force of this Asian investor in the Valley.
00:05:54.426 - 00:06:00.778, Speaker A: And Eric. What about you? How did you get into crypto and if you have anything to add about how you came to start Primitive Ventures?
00:06:00.954 - 00:06:40.934, Speaker D: Yeah. So I went to college in China, actually. Also, I was at Peking University. And I'm also Jewish. And so I guess those two things kind of conspired to make me really excited about bitcoin. So in 2013 I was introduced yeah, let me elaborate here's background there, because I guess my interest in bitcoin I think is a lot more political than a lot of investors. And what that comes from is as a Jew, I read historically about how when the Jews had been oppressed in various countries, really the first thing that happened, kind of the predecessor to a genocide was people's financial assets would be frozen.
00:06:40.934 - 00:07:10.674, Speaker D: And so every jew has some story about how their ancestors had to flee with basically just the clothes on their back. And so when I heard about this form of digital money that was completely outside of government control, I thought that was like an incredibly exciting thing. Really, from a political perspective. I wasn't that interested in the tech. And to this day, I really don't think the tech is something that new. It's kind of more of a recombination of existing interesting stuff. And then going to China kind of further reinforced that, because China has these super strict capital controls.
00:07:10.674 - 00:07:51.918, Speaker D: And so I had a bunch of Chinese friends that wanted to move money out of China, and they would have to find 20 friends that could each send $50,000 in order to move a million out of China. And that also just drove home for me that it was kind of ludicrous to have our money in the control of a central government. And so that got me both of those things kind of got me really into bitcoin, but I wasn't that interested in crypto as a whole. I kind of just thought bitcoin was like, this one off, really cool thing. But the other coins that were around when I first got started, if you went and looked at coin market cap in 2013, they were almost all complete garbage. There were just obvious scams. There was mega coin and feather coin and all these ridiculous things that have since died.
00:07:51.918 - 00:08:20.170, Speaker D: And so I didn't think of it as an industry by any means. I just thought it was this kind of cool thing. And then way later, I bought some bitcoin. Back then, I held onto bitcoin. I would read bitcoin talk obsessively, but again, I didn't think of it as like a sector. And then in 2017, I started seeing things that were actually interesting. And so when ethereum and zcash and these other coins started coming out, and the exchange infrastructure really started getting built out, it appeared to me that this was actually going to be a thing.
00:08:20.170 - 00:09:07.962, Speaker D: And through kind of a crazy series of coincidences, I ended up joining an investment firm in China called INB that's founded by this really interesting guy named V Shaolai, who to this day is one of the biggest holders of bitcoin. And so I worked with them for a while, became a partner there, and ran an early investment fund at INB. And that's how I met dovey. So Dovey and I were doing very similar kind of early stage investment stuff, and I think the two of us are similarly picky. If you look at know, I think Dovey and I have more in common with hardcore crypto skeptics that hate all crypto than we do with crypto ultra bulls, and that 99% of the stuff they hate, we hate, too. It's just that we think there's sort of a 1% kernel of things that are like the absolute truth and are super amazing. And so it was really refreshing to meet someone like that.
00:09:07.962 - 00:09:20.240, Speaker D: Like Dovey said, we ended up just talking constantly and we co invested in a bunch of stuff and at some point I was like well I mean if we're going to be co investing this often we may as well just have a fund of our own. And so that's how Primitive got started.
00:09:20.930 - 00:09:58.634, Speaker A: So the reason I wanted to have you guys both on the show is because I feel like you are both pretty steeped in the crypto world across regions and the last time I did a show about Asia was actually quite a while ago, was like a year and a half ago. So I was really curious to know kind of where things have been going over there. And so just in really broad strokes, why don't we just start with kind of like the big picture. How would you characterize the differences between crypto entrepreneurs and the crypto projects and teams in Asia versus the rest of the mean?
00:09:58.672 - 00:10:46.854, Speaker D: Something that Davi and I think about a lot is that crypto is inherently global. Right? There's no sort of built in restrictions in terms of where you can participate. And so as a fund we look really globally and what we found is that the stuff that we like in Asia and the stuff that we like in the US is completely different. And so in know a very high percentage, a distressingly high percentage of projects I think of as outright scams. And if they're not scams they're just really uninteresting stuff. But the sort of centralized infrastructure around crypto so like the Binance, the Huawei, the OK exchange, the unity, these kind of guys are in my opinion like an order of magnitude better than the US counterparts. And so if you compare binance not to pick on anyone but know, poloniax or something, it's just the team is incredibly competent, their execution ability is off the charts.
00:10:46.854 - 00:11:03.070, Speaker D: And so what we found is that we look at and do a lot more like equity deals in China that are for kind of crypto associated companies and then we do a lot more actual cryptocurrency deals in the US. Where I think there's kind of more sort of old school cypherpunk like cryptographer.
00:11:05.170 - 00:11:06.126, Speaker A: Oh go ahead.
00:11:06.148 - 00:12:21.350, Speaker C: Davi yeah right. So especially for just crypto entrepreneurs and one thing specific in China or just Asia in general is because we found all this application, this centralized application are really good to use there and I think that's probably partially because of the whole fintech thing is pretty advanced just backing China. So here in the United States and people are still paying with placid and write out billions of paper checks every year but everything is cashless. So if you ever go to Beijing, Shanghai, just that people just use alipay or Wichipay everywhere. So I think the centralized application or centralized fintech infrastructure is way more advanced there. So that's why there's a lot of talents and entrepreneurs and this traditional fintech founder who are converted to crypto founder and so that's where we find the true talents that belongs to that specific layer of applications.
00:12:21.510 - 00:12:44.020, Speaker A: Is that why you think that they differ in that way where kind of like the startups and the infrastructure as you described it is more advanced and interesting in China versus here. But then also on the flip side, why do you think more of the decentralized protocols and stuff are more those projects are more interesting in the US.
00:12:44.710 - 00:13:22.970, Speaker C: I think if you're entrepreneur who are building for a centralized application and so you have to be really good at user acquisition. User acquisition in the sense of at a consumer level. And when it comes to a protocol, when it comes to a protocol layer projects, the first set of clients, clients are more like developers. So you are basically targeting two different groups of users out there and so it's a complete different skill. So I think that's why that sets them apart to a certain extent.
00:13:23.710 - 00:14:25.680, Speaker D: There's something else that Davy brought up a while ago that I think we should mention, which is know, if you're working in crypto, you're working on a technology that's fundamentally anti government, and you're working on a technology that has a ton know, regulatory risk. And so you kind of need to be someone that's extremely comfortable with being a pirate. And we've noticed there's more of those people than you would expect in china. Despite know, there's kind of not the crypto firepower that we would want for these protocol level projects, but in terms of a CZ and hoyi type of team like you have at binance, where they're just going to go ahead and do this thing and if it works, it's fine, and if it doesn't, they'll live in singapore or something. And it's been slightly a bummer for me because there's been definitely projects in the US where they approach me with something that I think is really cool and I'm like, well, but you guys are US citizens and you're under US regulatory regime and what you're trying to do is just not going to fly in the US. And so we can't fund this because it's not going to work in the.
00:14:26.210 - 00:15:03.054, Speaker A: You know, I thought you were going to go in the opposite direction with that statement. I thought that Dovey's point was that the fintech firms had done well in Asia or China because the fintechs had done well, that that's why these startups, these exchanges had done well, but that something decentralized is really different. And I thought where you were going with being anti government was that people in the west are more used to doing that and that's why they're more, I guess, developing more interesting decentralized protocols. But you see it the, it's really.
00:15:03.092 - 00:15:53.242, Speaker D: I think it's really nuanced. So the nuance that I would try to try to explain is that the Chinese infrastructure firms that are flourishing, they're doing so outside of China. So it's Chinese teams but they're not dealing with Chinese regulatory risk because they don't have Chinese fiat channels and so there's some kind of interplay there. And then the other thing is the general, I think sort of Chinese developer profile I would say is much more sort of authoritarian and unwilling to challenge authority. But then you get these occasional teams not to come back to Binance, but I think they're really amazing. And the other big exchanges in China as well. And a lot of the wallet projects where whether you love them or hate them, it's sort of like the Travis Kalanik Uber model, where they're like, look, we made this thing that we know people like, and maybe the regulation doesn't fit yet.
00:15:53.242 - 00:16:01.040, Speaker D: But we're just going to keep doing this and people are going to love it. And eventually the regulators will come around. And I think we've seen sort of less willingness to do that in the US.
00:16:01.570 - 00:16:31.370, Speaker A: Yeah, I will urge people if you haven't yet, to listen to my interview with CZ. I also think he's pretty amazing. But Binance is just like an incredible story. You really need to listen to that podcast if you don't know the story of Binance. So one other thing that I was wondering, so now we've discussed the difference in the entrepreneurs. Do you think that investment in the two regions differ? Do you see that Chinese investors kind of prefer certain things versus investors in the west?
00:16:32.030 - 00:17:39.614, Speaker C: I think when it comes to specifically on Chinese investors or just firms that's based in think so we have to categorize them into something like say, for instance, we have pretty good friends out there like NGC, like FBG and a few others out there and I think their preferences are very much similar as what we have. But I think there are probably hundreds of different other VC funds or crypto funds out there but they're actually not even a fund. So they're just simply like a syndicate. And so that's what we have seen in 2017 and early 2018. So hundreds of such funds pop up and many of them, they're extremely short term and so the whole fund cycle is only one year and many of them are just pure, just a pump and dumpers. And so most of them are just trading centric. And so they will help you to do market making, so they will probably do all this pongsy design with you.
00:17:39.614 - 00:18:35.978, Speaker C: And so most of them are looking for just a short term return and just a short term liquidity. And I think we have to categorize of those not their legitimate funds out there and then some of those relatively some of those good ones out there. And one thing I realized about the investor profile is many of these investors, so they don't have any just product building experience. Many of them are not working in tech industry at all. And so some of them are former amateur trader of crypto, so buying bitcoin early on and just get rich overnight. And many of them, they will probably try to invest their existing crypto and then into something they can just keep the multiple going. And so that's a very common mentality that I have seen in the whole asian landscape.
00:18:36.154 - 00:18:54.566, Speaker A: Wow. So they form these sort of temporary groups, these short term groups, and then they just these protocols or these tokens, whatever the projects are, they would take a while to build, but they're trying to get a profit within that year.
00:18:54.748 - 00:18:57.686, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's probably like a few weeks.
00:18:57.868 - 00:18:58.678, Speaker A: Oh my god.
00:18:58.764 - 00:19:35.058, Speaker D: Yeah. Well, I mean, I would add to that by saying that there's kind of this shadow ecosystem of extremely shady projects in China and extremely shady funds. And so you'll have these projects that are, in my opinion, just like pure garbage. And they'll offer to their friends who are running these kind of like, pseudo little mini funds, these huge discounts with some form of lockup. And then they play this kind of musical shares game where their token gets released. They pay some listing fee, they get listed on some exchange. And then the funds that were in early all make two or three or whatever, ten X, depending on what the situation is.
00:19:35.058 - 00:20:22.420, Speaker D: And then they just rinse and repeat. And so what happened is during the massive bull run in 2017, they were able to do that pretty successfully. And then when the market turned much less bullish, they found themselves holding on to a bunch of just pure garbage tokens that were made by teams, in my opinion, really in bad faith. And so a lot of those funds, because what dovey mentioned, they have this extremely short time cycle, they're screwed. I mean, they're in a lot of trouble because they're holding assets that have no inherent value, they have no one to sell them to and their LPs want their money back in two or three months. So I think we're going to see kind of just the way we've seen in mining and the way we've seen in projects when the market turns sour for a while, all of these kind of amateurs and scammers and everyone get washed out. And I think we're going to see a lot of washout of that kind of fund.
00:20:22.950 - 00:20:47.046, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, let's hope. One thing that I wanted to ask you was I've spoken to both of you before and I noticed that I've seen or heard you both call the advantage that silicon valley VCs used to have. You've called it an unfair advantage. And both of you said that you think that's changing now with crypto. So what do you think that advantage was before? And how do you think crypto has changed that?
00:20:47.228 - 00:21:31.986, Speaker D: So I think in the past a huge advantage, and I think this advantage still exists to some extent. And by the way, I mean, the reason we use the word unfair advantage is it's just almost like a term of art in startups where if you're investing in a team, you want to ask them what's the advantage that they have that no one else can access? And I think for Silicon Valley VCs, the big thing was just there was this huge network effect where if you were a Silicon Valley startup, everything you needed was in the Valley. Like, all your hiring was going to happen in the Valley, all of your future fundraising was going to happen on Sandhill Road on one street in Palo Alto. And so if you were a very well connected Silicon Valley VC, you could approach entrepreneurs and tell know, we're well connected to all of your potential customers. We can help you hire. Your future fundraising is going to happen with people like us. And then crypto came along, and in crypto, the ecosystem is much more global.
00:21:31.986 - 00:22:21.046, Speaker D: And so if you're a project, you have to care about, like miners, which are mostly in China, you have to care about an exchange ecosystem that's truly global, but also has a very large presence. Many, many of these crypto teams are hiring remotely in Eastern Europe, in China, in Singapore, and in the US. And so if you're an old school Sandhill Road VC, you're actually going to be at a pretty big disadvantage because when a crypto project approaches you, you really can't offer them very much. And I think crypto projects are starting to wake up to that, where in 2016, 2017, a lot of these projects were really excited to get the big name, brand name VCs on board as investors. And then they realized that the value add being promised just wasn't being delivered because these people just they're not really in the right position. They're not connected to the right people. And you're starting to see a lot more specific crypto vehicles.
00:22:21.046 - 00:22:43.790, Speaker D: A fund that we like a lot is Paradigm. And so Paradigm was like Matt Huang left Sequoia and partnered with Fred Ursum and this guy Charlie Noyes to do a fund that's specifically going to be crypto focused and that will hopefully establish these connections. And so, you know, that's going to be a trend and that it is really just the global nature of the ecosystem that sort of eliminates that advantage that Valley VCs had.
00:22:43.940 - 00:22:54.034, Speaker A: Yeah. And for people who don't know, fred Ursum is the former co founder of Coinbase who left in, I think, late 2016. Debbie, were you going to add something?
00:22:54.232 - 00:24:17.886, Speaker C: Yeah, because I think the traditional venture business has been very regional, or at least started as a very regional business. And Silicon Valley has been the center of center of technology innovation over the past few decades and the whole ecosystem is complete, right? Because we have been saying that the whole Bay area or the Silicon Valley has been a stack. For instance, in south part of the Bay area is the infrastructure, cisco, Intel, Nvidia, and so moving on to the north of the bay is San Francisco where all the application is happening. And I think when it comes to crypto, everything is very Scattle. And ever since the early days and China and Korea has been major players in the crypto landscape, the topic changes were started, I think most of them, they are still operating back in China and most of the biggest and mining operations are also ran by Chinese. And there's also other thing I want to mention, so it's about the drive and then also it's about the desire for social mobility. That's one thing that's very obvious in South Korea when it comes to South Korea, first of like South Korea has a very strict capital control as well.
00:24:17.886 - 00:25:27.590, Speaker C: And then because it has a very high demand and very low supply. And so that's how the Kimchi premium comes into so and then also that Kimchi premium kick off like a wave of crypto hype among the local Korean citizens. And then I think the hype of crypto and token investment and then also the very strong drive and desire for social mobility and then because there's illusion that you can be overnight millionaire back in Korea, that has become like a social phenomena. So both investing and doing crypto startup has become both the Chinese and Korean version of both the Chinese and Korean version of American Dream. And so that's one thing that's probably lacking in Silicon Valley right now because I think most of the value entrepreneurs, so they're relatively philosophical and idealistic comparing with Asian entrepreneur who are definitely more practical. And then the whole hype behind crypto.
00:25:29.370 - 00:26:01.930, Speaker A: Has propelled that I wanted to ask you about. So actually before we move on, I did want to note for listeners who don't know what the Kimchi premium is, that was this period, especially during 2017 when due to restrictions on where you could trade demand in Korea drove the prices up sometimes I think to like 30% higher than they were on other exchanges. Is that roughly what it was, the peak?
00:26:02.010 - 00:26:02.734, Speaker C: Pretty much, yeah.
00:26:02.772 - 00:26:11.730, Speaker A: Which is just insane for coins like bitcoin and ethereum and stuff like that. Does the Kimchi premium even exist anymore?
00:26:12.150 - 00:26:23.026, Speaker C: So I think it's down to less than 1% now because everything has be more on this equilibrium and because of better liquidity.
00:26:23.218 - 00:27:00.900, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I do know that I did hear some other podcasts and other people that are a little bit more trading oriented talk about how I think some people would try to talk to their friends and relatives in Korea to see if they could take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. I do not condone that behavior. However, that is, I think what was going on back during those days. But just out of curiosity, why do you think? Because as far as I understand, in general, I think there's just much higher trade volume in Asia than in the west. Why is that?
00:27:01.350 - 00:27:58.882, Speaker C: So, in general, like the trading volume, I think trading volume because just exchanges are there, right? Because Korea has three biggest exchanges out there, so they can accept Fiat. And so that's why the Fiat on Ram Channel is pretty sufficient there. And then China, before the ban, before the ban last year, most of the major exchanges can also accept R B. So that is the FIA. And so that's why the FIA on Ramp Channel is very smooth. And even after the ban, everything just quickly move on to Alipay or WeChat pay as the over the counters, because digital payment is already pretty advanced. And as long as we can transfer money on WeChat, and so I can have your address, and so we can actually do just over the counter transaction using this peer to peer manner.
00:27:58.882 - 00:28:06.760, Speaker C: I think that's why probably that's one of the reason why the trading volume is larger in general, but in.
00:28:09.850 - 00:28:10.902, Speaker A: That okay.
00:28:10.956 - 00:28:51.298, Speaker D: So I would add to that know, when I first moved to China for college, I was at a cafe and I saw know, middle aged woman with her computer open. And she had what looked to me like a Bloomberg terminal open. I mean, it was this really advanced trading interface and she was day trading Chinese stocks. And I was like, you wouldn't really see that in the US. And it turns out in China, tons of people are really active and in some cases very skilled day traders. And so there's a lot more, I think just like amateur traders in China, I think that the structure of their markets is a lot more retail focused, especially with the Chinese domestic stocks. And so you had this huge pool of people that were used to trading pretty speculative assets.
00:28:51.298 - 00:28:55.666, Speaker D: And so when crypto came around, they were really into it. They traded it very heavily.
00:28:55.778 - 00:28:56.566, Speaker C: Yeah, I think.
00:28:56.668 - 00:28:57.330, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:28:57.500 - 00:29:37.782, Speaker C: So there's also very unique market structure like back in Asia. So if we comparing the and so comparing the.com bubble versus the crypto bubble. And so there seems not too many investment bankers out there like just sell side by side agents. So here in United States or Silicon Valley for specific for crypto products. But there are tons of such channel or just selling agent back in, just in Korea, Japan, China or Thailand just all over. And people tend to have crazy love into financial products.
00:29:37.782 - 00:30:15.300, Speaker C: And so those financial products are either insurance or high yield product or shadow banking products. So there are so many of those just like average mom and pop. And so they will all buy into that. And so usually it can be like a shadow banking product, which is not very common here. In the US. And many of those agents, so they're actually selling crypto products, comparing with this regular financial or just shuttle banking products out there. And I think that's one of this very unique market thing back in China and back in Asia in general.
00:30:16.790 - 00:30:40.890, Speaker A: One other thing that I was curious about, though, is if you were saying that a lot of OTC crypto trading is happening via WeChat and Alipay, those are surveilled. So, you know, obviously there is this ban on Bitcoin exchanges and investing in ICOs. So could trading on those platforms or investing via those platforms, could that put people who use them at risk?
00:30:41.470 - 00:31:21.080, Speaker C: So there's actually, like a certain risk out there, especially the government. They have been rounding all this monitoring, especially on crypto transaction. But I think if you're careful enough and just the amount is small enough, it's relatively hard to be caught. But I think there's definitely risk exposed to getting your banking account being freezed and stuff like that. And so many of my OTC friends has been through that before. But I think in general so if you're just doing consumer level and just a small amount, like peer to peer transaction, it should be.
00:31:22.970 - 00:32:07.202, Speaker D: That'S. I think that's accurate. I think actual the situation on the ground is that it's illegal in China to run a cryptocurrency exchange that has Fiat, but it's actually not illegal for me to sell you some Bitcoin for RMB if the two of us are just friends. And so it's unclear whether there might be some other kind of weird risks associated with that. I had a friend who did a pretty small OTC transaction and then ended up getting basically a police summons that said, we think you're involved with money laundering. And she went and it was fine. But I guess what happened is that somewhere in the chain of either I forget whether it was the Bitcoin transactions or the Fiat transactions, some money that didn't have a good origin ended up in her account, and they froze her account, like Debbie said, and it was a hassle, and she ended up it was fine.
00:32:07.202 - 00:32:09.670, Speaker D: She didn't get in trouble or anything, but it was pretty scary.
00:32:10.090 - 00:32:22.874, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's just like a really weird like as an American, the idea that a transaction that I'm doing on an app, that the government would have some insight into what I had done, that's a weird thing to me.
00:32:22.992 - 00:32:25.882, Speaker D: Although that's of course happening in the US.
00:32:25.936 - 00:32:36.430, Speaker A: As right, right. But I guess it's happening if you're using I guess what I'm saying is because, like, a chat app, right, it's different from if you're using like a financial app.
00:32:36.580 - 00:32:40.942, Speaker D: Well, but I mean, in the US. The governments have full surveillance of every chat app as well, except for maybe.
00:32:40.996 - 00:33:26.046, Speaker C: Signal, I think, when it comes. So if you and I want to transact crypto and the only thing we are going to communicate over WeChat is probably just like a QR code and I think the surveillance and so they would definitely try to labor those crypto relevant conversation but when it comes to small amount and so it's just fine and then just holding crypto is actually legal, so it is actually not illegal. We don't know anything about what is the specific just monitoring policy behind WeChat, but so far if you're just doing smaller like it should be fine.
00:33:26.228 - 00:33:31.466, Speaker A: So we're going to keep discussing regulation in a moment, but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors.

00:36:05.406 - 00:36:30.386, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Debbie and Eric of primitive ventures. So actually, before we keep going with this discussion about regulation, I did also want to ask you because I do feel like your fund is kind of unique in the depth of your relationships in both the US. And in Asia. So I was curious how your connections in China have helped your I mean.
00:36:30.428 - 00:37:25.574, Speaker D: So I think there's been a couple of interesting examples, but one of the big ones is really just like Dovey, much more so than myself, is super tied in with the miners in China. And there's a lot of cases where US projects that are proof of work based will want to do something that would actually be disastrous for them from a mining perspective. And so recently Zcash has been discussing changing their mining rewards such that it's time locked so that the crypto that you get from mining is not immediately spentable, but it's sent to you over a long period of time. And Dovey was able to very quickly talk to a bunch of Chinese miners, ask them how they felt about that and came back with the result that it's pretty likely that will be like a very strong centralizing force. And so whether Zcash does that or not, who knows? But they can get very quick feedback from us on what the actual look on the ground is. There's been a bunch of other ones we're really excited about this project called Handshake. People can check it out, it's Handshake.org,
00:37:25.574 - 00:38:22.038, Speaker D: but the general idea there is to have a DNS root zone replacement handled by a blockchain. And so you can do DNS routing of websites and then also of crypto if you want, using these human readable addresses. And those guys also had a proof of work issue where they initially were going to use an algorithm that's the same algorithm that Grin was originally using called Cuckoo Cycle. And they decided to switch it to an algorithm called Shaw Three in the hope that they would be very ASIC friendly and that they would have lots of people building asics and we were able to give them some sort of inside info on exactly how they should implement that to avoid having a Chinese company that has already made Asics for that, just be completely dominant in day one. So I think mining is a big picture, a big part of the picture. I think the other thing is we have really close ties to a lot of the exchanges. And where that comes in is that these exchanges every day get an overwhelming amount of contact from new crypto projects asking to be listed.
00:38:22.038 - 00:38:52.134, Speaker D: And they actually have a really hard time distinguishing what's a really, truly solid project that they should just immediately list and that they shouldn't ask for a bunch of listing fees or anything weird like that. And then what's? Just kind of a marginal project. And so what Dovey and I, by virtue of the fact that, like I said, we're just like super picky, we're able to go to our exchange friends and say like, hey look, we're looking at this project. We think they're really awesome. You guys should look at them too. Here's the contact and we we can make those connections. So I think really the kind of the two of the biggest pictures are the mining and then also the exchange side of things.
00:38:52.332 - 00:39:11.690, Speaker A: And then actually just to circle back to the regulatory thing, I wanted to ask you because you can see and I feel like this is affecting a lot of your investments. You can see how the regulatory climates differ across regions. How do you think that's affecting the development of crypto overall, globally?
00:39:12.030 - 00:39:43.938, Speaker D: Yeah, I think what we're going to see and what we're beginning to see is there's going to be some jurisdiction that says this thing is extremely disruptive. And like I said, I truly believe crypto to be I think maybe anti government is too strong over it to use. I think it's something that massively empowers individuals over governments. And so it's kind of a scary thing for any government in the world to be like, yeah, we're totally on board with this. But I think what you're going to see is there will be some jurisdictions, and I think Singapore is a good candidate for that. I think Malta is doing some stuff in this department, and even some states within the US. Like Wyoming has been extremely positive.
00:39:43.938 - 00:40:12.282, Speaker D: They're going to see that having this infrastructure that's going to be processing billions and billions of dollars of transactions is actually going to be something really valuable for them from a job creation perspective, from a financial perspective. And so they're going to start getting on board with that's. Actually. That's why I guess I have a lot of friends. Naval Ravikant is someone who has this opinion, and I don't agree with this opinion. And the opinion is they're very, very worried that governments are just going to unite and shut down crypto. And I think it's a legitimate concern.
00:40:12.282 - 00:40:39.602, Speaker D: But why I'm less worried about it is I think there's this really interesting game theory where if every other government is like, yeah, we hate crypto, then there's a high incentive for some government to say, no, we love crypto. Come here. Pay our taxes on your incredible returns. And so Finance made more money than Deutsche Bank in Q One, and Finance has 200 employees, and I think Deutsche Bank has something like 100,000. So we're talking about very significant sums of money, and I think that's going to end up being very enticing to some governments.
00:40:39.746 - 00:40:52.606, Speaker A: Yeah, I've already seen that happening. The likelihood, I think, that all the governments unite in one viewpoint on crypto is so low. But anyway, Debbie, what were you going to say?
00:40:52.788 - 00:42:00.018, Speaker C: Right, so because I think, first of all, the modern politician and so I think their job is not to form consensus, right? So it's almost impossible for all these major politicians to form a consensus to shut things down unless it's about life and death. And so that's what we have seen about World War II, about financial crisis last time, but I think crypto nowadays and so it's just not big enough for them to think about forming consensus as to one entity and then the other. Very interesting game theory is I think right now US. And China are in a very interesting historical moment and because both in China and US. And we have this very strong, mighty leader because of them, the strong, mighty leader leads to political tension. And so when it comes to political tension and anything that China bans, I think US. Will probably never ban it.
00:42:00.018 - 00:43:25.966, Speaker C: And so that's also a very interesting game theory that can actually kick crypto survive and then that's actually like the tier one solvent states, right? And so when it comes to tier two, like Singapore, Japan, Korea, and so they're actually moving very fast on clarifying regulatory playbook and license qualification, stuff like that, because they have very strong incentives to facilitate the whole industry and see it as a great opportunity when US and China are in this power. So, because I'm currently actually in Singapore right now, and so I live in a building which is very interesting that three other very influential crypto entrepreneur like back in China, so they all relocate to Singapore. And so we literally just live in the same building here, right? So I think that's a very major phenomena that many of these Chinese entrepreneurs, so they're willing just to give up what they have back in China and move out to a state that's more friendly and just start everything all over. And I think the survivability and just sustainability of this Asian entrepreneur are just amazing. It's just like cockroach level survivability, definitely. So I think that's my point on regulation in general.
00:43:26.148 - 00:43:34.930, Speaker A: All right, so let's move on to something that's been on everyone's minds recently, which is mining. How has this crypto winter affected the miners?
00:43:35.590 - 00:45:07.882, Speaker C: Okay, when it comes to mining, because one thing we have to understand is just like for all the POW mining, just like proof of work, right? So when all the POW mining and they have one thing that's difficulty adjustment. So when it comes to difficulty adjustment, which means the difficulty is actually like a trailing indicator of the price. So when the bitcoin price crash, so the bitcoin difficulty level is not going to adjust immediately. So it's always lag, which means all the miner has to keep the same level of hash power in order to keep producing the block. And so that's why a lot of miners and who are not very efficient or who are not on a very good unit, who are not on a very good unit economic so they will actually be washed out. Because if your blood reward cannot cover your marginal operational cost basically designed by the economic as a miner and then so you are not going to mine because you will be losing money. So there's a lot of decide turning off of the machine or just have the machine or probably just sell the machine at a deep discount to some minor that can be more efficient.
00:45:07.882 - 00:45:35.430, Speaker C: So that has happened in the last couple of months. We can actually see everything reflected on the total hash rate. So if a lot of miner turning off their machine and so we will see like a hit on the hash rate as well. So, I remember our hash rate right now is about 40 ish and so that's at least from the peak it was about 30% to 40% dropped.
00:45:37.930 - 00:46:38.410, Speaker A: Just to explain it, for people who maybe aren't super familiar, when Dovey was talking about the difficulty essentially the more computer power that there is on the network, the harder it is to find a block. Like the more electricity that you need to put into it, the harder the math problem gets. And that's because the software was designed so that there would be a new block found roughly every ten minutes. But of course, if you have more people and more computer power on it, then you would just find them more quickly, right? So instead the difficulty will adjust to make it more difficult. But what Dovey's saying is the reverse has been happening where the difficulty is dropping, but it only adjusts every two weeks. And so during this period where the price has dropped, there are a lot of people who cannot keep paying the same electricity to try to find the block rewards or to find the find the, to find the blocks to get the rewards. And so those people are just having to quit and maybe sell their miners.
00:46:38.410 - 00:46:55.374, Speaker A: Because as far as I understand, I think also that whole cycle hurts bitcoin in a different way, which is that many of those miners may also sell their bitcoin reserves, which then further drives down the price. Do you know if that's happening?
00:46:55.572 - 00:47:57.278, Speaker C: I feel like that has happening. So that has been happening for a while and because for every model of the machine and so let's say if you're probably mining with the best machine from big man like S Nine. And so S Nine has a certain level of price point that can break even. So if you hit the break even point and so you have to sell the quant that you have mined and just like to cover your operational expenses. So every model of the machine has a different breakeven price and so the better of your machine is and the lower the breakeven price is. And so that's why we have seen a lot of relatively outdated model like say for instance, early model from Avalon and then probably from Bitman as well, so many of them just cannot sustain. And so for many of them anything under 4000 so it's actually hitting their breaking even point.
00:47:57.278 - 00:48:02.040, Speaker C: And so that's why they have to just keep selling or otherwise just stop completely.
00:48:02.410 - 00:48:29.838, Speaker A: Well, so I'm glad that you mentioned bitmain because they've been in the news. Apparently they're undergoing layoffs and potentially on a really large scale with rumors of the layoffs hitting more than 50% of staff. And this comes in this period after they've filed to have an initial public offering. So can you tell us what you know about the layoffs? Do you know how many people it is? Which departments? Like, any details you have there?
00:48:30.004 - 00:49:13.150, Speaker D: So before we get into the bitman stuff, I just want to add one thing about the mining issue, which is it's been kind of interesting to see that despite all of the negative stuff that David just went over, which is all totally true, bitcoin has kind of just kept on chugging. And so there was this theory that what David described with the difficulty adjustment and also selling of reserves that you would end up with something called a mining death spiral where as more and more miners abandon the chain, the difficulty level adjustment happens too slowly. And so no one can mine. And so even less miners mine and it ends up just completely halting the chain. And we haven't seen that happen. And in fact, we've actually seen the difficulty level start going back up. So the difficulty level hit like a low, I want to say in early December, and then it's been climbing ever since.
00:49:13.150 - 00:49:35.054, Speaker D: And the new difficulty adjustment that hit around December 31 was an upward one. So it seems like bitcoin is actually pretty resilient even to these really extreme price drops coupled with crazy regulatory action and a bunch of strife for miners. And so I think in the long term, it's actually pretty exciting for bitcoin. It's just kind of like yet another thing that was supposed to kill bitcoin and didn't.
00:49:35.182 - 00:50:02.866, Speaker A: Yeah, it's things like that that remind me of how when I was first learning about it and I just felt like learning about bitcoin was just blowing my mind in so many ways. And even all these years later, when I realized that it works, I'm just like, wow, that's kind of amazing that they figured that out. I just feel like it's the longest game of, I don't know, just like something where you have to keep like a balloon afloat in the air or whatever. It just keeps going and it's kind of incredible.
00:50:02.918 - 00:50:17.682, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I forget who said it, but there was some great quote about bitcoin is the only thing that works better in practice than in theory. I love that because that's really interesting. Yeah.
00:50:17.736 - 00:50:20.100, Speaker A: That is so interesting what's going on there.
00:50:20.470 - 00:51:14.434, Speaker C: Yeah, so all the things I know so that's actually not confirmed officially by bitmain because the local community is just so small and so we have pretty much know everything even before any official thing came out. So from what I have heard, so the laid off is definitely more than 50%, and I think it's probably hitting like 70%. Yeah. So just to let you know about the total employee number of big man before the layoff. And so it's somewhere around 3000. So it's a huge company and because based on their IPO filing, I remember it is around 2500 ish just based on the IPO filing. And so they have been hiring like crazy even afterwards for a few months.
00:51:14.434 - 00:52:38.890, Speaker C: And so that's why before the layoff is around 3000 from what I heard is their Beijing office which is their headquarters. So it's going to be cut to 300 from over 1000. And so they have like a Shenzhen office, so they have like a Shenzhen office and I think Shenzhen office is going to cut from 800 to 2200. So like one specific department that's been hitting really hard, so probably two, one is the BCH client department and the other one is the AI department and the mining department, it has two sub office and one is the mining pool and I think that has been reorganized to somewhere to 20 to 30. So the other office is the self mining basically like the whole mining farm. And so that's something that I'm not clear yet, but what I heard is they have a major reconstruction of the whole self mining facility thing. And so I've heard rumor that they might be spinning out because one problem with their current with their IPO accounting is majority of their mining income is very hard to put into this regular accounting mechanism.
00:52:38.890 - 00:53:03.046, Speaker C: And bitmain has been investing quite a bit in mining facility and just international mining farm in Canada and all over the world. And so I have heard rumors saying that they might be spinning out but I'm not sure yet. But definitely the bitcoin cash client team and then also the AI chip team has been hit really bad.
00:53:03.228 - 00:53:10.902, Speaker A: And when you say bitcoin cash client, you mean the software that's used to run bitcoin cash?
00:53:11.036 - 00:53:11.334, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:53:11.372 - 00:53:31.374, Speaker C: So client side is I think the protocol team is okay but anything on top of that protocol like say for instance bitcoin cash wallet, like bitcoin cash API and just anything on top of that. And so they have a separate team for that and so that has been hit really bad.
00:53:31.572 - 00:53:36.500, Speaker A: Do you think it's their ideological shift to bitcoin cash that has caused these problems?
00:53:38.710 - 00:54:15.470, Speaker C: I think that's definitely one of the reason. Because I know Jhan bet on bitcoin cash heavily just after the initial half fork. I remember they have spent over like 2.5 billion just in buying bitcoin cash. So after the first half fork and so they have acquired a lot of bitcoin cash from their bitcoin position but they have been just keep buying more like bitcoin cash. And so that's around 2.5 billion US dollar.
00:54:15.470 - 00:54:28.098, Speaker C: And so I think they are really ambitious on just pushing out bitcoin cash and on payment on pretty much everything smart contract because they were taking payment.
00:54:28.184 - 00:54:39.800, Speaker A: For their miners in bitcoin cash right. Like you could only buy the mining equipment. Yeah. So they must have a huge amount of it, and I'm sure the price of that is down.
00:54:41.930 - 00:55:30.994, Speaker D: One thing that I thought was kind of interesting is when they were doing this IPO, I asked some of my chinese PE friends what they thought of it, and they had read through the docs that got leaked and they were all really shocked by the amount of bitcoin cash on the balance sheet. I do exclusively early stage investment, so I don't really know much about this stuff. And so I couldn't have a really solid take on whether this is normal or not. And their take was that it was insane and that it represented a massive risk to the company. And it seems like that's played out that holding that much bitcoin on the balance sheet would be scary for a lot of these traditional investors. And so when they see someone holding this alternative asset that hasn't even proved itself in an enormous, very relevant to the company amount, I think that was really scary. And I think they were right to be scared.
00:55:30.994 - 00:55:33.798, Speaker D: If you look now, it really hasn't turned out well for them.
00:55:33.964 - 00:55:58.250, Speaker A: Yeah, and according to one report, the regulators in Hong Kong, which is where bitmain filed to IPO, they've indicated that they think it's too early for any crypto company to go public. It just feels like if they cannot get this cash injection that they were expecting from going public, what do you think the prospects are for bitmain?
00:55:58.410 - 00:56:41.900, Speaker C: Yeah, because whenever just a bear market or just any nuclear winter, and I think only the top player going to survive and even big man has burned a lot of cash, but I think they still have decent bankroll, especially after this massive layoff. I think they will have a decent control on their operational expenses and just general expansion plan. I think bitman should be fine because they are the biggest ASIC maker out there. They're the biggest miner out there, and so as long as they stay as the biggest one, so they should be okay.
00:56:42.270 - 00:56:43.020, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:44.270 - 00:57:34.830, Speaker D: I would bet against bitmain, like disappearing as a result of this, but I think it was a massive setback for them and I think it opens up competition where they have there's a lot of technical teams in china that are competing with bitmain. And in some cases I think they actually have a stronger technical team than bitmain. But what they don't have is what w was mentioning, like the massive economies of scale know, foundries like TSMC and all the supply chain stuff and all the shipping stuff. But I think at the point where bitmain faces this huge setback in terms of their cash flow and in terms of their asset balance sheet, it opens up a space for someone new to come in. And I think that's actually something I really love about proof of work where it's this extremely chaotic, extremely tied to the real world ecosystem, and it becomes very hard for anyone to be a monopolistic power for too long. Like, you just make one misstep, and now you're out, and now someone else has taken over. And I think that's really valuable for the chain.
00:57:35.810 - 00:58:15.450, Speaker A: Yeah. Just going back to Duffy's comments, I just realized after I asked that about bitmain, that maybe one of the reasons that they are doing these massive layoffs is because they've taken the temperature and realized that maybe they won't get their IPO, and so this is their way of saving themselves. So I also want to ask something else about the Chinese government, which is I read this other report saying that the Chinese government wants to get bitcoin miners to exit or get bitcoin miners in China to exit the industry. So do you know if that's true? And if so, do you know if miners are complying?
00:58:15.790 - 00:59:02.482, Speaker C: Yeah, so as far as I know, I don't think so. There's still a lot of mining operation, and so both legal one and illegal one. And so I think they're still operating okay right now's. Problem is not from the government. So it's more about just, like, economic in general, because the hydropower, just like the hydroelectricity costs, it's actually not that low back in China. And many of these Chinese miners are going to Russia, going to Ukraine, going to the other part of the world, and to find some cheap electricity to further round their operation. I think it's more economic driven, but not like, government driven.
00:59:02.626 - 00:59:30.094, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree with that. I think also the other, like, everything, it's so much more nuanced than the general media reports. So in China, there's not like, a ban on mining. What there is, is if you're on the national electricity grid, they don't want you mining. However, a lot of miners have their own electricity. So we know some folks that used to be gold miners, and they have their own hydropower and their own coal power that they were using to power a gold mining operation. And they now switched, like, half of that over to mining bitcoin.
00:59:30.094 - 01:00:08.298, Speaker D: And the government probably doesn't even know about that and certainly doesn't care about it. And so you see, when people say the Chinese government, I think very rarely is that an accurate phrase, and what they mean is the province of Hunan's government or the central government or whatever, but it's not really a monolithic organization. And there's this great phrase in Chinese, Shanghao Huangdi, the mountains are tall, and the emperor is far away. And so in lots of places in China, what the central government says is not necessarily what's going to happen immediately. And I don't think there's some big push from the government to get rid.
01:00:08.314 - 01:00:31.480, Speaker C: Of miners, because just checking on my recent conversation with one of my bit minor friend, he's actually considering buying some major den. Just buying the den out there and then just to produce his own hydroelectricity. I definitely don't think that people are moving out because of government.
01:00:35.930 - 01:01:12.580, Speaker A: You know, like I said, I saw that report that they were trying to do that. And in general, I feel like in the west we have this conception that everything is extremely top down over there, and that when the government wants to do something they can do. Like, oh man, I was going to use a very unfortunate phrase. I was going to say they could steamroll over people to do that, but let's not think about that. But one other reason that I thought maybe they might have a motivation to do that is there's been this talk of a crypto yuan. Do you have any sense of how much of that is just talk and how much of that is like an actual intention of the government?
01:01:13.270 - 01:02:05.266, Speaker C: So, first of all, PBOC just the People's Bank of China. And so that is the So, because I have chat with some of their insider there. And so they're actually extremely knowledgeable about everything on crypto and all the way from protocol to monetary policy to everything. And so I think if they really want to roll it out and so they can probably do it tomorrow. And so it is not about feasibility. It is more about timing and about application and about overall sentiment, et cetera. So I'm not sure at what specific timing that they will make a decision, but I think they have the full capability there to do so.
01:02:05.266 - 01:03:00.054, Speaker C: I remember the PBOC, they have a research team, so they actually recently published a paper talking about blockchain. And so that's one of the most insightful paper that I have seen published by any Chinese player. And then one of the author of that paper right now is actually the chief economist of he joined I think he joined Bitmain after he published that paper. And then also there's one company and back in China invested by Sequoia China, I remember, and I think also China Merchant Bank. And so they have been this PBOC in house blockchain engineering team. And so the founder used to be working for Ethereum Foundation. So I think the technical capability is definitely there.
01:03:00.054 - 01:03:49.620, Speaker C: So it's more about what are the specific application and how to synthesize the whole infrastructure, because the whole banking infrastructure back in China is kind of chaos. So it's pretty chaotic if you have saving on one China Merchant Bank. And so China Merchant Bank does not share the database with the China Construction Bank. So I think there's a lot of this data synchronization problem that they have to figure out before they can roll out the whole just a digital cash or just a digital yuan, but just purely from cryptocurrency perspective, I think their talents and just a competence. So it's definitely at a pretty high level.
01:03:50.950 - 01:04:15.818, Speaker A: So we're running out of time. But I just want to ask you guys one last question, which is I know that there are a lot of people in the western crypto community who say that one motivation that chinese citizens could have to use bitcoin is to escape the surveillance state and things like this social credit system and whatever. How much do you think that motivates actual Chinese people who use bitcoin or trade bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
01:04:15.994 - 01:04:28.580, Speaker C: Not at all. Nobody actually care about that credit system at all, first of all and just that people will not associate cryptocurrency with that thing and then people will only.
01:04:29.750 - 01:04:48.120, Speaker D: That whole thing is such an overblown. It's almost like a fake news story. The Western media loves reporting on this credit system. And no one I know in China even knows what it is. Or if they do, it's not very well integrated. Most people don't use it. It doesn't touch most people's lives, but it's this really scary, dystopian sounding thing.
01:04:49.450 - 01:05:18.930, Speaker A: It doesn't touch most people's. You. You must know. For instance, if somebody goes missing, one of the first things investigators do is they look at their financial transactions to try to figure out what they've been doing, where they've been, stuff like that. And so in China where so much financial transactions happen in this cashless way on these apps that are surveilled by the state don't you think people have an awareness?
01:05:20.790 - 01:05:37.522, Speaker D: So to clarify, what I'm saying is sesame credit social credit score thing is an overblown story that basically doesn't exist. I mean, it exists, but it's just not a big deal. The surveillance state stuff you're talking about is totally real and totally exists and definitely does touch people's lives. Those two things are totally distinct.
01:05:37.666 - 01:05:43.370, Speaker A: But I would say that Chinese people aren't motivated to use Bitcoin for that reason. Like they don't connect the two.
01:05:43.440 - 01:05:54.910, Speaker D: No. Yeah, they're not a, they're not that worried about the surveillance, and B, I would say from a factual perspective, bitcoin doesn't get you much in that regard.
01:05:54.980 - 01:05:59.120, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, it should be like Monero or Z cash. It would be a better.
01:06:01.730 - 01:06:32.966, Speaker D: Even those things. I think crypto is pretty far from being a really robust payments layer. So, actually, debbie and I chatted with the folks who run WeChat or run $0.10 fund. And one of the figures I was super curious about is what's the TPS the transactions per second that WeChat sees. And I think we're asked not to share the numbers, but it's insane the amount of transaction volume that something like WeChat sees, especially during peak times, is, like, mind blowing. And there's no crypto system as of yet that's getting even close to that.
01:06:32.966 - 01:06:58.446, Speaker D: I mean, the guys that I've seen that kind of have the closest chance of being an actual payment system are the mobile coin folks. That'll be something. Where it'll work as a payments network. If everyone in China adopted it tomorrow, though, it would collapse. Like all the other ones. And so I think this idea that people in China are jumping on crypto as a payments thing or as a way to avoid financial surveillance is pretty misguided. But I do think what they are using it for is to avoid capital controls.
01:06:58.446 - 01:06:59.940, Speaker D: And that's the big one.
01:07:00.950 - 01:07:24.570, Speaker C: So there are two primary purpose of using crypto. One is as an investment asset. People want to get rich, like simply asset. And then second is just moving capital out, just moving RMB asset into crypto asset and then further transfer to probably US dollar asset. So those are the two primary purpose that we have seen Chinese people are using crypto.
01:07:25.790 - 01:08:17.930, Speaker D: I know we're running out of time, but I think one thing that I think it's really important to understand just from a sort of fundamental perspective about crypto, and I think it really informs Davi. And my perspective on what's happening in China is that all of these systems have to first function as a store of value before they can start functioning as a unit of account or as a medium of exchange. And so I think Bitcoin has done very well at becoming this sort of store of value use case. And we're seeing where a store of value doesn't mean you never transact, it means you're not buying coffee with this thing. But if you want to move a lot of money offshore to go buy a house in America or something, you would use it. And I think we're going to start seeing sort of the medium of exchange use case come about in mid 2019, early 2020, when projects like Mobile, Coin, Ship, I think Stellar is looking into stuff like this and I think we're going to start seeing that. But I think right now it's not the reality on the ground and so as a result, it's not how people use these systems in China or anywhere.
01:08:18.430 - 01:08:51.670, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion. I had a whole bunch more questions for you. I think maybe I will see if you guys can just write a few answers for me by email for those additional questions and I'll put them on my website for people to listen to or to read. When I started doing the podcast, I would often talk about the readers and then I'd have to be like the listeners. And now I've switched the other. But anyway, so yeah, like I said, this has been such a great discussion. Where can people learn more about you guys and primitive ventures?
01:08:52.250 - 01:09:08.758, Speaker D: So we have primitive ventures for the fun. There's not a lot of information there, but there's contact info if anyone wants to say hi. And then Dovey and I are both pretty active on Twitter, so I'm Wheat Pond on Twitter. Wheatpond and dovey.
01:09:08.774 - 01:09:12.970, Speaker C: You're just my first name and my last name.
01:09:13.120 - 01:09:17.178, Speaker A: Okay, great. Well, thank you both for coming on Unchained.
