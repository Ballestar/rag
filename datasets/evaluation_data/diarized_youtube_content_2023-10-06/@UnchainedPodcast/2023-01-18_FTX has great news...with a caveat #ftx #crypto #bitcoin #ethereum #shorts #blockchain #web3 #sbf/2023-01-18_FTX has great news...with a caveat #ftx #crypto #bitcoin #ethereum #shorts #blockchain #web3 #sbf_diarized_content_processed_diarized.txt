00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.902, Speaker A: I think the issue is going to be, is it great news or is it good news? So when you peel back what's in that portfolio of stuff that they say is highly liquid? How highly liquid is it? I guess just more disclosure. It's a big statement to be making. And there's really no benefit to an estate professional over promising and under delivering. Generally, it's the other way around. They under promise and over deliver, so they look great. Just like John Ray in the beginning of the FTX case. He was sort of, oh my God, this is the worst case ever.
00:00:32.902 - 00:00:41.330, Speaker A: Worst case ever. And then it's like, oh, actually we found a billion dollars. So it's like they have a tendency to do that, sort of under promise and over deliver.
