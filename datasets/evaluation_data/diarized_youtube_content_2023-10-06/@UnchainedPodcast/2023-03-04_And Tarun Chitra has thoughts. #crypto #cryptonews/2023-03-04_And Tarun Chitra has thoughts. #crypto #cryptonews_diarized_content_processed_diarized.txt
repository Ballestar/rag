00:00:00.330 - 00:00:44.100, Speaker A: Well, I think, you know, I saw a very maybe somewhat politically incorrect tweet about Base, which was it's Binance Smart Chain for white people. And so, to give some context, Binance Smart Chain is a chain actually very similar to Coinbase in the sense of it will have a smaller set of validators. You can't just join and validate the chain. And it it's sort of where a lot of retail users in China and Asia go to first have their first experience with actually using a wallet. And it's very popular. It's like the most popular blockchain, actually, by transaction volume. But the interesting thing is, I guess the US doesn't really have that experience.
