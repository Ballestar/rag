00:00:00.090 - 00:00:41.382, Speaker A: Tax law has a lot of rules about what losses can be deducted. So if you apply a substance over form approach to the taxation of frentech, I think you're stuck with that result. And unfortunately, that result ends up being really bad for taxpayers, for most taxpayers. And here's why. As I said, my gain is ordinary income. Maybe that's not the worst thing in the world, because I probably wasn't planning on holding friendtech keys for more than a year to get the long term capital gains rate. So whatever.
00:00:41.382 - 00:00:57.900, Speaker A: I would have had short term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary rates anyway. But what about the loss that someone incurred if they redeem for an amount of ETH that is worth less in US dollar terms than the amount of ETH that they put in?
