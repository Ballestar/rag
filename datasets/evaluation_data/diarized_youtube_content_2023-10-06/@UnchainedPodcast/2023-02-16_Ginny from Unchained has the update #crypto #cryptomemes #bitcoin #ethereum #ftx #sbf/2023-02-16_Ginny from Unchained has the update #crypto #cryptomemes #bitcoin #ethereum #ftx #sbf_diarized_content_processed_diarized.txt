00:00:00.250 - 00:00:20.474, Speaker A: Firstly, we got the names of the people who backed SBS Bail. It was the former dean of the Stanford Law School, a Stanford research scientist, and Giselle. Oh, no, wait. Sorry, sorry. I read that on SBS substac. That's not true. The two Stanford affiliates pledged about $700,000 for SBS bail, which is officially the most money anybody has ever put up to let some dude live in his mom's basement.
00:00:20.474 - 00:00:57.758, Speaker A: The fact that these Stanford professors have so much money only adds to the carnage created by TX. How irresponsible of them to imbue undergrads everywhere with the insane notion that getting a PhD is an economically wise choice. The names were revealed after news organizations petitioned for it, so I was inspired. And I myself petitioned to have the names revealed of every woman SBF has ever slept with. Shockingly, they accommodated me. SBF is also in trouble for using a VPN to watch the Super Bowl. I don't know why he even wanted Too if he's curious about what it looks like when a small group of men create a lot of chaos and utter devastation that no one can tear their eyes away from.
00:00:57.758 - 00:00:58.970, Speaker A: He should just Google himself.
