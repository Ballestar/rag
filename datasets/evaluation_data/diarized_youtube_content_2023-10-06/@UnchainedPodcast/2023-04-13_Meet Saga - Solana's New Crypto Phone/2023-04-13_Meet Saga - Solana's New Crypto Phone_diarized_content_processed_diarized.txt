00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.910, Speaker A: Get ready to meet Saga, the game changing crypto phone designed by Salana.
00:00:05.490 - 00:00:38.840, Speaker B: I'm Jeff Benson with Untrained. Now take a look and you'll see that this phone is, in fact, a smartphone. It makes calls and send text messages. You can take pretty good videos and photos, but it's so much more than that, because this is a Web three phone designed for people who love using crypto and use it every day. You've got three buttons along the side top volume, bottom volume, and this, that gets your phone up and running. You see this little button here? This is for fingerprints. Oh, there we go.
00:00:38.840 - 00:01:19.830, Speaker B: Now, taking a look at the home screen, you'll notice that I've got all kind of basic apps. It is an Android phone, so it's going to look a lot like any other sort of phone that you might be running with a Google based operating system. So if you open up, you'll see right away you've got your Google Drive, your Google Docs, all of your Google needs right there on the home screen. There are two main things that really make the Saga stand out and be different from your typical phone. First is the seed vault. Seed vault. It's not a wallet, but what it does is it works with your wallet, and it works with the operating system to help keep your passwords and seed phrases safe.
00:01:19.830 - 00:01:44.750, Speaker B: So there's that. And that'll integrate directly with the fingerprint so that you don't have to constantly be entering in a 24 word seed phrase. Now, the other thing that really makes it stand out is the Solana DAP Store. Now, these DApps are not what you're used to. This isn't from Android. It's not from iPhone. This is the Solana DAP store.
00:01:44.750 - 00:02:13.798, Speaker B: So you've got your wallets, you've got DeFi, you've got NFTs, you've got social, and then you've got everything else. You can download any of these apps and use them directly on your device. And it's meant to integrate directly with your wallet and the device. This phone is really meant for people who are deep into crypto and not just any crypto people who are into Solana specifically. There's no ethereum. DAP store. This is the Solana DAP store.
00:02:13.798 - 00:02:48.140, Speaker B: So you have to be sort of wedded to that particular ecosystem. And right now, there's not that much in way of applications that are really going to draw you to buy this phone. But if you're an early adopter, you can certainly expect improvements to be coming down the line. There's going to be new applications. There's going to be improvements to applications, and the integrations are going to get better and more seamless as people start figuring it out. So they've built the phone. Now the app developers need to come close.
