00:00:00.650 - 00:01:01.870, Speaker A: We're trying to compete with centralized exchanges. And centralized exchanges are more than just their spot markets. What they are is this suite of products that is packaged into one unified experience. And so along with their spot markets, they include margining and perps and launch pads, custody services and fiat on ramps and stuff like that. And so if Osmosis, as a platform, as a chain, wants to compete with centralized exchanges, it needs to offer that suite of products in one unified experience. And to do that, we need to enable external teams to come in and help build parts of this stack. And so to do this, what we did was we added Cosmosm, which is a smart contracting system built for the Cosmos SDK, and it's one of the most popular smart contracting systems today.
