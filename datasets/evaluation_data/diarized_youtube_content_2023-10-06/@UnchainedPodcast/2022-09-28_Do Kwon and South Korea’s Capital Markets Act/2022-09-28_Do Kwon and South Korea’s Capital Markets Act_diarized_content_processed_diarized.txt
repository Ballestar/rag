00:00:00.250 - 00:00:12.640, Speaker A: So are you saying that Doe was saying if he was charged with a violation of the Capital Markets Act, that he would not go back to Korea because he basically felt that that wasn't an unjustified charge? Is that what you were saying there?
00:00:13.250 - 00:00:50.060, Speaker B: Yeah, he was saying know, obviously this interview happened before the charges came out. So we were just talking prospectively about where do you see this investigation going and what are the potential things that could happen? And one of the things that he raised was the Capital Markets Act is a bit of a catch all right now, similar to kind of the way that the US. Still hasn't figured out what crypto is. Is it a security? Is it not a security? That was one of the charges that he was saying, I don't know what's going to happen on that front. And so that's one if that was the only charge that they had that he was, I think, reluctant to kind of the idea of going back to Korea, because obviously, if you don't know what the charges entail, it becomes a little difficult. Ah.
