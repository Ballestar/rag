00:00:00.000 - 00:00:46.130, Speaker A: But for about 2020, celsius began spending its own money, spending its customers money, spending investor money to prop up the price. So they would tell the community, well, we buy a certain amount of sell from the market to pay the rewards that we owe you. In fact, they bought to keep the price where they wanted it to be. One of the reasons was so that insiders executives, people like Alex Minsky, so that they could sell their own holdings of cell without affecting the price massively. Another reason is keeping the price of cell up had a major positive impact on Celsius's own balance sheet. So Celsius had its own holdings of cell token. It recorded it on its own balance sheet as an asset.
