00:00:46.272 - 00:00:48.934, Speaker B: Today's guest is Jesse Liu, a partner.
00:00:48.982 - 00:00:50.602, Speaker A: At Scadden and the former US.
00:00:50.656 - 00:00:54.026, Speaker B: Attorney for the District of Columbia. Welcome, Jesse.
00:00:54.218 - 00:00:56.800, Speaker D: Thank you so much, Laura. It's such a pleasure to be here.
00:00:57.410 - 00:00:58.254, Speaker A: As the US.
00:00:58.292 - 00:01:25.986, Speaker B: Attorney General in DC. You created a Threat Finance Unit focused on financial crimes that threaten national security. There, you headed up the team that prosecute what some believe is the greatest number of cryptocurrency crimes worldwide. Welcome to Video Dark Scandals. Helix some involving North Korea's Lazarus group hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS. How did you come to establish the Threat Finance Unit and prosecute all these crimes involving cryptocurrency?
00:01:26.178 - 00:01:48.810, Speaker D: Well, I think it was a terrific confluence of events, and I was very lucky to have some incredibly talented colleagues at the US. Attorney's Office. Before I was the US. Attorney for the District of Columbia. I was a deputy general counsel at the Department of the treasury. And there my portfolio focused on law enforcement, national security, and international issues. So I did a lot of work with OFAC and Finsin.
00:01:48.810 - 00:02:24.438, Speaker D: And when I went over to the US. Attorney's Office, I was already thinking about ways that the US. Attorney's Office could work with the Treasury Department in particular, as well as with other government agencies to pursue financial crimes. And there was already a group of AUSAs at the US. Attorney's Office who were doing that. And so we worked together both within the office to increase the number of cases that we were bringing in this very important and cutting edge area and also working with the Department of the treasury and with other parts of the US. Government to bring more cases.
00:02:24.438 - 00:02:31.600, Speaker D: And this, of course, as you know, incredibly interesting cutting edge area. So it was very exciting for us.
00:02:32.290 - 00:02:42.046, Speaker B: Last week, Attorney General William Barr announced the publication by the Department of justice of a cryptocurrency enforcement framework. What is in the framework and how.
00:02:42.068 - 00:02:43.054, Speaker A: Will it be used?
00:02:43.172 - 00:02:48.610, Speaker B: Does it change anything about the way law enforcement has been going after crimes involving cryptocurrency?
00:02:49.590 - 00:03:45.780, Speaker D: Well, I don't know that it changes anything, but it is very significant in a number of ways. So, first of all, the cryptocurrency enforcement framework is a 70 plus page document issued by DOJ specifically by the Attorney General's Cyber Digital Task Force a week ago today on October eigth. And it is a self described comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency. It details the important relationships that the Department of justice has built with regulatory and enforcement partners both within the US. Government and around the world, and then outlines the Department's response strategies. And for my purposes, I personally find the last part where the framework talks about how the Department has responded to cryptocurrency the most interesting.
00:03:46.550 - 00:03:53.186, Speaker B: And so in general, what are the main takeaways in terms of the significance of the Attorney General publishing this document?
00:03:53.378 - 00:04:49.642, Speaker D: Well, first of all, I think just the fact that the Attorney General and the Department of justice has published this document is itself significant. It shows that crypto is something that DOJ is focusing on and also, perhaps even more important, that DOJ wants the world to know that crypto is something that it's focused on. I pull a couple of key takeaways from the framework. First of all, DOJ seems to be still somewhat skeptical of crypto. So in the first part of the framework, there's a section on legitimate uses of crypto which runs about a few paragraphs. And then there's a section that is titled Illegitimate Uses, which runs to more than eleven pages. And if you look closely at the Legitimate uses section, it's careful not to come out and actually say that there are any legitimate uses at all.
00:04:49.642 - 00:05:46.860, Speaker D: It uses language like, and here I'm quoting Laura cryptocurrency advocates maintain that a decentralized, distributed and secure cryptocurrency holds great promise for legitimate use. Proponents of cryptocurrency contend that by eliminating the need for financial intermediaries to validate and facilitate transactions, cryptocurrency has the potential to minimize transaction costs and to reduce corruption and fraud. Some advocates also claim that cryptocurrency may in the future facilitate micro payments. Others believe that the privacy associated with cryptocurrency through raising significant challenges for law enforcement though raising significant challenges for law enforcement can have valid and beneficial uses. So, reading between the lines, I think you can detect a certain amount of skepticism about crypto even though it's not nearly as new as it was at one time.
00:05:47.710 - 00:05:53.790, Speaker B: So when it comes to the DOJ, what are the main crimes that they're looking at when it comes to cryptocurrency?
00:05:54.290 - 00:06:54.740, Speaker D: Well, the first part of the report, or the framework actually lays out three categories of crimes. So one is the use of crypto as payment or facilitation for illicit activities. So for example, taking crypto as payment for illegal drugs or illegal weapons or child pornography, or using crypto to engage in terrorist financing. That's category one according to the framework. The second category, according to the framework, is using crypto to engage in money laundering or hide assets from tax authorities. And the third, it's crimes against the crypto marketplace itself, like hacking exchanges and there's a section of the framework that goes through all of the laws that DOJ can use to counter this kind of activity. And they're more or less what you would expect the fraud statutes, the money laundering statutes, the terrorist financing statutes, and the like.
00:06:55.670 - 00:07:06.840, Speaker B: And what aspects of the framework do you think crypto entrepreneurs and startups and projects should be aware of? Or what aspects do you think that they're not focusing enough on?
00:07:07.610 - 00:08:23.600, Speaker D: Well, so again, as I said before, to me the most interesting part of the framework is part three, which is titled ongoing Challenges and Future Strategies. And I think this is where you can glean the answer to the question, where is DOJ going with all of this? And what I found interesting is that in this part of the framework, DOJ identifies what it calls business models and activities that may facilitate criminal activity. And then it has a list of those. It includes cryptocurrency exchanges, P to P exchangers, crypto ATMs, virtual currency casinos, anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies, which I think is worth talking about in a little bit more detail, and of course, mixers, tumblers and chain hopping. There are some definite clues in this document to where DOJ may focus its attention next. And I think one area for the crypto industry and those who are interested in the space to focus is thinking about the business models that DOJ has essentially identified as those that it is particularly skeptical of. So I think that's going to be really an area to watch.
00:08:24.690 - 00:09:02.598, Speaker B: One of the big recent cryptocurrency cases that involved DOJ was the indictment of four executives at Cryptocurrency Derivatives exchange BitMEX. And that indictment became public on the same day that the CFTC announced its own charges against BitMEX for allegedly illegally operating crypto derivatives exchange and also anti money laundering violations. And then shortly thereafter, the framework came out. So are these actions an indication that the crypto industry should expect that there are more enforcement actions in which DOJ acts in concert with other agencies to bring criminal charges?
00:09:02.774 - 00:09:41.750, Speaker D: Yes, I think definitely the answer is yes. And there are further clues, or perhaps even more than clues, almost explicit statements to that effect in the framework. So the framework talks about it has a specific section that talks about DOJ's partners, and it starts by talking about the other US. Government agencies that DOJ is working with on these issues. And they're more or less the ones that you would expect FinCEN OFAC the SEC, the CFTC, the OCC, and there's also a lot of discussion about partnering with international organizations like the Fatif.
00:09:42.090 - 00:09:52.460, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I think we're going to have to dive a little bit more into what that means and why that's happening. But first, let's take a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:10:19.510 - 00:10:58.830, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Jesse Leo. So, speaking about the partnerships that the DOJ is pursuing in order to prosecute some of these cases, I noticed in the framework that it says, quote, the department also has robust authority to prosecute virtual asset service providers and other entities and individuals that violate US. Law even when they are not located in the United States. So how can it claim this authority to go after entities not in its jurisdiction? And not only can they claim the authority, but how can they also go after them, just from a practical perspective?
00:10:59.330 - 00:11:37.130, Speaker D: Sure. Well, first of all, I think it sometimes surprises people, but DOJ is extremely aggressive about asserting its jurisdiction, even with respect to conduct that occurs abroad. And so outside the crypto context, there are any number of cases where DOJ has asserted jurisdiction, because there was one email that went through a US. Server, because there was one wire that went through a US. Bank that there were transactions that were conducted in US. Dollars. So the long arm of US.
00:11:37.130 - 00:12:28.842, Speaker D: Law is just that. And DOJ is really quite assertive about exercising jurisdiction, and there's a lot of statements in the framework about that, which I think makes very clear that DOJ is prepared to exercise really near global jurisdiction in the crypto space. For example, with respect to crypto exchanges, the framework says all entities, including foreign located exchanges, that do business wholly or in a substantial part within the United States, such as by servicing US. Customers. Such as by servicing us. Customers. So this could be a situation where the exchange is located overseas, the servers are located overseas, the people who run it are located overseas, but it serves US.
00:12:28.842 - 00:13:23.742, Speaker D: Customers. And according to DOJ, those exchanges have to register with Vincent and have an agent to the United States for bank secrecy, act reporting, filing, SARS, and the like, and for accepting service and process. And I actually think BitMEX is a pretty good example of this, because it was a little, I think, unclear as to exactly where BitMEX had a physical presence. To the extent that it had a physical presence, it was registered in the Seychelles with offices in places like Hong Kong and New York city. There are people who ran it who were in the US. I believe that it was said it could not be used by US. Persons, but the government apparently didn't think that that was enough, that it really wants these exchanges to take active steps to ensure that US.
00:13:23.742 - 00:13:26.240, Speaker D: Persons don't actually use them.
00:13:27.170 - 00:14:09.100, Speaker B: Well, yeah, it's interesting how they claim jurisdiction, but apparently it is possible, and they've done it in the past. One other thing that a lot of people in crypto have been chatting about recently is the global standards regarding anti money laundering and counterterrorism financing by the FATF and the Financial Action Task Force and different countries are implementing those global standards differently. There was a recent episode I did about these FADF rules, and in Switzerland, they're apparently making people identify their self hosted wallets. And I wondered how you thought the FATF regulations would affect enforcement here in the US.
00:14:10.350 - 00:15:06.110, Speaker D: Well, the US is a leader within FADF and is a big booster within FADF. And I think one trend that we're seeing, I think, is going to be within the US. That the regulators and the enforcers are going to be demanding more from crypto industry with respect to AML BSA CFT standards. But of course, there are differences across countries. I think the US has been pushing quite hard for everyone to apply the same kind of AML BSA CFP standards that the US does here. So it'll be interesting to see how that plays out. One of the points that the framework makes is it sounds a little bit of a note of frustration about how the standards are different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and how that can sometimes enable illicit activity.
00:15:08.210 - 00:15:30.550, Speaker B: Yeah, one other thing that I wanted to ask is about what you mentioned earlier, this interest in privacy preserving technologies in the crypto space. Clearly the DOJ took a side eye, I would say, to such technologies. So I wondered what your take was on what their approach would be when it comes to privacy in crypto.
00:15:30.970 - 00:16:45.418, Speaker D: Well, I think that the framework is a signal that the DOJ is deeply skeptical of privacy anonymity in crypto. The framework actually calls out by name monero, Dash, and Zcash. And it goes on to say, this is a very blunt statement. The department considers the use of anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies to be a high risk activity that is indicative of possible criminal conduct, which to me is a pretty blunt statement. And then there's a bit of a warning to the industry. They say companies that choose to offer AEC products should consider the increased risks of money laundering and financing and criminal activity and should evaluate whether it's possible to adopt appropriate AML CFT measures to address those risks. So taking those two statements together, I think that's a clear signal that DOJ is going to be watching anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies pretty closely, and that DOJ has some doubt about whether it's possible for that business model to comply with AML CFT BSA requirements.
00:16:45.418 - 00:17:52.260, Speaker D: And so that's an area where I think all the signs, at least from the framework, are indicative that there will be some real scrutiny in that area. The other area that I noticed where the framework takes a little bit of a dim view about privacy is that the framework devotes a whole page to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, the GDPR, which is a privacy law that's been used by some crypto exchanges to try to withhold data that US. Criminal investigators try to get through grand jury subpoenas. And the framework makes very clear that DOJ disagrees with the basis for those objections and that it will continue to engage with those exchanges to ensure compliance with lawful requests and even, quote, will pursue motions to compel as needed. So that's a pretty clear indication, I think, that to the extent that exchanges are citing the EU privacy law as a reason not to provide information to DOJ that, they may be facing a court fight.
00:17:53.590 - 00:18:54.486, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, well, one other thing that I was thinking about when it comes to this is the fact that I think the big financial institutions are really interested in privacy because they'll want that for their transactions. And so I just wondered, when you have such a big and important industry that has an interest in that, how that will play out against what apparently is DOJ's desire to not have privacy enhanced coins used very much and kind of in that mix. One other thing I noted about the framework is that even as the report expressed concern about these privacy enhanced coins, it also admitted that many of them have viewing keys that make it possible for exchanges or other businesses using privacy enhanced coins to comply with anti money laundering or counterterroris financing regulations. So I wondered if you thought that might would play a role and in.
00:18:54.508 - 00:18:56.502, Speaker A: General, how it will play out.
00:18:56.636 - 00:19:00.650, Speaker B: Know, like I said, traditional financial institutions interested in privacy.
00:19:00.990 - 00:20:12.910, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think there's going to be a constant push, know, in this area because DOJ and this plays out in lots of other areas too. It certainly played out, for example, with respect to the DOJ being able to get access to the contents of cell phones that were password protected completely outside the crypto space. But it is a constant kind of tension between the DOJ attempting to get information pursuant to legal process and the privacy interests that are involved. And I know that there's been quite a bit of commentary, I think, in response to the framework, but as part of a conversation that's been going on for a long time about, well, here is this model of a decentralized ledger that has privacy benefits, that has anonymity benefits and what is the government doing? And to what extent do all of those privacy ideals survive in the face of increased government scrutiny?
00:20:14.210 - 00:20:46.170, Speaker B: So one last piece I wanted to ask about is cryptocurrency obviously is global in nature, and the framework even calls out how this global nature, quote, poses significant investigative challenges for US. Law enforcement agencies and for department prosecutors. And I just wondered, from your experience, are foreign countries generally willing to assist the US. In cases involving cryptocurrency, or do you think that we'll find that a lot of these people who engage in crimes involving cryptocurrency will be able to play regulatory arbitrage?
00:20:46.910 - 00:21:45.470, Speaker D: Well, I think it depends on the jurisdiction, quite honestly. So in our experience, my office did the welcome to video case, which is one of the cases that's highlighted in the framework. It was a child pornography case, and we had fantastic international cooperation from jurisdictions all around the world. I think that there are other jurisdictions that perhaps are less cooperative with US. Investigators, and so it really depends. And I think that one of the things that DOJ is really trying to do is spread the implementation of the FATF recommendation around the world in an effort to try to get more cooperation in this area. And the framework explicitly recognizes that because crypto is global and it's cross border, that there's only so much that one country can do, and that in order to address the risks that DOJ sees, there needs to be international cooperation.
00:21:46.610 - 00:21:52.058, Speaker B: All right, well, this has been such a great and interesting conversation. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.
00:21:52.154 - 00:21:54.210, Speaker D: Thank you so much, Laura. It was a great pleasure.
00:21:54.790 - 00:21:57.730, Speaker B: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap.
00:22:01.510 - 00:22:46.770, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning into this week's news recap. First headline stone Ridge bets $115,000,000 on bitcoin, continuing the trend set by MicroStrategy and square. The $10 billion asset management firm. Stonerich holdings group revealed in a Forbes article Tuesday that it has invested in 10,000 bitcoin, currently about $115,000,000. It has also raised $100 million in funding for its crypto subsidiary new York digital investment group, or NYDIG, with $50 million in a recently closed round. In a statement to CoinDesk, the private firm called bitcoin its, quote, primary treasury reserve asset. The announcement further illustrates the growing trust in bitcoin as a safe haven asset.
00:22:46.770 - 00:23:42.660, Speaker A: Stone ridge's move toward the investment began three years ago when its founders and senior employees began buying bitcoin at an ever increasing pace, which in turn generated greater interest from clients. To manage the funds, stoneridge built execution and custody tools from scratch. Although most NYDIG customers are not public yet, the company confirmed that the $115,000,000 position it manages for stoneridge is not as largest. Next headline bullish signs for bitcoin in quite a turnabout, j. P. Morgan now says that investments like square's $50 million bitcoin purchase are, quote, a strong vote of confidence in bitcoin and its strategists expect, quote, other payments companies to follow in facilitating client bitcoin investments or risk being left behind. Meanwhile, grayscale investments posted its all time best quarter ever, with over $1 billion invested across its cryptocurrency products.
00:23:42.660 - 00:24:59.020, Speaker A: In the OTC markets. BTC and ETH are showing renewed interest following the square news as attention seems to be moving away from DFI tokens back to these more tried and true crypto assets. Fidelity also published guidance on bitcoin as an alternative investment, highlighting what it sees as continuing retail interest in bitcoin, as evidenced by the increasing number of wallets holding less than ten bitcoins fidelity also laid out annualized returns for hypothetical portfolios allocating one to 3% to BTC. It shows that even in 2018, when bitcoin's price fell 70% with regular rebalancing, a portfolio with 3% of bitcoin set up at the beginning of the year would have outperformed a portfolio without any bitcoin by 1.1%, and from January 2015 to September 2020, such a portfolio would have outperformed one without bitcoin by 29%. However, the report notes that bitcoin's historical pattern of accelerated returns may not continue as it exits early stage behaviors. On the flip side, bitcoin could instead enter a period of more stable and steady performance, possibly resulting in lower volatility and favorable riskadjusted terms.
00:24:59.020 - 00:25:52.290, Speaker A: Lastly, market analyst Willie Wu posted some charts to Twitter illustrating why square and microstrategies bitcoin purchases are just the tip of the iceberg. He pointed out that there has been a reduction of 250,000 BTC on spot exchanges over the last eight months, signaling that other big investors may be getting into the game. Next headline. CFTC Chairman Praises Ethereum. Appearing Wednesday at CoinDesk's Invest Ethereum Economy Virtual Conference commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Heath Tarbert discussed how Ethereum and DeFi fit into us. Securities and commodity laws. But surprisingly, he gushed about Ethereum quote Let me just basically say how impressed I am by Ethereum full stop period, Tarbert said when discussing whether a proof of stake ethereum would be a security or commodity.
00:25:52.290 - 00:26:59.522, Speaker A: He deferred to his colleagues at the SEC, saying only quote the more decentralized it becomes overtime, and the more that it effectively runs itself, the more likely it is that it's going to fall within the commodity category and not the securities. Tarbet was equally hesitant to make a firm judgment on the place of DeFi within securities and commodities laws, but said of the uni token from Uniswap, which was airdrops to its users, quote if people didn't necessarily pay for it, then it's hard to see at one point there would be an economic loss. Next Headline BitMEX continues bringing in new Execs 79,000 BTC move off platform as follow from the BitMax lawsuits continues, questions remain about what may happen next now that the US. Government has gone after the Crypto Derivatives Exchange and its former executives. According to the bloc, legal experts generally agree that BitMax will avoid a government shutdown and be allowed to continue operations. As for whether other exchanges could face similar charges, they also pretty universally believe that this is likely. What remains a bit hazier is whether or not the US.
00:26:59.522 - 00:27:57.910, Speaker A: Will successfully extradite the defendants who remain at large. Meanwhile, BitMEX CTO Samuel Reed was released from custody after posting a $5 million bond. He pledges to appear in court to comply with sentencing or risk losing the bond. Also, the exchange's parent, group 100 X, announced Malcolm Wright had been appointed as chief compliance officer. Wright chairs the advisory council and AML Working Group of Global Digital Finance and BitMEX's announcement noted Wright's quote extensive background in compliance and antimoney laundering. CoinMetrics points out that unlike other exchanges using the typical hot and cold wallet structure, BitMEX holds all its Bitcoins in cold storage processing withdrawals once a day. Each BitMEX address is a multi signature address that requires three of four keys to initiate spending, three of which each is owned by one co founder while a fourth is mined.
00:27:57.910 - 00:28:56.322, Speaker A: Such a system means that had another founder been incapacitated in any way while Reed was in custody, a freeze of all funds on the platform could have occurred. Now that all three co founders have stepped down, it can be assumed that their keys have changed ownership. However, such a transition has not been confirmed. So far, users have had no trouble accessing funds, and thousands of users have successfully withdrawn Bitcoin. In the days following the announcement of charges, CoinMetrics posted a series of graphs that charted the sharp decrease in Bitcoin held by BitMEX and showed where some of the coins may have gone, with the top recipients being Binance, Gemini, Huobi and Okx. Next Headline Crypto community pans DOJ's suggestion to create backdoors for encryption The Department of justice is calling on tech companies to work with governments to implement encryption so that firms themselves and law enforcement can act against illegal content and activity. Crypto Twitter was not so supportive.
00:28:56.322 - 00:30:18.222, Speaker A: Melton demures of CoinShares criticized the DOJ's mention of, quote, sexually exploited children to prevent consumers from using end to end encrypted technology. In a Twitter thread compound, general counsel Jake Trevinsky brought up the DOJ's stance to support his contention that a greater ideological war is brewing over self custody and privacy.

The network went live at block 148 888, which Filecoin said in a blog post means, quote, prosperity for life in Chinese, chosen to honor the epic contribution by our Chinese mining community to File's long term success. The launch is a long time coming for the 200 million dollar ICO, with speculation that it could become the fastest newly live blockchain to reach a market cap of over $1 billion. Gemini and Kraken both immediately opened, trading for Filecoin. Next Headline The Whale Alert team gives a peek behind the tweets the Block interviewed Whale Alert, one of crypto Twitter's most famous accounts, known for tracking addresses that hold and move a large number of tokens.
00:30:18.222 - 00:31:18.894, Speaker A: The interview dives into the history of Whale Alert how the Twitter account straddles the line between privacy and transparency and goes into a tweet by Whalert about a, quote, possible Satoshi owned wallet that may have caused a drop in the price of Bitcoin. One tidbit they dangled is that, quote, we will be releasing an article in the near future about our views on Satoshi. Time for fun bits.
