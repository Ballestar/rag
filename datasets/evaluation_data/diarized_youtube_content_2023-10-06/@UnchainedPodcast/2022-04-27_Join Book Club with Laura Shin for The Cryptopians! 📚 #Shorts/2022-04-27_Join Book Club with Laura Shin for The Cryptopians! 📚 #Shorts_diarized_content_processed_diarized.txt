00:00:01.210 - 00:00:29.938, Speaker A: Hi, all. Laura here. In case you didn't hear, I am launching a book club. And we'll be discussing my book the Cryptopians Idealism greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze. And it came out two months ago. I know a bunch of you have had a chance to read it, and there's a bunch of crazy things that I revealed in the book that I know people were pretty shocked by. And so I thought it would be fun for all of you to be able to discuss it with each other and do it in a way where you didn't have to worry about spoilers.
00:00:29.938 - 00:00:56.378, Speaker A: And for some of the book clubs, we do have special guests, including a bunch of people that were involved in the Dow and including somebody whose role in crypto and in the Dow was not previously known until my book came out. Kind of shocking. A big name in other circles. Yeah. And he has agreed to take your questions, so be sure to check out the link. It is right here in this video, and I hope to see you. The first club is on Monday, the next one's on Tuesday.
00:00:56.378 - 00:00:58.250, Speaker A: And yeah, you can buy them all at Bitsky.
