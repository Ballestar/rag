00:00:00.410 - 00:00:53.840, Speaker A: So one of the things that's going to get answered here is, is the CFTC the correct regulator to be in this action? And they are a commodities regulator. So one of the decisions the judge is going to have to make is, are these things commodities? Because if you look at these and say, well, bitcoin ethereum, these stablecoins litecoin, all of them are securities. The question will be, CFTC, what are you doing here? Like, get out of here. The SEC has got to bring this action. And so the fact that the CFTC is bringing it is going to force a judge to confront that issue of, like, do you have regulatory authority over these actions? Which necessarily involves a determination. Because another option, for instance, to leave the SEC out of it is if you look at USDT and BUSD and say, no, these are unregulated banking products. Like, essentially this is an unregulated bank, you may need some, like the OCC showing up instead to confront those issues.
00:00:53.840 - 00:00:55.100, Speaker A: It is.
