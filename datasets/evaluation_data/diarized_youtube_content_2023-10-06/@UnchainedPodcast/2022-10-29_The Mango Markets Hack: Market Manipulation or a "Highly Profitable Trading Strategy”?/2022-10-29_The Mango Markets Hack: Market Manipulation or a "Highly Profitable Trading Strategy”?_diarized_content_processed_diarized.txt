00:00:00.250 - 00:00:13.870, Speaker A: Some people would have said what you did was a hack or market manipulation. You called it a highly profitable trading strategy. So in general, how do you view these events when the way the code actually functions is different from the intent?
00:00:14.450 - 00:00:36.660, Speaker B: So, first of all, I think a lot of these just speaking of generalities, sometimes it's very unclear what the intent might have been. Sometimes the code doesn't match docs off. Sometimes the doc says something and it's just not implemented. And sometimes the code does exactly what was intended. It's just that what was intended isn't what anyone wanted.
