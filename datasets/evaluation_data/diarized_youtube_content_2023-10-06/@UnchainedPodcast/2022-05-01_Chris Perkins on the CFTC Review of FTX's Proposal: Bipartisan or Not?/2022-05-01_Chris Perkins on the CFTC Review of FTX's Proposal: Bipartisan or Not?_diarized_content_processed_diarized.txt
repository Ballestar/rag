00:00:00.170 - 00:00:35.474, Speaker A: And if you look at historical decisions made by the CFTC, they're typically along party lines. Not always, but a lot of times. I'm guessing that in this case, that may not be the case. And so if there's any partisanism that's introduced, that would be very curious to me, because from my experience, even if you look at recent congressional races, it's very much a bipartisan phenomena where Eric Adams and Ted Cruz are agreeing that we need to embrace this technology. So that would be something that I would watch, but I don't expect it to be partisan.
