00:00:33.530 - 00:00:36.434, Speaker C: Today's guest is Chris Black, DFI researcher.
00:00:36.482 - 00:00:38.938, Speaker B: And analyst and founder of The Black Report.
00:00:39.104 - 00:00:40.262, Speaker C: Welcome, Chris.
00:00:40.406 - 00:00:42.458, Speaker A: Hey, Laura, thanks for having me on.
00:00:42.624 - 00:00:45.830, Speaker B: This week, A 16 Z crypto's participation.
00:00:45.910 - 00:00:54.874, Speaker C: In a Uniswap vote caused quite a bit of uproar in the community. The proposal was whether or not to deploy Uniswap V Three on the BNB.
00:00:54.922 - 00:00:58.522, Speaker B: Chain and in an initial temperature check vote.
00:00:58.586 - 00:01:10.420, Speaker C: Before the formal proposal, more than 60% of the community wanted to deploy using the Wormhole bridge rather than using layer zero, which is an A 16 Z portfolio company.
00:01:10.950 - 00:01:16.114, Speaker B: However, at that time, A 16 Z was actually not able to participate in that temperature vote check.
00:01:16.232 - 00:01:27.678, Speaker C: And then so when the formal vote started and this again was just on whether or not to deploy on BNB and kind of tucked in, there would be that they would also deploy using wormhole.
00:01:27.794 - 00:01:29.830, Speaker B: At that time, A 16 Z crypto.
00:01:29.910 - 00:01:49.310, Speaker C: Used 15 million of its Uni tokens to swing the vote in a different direction. The voting is still occurring, so the period is not over, and at this moment, actually, it looks like they're definitely going to lose. But talk a little bit about what your perspective was as you were watching this play out.
00:01:49.460 - 00:01:58.242, Speaker E: We've seen large token holders like A 16 Z in the past come in and basically use their might in order.
00:01:58.296 - 00:02:01.966, Speaker A: To change outcomes that look like they're.
00:02:01.998 - 00:02:36.606, Speaker E: Favored by the community. And what we saw here in this case was A 16 Z coming in, laying down 15 million uni tokens in a direction that was opposite to basically all of the votes up until that point, almost. So it did appear on that day that they were trying to swing the vote in their favor. Since then, we've seen things shift quite a bit, and more and more votes have come in on the side opposite of A 16 Z, including votes from their very own delegates, which is very, very interesting. And now it's tilted the scales in.
00:02:36.628 - 00:02:39.214, Speaker A: A way that is opposite to what.
00:02:39.252 - 00:02:55.780, Speaker E: A 16 Z wanted. And they admitted right up front in some forum posts that they wanted this outcome because they wanted it to favor a company layer zero. That's part of their investment portfolio, which made it a very interesting incentive situation.
00:02:56.090 - 00:02:58.434, Speaker A: For them and their Uni tokens.
00:02:58.562 - 00:03:24.606, Speaker C: So, as you mentioned, A 16 Z has quite a large number of tokens. It has at least 55 million uni. The 15 million that it voted with and then the 40 million that it delegated out to other groups, many of them educational blockchain groups such as ones affiliated with different universities. How do you think Dows should deal with these kinds of entities that have large numbers of tokens like that?
00:03:24.788 - 00:03:51.714, Speaker E: How should they deal with them? I mean, it's kind of by design, right? The way that this whole thing works, it's one token, one vote. And these large entities like A 16 Z have that many tokens because they purchased them from the Dow or the company that was starting this thing up or whatever it might be. So I don't think it's a situation where the system is broken per se because it's working as it was intended.
00:03:51.842 - 00:03:54.966, Speaker A: The problem comes when they pitch these.
00:03:54.988 - 00:04:10.460, Speaker E: Things as decentralized and as people powered but then these entities come along and they just throw their tokens in when they feel like things aren't going their way, which is something that A 16 Z does have a history of doing in Dows like this.
00:04:11.250 - 00:04:16.174, Speaker C: Do you feel that there's anything faulty with Dow design or do you think.
00:04:16.212 - 00:04:17.422, Speaker B: That that's a good system?
00:04:17.476 - 00:04:21.280, Speaker C: One token, one vote, and there's whales in the system?
00:04:21.650 - 00:05:05.034, Speaker E: Yeah. My personal opinion is it's a horrible system if you're trying to create a decentralized, autonomous organization, which is what a Dao is supposed to be, right? So if you have a situation like we've seen before with Uni, with MakerDAO, with a bunch of other DAOs out there where these small token holders operate, and they do the work and they vote on things and they're able to do what they want to do until something that they want to do goes against the interests of one of those large whale organizations or whatever it might be, then that whale organization comes in and just votes on those certain proposals that do go against their financial interests.
00:05:05.162 - 00:05:06.542, Speaker A: That is a problem, right?
00:05:06.596 - 00:05:16.414, Speaker E: Because you are creating this illusion that it is decentralized and that it is people powered when in reality it's always being watched by the actual owner.
00:05:16.542 - 00:05:18.962, Speaker A: In this case, a 16 Z.
00:05:19.096 - 00:05:20.526, Speaker B: Wait, I'm sorry, the actual owner?
00:05:20.558 - 00:05:24.066, Speaker C: You mean just of those tokens or owner of what?
00:05:24.168 - 00:06:18.306, Speaker E: That's a great question and that's something that I've been trying to answer myself. A 16 Z has a pretty considerable percentage of the voting power both between what they operate within their own wallet and what they've delegated out to other entities, universities, et cetera, like what you said. Plus, who knows? We have no way of knowing how many other Uni tokens they might have, okay? There's no way to know for sure exactly what that total is beyond just what they say. Now, how is that different from looking at a private company that might have 4610 percent of the voting shares in that company? You would call them still one of the owners of that company. It's a lot different from me if I have ten uni versus this entity over here that has 50 million. So at some point we need to start to see the parallels that are happening between a traditional company and what's.
00:06:18.338 - 00:06:21.334, Speaker A: Supposed to be a Dow when in.
00:06:21.372 - 00:06:50.990, Speaker E: Reality it's really being operated. In this case, the whole debate is happening between A 16 Z and Jump because of their competing interests in these two bridge organizations and everybody else just has little bits of input here and there. What's making this really interesting, though, like I said, is that delegates of A 16 Z are voting against them. So it's going to be interesting to see how A 16 Z reacts to that down the road because why would they keep these delegates if they're not supporting their interest?
00:06:51.060 - 00:07:38.238, Speaker C: Yeah, and just to clarify for listeners, so Jump Capital is the major investor in Wormhole and A 16 Z is major investor in layer zero. And Wormhole, after it was hacked, was basically kept alive with an infusion of $300 million from Jump. So obviously they have a strong vested interest there. You talked about how it is that A 16 Z has actually delegated out the majority of their tokens. And some of those different educational groups like the Michigan I don't remember their official name, but something like the Michigan Blockchain Club, the University of Michigan, there were others with different universities. They did not vote in line with A 16 Z. They voted against, as you pointed out.
00:07:38.238 - 00:07:56.926, Speaker C: And so doesn't that kind of undercut your argument that A 16 Z is sort of like controlling all of their tokens? And doesn't it sort of align with that idea that even though they are the owners that they're delegating in order to foster decentralization, it doesn't undercut it.
00:07:56.968 - 00:08:23.886, Speaker E: Because a 16 Z chose their delegates, right? And they chose delegates for very specific reasons because they lended legitimacy. Because they thought they would think in a certain way because they thought they would vote in a certain way that would ultimately help A 16 Z. The biggest mistake that I think people make when talking about this issue is assuming that a 16 Z or any venture capital firm has any reason at.
00:08:23.908 - 00:08:25.466, Speaker A: All to be philanthropic.
00:08:25.658 - 00:09:05.274, Speaker E: They're not here to be charitable. They're not here to give you and I more rights in the world or to help us in any real way. They're here to make money. That's what venture capital firms do, right? When they're choosing their delegates. They're choosing their delegates because they think those delegates are going to help them make more money. So the real question to me now is they can't force their hand, right? They're not forcing the delegates to do anything, but they chose them and they can get rid of them and they can get new ones too or they can choose not to if they think that's going to look bad and that's going to cost them money. Whatever's going to make them more money is what they're going to do.
00:09:05.392 - 00:09:07.398, Speaker A: So it's up to us because there's.
00:09:07.414 - 00:09:16.686, Speaker E: No regulation in this space, because there's nobody else doing the work, it's up to us to look at it and interpret what's going on so that we can manage these things better in the.
00:09:16.708 - 00:09:19.086, Speaker A: Future and we can tell people when.
00:09:19.108 - 00:09:21.086, Speaker E: It'S decentralized and when it's not.
00:09:21.188 - 00:09:24.080, Speaker A: Clearly this situation is not decentralized though.
00:09:24.630 - 00:09:37.830, Speaker C: So when you say that, it remains to be seen how A 16 C will react to the fact that the entities that it delegated its votes to voted against them. What do you mean by that?
00:09:37.980 - 00:09:48.678, Speaker E: I mean that A 16 Z is a for profit corporation. They're not doing this for philanthropic reasons. They are operating in a way that's.
00:09:48.694 - 00:09:51.242, Speaker A: Going to ultimately make them money, whether.
00:09:51.296 - 00:10:00.954, Speaker E: It'S through their tokens, through their investments in other companies. And it's pretty clear that A 16 Z, hey, they're smart, they're savvy, they.
00:10:00.992 - 00:10:03.962, Speaker A: Want to put together a DFI ecosystem.
00:10:04.026 - 00:10:20.050, Speaker E: I like to call it a cartel, but an ecosystem of companies that work together and create this little bubble of their investments, their different companies. And the beautiful thing about DeFi is it's interconnected and everybody can benefit each other in their portfolio.
00:10:20.550 - 00:10:29.538, Speaker A: So when their delegates start standing in the way of that, then you have to start to wonder what's the benefit.
00:10:29.554 - 00:11:09.250, Speaker E: Of keeping those delegates? So either they're going to end up keeping them and say this is proof to the world that we're not trying to be tyrannical and to dictate what goes on here or they're going to get rid of them and they're going to get other delegates that are going to vote more in line with the way that they want to invest and the way they want to make money with their business. So that's the part that is going to be interesting to watch. I happen to think they're probably going to keep these guys on and say, hey look, it's decentralized because our delegates are voting against us. But again, it's not because they really care about decentralization, it's because they care about looking decentralized.
00:11:10.870 - 00:11:11.346, Speaker B: All right?
00:11:11.368 - 00:11:35.926, Speaker C: And just to bring in one of the voices so Blockchain at Michigan is the group that I was thinking of. They were one of the delegates of the A 16 Z unitokens and they tweeted we voted incongruently with A 16 Z because we believe that wormhole is an adequate messaging solution for cross chain governance. A 16 Z is an investor in layer zero. They have an interest in seeing layer zero succeed.
00:11:36.038 - 00:11:36.758, Speaker B: We don't.
00:11:36.854 - 00:11:45.086, Speaker C: Although we like layer layer zero, our priority is what's best for uniswap protocol. So in a moment we're going to.
00:11:45.108 - 00:11:46.446, Speaker B: Talk a little bit more about the.
00:11:46.468 - 00:11:52.640, Speaker C: Role that VCs should play in a decentralized world. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:12:20.534 - 00:12:22.646, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Chris.
00:12:22.838 - 00:12:24.906, Speaker B: So you hinted at this a little.
00:12:24.928 - 00:12:36.378, Speaker C: Bit in some of your answers, but do you feel that VCs don't really have a place at all in a technology that's meant to foster decentralization or what role do you see them playing?
00:12:36.554 - 00:12:39.406, Speaker A: Personally, I come from the point of.
00:12:39.428 - 00:12:49.970, Speaker E: View of somebody who entered the space because of bitcoin, because of the promise of decentralization, of self sovereign money, of trustlessness.
00:12:50.310 - 00:12:53.662, Speaker A: Venture capital firms don't and they can't.
00:12:53.726 - 00:13:27.966, Speaker E: Share those same interests because those interests are not necessarily profitable. They're not billion dollar company unicorn startup ideas, right? You can't build a unicorn company and have it be completely trustless because then you have no real solid way to make money and to change your product with the times and to keep up with things. So I don't think that VC investments when it comes to blockchain tech are compatible with a lot of the principles that bitcoiners in general come into the space for. So with that being said, they could.
00:13:27.988 - 00:13:29.726, Speaker A: Be doing a lot better, they could.
00:13:29.748 - 00:14:00.086, Speaker E: Be doing a lot better to actually prove that they're interested in decentralization, like they say. But we've seen, and we're seeing right now, this play out, this vote that's going on is not necessarily about what's best for decentralization or what's best for trustlessness or anything like that. This is turning into what's best for each party's investing strategy, what's best for their portfolio, for their bottom line. And that's not really why I entered.
00:14:00.118 - 00:14:01.260, Speaker A: This space at all.
00:14:01.950 - 00:14:04.042, Speaker B: Yeah, you tweeted the part that many.
00:14:04.096 - 00:14:19.934, Speaker C: Are missing is that behemoth VCs like a 16 Z are using the free market excuse to foster a regulatory environment that will ultimately stifle competition and make it impossible for indie devs to operate in DFI legally. What did you mean by that?
00:14:20.132 - 00:14:22.554, Speaker A: What I mean is that big money.
00:14:22.612 - 00:14:27.794, Speaker E: In the space, whether it's a 16 Z or other big investing firms, have.
00:14:27.832 - 00:14:33.182, Speaker A: An interest in fostering a regulatory environment.
00:14:33.326 - 00:14:47.080, Speaker E: And working with regulators to develop a regulatory environment that favors their business. They're not interested in running pirate operations that go against the grain or go against the law or anger the government.
00:14:47.610 - 00:14:50.054, Speaker A: They're not going to become giant, billion.
00:14:50.102 - 00:15:50.198, Speaker E: Billion, billion dollar companies that way. The way that they become huge is by working with the regulators, working with the government in order to put together laws, regulations, whatever they might be, that benefit them over the next 510 20 years. And that's happening right now. And ironically, a year or two ago, a 16 Z actually used their tokens to vote into existence an organization called the DFI Education Fund, which, if anybody wants to look back, can see a 16 Z made that happen. They used their tokens to make this thing happen. And what it is, it turned out it was like a 30 or $40 million fund intended specifically to lobby, to work with regulators and educate them about the way that regulations should come into existence. But because of the way it's funded and incentivized, it's not about creating regulations that are privacy friendly, that are liberty friendly.
00:15:50.198 - 00:16:12.450, Speaker E: It's about creating regulations that are going to ultimately allow a 16 Z's portfolio to grow and to become huge companies, become huge successes. And those two things are not compatible. So that's what I'm talking about when I say they're trying to foster something that almost goes against a lot of the language they're using to describe these organizations.
00:16:13.110 - 00:16:15.986, Speaker B: You tweeted. I've been asking a 16 C to.
00:16:16.008 - 00:16:25.958, Speaker C: Engage in a public dialogue with me about DFI governance for over two years. So if you had that opportunity, what questions would you like to ask them?
00:16:26.124 - 00:16:29.606, Speaker E: I'd like to know how well, first.
00:16:29.628 - 00:16:31.306, Speaker A: Of all, I'd like to know how.
00:16:31.328 - 00:16:39.574, Speaker E: They choose and why they choose delegates the way that they do. They've done some blogging about that. They talked about that somewhat.
00:16:39.702 - 00:16:43.758, Speaker A: But the bottom line is, like I said before, they're coming at it from.
00:16:43.764 - 00:16:52.942, Speaker E: The point of view of they're trying to be these goodwill ambassadors and we're being so generous and doing these delegations, but let's get down the brass tax.
00:16:53.076 - 00:16:54.350, Speaker A: You want to make money.
00:16:54.500 - 00:17:42.346, Speaker E: You're choosing delegates that you think are ultimately going to help you make money. Why are you making these choices the way that you're making them? So that's one thing for sure, and then beyond that, it's really about how can we consider these things to be decentralized when it really comes down to just a handful of giant organizations like yourself? Maybe there's four or five organizations that can swing any vote with a lot of these Dows. And I know that the long term thing is for them to unload the tokens and to dump them on people who might come in later. But I mean, for now, to call these things decentralized, autonomous organizations, it's like a slap in the face to everything that bitcoin in the first place built. And to continue to use that term.
00:17:42.378 - 00:17:43.840, Speaker A: Is just crazy to me.
00:17:44.450 - 00:17:46.626, Speaker C: So do you feel that there's any.
00:17:46.728 - 00:17:48.466, Speaker B: Optimal way that you would like to.
00:17:48.488 - 00:18:02.790, Speaker C: See DeFi governance operate? Or are you saying that you feel that DeFi protocols in general can never be truly decentralized? Or in general? What do you think this says about DeFi, not just VC participation in DeFi?
00:18:03.850 - 00:18:06.018, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of experiments.
00:18:06.034 - 00:18:07.510, Speaker E: That have yet to actually be tried.
00:18:07.580 - 00:18:11.610, Speaker A: As far as using tokens to vote.
00:18:12.030 - 00:18:20.990, Speaker E: And really the most popular method still is one token, one vote. And what we've seen over and over is that doesn't work for decentralization.
00:18:21.330 - 00:18:24.654, Speaker A: That method, with the amount of money.
00:18:24.692 - 00:18:36.818, Speaker E: That'S involved with it is absolutely going to end up being captured by regulators or governments down the road just because it's clear. You have these parties that have 5% of the voting power.
00:18:36.984 - 00:18:39.794, Speaker A: They're saying this thing's decentralized, but they.
00:18:39.832 - 00:18:46.682, Speaker E: Can sway things in so many different ways. That's not working. It's not working for decentralization.
00:18:46.766 - 00:18:49.526, Speaker A: Now I think there's other things going.
00:18:49.548 - 00:19:31.362, Speaker E: On out there, other Dows that are trying different things, quadratic voting or time lock voting and stuff like that. But that stuff is less profitable for venture capitalists. So they still favor the one token, one vote and they're going to push that as far as they can go. So my objective right now is just to make people aware of what's going on because a lot of people just can't wrap their heads around how this stuff is working. And the almost false like advertising that's happening from a lot of the VCs in the space isn't helping. So it's really up to us to explain to people here's why it's not as decentralized as you think. And here's where it's going to lead.
00:19:31.362 - 00:19:48.794, Speaker E: It's going to lead to regulation. It's going to lead to less privacy for you. It's going to lead to governments having a huge say over how these things work in the future. And that's almost certainly what a lot of these VCs want. They want that type of regulation because that's going to be the path to.
00:19:48.832 - 00:19:50.140, Speaker A: Big money for them.
00:19:50.830 - 00:19:54.534, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, I guess you alluded to that earlier.
00:19:54.662 - 00:19:55.914, Speaker B: I did want to ask you though.
00:19:55.952 - 00:20:12.570, Speaker C: Directly, so you wrote again in a tweet, all Dows, using unadulterated one token, one vote governance mechanisms will inevitably be captured by governments, regulators. How do you see that happening? What do you mean exactly when you say that?
00:20:12.740 - 00:20:16.466, Speaker A: I mean that there's a lot of.
00:20:16.488 - 00:20:53.742, Speaker E: Money right now going into lobbying and trying to push regulations into existence. Big institutional money won't come in to DeFi until there is clear regulation, until we know exactly what's legal and what's not. And those regulations ultimately are going to control what's legal, what's possible with a dao, with a dao that is selling tokens and is operated through these type of voting tokens. So at a certain point we're going to have on the books very clear rules about how this is going to work.
00:20:53.876 - 00:20:58.830, Speaker A: And there are rules that are going to favor big whales that are actually.
00:20:58.900 - 00:21:13.182, Speaker E: Out there greasing palms and making sure that things happen the way they want them to. But those same rules are going to apply to new Dows. They're going to apply to small Dows. They're going to apply to indie developers that are thinking of new projects that they want to launch.
00:21:13.326 - 00:21:14.434, Speaker A: It's going to be up to them.
00:21:14.472 - 00:21:16.654, Speaker E: To make sure they're not breaking these new laws.
00:21:16.782 - 00:21:19.494, Speaker A: And that's part of the reason that.
00:21:19.532 - 00:21:23.670, Speaker E: The existing organizations want to have a say in how these laws look because.
00:21:23.740 - 00:21:26.486, Speaker A: They want to make it harder to.
00:21:26.508 - 00:21:45.238, Speaker E: Lose their competitive advantage. And this isn't unique to blockchain. This is every industry. We've seen it over and over for decades. The first movers want to come in. They want to take advantage of their relationship with regulators, teach the regulators about how it should be. And then all of a sudden, you've got these laws, and we've seen it.
00:21:45.264 - 00:21:47.966, Speaker A: From what we're seeing now to the.
00:21:47.988 - 00:22:04.820, Speaker E: Internet to telephone to radio, go back 100 years. This is always the way it's been. And so anybody new that wants to enter to the space needs to hire lawyers, have tons of software, tons, know stuff to navigate the bureaucracy. It's going to make it harder for new people to come into the space.
00:22:05.750 - 00:22:09.234, Speaker B: All right, Chris, well, thank you so much for sharing your insights.
00:22:09.362 - 00:22:10.870, Speaker E: My pleasure, Laura.

An Extremely Bored Ape The FBI seized a bored ape, which turns out to be a pretty hilarious story. Why don't you listen to it? From Unchained social media manager Jenny Hogan.
00:33:18.070 - 00:33:59.730, Speaker F: So the FBI has seized a board ape, which, now that it's mired in government bureaucracy, is an extremely bored ape. To a recent report, the FBI seized the ape a doodle NFT about 87 ETH and a $40,000 watch, all from an infamous crypto scammer named horror. By far the most shocking part of this story is that when the government seized the assets, the ETH was worth about $116,000, and today it's worth about $144,000. That was a twist for the ages. Of course, the FBI themselves did not actually find horror doing things, achieving goals, helping people that's not really like what the government's all about. Independent blockchain investor Zach XBT to the rescue. We don't know the real identity of Zack XBT.
00:33:59.730 - 00:34:18.080, Speaker F: He is not, as his name suggests, one of Elon Musk's children. But get this Horror was discovered because of a $40,000 watch that he bragged about on social media. Doesn't he have anything normal to post about, like an avocado? All of which is to say, if you're going to steal a shit, ton of crypto have the decency to use your iPhone to keep track of time.
