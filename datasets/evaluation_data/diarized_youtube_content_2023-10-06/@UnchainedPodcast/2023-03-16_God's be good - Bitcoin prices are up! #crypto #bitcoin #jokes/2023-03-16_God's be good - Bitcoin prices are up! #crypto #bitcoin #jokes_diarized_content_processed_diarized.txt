00:00:00.090 - 00:00:28.054, Speaker A: Let's be good. The price of bitcoin is up at $26,000. It hit its peak since June 2022. Honestly, watching its value rise to its highest level in nine months is the closest most Bitcoin bros will come to ever giving birth. Even though crypto is now totally unbanked after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, this rise in bitcoin's price might be evidence that maybe banking is overrated. Personally, I keep all my money in venmo. Some say that regulators shut down at your bank in an attempt to send an anti crypto message.
00:00:28.054 - 00:00:50.206, Speaker A: But this is evidence that their plan has backfired. I can't decide if I find that satisfying. Being asked to choose who I'm rooting for between regulators and bitcoin holders is like being asked if I want the temperature at twelve degrees or 112 degrees. Regulators miss the mark here. They don't need to shut down a whole bank just to send an anticrypto message. It would be enough to just read the quote tweets on anything SBS puts out. It's not, though.
00:00:50.206 - 00:00:59.610, Speaker A: Crypto is permanently unbanked either, like a bunch of banks have indicated that they may tentatively accept crypto, including Santander HSBC, Deutsche Bank and the Ghost of Bear Stearns.
