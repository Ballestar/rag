00:00:00.170 - 00:00:52.380, Speaker A: The fee on the product today, I think, is certainly borne by just a lot of costs that go into running a product in the crypto space. It's not analogous today to the kind of economies of scale that you'll see for equity products or fixed income products. And we've said publicly, and I'll say to you again, we are committed to lowering the fee on GBTC when it converts to an ETF risk. But certainly in the meantime, all the fees that are being generated on GBTC, that is all the capital that we as an organization are putting into our lawsuit against the SEC, bringing the best legal minds possible to the case and really just continuing to advocate for investors. So we feel very strongly about the case. The full resources of the firm are behind it. And again, yeah, we'll we'll lower fees in an ETF state.
