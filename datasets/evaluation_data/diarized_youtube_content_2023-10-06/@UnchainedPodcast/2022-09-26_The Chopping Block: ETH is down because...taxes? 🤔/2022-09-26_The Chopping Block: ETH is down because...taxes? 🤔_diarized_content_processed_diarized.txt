00:00:00.250 - 00:00:27.640, Speaker A: Everybody made a ton of money last year. The market was up. Everybody was like, churning crypto, buying it, selling it. Everybody filed extensions, which are due soon, and people are just now realizing how much money they made last year and how much lower their crypto is relative to last year. But hold on. But why would this affect no. Why would this affect ether more than Bitcoin? That make any sense? It's impacting everything.
00:00:27.640 - 00:00:47.798, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems uniformly across. I think the ETH thing may have been that more people were speculating for the merge, but then once it was a nothing burger, it was like a nothing burger in a good way. Sorry, I don't mean that. I'm trying to say, like, nothing. And there was no excitement, right. ETHW. Died immediately, basically.
00:00:47.798 - 00:00:59.210, Speaker A: So I guess that part people were hoping to probably make some carry on for whatever little time that trade existed, and then now they're like, oh, shit, we need to pay taxes.
