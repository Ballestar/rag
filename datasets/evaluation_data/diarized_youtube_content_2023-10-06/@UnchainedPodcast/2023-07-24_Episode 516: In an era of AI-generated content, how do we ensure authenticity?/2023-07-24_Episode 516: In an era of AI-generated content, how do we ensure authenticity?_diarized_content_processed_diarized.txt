00:00:00.090 - 00:00:40.674, Speaker A: So, for example, let's say this podcast was completely AI generated. How do you know that? How would the listener know that it was AI generated or real people? We three actually said, yes, we actually participated. And so the way to do that is for us, all three, after it's recorded, to sign the kind of hash of the whole podcast and say like, yes, we participate in this. And this is indeed content that we've been members of, but it can be actually edited with AI to make it sound nicer, to have better images, et cetera. That doesn't matter. What matters is that I say, yes, I authorize this content and I put my reputation in this. And so to do that, we need cryptographic signatures.
00:00:40.674 - 00:00:56.060, Speaker A: We need kind of an identity that ties all of the things that I signed with so you can see what I've signed. And we need a set of tooling that when you do list in, it on, for example, podcasts or Spotify or whatever. It says, yes, it's verified and indeed signed by the right people.
