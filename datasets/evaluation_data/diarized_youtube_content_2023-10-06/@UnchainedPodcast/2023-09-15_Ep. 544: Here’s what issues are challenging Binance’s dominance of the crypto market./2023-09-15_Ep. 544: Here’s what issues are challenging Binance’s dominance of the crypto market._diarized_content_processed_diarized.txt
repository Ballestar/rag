00:00:00.250 - 00:00:39.414, Speaker A: So there's the CFTC lawsuit in March. There is the SEC lawsuit that came in June. There are rumors that the DOJ is investigating Binance and they would bring criminal charges. CFTC and SEC are sort of civil endeavors which would kind of lead to fines and maybe bars from trading in certain activities. But obviously DOJ could bring criminal penalties if they bring such charges and are able to get CZ into I mean, there's other aspects too as well. I mean, Binance has been losing payment and banking partners around the world. Binance US in June had to become a crypto only exchange because they lost their banking partners in the US.
00:00:39.414 - 00:00:57.340, Speaker A: So they couldn't handle US dollars anymore. They lost their auditor in January. And then on top of that too, just a wave of executive departures going from the C suite to country. This a lot for one particular exchange. Any company, really, but an exchange as consequential as Binance to deal with.
