00:00:00.810 - 00:00:42.410, Speaker A: Hey, all. Some of you may have heard that Silvergate Bank, the leading bank for the crypto industry, is facing challenges after FTX's implosion it's. One of the most shorted stocks has changed its chief risk officer, which is a role focused on fraud, and it's been releasing public statements weekly to try to quell the markets. In this episode, we heard from veteran short seller Mark Cohores and crypto banking insider Ram Alawal. Leah on why for Mark he believes that this is only the beginning of Silvergate's troubles and why for Rom, he believes Silvergate won't go down. It was an intense and fascinating discussion with great points by both sides. I think we'll have to see how events play out before we can see who was right.

Here to discuss are Mark cohortes, individual investor and former hedge fund manager, and Rom Alawalia, CEO and co founder at Lumida. Welcome, Mark and Rom.
00:03:00.802 - 00:03:02.322, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, Laura.
00:03:02.466 - 00:03:50.806, Speaker A: Silvergate bank has been an important bank for the crypto industry, giving access to the traditional financial system to crypto companies, including exchanges such as Coinbase, hedge funds, venture capital firms, Et, cetera. It started off as a real estate bank back in the day, but began switching to crypto in 2016. And from 2020 to 2021, deposits at the bank quintupled from 2 billion to 10 billion. Its stock price also skyrocketed from twelve dollars to two hundred dollars a share, but now it's trading at about $20 after the collapse of one of its clients, FTX. But before we dive into all the details on what's going on with Silvergate, why don't we have each of you give your backgrounds so the audience understands how your perspective here is relevant to the situation. Mark, why don't you go ahead and begin.
00:03:50.988 - 00:04:25.214, Speaker B: So I'm a 62 year old fellow. I used to be in the hedge fund business. I'm not, as I would say, retired. I'm still an investor, but most people know me as a short seller and market skeptic. I'm a Googleable guy. I've exposed significant frauds going back from the 80s till as recently as, I think, 2018, which is something called my Medics, where the CEO and COO went to jail and you were calling out.
00:04:25.252 - 00:04:29.066, Speaker A: FTX back in, what was it, September? October?
00:04:29.258 - 00:05:19.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll get to FTX in a minute. You asked for my background, but there have been some Harvard Business School cases written about me, about exposing subprime mortgage fraud and various things. And I think I put numerous people in prison, probably more than anyone on the planet, from a forensic analysis standpoint. I started calling out FTX on Twitter back in May, and probably I'm the only one who publicly went after them with a hatchet and axe, but was largely ignored. The mainstream media here did a horrifically bad job in following through. So that's sort of a little bit about me. And I have a very strong and negative point of view on Silvergate as it relates to their practices and how they go about doing their business.
00:05:19.730 - 00:05:39.766, Speaker B: That's just a little bit about me. I tend to be vocal and I don't sort of give up till things have sort of cleared themselves through. So I'm just not one of these people who say something and just drop it and move on, which is great.
00:05:39.868 - 00:05:41.500, Speaker A: Rom, what about you?
00:05:42.110 - 00:06:01.886, Speaker C: Thank you. Laura. First off, Mark, pleased to meet you. I've tracked your research going back to Novastar, and of course you've made a killing this year in Carvana in a former life ten years ago as an investor in Carrisdale. I'm sure you know who they are, and I'm friendly with folks at Hindenburg. So you've made a killing this year. You're having probably one of the best years you've ever had.
00:06:01.886 - 00:06:33.482, Speaker C: I respect your analysis, although I do think you've overextended. We'll get into that. But I appreciate the points and the contributions you've made, especially in calling out FTX well ahead of anyone else out there on my background, briefly, banking and capital markets in a nutshell. So I grew up at banks as an executive at Banks America as an operating executive, and also at Merrill Lynch. I was at Merrill Lynch during the 2008 financial crisis, literally lived on Wall Street. I saw the limos pull up and Maiden Lane and take a Lehman under that weekend. So it's very up close for me.
00:06:33.482 - 00:07:08.378, Speaker C: I was also shorting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac due to solvency issues. So I'm sympathetic to some of the arguments that one can make around solvency. More recently, I was the executive at Cross River Building, the crypto business. Our clients included Coinbase and other leading exchanges. And I co founded Lumida, which is a digital asset advisory firm. And my colleagues come from Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and also include a bank regulatory attorney who's the CEO of a trust bank. In terms of regulation, I've done teachings at the US securities and Exchange Commission.
00:07:08.378 - 00:07:27.798, Speaker C: I co wrote an op ed with SEC Chair Arthur Levitt, and I've written comments and have been recognized by U. S. Treasury a few times. Also, the FDIC was a client of a prior company I started called PIQ. They issued a press release there. So I hope I'm googleable what old to say is that I'm credible on bank and regulatory matters.
00:07:27.974 - 00:08:00.578, Speaker A: All right, so then let's have each of you maybe just explain, like, I started to talk about what Silvergate is and why it's important to the crypto industry, but I don't know if there's anything either of you want to add on there. And then after that, we can kind of get into your views on it. Because from what I can tell so far, mark is bearish, as he indicated, and Rom, you're, I think, more bullish. So maybe just each of you explain why you think it's even important to discuss this at all, why crypto people should know about it, and then we can go into the arguments.
00:08:00.674 - 00:08:56.198, Speaker B: Well, Silvergate sort of stuck out to me because the guy who runs it, Alan Lane, I think is beyond incompetent. He brags about doing due diligence, brags about all his processes, brags about everything that he does right. But he had SBF as his spokesperson on the website till SBF had trouble. And then SBF, everyone knows of his issues. He then switched to having someone from Bittrex be his spokesman. And Bittrex is probably almost as big a scam as so, you know, once you can call it an accident, you're you're sort of guilty of, in my mind, sleeping at the switch. And when called out about Bitrex, Silvergate took this thing down.
00:08:56.198 - 00:09:43.510, Speaker B: And when you look at the employees at Silvergate, there's no one who has what I would call pedigree who can actually pull this off. There's no one there like Rom, who's an experienced soul. The Alan Lane's son in law used to be the head of Risk and was replaced in early November. And from former employees I've talked to, there's numerous family members there in key positions. One more incompetent than the next. So really, silvergate was a sleepy regional small bank in La Jolla, about 40 million in assets. And they were talked into banking for crypto.
00:09:43.510 - 00:10:18.322, Speaker B: And from what I can gather, again through some of the stuff I've done, and talking to some people who used to work there, and some people who compete with them, their systems are inadequate. The people there don't know their ass from first base. They got in huge trouble with FTX. Their trouble has just begun. They're going to have issues with Bittrex. They've had issues with other exchanges which they're not disclosing. And I think the regulators have been woefully behind in terms of looking at things.
00:10:18.322 - 00:10:55.418, Speaker B: And when they catch up, I think they're going to dig deep here. They're going to look at the trillion dollars that the Send network has passed through, and trillion dollars is a lot of money. And I think they're woefully deficient in KYC and AML practices. And their book value is vastly overstated. They have probably $500 million of assets that they admit are overvalued. And when they run that through the income statement and book value, book value goes from 35 to 20. So I think the bank is going to be in runoff.
00:10:55.418 - 00:11:42.460, Speaker B: I think they're going to be in court from this FTX matter from now till when my grandkids are my age, and I think there's nothing there. I think it was an idea that was good at the time. I think it got out of control. I think it grew way too fast. And now with FTX and others hitting the wall, I think Silvergate's deposits are going to go from I think they peaked at 15 billion, 13 billion somewhere in there. Think they're going to go back down to where they started and real guys are going to come in and do this business rather than them. I think SBNY said last week, they want to sort of get out of the business or cut a way back.
00:11:42.460 - 00:12:02.210, Speaker B: And they know what they're doing. I mean, their controls are superior to Silvergate. From a stock standpoint, you don't have to short it. I'm short the stock. You don't have to short it. But if you own the stock, I think you need your head looked at, at least from now till six months from now, to where the smoke clears or the bank has issues.
00:12:02.280 - 00:12:03.858, Speaker C: So we'll see.
00:12:04.024 - 00:12:08.622, Speaker A: And Rom, I know that you have a different position. What's your view?
00:12:08.776 - 00:12:53.214, Speaker C: Sure. Well, I won't react to Mark's comments. I'm sure we can get that into Q A and really focus on those different topics and cycle through them. But I'll start by framing up Silvergate, and then I'll cycle through how a regulator would look at silvergate in terms of capital, asset quality management, earning, liquidity, sensitivity to market, risk factors. And my conclusion from all of that is that at least as of September 30, regulators did view Silvergate in good standing and of course, there are some bumps in the road related to FTX, and we'll come back to that. But first off, silvergate. So they're the leading crypto bank exchanges, hedge funds and asset managers have an account there so that Silvergate can enable book transfers.
00:12:53.214 - 00:13:32.142, Speaker C: Twenty four, seven and Silvergate plays a vital essential role to enable the movement of money, including Stablecoins and Mark. Alluded to this in terms of the velocity of payments owing to the nature of their business model on the platform, it's important to say a few points of clarity here. One is silvergate does not hold any crypto on its balance sheet. And first off, that's illegal. Silvergate cannot hold any crypto on its balance sheet. Silvergate holds deposits, and their deposits are concentrated around these crypto companies. Also, the loans Silvergate has to crypto firms are over collateralized 2.5
00:13:32.142 - 00:14:22.802, Speaker C: x. And that Send leverage program has experienced 0% in credit losses since inception through December 9, which I believe was this past Friday. So let me just cycle through a couple of the key areas here. One is around the overall company, I would say that Silvergate maintains a high quality, high earning asset base consisting primarily of government backed mortgage backed securities, Treasuries, cash, and they also have a diversified funding base, although it's true that's come under pressure in recent months on the credit assessment. Silver Agate's assets. Again, they're high credit quality, they're mostly liquid, and they have very low duration risk due to the floating rate nature or Silvergate's usage of derivatives. Silvergate has about 15.5
00:14:22.802 - 00:14:43.542, Speaker C: billion in assets, and again, crypto lending exposure is less than 2%, and that's already over collateralized. Zooming into the asset side of the balance sheet. They have almost $2 billion in cash as of September 30. They have $1.3 billion in US. Treasuries. They've got six and a half billion in US.
00:14:43.542 - 00:15:05.998, Speaker C: Agency sponsored debt. They also have $3 billion in uni bonds. So zooming out. They're taking credit risk on the full faith and credit of the US. Government, which I have confidence will pay. On the liquidity side, we've done a stress test analysis. Crypto deposits would have to decline something like 93% in order for there to be a real issue.
00:15:05.998 - 00:15:38.406, Speaker C: And the reason why is Silvergate has access to multiple sources of funding. They can pledge eligible collateral to the FHLB. The Federal Home Loan banks. They can pledge to the Federal Reserve. Also, they can sell those liquid marketable securities we talked about into the open market and not incur an impairment. Finally, they can issue certificates of deposit, which they've done in recent weeks to address any issues around customers withdrawing. I'll conclude more on the earnings side.
00:15:38.406 - 00:16:02.110, Speaker C: So Silvergate has net income of 100 million plus in the first nine months of this year. It's a 77% growth rate, reflecting the growth rate of the category. Of course, we'd expect those earnings to come down and growth rate to slow as their funding costs improve, but they have a significant amount of fee income. They have net interest income, and that net interest income is on good creditors. So I'll pause there.
00:16:02.260 - 00:16:57.250, Speaker A: Okay, well, I think because we didn't fully get into the FTX thing, but that's probably what most people are wondering about. This is kind of, at least for me, one of the biggest questions. So obviously at this moment, and granted, like, new facts are coming out pretty much every day, but it looks like customer funds at FTX were inappropriately against the terms of service on the platform sent to the trading shop Alameda. And Mark called this out when he was talking about what his views are on. Like, I guess I was kind of wondering. So Mark, are you saying that when you're looking at the when you have concerns about its KYC AML, are you saying that somehow deficiencies in the KYC AML process at Silvergate either allowed that or somehow enabled the transfer of those funds, or are those unrelated?
00:16:57.750 - 00:17:49.210, Speaker B: Okay, that's a good question. First, I want to just take a few things that Rom said. I mean, when Rom says as of 930, that's like saying that Titanic was a great ship till it sank. 930 doesn't mean jack shit here because there was a catastrophic event in early November and the business, Silvergate's business, has absolutely imploded since 930. So 930 doesn't matter. And when Rom says asset quality, silvergate has a $1 billion impairment, some of which they've yet to run through the balance sheet holding these mortgages governments and things like that, they're $1 billion in the whole a lot of this they've yet to run through book value or the income statement. When they run this through the income statement, the losses here are going to be catastrophic.
00:17:49.210 - 00:18:33.938, Speaker B: So it doesn't matter what anyone thought of Silvergate as of 930. Right now we're at 1211 and the bank is an absolute mess. They're having to put out press releases every ten days. They're putting out updates every seven days. They're going on the Cartoon Network, which I call CNBC to sing for their supper. The CEO has had his son in law as the head of risk of the bank till November 7, his son in law, and he has numerous family members as employees. So this bank, let me make it real clear, is completely out of control and is an absolute shit show.
00:18:33.938 - 00:19:08.922, Speaker B: They do business with people who they do not do not run through proper AML and KYC protocol and the sheer amount of money that send transfers a trillion dollars. Just think of that. Everybody think of running a trillion dollars through a network that runs 24 7365 off an asset base that is well below probably $7 billion as I speak. So that is before we'll address this.
00:19:08.976 - 00:19:31.666, Speaker C: Alameda thing, quick responses, just laura, I just want to address a few things. One, and of course, Mark knows this Silvergate does have a 500 million dollar recognition of losses against certain assets on the balance sheet. Mark is saying that there's another 500 million to go. I'd love to see the documentation, the evidence of that. We could follow up on that later. I don't want to derail the interview, but that's one. They also have $1.3
00:19:31.666 - 00:19:55.606, Speaker C: billion in stockholder equity. Of course, they are well capitalized and meet their current regulatory reporting requirements. The intra quarter updates is what Mark's referring to as press releases. It's true. Banks are on a quarterly reporting cycle and Silvergate is going to the market and providing updated disclosures. We'll get another quarterly report, likely in January, but they are updating disclosures. The last thing I'll say on this is that Brigade is handicapped.
00:19:55.606 - 00:20:21.140, Speaker C: For example, it's illegal for a bank to report on suspicious activity of one of their clients. That's called a SAR or Suspicious Activity Report. You're not even going to disclose to the client that you filed a Suspicious Activity Report. You're chaired with the regulator. So there are some constraints around what Silvergate can say publicly. So there needs to be someone else like me that can do the analysis, taken in a clinical independent view on the matter.
00:20:22.070 - 00:21:00.766, Speaker B: But if in fact, they were filing suspicious claim reports on Alameda or FDX, why would they have SBF as their mean? It makes no sense. And it's the same thing with these bitrex clowns. They're using them as spokesmen till they're called out for doing illegal things, and then they pull them down. And this is short sellers calling them out, not regular souls like yourself. You had no clue what these guys were up to. You guys have no clue what was going on there. It took the skeptics unearthing this thing and calling these guys out.
00:21:00.766 - 00:21:08.318, Speaker B: And when you run a business reacting to short sellers bringing up facts about your business, you are destined to fail.
00:21:08.414 - 00:21:09.730, Speaker C: Destined to fail.
00:21:10.150 - 00:21:47.440, Speaker B: And if you look at the balance sheet, I'm not at a computer, otherwise I'd call it up. Look for securities held to maturity and securities available for sale. And given the stress that they're under, they're going to have to sell the securities held to maturity. And you said they could use that for liquidity. So they have roughly half a billion dollars of securities held to maturity that they've yet to run through the PNL or the balance sheet. And when you do that, book value goes from 1.3 to about 800 million.
00:21:47.440 - 00:22:21.020, Speaker B: So everyone thinking that it's cheap based on book value. And you should know better, Rom. Book value for banks don't matter because Nova Star, when the stock was three, folks wrote off $77 a share in book value. So book value on banks, especially distressed banks, don't matter. Lehman brothers book value didn't matter when it went under. Same thing with Bear Stearns. Don't worry about book value of a distressed situation.
00:22:21.020 - 00:22:47.534, Speaker B: And for a bank, which was a sleepy bank doing $40 million of deposits with regional mortgages all of a sudden going to Crypto, where your son in law is the head of risk, that just doesn't cut it. That just doesn't cut it. Rom, if you're running a bank, I don't think you're going to have your son in law be the head of risk. I just don't it's just a huge black eye.
00:22:47.662 - 00:22:55.490, Speaker C: There are a few things I'm going to focus clearly, they're investing in the board and they're improving the management. They have a new risk person and a CRO.
00:22:57.050 - 00:23:16.060, Speaker B: Rom, the horse has left the barn. The new risk person is as of November 7, right? As of November 7. They have Elizabeth Warren up their ass. They have a bipartisan who's also signed off with Kennedy up their ass with questions they're not going to be able to answer.
00:23:16.430 - 00:23:29.770, Speaker C: I disagree with that. Look, there's a lot of topics to unpack here. I'm trying to bob and weave through the five attacks here on Silver Gate, and I'm happy to address them all in turn, but let's add some structure and discipline.
00:23:29.850 - 00:24:06.060, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's be a little more structured. Because one thing that I did want to ask about earlier when we were talking about their KYC AML program is, Mark, when you were saying that they probably facilitated a lot of, I don't know, fraudulent transfers or something like that, I was curious, for a client, if they have a crypto exchange that is initiating the transfer of that money or a customer on that exchange, then who is kind of the ultimate stop here when it comes to regulators. Is it the compliance team at the exchange or is it the compliance team at the bank? Are they equally liable or how does that work?
00:24:07.870 - 00:24:46.358, Speaker B: But the compliance team at the know in terms of FTX and Alameda were completely crooked. I mean, if anyone doesn't think that that's a criminal operation at FTX, something's terribly wrong with you. So FTX had no compliance. Alameda had no compliance. The chief regulatory officer at FTX was a poker criminal, was a guy who cheated people in Cart. He was the chief regulatory officer. So assume there was no compliance at FTX and no compliance at Alameda, and it's come out that they commingled customer deposits as well.
00:24:46.358 - 00:25:06.238, Speaker B: So at a minimum, when forensically everything gets unwound, someone is going to have their head so far up Silvergate's ass, they're not going to be able to see. And every transaction will be scrutinized. Every transfer at the end of the day is going to get scrutinized here.
00:25:06.324 - 00:25:18.100, Speaker A: So obviously there is like 5 million investigations of FTX and Alameda. So regulators are clearly looking at that. But will regulators also probably enforce something on Silvergate? Like, that's kind of what I'm asking.
00:25:18.870 - 00:26:21.302, Speaker C: The KYC program, and then it'll just create more structure for this. So let me educate the audience here. So Silvergate has to have a BSA AML program in accordance with the US Patriot act and bank secrecy act. So there's initial and then ongoing initial mean that there's a KYC and AML program, also known as a Sip program, a customer identification program, and they'll have a various sets of activities including negative news screening. And they will subject their clients to what's called enhanced due diligence, particularly because in the crypto sector, they will take extra efforts above and beyond a bank opening up a non crypto account because of the nature and the potential for higher propensity of illicit activity. Then there's ongoing activity. So what the compliance team will do is they'll look at the nature of the customer's activities and they'll say if there's a change in behavior, just a change in behavior, then they per their policy and procedures, should issue a suspicious activity report, certainly notify their compliance team.
00:26:21.302 - 00:26:49.034, Speaker C: That suspicious activity report would go to the regulator and that's the standard framework for a BSA AML compliant program. Now the question is, were they in good standing? First of all, that's one way to look at it. Did the regulator view on silvergate change? I can say that they must have been in good standing. And here's why. First off, they bought DM, which was a stablecoin issued or intended to be issued by facebook. That requires regulatory approval. Regulators have to prove an m A transaction.
00:26:49.034 - 00:27:31.034, Speaker C: They would not approve that if they thought Silvergate's equity was at risk or that that business activity would be untoward in some way. Second, silvergate has no public consent order and they're permitted to grow their business. They've not been directed to curtail the activity. Lastly, on the regulators regulator, the FDIC has issued a non objection requirement, meaning if you're a bank that you want to be active in crypto, you have to seek non objection from the regulator. Silvergate is active in crypto, which the inference is that they've obtained regulatory approval and the regulators want to keep crypto activity within banks that they deem have the appropriate systems and controls. They don't want to spill this out to other banks. They want to keep scrutiny high.
00:27:31.034 - 00:27:50.610, Speaker C: I agree with Mark that these transactions will be scrutinized and the scrutiny will be around. Did Silvergate faithfully apply and adhere to the stated policies and procedures in accordance with law one and two? Were those policies and procedures of sufficient stringency? That's really the analysis the regulators will do on those transactions.
00:27:51.030 - 00:28:25.118, Speaker B: Your points are good, but the problem is they're as of or before 930 and the Titanic sank in November that the regulators nor no one saw coming. That's the problem. The problem is the analysis of this company is through the front window, the front windshield, rather than the rear view mirror. And everything you talk about is rear view looking. Yeah, in the past, prior to 930, they were in accordance. I cannot wait to see what they're going to report. Come 1231.
00:28:25.118 - 00:28:37.218, Speaker B: I can't wait to see what those 1231 numbers are and everyone is going to be beyond surprised of the regulatory scrutiny that's going to come down on these guys, that I can promise you.
00:28:37.304 - 00:28:51.110, Speaker C: Mark, can I ask you a question? Do you believe there was any willful neglect at Silvergate or do you believe it was assistance and controls issues? A failure to apply procedures or insufficient procedures? I'm trying to just distinguish between willful.
00:28:51.930 - 00:29:01.894, Speaker B: When the final chapter is written, alan Lane's going to say he was deceived as well. He's going to pull the benign neglect.
00:29:02.022 - 00:29:07.130, Speaker C: What's your view? Do you think that Silvergate was complicit somehow and engaged in willful?
00:29:07.550 - 00:29:11.594, Speaker B: No, I don't think they were complicit.
00:29:11.642 - 00:29:16.560, Speaker C: Okay, so it's a controls issue, it's a systems and controls policy and procedure. Yeah.
00:29:18.450 - 00:30:01.774, Speaker B: I think these guys were operating on 1990 technology, 1990 procedures. I think it's a publicly traded company that was run by a family owned bank. And I think these crypto exchange swindlers criminals took advantage of them essentially being like a drug mule. I think they found a sleepy bank that wanted to become a big time player, that thought it was going to be simple, that grew like crazy, that had zero controls. They weren't in on it. I don't think they were in on it. Now I think a couple directors are sideways and I think a couple directors are going to have just, just think about it.
00:30:01.774 - 00:30:25.778, Speaker B: Why would you have SBF as your spokesperson and then after SBF, you go to another guy who has similar issues and when it's brought up by short sellers, you decide to take that down. Now the regulators are being handed everything I've talked about, which is about 5% of what I really know and more.
00:30:25.944 - 00:30:44.026, Speaker C: So they're getting, I'm sure folks express regret. I'm sure Tom Brady has regret run SBF. This guy went from hero to villain. And to your credit, I think you were the first to identifying. So I give you all the credit in the world. Look, SBS is a fraud. It's a multi layer fraud that I have no doubt and it's through and through.
00:30:44.026 - 00:31:15.586, Speaker C: We're in full alignment around that. So what you're saying is, hey, look, it's a people at controls issue and that's a good branch of the tree because willful violations of the law have serious consequences. Now if it is not a willful violation, then it's a people controls issue. So what regulators can do is say, hey, you've got to level up your management team. They can mandate changes at the executive level. And what I'm seeing are changes at the management level and changes at the board level. We don't know if that's voluntary from the board or both, but we are seeing that.
00:31:15.586 - 00:31:42.106, Speaker C: So my take, Mark, is this is that if there are people and control issues, we should see a consent order, we should see a curtailment activity, but we're not going to see some kind of catastrophic claim on the bank from the regulators. The. Regulators need points of control that they can govern oversight and that today is Silvergate. Because Silvergate is the leading crypto bank. They don't want those transactions to go anywhere else.
00:31:42.288 - 00:32:29.158, Speaker B: What's going to happen? I think if I'm going to write the final chapter, the government is not going to want the transactions to go anywhere offshore. So this stuff is going to be curtailed and ended. The on and off ramps in my mind are going to get blown up, just completely blown up from as people know them today and new laws are going to be put in where people are going to have to comply. But the problem is it's not going to be the FDIC OIG per se which shuts them down. Their business will be curtailed significantly so the company will have zero earning power. Because if you're borrowing at I mean the joke of the matter is Silvergate's deposits pay zero interest. They don't pay interest on their deposits.
00:32:29.158 - 00:32:36.942, Speaker B: So the fact that they're going to have to pay 450 on CDs to get liquidity, the bank's never going to earn a dime again or very little.
00:32:36.996 - 00:33:03.794, Speaker C: Right. So I agree short term there's an earnings impact. Look again, I was at Cross River and during PPP we need liquidity to fund the working capital of these loans. We took out a CD at a very high rate. Then that CD rolled off and we started making a lot of money again. So Silvergate is taking the appropriate action which is to issue a CD which creates term funding for them I agree as a near term impact to earning. However, the present value, the intrinsic value of a security is not based on next year's earning.
00:33:03.794 - 00:33:15.450, Speaker C: As you know. It's based on the overall long duration of cash flows. But I think we're focusing on the key elements. It's around what's the regulatory response, what's the probability and severity of the regulatory response?
00:33:17.390 - 00:33:49.458, Speaker B: And then what I think you're going to get, Laura, in the not too distant future, I think Alan Lane, the CEO, is either going to resign or put on leave for an internal investigation to begin to figure out why these guys were so sleeping at the switch in who they were doing business with. I think Rom and I agree, these guys, they weren't willfully involved, they weren't willfully in on it per se. But what's worse, being willfully in on it or being sleeping at the switch if you're a bank?
00:33:49.554 - 00:34:42.530, Speaker A: I love this back and forth, but I feel like we need to also discuss certain core issues that I just want to make sure we address and that the audience understands.

Back to my conversation with Mark and Rom.
00:36:25.682 - 00:36:44.240, Speaker A: So I did ask this earlier, we didn't really address it, but you know, for that core issue of FTX having transferred customer funds over to Alameda, is that going to be something that the regulators will view Silvergate as having some responsibility for or? No.
00:36:44.610 - 00:36:53.198, Speaker B: 100% and they're going to go through every single transaction and say why did this happen and why did you let it go through?
00:36:53.284 - 00:37:13.298, Speaker A: But I have a question, because isn't at least I would imagine the vast majority of that money is crypto assets which Silvergate wouldn't have visibility into. Except for the other part of it though is when Sam said that FTFs didn't have a bank account for a while and during that period customers were sending funds straight to Alameda.
00:37:13.314 - 00:37:43.614, Speaker C: So maybe that's those are USD transfers because Silvergate by law cannot have crypto on its balance sheet, can custody crypto and it does that through its agent Silvergate. Look, this is a matter of law. This I can be very clear on. What the regulators will look at is this one did Silvergate have an effective bank secrecy act any money laundering egbsaml program? One, did they have an effective policy and procedure framework? Second, did they apply it? If they did those two things, if it was effective and they applied it, you still have bad actors in the banking system. Right.
00:37:43.652 - 00:37:50.766, Speaker A: But would any of that have any bearing on that issue of the FTX customer funds?
00:37:50.958 - 00:38:33.938, Speaker C: It does. Because if you had a transaction with Alameda, let's say, which is your point, or FTX, and FTX is a bad actor. So long as the Bsaml program was effective. Meaning it was robust, it was stringent and they were carrying out what they said they're supposed to be doing, then the severity, if any, of an enforcement should be liked, if the program was ineffective and they did not have oversight, and they were not looking at if they were not engaged in following SARS, if they were not looking at suspicious activity, if they weren't tying out the sender of state information, then Mark has a point around potential enforcement actions. And we don't know that. To be honest. We need to see evidence of that.
00:38:33.938 - 00:38:36.034, Speaker C: I've not seen any evidence of that.
00:38:36.232 - 00:39:36.082, Speaker B: I think to your point, Laura, the amount that was going from Alameda through FTX, through Silvergate, back and forth, the numbers are so large they are going to get scrutinized because the regulators were completely sleeping at the switch along with Alan Lang. I mean, this is a sign of why the son in law was removed for the head of risk. They realized they had a problem and they said, we have to make a change on November 7. It's all after the horse is out of the barn. But the problem for Silvergate is it's not only FTX, it says Bittrex and I've identified, but have yet to come public with it. At least three more. So I think that when you find one you can say bad luck, two, it's no longer bad luck or a coincidence.
00:39:36.082 - 00:39:47.318, Speaker B: Three becomes a trend. And more than three, you have a major problem. And I'm here to say these guys have a major fucking problem. Major problem.
00:39:47.404 - 00:40:20.626, Speaker A: So one thing that I just want to understand is for the situation with FTX and Alameda, when FTX transferred the customer funds to Alameda, that's against their terms of FTX's own terms of service. So that's kind of what that violation was. So I just want to cause, like we're, we're talking about the AML and KYC program at Silvergate, but is that kind of situation where the violation is against the terms of service with the AML KYC processes have any relevance with that? Do you understand how in my mind.
00:40:20.808 - 00:41:10.546, Speaker B: I understand what you're saying. I'll simply say if there was no Sen network, if there was no Sen network, there would be no FTX or Alameda. They wouldn't exist. Okay? The crimes at Alameda and FTX would not have existed had Silvergate not been in this business. So the problem is going to be if you're a depositor to FTX, right, and your money is gone as part of all the lawsuits. Silvergate is going to be a defendant as sure as I'm sitting here, because Silvergate was and were and are the pipes where this stuff goes through. It's not going to be a term of service thing.
00:41:10.546 - 00:41:44.174, Speaker B: Your money is gone, your money is gone, it's stolen, it's gone, you'll never get it back or you may get cents on the dollar back, okay? But in things like this, the lawyers or your class action lawyer and other lawyers are going to go after everyone where that money could have gone through, touched or appeared. I mean, look at all the Madoff stuff. I mean, JP morgan I think, paid two and a half billion dollars in the Madoff thing and they didn't even touch the money.
00:41:44.372 - 00:43:10.010, Speaker A: Okay, so I just want to break it out for the audience because as we identified, there's at least some portion of that money that's going to be crypto assets that Silvergate probably didn't have any visibility into because that was just FTX and Alameda sending that on blockchain networks. And I don't remember if we described what send is for people, but I'll just quickly do that to make sure the audience fully understands it's the Silvergate Exchange network. And that gave clients the ability to move dollars between each other pretty much instantaneously to settle the fiat side of any of their crypto transactions basically immediately, which obviously for anybody who's navigated that difference between bank time and crypto time, bank time often can be like days or whatever versus crypto time, which is seconds or minutes. So obviously that's a huge advantage. That network also enables customers to deposit money from a bank onto a crypto exchange as long as both the customer and the exchange banked with Silvergate and to move that money. So Mark, just to understand when you say that FTX and Alameda would not have been able to do this without Sten, that's for the fiat portion of whatever funds that moved. So are you talking about how Sam Bankman Fried said that initially customers were wiring or FTS customers were wiring money directly to Alameda? Is that where they're culpable?
00:43:10.350 - 00:43:46.770, Speaker B: SBF has said, and I've put it on my Twitter and I can send a copy to you, he said prior to the Silvergate network, this couldn't have no, banks wouldn't touch them. Banks would not touch them as it was. That's why they had to call it Alameda Research. And they said before Silvergate existed, these crypto exchanges couldn't have mean just flat. And Alan Lane foolishly used SBF as a sponsor and foolishly, he uses this Bitrex guy.
00:43:46.920 - 00:44:02.406, Speaker C: It's not a crime. It's not a crime. Yeah, it's foolish. I'm sure they have hindsight 2020, but I'm trying to focus on claims to stockholder equity. I'm sure they regret it, but we should move off the whole getting the bad spokesperson point. I don't think it advances the conversation.
00:44:02.438 - 00:44:37.800, Speaker B: Well, it's going to turn out to be a big deal as it relates to those suspicious reports that you talked about, because I don't think you're filing suspicious reports against someone's entity and still going to have that person as a spokesman. And if they didn't file suspicious reports on Alameda or FTX or Bittrex or these other criminals who they do business. I mean, they do business, Silvergate, make no mistake. And I think you'll admit this, criminals use the Send network. Do you disagree with that?
00:44:38.250 - 00:44:55.770, Speaker C: I believe criminals will seek to utilize crypto exchanges to attempt to launder that's not what I'm getting. I don't think it's relevant, Mark. I think the question is, do they have an effective Bsaml program? Was it applied or not? That's what the regulators will look at.
00:44:55.920 - 00:45:19.886, Speaker B: That'S on the regulatory standpoint, and I think they'll be guilty of that. But on the court of law standpoint, court of public opinion standpoint, if you were someone who lost money in FTX or Alameda and you're covered in these multi billion dollar suits, I know at your core you realize the heat that's going to come at Silvergate.
00:45:19.918 - 00:45:51.882, Speaker C: So the two points that Mark is raising here, which are novel, haven't introduced yet, one is, hey, lawsuits. So the case with JPMorgan, you raise it's a great point. You say, look, they got a $1.7 billion fine on January 17, 2014, because despite their asset manager saying that Madoff wasn't suitable for investment and they suspected fraud, they enable funding to take place. So that's Mark's one of his observations. I'm saying it's not relevant here's why JP morgan is an asset manager. They have a duty of care.
00:45:51.882 - 00:46:32.542, Speaker C: They were acting in a very different capacity than Silvergate, which is providing money transmission service between institutions where their system of controls related to KYC and AML. So it's a different framework and not fiduciary it's. Further, in order to file a claim of suit against Silvergate, you got to have standing. If you're a client of FTX and you lost money, yes, you can file a frivolous lawsuit against Silvergate, but there's no standing or legal basis for that claim to go anywhere. In fact, I've studied the two class actions out there that were issued. They don't even have a plaintiff yet. And the complaint cites this Twitter thread from anonymous person and an allegation, which isn't evidence.
00:46:32.542 - 00:46:44.778, Speaker C: And it's a house of cards built on this one Twitter thread, including the Elizabeth Warren letter, which references that. I'm sure we'll come back to that, but there's no evidence nor standing for plaintiffs to seek remedy from Silvergate.
00:46:44.874 - 00:47:42.782, Speaker A: Okay, so I want to ask about this because I'm not sure that this is the class action lawsuit that you're referencing, but I'm just going to quote the portion that I think is interesting. So this complaint alleges that Silvergate was complicit in and responsible for some of these fraudulent losses through the bank's violation of Ky and AML obligations, and knowingly or negligently permitted FTX to direct customer deposits to Alameda Research, which is this hedge fund that is not supposed to be related to FTX. So I was wondering, is it Silvergate's responsibility to have recognized that those transactions shouldn't have happened? That FTX customers should not have been wiring money into Alameda? Because it seems somebody, whether at FTX or Alameda or somewhere, should have recognized this should not be happening. But could it be someone at Silvergate that should have recognized that?
00:47:42.836 - 00:48:30.634, Speaker C: It's a different question. Again, I'm going from the regulatory perspective and the law perspective. Again, as an operator, I had to know the law, right? So the regulator will say, silvergate, did you apply your Bsaml program? Did you monitor persist activity? If you saw activity, did you report it and did you investigate further? The regulator will ask, did Silvergate have a reasonable basis in enabling those transactions? If they had a reasonable basis and they complied and they did whatever investigations they did, they did, then Silvergate has low risk. If, however, Silvergate did not apply the procedures, that's negligence. Or if they saw something suspicious and they didn't report it, that's an issue. So that's really where this debate turns on. And I haven't seen evidence of negligence.
00:48:30.634 - 00:48:37.822, Speaker C: What I've seen is evidence that they're in good standing and that's why the regulars let them grow their business. That's why they're able to acquire the DM stablecoin.
00:48:37.966 - 00:48:39.870, Speaker A: But why isn't that negligent?
00:48:40.030 - 00:48:44.660, Speaker B: This is all prior to 930. I mean, 930 doesn't matter.
00:48:49.590 - 00:49:40.610, Speaker C: I like your 930 point. And look, I agree the regulators are examining let me just have one other kind of story to make this very clear. The FDIC examination teams, they have the rights to inspect all sorts of data, look at anything they want, any policy and procedure, email correspondent, it's not easy being a bank. They were scrutinized well before 930 is my point. They were of course on site or virtually on teams looking at data. And Michael Sue, the acting counsel of the currency, which is the most senior official, the bank regulators, again, he issued a requirement requiring non objection from the primary regulator. So what I'm saying, Mark, is I agree, your point, 930 can't wait to year end, and we are speculating here, but the regulators are already all over this because they already have a heightened sensitivity to the risk of illicit activity on cryptocurrency transactions.
00:49:40.610 - 00:49:51.626, Speaker C: They're focusing on Bsaml, they're looking at those transaction documents, they're looking at the back and forth, the client, they're looking at the Sip program and the raw data even before 930 at a granular level.
00:49:51.808 - 00:50:03.986, Speaker A: But wait, and Ron, why is it that you said that the regulators wouldn't deem Silvergate allowing FTX customers to wire funds to Alameda as negligence?
00:50:04.118 - 00:50:23.842, Speaker C: They're not regulated as an asset manager. An asset manager is a fiduciary. They have a duty of care to and JP. Morgan said, we think this is a fraud. Apparently this is my understanding of the story and yet they let a wire go into an actor that they perceived as fraudulent. Silvergate is regulated as a bank. It has to comply with, of course, law.
00:50:23.842 - 00:50:50.198, Speaker C: And the relevant laws are what we've described. The BSA AML program reporting of suspicious activity. Money transmission law. They're not a fiduciary to LP. So a 16 Z cannot sue Silvergate or outstanding because they lost money in FTX because FTX was a fraud. That would be the JPMorgan analogy. If JPMorgan said FTX is a fraud and JPMorgan processed a wire for a 16 C, you could argue they have standing.
00:50:50.198 - 00:50:55.790, Speaker C: But Silvergate is not an asset manager. They don't have that duty of care as it relates to investment management.
00:50:56.370 - 00:51:25.480, Speaker B: Laura, if it turns out that Silvergate was negligent in any of the things Rom talked know, it's essentially over for the bank because that opens the doors for all the lawsuits because Suspicious Activity reports weren't filed and they didn't do anything to stop it. And he was well aware of the SBF promote of saying how easy it was to do business with Silvergate and no one else other than Silvergate would have banked them.
00:51:26.250 - 00:51:28.834, Speaker C: How do you know they weren't filed, Mark? They're confidential and private.
00:51:28.882 - 00:51:39.306, Speaker B: The SARS because if they were filed, right, if I was filing suspicious activity reports on you, I'm not a Harvard or a Yale guy or anything like.
00:51:39.328 - 00:51:41.050, Speaker C: That, you're saying you would take the name off the site?
00:51:41.120 - 00:51:42.886, Speaker B: That's the big for sure.
00:51:42.928 - 00:51:50.030, Speaker C: And now the other part is, again, the fact that FTX is a fraud, which I'm in complete agreement with you, that guy got to go to jail.
00:51:51.970 - 00:52:08.118, Speaker B: No, it's not only a fraud, it's a criminal operation. And the question is, the real question where I think it's going to turn is what role did Dan Freeberg have in all of this? Along with SBF, right?
00:52:08.204 - 00:52:31.994, Speaker C: I'd love to get there too, Mark, and I'll say this. The fraud at FTX, among others, stealth dealing, all the rest was misuse of customer funds. But that activity takes outside Silvergate and the cent network. It takes place at FTX. Between FTX and Alameda. Meaning the mere fact that FTX is a fraud is not indicative that there would be transactional data that and criminals.
00:52:32.042 - 00:52:38.160, Speaker B: Use the send network to transfer up to a trillion dollars. A trillion dollars.
00:52:38.610 - 00:52:40.910, Speaker C: They facilitate the movement of stablecoins.
00:52:43.570 - 00:53:19.180, Speaker B: It will not matter at all. We're not talking about Morgan and we're not talking about a too big to fail bank. We're talking about a bail. A bank run by an absolute clown. Alan Lane is a clown. He at best at best is a C minus manager who is foolish enough when he's on the Cartoon Network to put religious motif in the background and have his son I mean, come on, rom, would you have your son in law as the head of risk of any institution you would run?
00:53:20.030 - 00:53:52.338, Speaker C: I'm not under public scrutiny, but I will say rom. Answer the question mark. I'll answer the question. I'll say, look, the vast majority of small community banks, which is how Silver gets started, is Community Bank San Diego the primary predictor of whether bank gets acquired is if the CEO retires, because usually they hand it to their son, their family, intergenerational businesses. But you're right, it was a sleepy bank that grew up. It benefited from the tremendous growth in crypto. I acknowledge that that was a driver of their growth.
00:53:52.434 - 00:54:32.740, Speaker B: And the only thing I'll say, Laura, is when you're a financial institution like Silvergate, a sleepy this is where we all agree, right? A sleepy bank with 40 million in deposits and you grow to 15 billion in a couple of years, you tend to lose control if you're on top of it. If you're not on top of it and your systems aren't up to speed and your largest customer is a criminal in a criminal organization, and I can find others like it, which I haven't even come with yet, it's going to be a major problem.
00:54:33.990 - 00:54:42.726, Speaker C: They've upgraded management, and the son in laws know they're working in that capacity. So I'm just acknowledging they're remedying issues around people and controls. Yeah.
00:54:42.748 - 00:55:39.514, Speaker A: Okay, but so I want to just have you kind of each play out your scenarios here because we have the letter from Senator Elizabeth Warren and two other senators, John Kennedy and Roger Marshall, to Silvergate saying your bank's involvement in the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank's responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients. I don't know where that query could go, but I was wondering, Mark, what do you think are the regulatory actions that might be on the horizon and how would that affect the bank? Because I'm not some expert on the traditional financial world, but I've seen so many banks get, like, big fines, and then they just keep, you know are you saying that you think silvergate will go under, or will it have to pivot out of crypto the way it looks like Signature might be doing? Or what's your vision of where you think things land up?
00:55:39.552 - 00:56:10.802, Speaker B: Well, they have to answer Senator Warren's questions by, I think, December 19. So that's going to be very interesting, what they come up with. I think their business right now is an absolute free fall, and they still have other customers who are under significant stress who may go bankrupt or fail. I'm not a crypto guy. I've never been a crypto guy. I've always said I'm not a crypto guy. And we've yet to see the bottom of any of this stuff.
00:56:10.802 - 00:57:01.502, Speaker B: So who knows where their business is going to bottom out? But as it stands right now, they're not making any money. They're probably losing money given what their funding has done and their new cost of funding. So they have to answer Warren. I think other regulators are going to start kicking things around, and I think things are going to end very badly because as more truth comes out to what went on, these guys ROM's a good guy, he's a solid guy, and he's admitting they had to make changes and did make changes. But when you make changes at the senior levels, like had a risk, that's a sign that there was a major problem. That's sort of an admission that there was an issue. Now so much money went through their network and their wires.
00:57:01.502 - 00:57:45.590, Speaker B: This is a company that is only capped at $700 million. This is not a too big to fail bank. This bank could go under, which I think it will. I think the bank will fail or will get seized. And when it happens again, this is not Morgan or bank of America or City or Wells, which is too big to fail, then the rules of the road will change and it won't be so simple to move a trillion dollars, 24, 7365. It'll be regulated on who can move the money through that network. And it's going to be a trust, but verified.
00:57:45.590 - 00:57:59.166, Speaker B: And I think the trust was there, but the verify was never there. They never realized that all this money moving from Alameda through FTX, through Sen, and through other guys was untoward.
00:57:59.278 - 00:58:08.726, Speaker A: The last bit was we mentioned this class action lawsuit, which Rom said he felt the plaintiffs had no standing. Do you think there's merit in it? And if so, where do you think that might go?
00:58:08.908 - 00:58:44.194, Speaker B: That's not the class action lawsuit that's going to get them. The lawsuits that's going to get them is they're going to be named in everyone who lost a dime at FTX. They're going to be a defendant in that. Whether they can get themselves thrown out of that, we'll see. But if they were negligent in any of those tests that Rom talked about, rightly, talked about, the bank will close because negligence is not know. Being in on it is not okay. But being negligent is not okay.
00:58:44.194 - 00:59:06.220, Speaker B: And there are former employees who've reached out to me through my DMs and other means where the picture they paint is so bad, is so bad, it's downright scary. And I forwarded those things off to the regulators who I'm in close contact with, and I just give them everything.
00:59:06.590 - 00:59:12.394, Speaker C: I got to respond to the Warren question and then whether regulators will allow this bank to fail or not. And the negligence point.
00:59:12.512 - 00:59:15.614, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to ask you how you think things will play out.
00:59:15.732 - 00:59:42.386, Speaker C: Let me go through that. So first off, that Warren letter simply restates the allegations from an anonymous Tweet thread, and it doesn't actually add any new information. It says Silvergate appears to be at the center of improper transfers. Well, of course, a leading crypto bank is that it could constitute violations of law. This is just restating known law and known facts. I will also say Elizabeth Warren on that day, published three other letters. She's written more letters this month than there are business days in December.
00:59:42.386 - 01:00:21.394, Speaker C: She wrote a letter against Wells Fargo. Last month, I spoke to a short seller who said they had a hand in writing the letter. So this looks to me like an organized bear raid. And what Elizabeth Warren's letter did is it added the veneer of legitimacy by wrapping her good name around this anonymous Tweet thread that has these highlighted documents and drawings that are looking nefarious. So, again, there's no evidence they're allegations. Now let me talk to bank failing. Regulators view it as a failure on that part.
01:00:21.394 - 01:01:06.974, Speaker C: If a bank fails on their watch, why is that? Because the regulators need to preserve the public's perception of the safety and soundness of the banking system. They will go through great lengths to take steps to avoid a bank failure, including a letter that's sent in advance, corrective Actions memorandums, understanding Consent orders. And if they truly feel that there's a risk, then they'll invite other banks to auction off assets and liabilities. And Silvergate's assets exceed the liabilities. Even if you take in Mark's worst case, write down. So the depositors are not at risk here. And the regulators, again, we agree, seems like as of 930, silvergate was in good standing.
01:01:06.974 - 01:01:29.910, Speaker C: You don't go from good standing to we're going to take your bank out in a few months. There's a remediation process. There's a cure process. Lastly, on negligence, so we're talking about the severity of negligence and whether is negligence or not. I have not seen evidence of that. Mark is alleging he's seen evidence of that. Look, there are other trust banks in the crypto ecosystem that have received consent orders.
01:01:29.910 - 01:02:30.090, Speaker C: Okay? Anchorage received a consent and just to find consent order. So a consent order is a corrective action from the regulator, which must be obeyed by the bank on pain of further penalties, which could include management expulsion and loss of the charter. They're serious. And so in the other consent order, what was required is that customers are re KYC'd, they hire a new BSA AML leader, and their containments on growth, that was the consequence of some deficiency in the Bsaml program. And under the Administrative Procedures Act law, the regulators are required to treat like circumstances in like manners. So supposing there's a deficiency in Bsaml for which I haven't seen evidence, then what we should expect is something like a consent order with a similar treatment and consequence for Silvergate.
01:02:30.610 - 01:02:54.674, Speaker A: Okay, so you guys have both laid out great arguments. I'm not in a position to pass judgment, but I sort of feel like both of you have strong arguments. But I'm very curious for both of you, what new information would you have to learn to change your position on? Like, what if you found out something? What would make you.
01:02:54.712 - 01:02:57.540, Speaker C: Change your mind, mark is going to stay committed to this position.
01:02:58.090 - 01:03:06.760, Speaker A: No, he may not. He looks like he's thinking. And by the way, Rom, I meant to ask you because Mark disclosed earlier that he short Silvergate. Are you?
01:03:07.210 - 01:03:20.026, Speaker C: Good question. I did put a long position on last week. We don't have a view at Lumida yet, although we have a cracked heap of analysts working this. My wife will agree with Mark that my head's probably on backwards, although she says that every other day of the.
01:03:20.048 - 01:03:26.522, Speaker A: Week, so okay, well, people it's good for people to know you both have a vested interest in your arguments.
01:03:26.666 - 01:04:06.618, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm not short of opinions. I mean, I would have shorted FTX if I could, you know, I couldn't have. So I still spoke out to try to help people out, and I think I'd helped a lot of people out, so that's good. I don't know. For me to change my mind on Silvergate, I'd need time. I'd need time to see things play out, to see they aren't as nefarious as I think, need to see more evidence. But the problem is people are talking, and there was an Ft article out, and former employees talked to the Ft person, and they're talking to me, and the procedures and how they go about doing business.
01:04:06.618 - 01:04:53.450, Speaker B: And there were limits to what people could move on the Send network, but when things got volatile, they could go and complain they need to move more, and they weren't supposed to, and they up people's limits. I mean, the bank is just completely and utterly out of control. Whether or not it rises to the level of the government seizing it, we'll see. But at a minimum, and I think I'm curious on ROM's sake, these guys aren't going to earn any money, so they're going to start losing money probably in a big way shortly. And from an earnings standpoint, the stock is way overvalued. From an equity standpoint, the book value is not 35, it's somewhere close to 20, and that's not going to matter. And I think they have huge problems.
01:04:53.450 - 01:05:18.420, Speaker B: I think Alan Lane is as good as gone on leave. I think they're going to have to have an internal investigation. And a lot of times with these things, what you need is time. And I'm in no hurry to cover, none whatsoever. I did more last week. I shorted more because I think this thing is very sick. So if we pick this up three months from now, I think there'll be more information.
01:05:18.420 - 01:05:43.234, Speaker B: And I'll either say I feel better about my position or I feel worse and I'm gone. And I'm an active tweeter. I tweet about this thing all the time. And something else, Rom, that should bother you greatly is whenever companies in my history blame short sellers or social media for their problems, it's a very negative.
01:05:43.282 - 01:05:47.034, Speaker C: Sign, a very I generally agree with that statement. By the way.
01:05:47.072 - 01:05:56.974, Speaker B: Yeah. And the fact that they put it in an eight k in an SEC document means they're going to have to be held to just the optics here.
01:05:57.012 - 01:06:02.894, Speaker A: Are very, you know, I want you to answer what information would make you change your mind?
01:06:02.932 - 01:06:14.014, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Evidence. Evidence would change my mind. Hard data. And I'm looking forward to a few catalysts. I'm looking forward to intra company reporting, intra quarter reporting. I'm looking to quarter end financials.
01:06:14.014 - 01:06:37.050, Speaker C: I'm looking for additional AK. I see the short interest is at 40%. Now, the stock has moved down from the shift from short interest going from 20% to 40%. So every short has to cover at some point its future demand on that side of things. So that's what I would look for. I agree with Mark that short term earnings will be challenged for their funding higher. That's not the main driver of valuation.
01:06:37.050 - 01:07:06.610, Speaker C: Banks in general are valued at a price to book ratio that oscillates around one. It's higher if you grow more quickly, it's lower if you have a lower business. The price to book ratio is around 0.5. Even if you accept Mark's argument around the write down, which I haven't seen evidence for, on that basis, you could say Silvergate is still fairly valued and growing at an above average industry growth rate. If that write down isn't there, Mark, please send that to me. I would love to just study it clinically, independently.
01:07:07.110 - 01:07:20.854, Speaker B: DM me your email, I'll send it to you. But they're not growing Rom, they're going to be declining huge in 23. Huge. The numbers are coming way down.
01:07:21.052 - 01:07:53.634, Speaker C: Right, one last point on the and you're right. Look, crypto sector is going to grow slower, so I'm not surprised to see lower growth. I just think that they have a competitive advantage because the regulators are not going to allow other banks to get in their business. So there are not many ports of call for crypto firm with your depositors. We saw Falcon X leave the program and then come back to the program within a week. Silvergate uses APIs to enable exchanges to move money and they have hooks into these businesses, so I think it's sticky. I don't think Coinbase or other leading exchanges are going to move away from them.
01:07:53.634 - 01:08:25.194, Speaker C: They're long. Silvergate doesn't mean they have to be long. The stock they're along the business model. Silvergate's indispensable to the functioning of the crypto exchanges, which appears to be I think we're in agreement around that. Just but lastly on the short point, look, shorts play a valuable role in calling up fraud like Muddy Waters in China and Carrisdale and shorts over the last, I guess, ten years or so. And Mark, you know this better than me, you're a legend. Have evolved from identifying malfeasance to really doing more event driven short selling.
01:08:25.194 - 01:08:49.586, Speaker C: Meaning there's like a campaign, there's a class action here's, a tweet, there's an aggressive marketing. And that's what I see here. I see a tweet with no evidence, number one. I see Senator Warren wrapping her esteemed reputation around this tweet. I see two class action lawsuits that don't have a plaintiff, a standing or a basis, and I see remedial action from Silvergate. They're taking efforts. They issued a CD.
01:08:49.586 - 01:09:19.374, Speaker C: That's what they're supposed to do. They're improving and upgrading the board and management, and they are issuing disclosures intra quarter where they can in a manner that has to comply with law. Again, they can't talk about suspicious activity that itself could violate the law. If price to book for Silvergate goes back to one or 1.2 in a two to three year time frame, which is my outlook, then you've got like a two X here. But I agree. Look, the next year we got away from our data, and I go back to your point on JPMorgan, Mark.
01:09:19.374 - 01:09:47.634, Speaker C: So again, in January 17 of 2014, when they got a $1.7 billion fine for the made off enabling that wire transfer, which again, is not a relevant case here, their stock essentially went flat for the next nine months. It wrapped up the year up 10%. If you had bought JPMorgan on January 14, held it to today, that's eight years later you'd be up 290%. That's a three extra term. That's a venture capital outcome. I'm not saying that's never going to happen here.
01:09:47.634 - 01:10:02.766, Speaker C: All I'm saying is dislocations, create opportunity to study, focus, dial in, analyze, assess the assets and the liabilities of solvency liquidity capital requirement, competitive advantage, and develop a point of view. And I enjoy the back and forth here.
01:10:02.788 - 01:10:11.150, Speaker B: Mark, around this yeah, all's good. I'll just say alan Lane is not Jamie Diamond. Alan Lane is a fucking clown.
01:10:12.530 - 01:10:17.598, Speaker C: You hold it to an impossible stance. Silver Gate is a sub $1 billion community bank.
01:10:17.774 - 01:10:25.058, Speaker B: But I'm just saying if Silvergate disappears tomorrow, no one will miss them. No one. No one will miss.
01:10:25.224 - 01:11:03.982, Speaker A: All right, well, this is, I think, a great place to end it. There's just a lot of good points on both sides. I mean, super fascinating discussion, and I think it's one that a lot of at least crypto business owners will be interested in, because I think a lot of them probably bank with Silvergate and a lot of exchange customers will be affected if anything happens to them. So we're going to have to see what happens. Obviously, there's going to be a lot of eyes on what they say December 19, et cetera. But I just loved having both of your insights. So before we wrap, why don't each of you tell people where they can learn more about you and your work?
01:11:04.116 - 01:11:35.894, Speaker B: Well, first of all, I think ROM's a good guy. We can agree to disagree, but I enjoyed this thoroughly and I want to thank you for having essentially, I'm a Twitter guy. I'm at Alder Lane Eggs. I'm prolific on Twitter and that's where you can follow me or find out how I'm thinking and I'm not afraid of much, so I just kind of speak from the mind and the heart and I appreciate having me and it was nice getting to know you, Ron.
01:11:36.022 - 01:12:05.838, Speaker C: Likewise, Mark. And again, thank you for the kind words and I think again, you're credible and I appreciate the back and forth. We agree to disagree on this point here. First off, anything I've said here is not financial advice, it's not officially limited position. You should talk to your advisor. And by the way, if you do want to get long the stock, there are better opportunities such as selling an in the money put because the implied volatility is so high that you can reduce your cost basis. Or perhaps going along the preferred stock, which is seeing the capital structure, you get a twelve to 13% yield.
01:12:05.838 - 01:12:26.166, Speaker C: So there are different opportunities. Feel free to reach out to Lumida at Lumida co you can find me at Twitter at just briefly closing argument. Zen is critical market infrastructure. Coinbase, the other exchanges need them. They have benefit from a network effect. They have a dominant leading position in the sector. They're not easy to replace.
01:12:26.166 - 01:13:00.134, Speaker C: They have integrations through APIs. They're one of the only games in town. Switching costs are very high. Mark's main point is that there are these liabilities that are unknown around enforcement and clash actions. We disagree on the probability and severity of those actions as well as this kind of balance sheet impact, which I will study more closely and we'll follow up with Mark around that. So they have ample capital, they've got ample liquidity, they're improving board, they're improving management, they're funding through CDs. I think the bull case is that creates a near term dislocation opportunity.
01:13:00.134 - 01:13:21.482, Speaker C: Silvergate's traded down in lockstep with Coinbase fundamentally different business models. Coinbase is procyclical, they make money on transaction fees. Silvergate has recurring revenue, eight to $9 million in fee income, plus they're generating net interest income with zero credit losses on the crypto book and US credit risk from the US government.
01:13:21.536 - 01:13:52.098, Speaker A: So I'll wrap up think, I mean, we've gone through just so many arguments on both sides. Both of you just make such good points. So I think we're going to have to see how things play out from here on out. But I'm glad the audience now kind of understands the issues and I have a know many listeners were not aware just how crucial silvergate was to the crypto. You know, it's important to see what happens there. But thank you both again. It has been such a pleasure having you both on Unchained.
01:13:52.274 - 01:13:54.566, Speaker C: Thank you both. Thank you, Laura. Thank you, Mark.
01:13:54.748 - 01:14:21.500, Speaker A: Thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about Silvergate, Mark and Rom check out the show notes for this episode.
