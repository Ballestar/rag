And when we have those kinds of AIS and they're still far away, I think to have them realistically beyond just like video game environments, when we have those kinds of AIS, I think those AIS are going to want to solve problems that involve shared resources and we know how to solve problems that involve shared resources. We use money. Money is the way that we negotiate access to shared resources. Whether it's a message bus, whether it's turning into a lane, whether it's asking somebody to do something for you that's easier for them than it is for you. The way we solve all those problems, a huge category of problems is with money. And so AIS are going to want to use money, but they're not going to be able to use fiat money because Chase is not going to open a bank account for an AI.
00:00:53.642 - 00:00:57.740, Speaker A: They won't even open a bank account for a crypto startup, so they're definitely not going to do one for an AI. But.
