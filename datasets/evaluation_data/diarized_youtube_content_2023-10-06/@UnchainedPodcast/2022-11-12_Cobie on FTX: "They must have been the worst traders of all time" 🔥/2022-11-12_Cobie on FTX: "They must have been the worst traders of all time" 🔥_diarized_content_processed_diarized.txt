And part of the reason I would say this I would have never have guessed they were insolvent is they sort of had the game rigged in their favor, right? So they were able to do these things with these markets that allow them an advantage over any other market participant, such that they should just be printing so much money all of the time. Like, they had the exchange, they owned the venue, they had all the data for people's positions on the venue, they had markets that they wanted to hedge their own positions, like were off venue, and somehow they still managed to lose $10 billion. Does it make sense? They must have been the worst traders of all time.
