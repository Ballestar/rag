00:01:35.190 - 00:01:36.780, Speaker B: Hey, Laura. How's it going?
00:01:37.470 - 00:01:43.500, Speaker A: This week, Compound distributed its governance token, which generated a lot of buzz. How did they do?
00:01:45.470 - 00:02:03.700, Speaker B: You know, they've been planning this for a while and essentially they've set up a distribution where the people who use the protocol get the tokens right. So people who are lending and borrowing on the platform receive comp tokens as an incentive to utilize the platform.
00:02:04.710 - 00:02:13.320, Speaker A: And so that seems pretty straightforward. But after it launched, a lot of people were talking about it. Why? What happened?
00:02:14.010 - 00:03:02.118, Speaker B: I think there was a bit of surprise in terms of the overall market cap that was kind of achieved at that point. So they initially put a distribution, someone from within the team or someone who's close to the team, put a distribution of tokens onto Uniswap and those tokens were immediately bought up and pushed the price up to a little over $100. The price then over the next sort of two to three days, as people were earning comp and selling it down into the market, dropped down to about $60. But then this morning when I've woken up to do this interview, I've noticed that it's been announced that it's going to be listed on coinbase and now the price is up at about $170. So I expect that there's going to be even more craziness over the next week or two as that kind of plays out.
00:03:02.284 - 00:03:19.530, Speaker A: Yeah, and I saw that people were saying it almost feels it's like a little bit reminiscent of the ICO craze because the amount of ether locked up in it is, I think, maybe about 300 million. But the market cap now is definitely over a billion.
00:03:21.470 - 00:03:25.486, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. It's interesting the dynamics at play, for sure.
00:03:25.588 - 00:03:31.840, Speaker A: And you said you hadn't foreseen it playing out like this. What did you think going into it and what did you get wrong?
00:03:33.170 - 00:04:18.906, Speaker B: I thought that it would do fairly well. Right. I thought the token market cap would be in the kind of range of like 200 to 500 million initially right. Which would be $20 to $50. So the fact that it was double to five times higher than that range at the low end of the range was pretty surprising to me. And I think that was partially due to the fact that there's not much liquidity because people are just starting to earn the token. But I think the big difference in this distribution versus, say, ICOs back in the day is that it wasn't just a bunch of tokens sold to people who were supposedly going to use the protocol, it was tokens that were only essentially distributed to people who were using the protocol.
00:04:18.906 - 00:04:31.330, Speaker B: And then there was a little bit of liquidity put on uniswap. So the price discovery is still going on at the moment, and I think it's going to take a bit of time for that to kind of play out. But in terms of just the price action, I was very surprised. I think a lot of people were surprised.
00:04:31.750 - 00:04:39.960, Speaker A: And one other piece of this is that now the governance of compound is in the hands of the community. How do you think that's going to go?
00:04:40.730 - 00:05:29.170, Speaker B: So I'm one of the participants in that governance process, so I'm someone that you can delegate your comp voting power to. And I think there's two parts to that for me, they're both self interested. So one is I have a fair amount of value on compound, so I'm an active lender and borrower on compound. So when I was given the opportunity to participate in governance, obviously I like the idea of having some level of control as a community participant. And I think the other thing is we're all kind of trying to figure out this decentralized governance process, right? And as part of our synthetics transition to decentralized governance, there's a whole bunch of things that we're testing out. And in DeFi, the fastest way to learn is just to get in and do things. And so having exposure to another project and the way that they're approaching this from the outside is quite powerful.
00:05:29.170 - 00:06:09.140, Speaker B: And so that's kind of the reason why I wanted to participate, was to have some measure of control and also to kind of be able to follow along closely as they work through it. And I think already we're seeing proposals come out that are trying to more closely align incentives within the system. So this comp distribution launched, there's people that are yield farming, which they're trying to maximize their gains from the comp emissions. And I think people are trying to tweak those incentives to get that right, to make sure that we're actually incentivizing the right behavior and not just incentivizing people to kind of pull as much value out of the system as possible.
00:06:09.510 - 00:06:12.500, Speaker A: And when you talk about that yield farming, what are they doing?
00:06:13.190 - 00:07:09.110, Speaker B: So they will put some value into compound, right? And a lot of this is happening on USDT, which is a bit ironic because it's not the most decentralized asset in the world, right? But they're depositing some value into the system. Then they're borrowing USDT because the borrow cost or the Apr on USDT is the highest in compound right at the moment. So to borrow USDT cost about 15% Apr. And the way the distribution works is the more interest you pay or the more interest you accrue, the more comp you get. And so a lot of the kind of comp emissions are going to these USDT farmers who have put USDT in, borrowed it, then moved it into another wallet, deposited again and borrowed it. So you can kind of lever up, right, and try and maximize your gains, which is not ideal, right? It's not exactly what we want. We want actual users to be getting the comp tokens because it's supposed to be this community governance process.
00:07:09.110 - 00:07:17.654, Speaker B: So on some level, you want to incentivize people to come in who have assets, but you don't want them to be kind of gaming the system, I guess.
00:07:17.852 - 00:07:23.500, Speaker A: And if that were to continue on too long, would that put the system at risk in any way?
00:07:24.430 - 00:08:13.050, Speaker B: It doesn't put the system at risk, but it does have some interesting dynamics for the rest of DeFi, I guess, because the rest of DeFi obviously is very connected. And so there are a number of weird things that happened over the last few days as different lending pools got drained and people were putting value in. And we saw a lot of value on the curve pool, for example, there was $25 million worth of transactions because people were borrowing. And curve pool is an AMM. So like an automatic market maker for stablecoins. And so people were basically cycling this USDT into USDC through this pool. So there's all kinds of weird things and effects flow on effects from an incentive like this that's so big, that's got so much attention.
00:08:14.430 - 00:08:47.818, Speaker A: And one other thing is, I saw that you took issue with a Tweet that Tushar Jain made where he talked about how he didn't see how liquidity mining and DeFi protocols was any different from transaction mining for centralized exchanges. And he basically said that for both. He didn't see how either would help their projects get market share long term. So for the listeners, can you define liquidity mining and transaction mining and then explain why you disagreed with Tushar.
00:08:48.014 - 00:09:11.222, Speaker B: Yeah. So the transaction mining thing that kind of started with FCoin and some of these other centralized exchanges was designed in a similar way. It was designed to create liquidity. Right. It was designed to have people that were putting liquidity into centralized order books as a means of attracting normal traders. Right. Because the more liquidity there is, the better off it is to trade on an exchange.
00:09:11.222 - 00:09:42.534, Speaker B: But it wasn't very well controlled. Right. So the fact that people were just wash trading to try and maximize their gains meant that there wasn't really a strong kind of alignment, incentive alignment from those promotions. It just created a lot of, I guess, optics. Right? Like the optics looked like there was a lot of volume, but the reality was there wasn't much liquidity coming from that. I think in this case and this is one of the benefits of DFI when you're incentivizing some behavior, the liquidity is genuinely there. You can see it.
00:09:42.534 - 00:10:28.482, Speaker B: You can see that the assets in compound went from 100 million to 200 million over the course of a few days. Right? Now, those assets are there for people to borrow like they actually exist. They're in the protocol. You can borrow them. And in many of the cases, ignoring the USDT example, the cost of borrowing has gone down because there's more assets now that lenders have deposited into the protocol. So I think with some small tweaks to this incentive program, which is our job as decentralized governors of this system, myself and others are looking at ways to kind of tweak this mechanism. I think we can ensure that the incentives are aligned such that it's a beneficial sort of program and beneficial incentive and all the incentives are aligned and users actually get a better experience from this.
00:10:28.482 - 00:10:37.560, Speaker B: And so I think that's where it kind of deviates, right, is that you can actually tweak these incentives and the community has control of it to ensure that the incentive alignment is there.
00:10:38.490 - 00:11:09.870, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk about how this trend could continue and what it means for the future of DFI. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible. In response to the challenging times, crypto.com is introducing three measures to help the community. First, the 3.5% credit card fee for all Crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months. Second, you can now get up to 10% back by using the MCO Visa card on food and grocery shopping.
00:11:09.870 - 00:11:30.902, Speaker A: Lastly, you could buy gift cards on the Crypto.com app from merchants like Whole Foods, Safeway, Burger King and more and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries. Download the crypto.com app. Today. In this crisis, many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets. Others seek to maximize the yield on their cash.
00:11:30.902 - 00:12:10.486, Speaker A: Nexa allows you to achieve both of these goals. The company offers instant crypto credit lines against all major cryptocurrencies, with interest rates starting from only 5.9% Apr. Nexo also allows you to earn up to 8% annually on your Fiat and Digital assets. What's more, interest is paid out daily, and you can add or withdraw funds at any time. Get started at Nexo IO back to my conversation with Kane Warwick. So when we saw what happened to the Comp token on the first day, you tweeted that you thought seeing it five X on the first day was the harbinger of a D five bull market.
00:12:10.486 - 00:12:11.400, Speaker A: Why?
00:12:12.410 - 00:12:28.950, Speaker B: I think it shows how much interest there is in the space. Right. There's a lot of things that you kind of see at the start of a bull market little anomalies, right. Little things that kind of forget that go, oh, that's interesting. Right. That's not what I was expecting. That was surprising.
00:12:28.950 - 00:13:11.026, Speaker B: And I think that we were starting to see little sorry, 1 second. Sorry. My daughter's just sitting next to me. So we're starting to see little blips like this right. That are kind of indicating that we're getting into a market where there's a lot of attention starting to flow into DeFi. And crypto has been in this weird sideways movement for a while now, but there is kind of one bright spot, which is DeFi, that has started to get attention, started to get some traction. And so I think the fact that we're seeing tokens and this resurgence of tokens and tokens used as very powerful incentive mechanisms is kind of the start of this movement.
00:13:11.026 - 00:13:28.400, Speaker B: Right. It's been going on for a little while, but I think the rest of the market is starting to take notice. And Compound being such a high profile project, moving this direction, I think is kind of a big deal. So it was just one of those things where I was like, okay, this is interesting. We're starting to see some real attention flow in.
00:13:28.930 - 00:14:08.106, Speaker A: Yeah, I happened to look at this. I guess it's a newsletter by Kerman Coley called DFI Weekly, and he said Comp is basically a bank that lives purely in the cloud and took less than ten people to actually develop. Also, the fact that it's a liquid unicorn less than three years is really wild to see. The past of raising continual rounds of investment and hoping to go public are over and yeah, looking I think Compound raised about 25 million, or at least in its Series A. I guess probably there was maybe a seed round before a little bit. That's definitely yeah, it's interesting, right?
00:14:08.288 - 00:14:12.240, Speaker B: There's definitely something there something's happening, I guess is the point. Right?
00:14:12.770 - 00:14:25.790, Speaker A: Yeah. And I also see you had another Tweet storm about BTC dominance, or what you call the BTC dominance cycle, and it was about how bitcoin flows into what you called alts, I think. So. Can you summarize your thoughts?
00:14:26.770 - 00:15:04.794, Speaker B: So I think I'm probably the most bullish person that I know at the moment on this whole thesis of BTC flowing into Ethereum. So I'm very close with a number of projects that are working on this solution. I've been actively kind of pushing for this for a while. So we've been talking to the Keep team for TBTC. I talked to some of the people from BitCo around wrap BTC and talked to the Ren team as well on Ren BTC. So I'm across most of the different approaches to bringing BTC onto Ethereum, and I think that there's also Rune as well, THORChain, which is working on it. So there's a number of people working on this solution.
00:15:04.794 - 00:16:12.830, Speaker B: And as someone who's kind of a recovering bitcoin maximalist, I think that I can see how this view of bitcoiners, that bitcoin should stay and not do much and should just be a store of value, could get eroded. I can see the path to that. And so if that starts to happen and they see yield, like comp, for example, right? Like, you can take your wrapped bitcoin and you can deposit it into comp or you can let it sit on Poloniax or Kraken or Binance or whatever and not do, you know, if you're not actively trading it's, just sitting on an exchange, maybe it's sitting in cold storage. But now there's a way that you can actually put your bitcoin to work and you can bring it onto Ethereum as a tokenized representation of it, and you can lend it out, or you can do a whole bunch of things with it. And so I think that there will be this movement of a significant portion of bitcoiners realizing that they can actually do something with their bitcoin, they can leverage it, and there's ways to get yield, there's ways to participate in other protocols. And I think that that's going to have a huge impact on the overall ethereum ecosystem. And obviously DFI, right, because there's just so much value in bitcoin.
00:16:12.830 - 00:16:33.562, Speaker B: There's almost $200 billion worth of bitcoin floating around. It doesn't take much for that flow into DFI to have a huge impact. And we've seen that in Maker. When Maker enabled wrap bitcoin, a ton of bitcoin flowed into that system to issue Dai. Right? And I think that's just the start of it. I think it's going to increase from here. So I'm really excited about that.
00:16:33.562 - 00:16:40.750, Speaker B: And I think it's something that we need to be watching for this movement of bitcoin onto ethereum.
00:16:41.170 - 00:16:56.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I had Matt Luanko on Unchained talking about TBTC, and I agree, there is something about the idea of marrying bitcoin to DeFi that it does make me think that there's going to be something that happens.
00:16:56.710 - 00:16:59.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I very much agree.
00:17:00.070 - 00:17:20.070, Speaker A: And when you wrote that Tweet Storm, you kind of were talking about how you feel like you're already seeing some of this action happen, and you talked about kind of like, which kinds of tokens have benefited. So what are you seeing in that regard like which tokens are kind of already starting this trend where you're seeing bitcoin going into DeFi.
00:17:20.490 - 00:18:27.294, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, you're seeing the maker example is a great example, right? And compound as well. We're actually launching something with the Curve team, which is that AMM protocol that I mentioned, and the Ren team, where we're going to put SBTC, which is our synthetic bitcoin, wrap bitcoin and Ren BTC all into an AMM pool, which is designed to have a ton of liquidity. And so we're hoping that we can get four or $5 million worth of bitcoin into that pool, which will mean that someone would be able to go from Ren BTC to wrap BTC or synthetic bitcoin, et cetera, which should really help with the liquidity across these different protocols because it's the composability that really makes it work. So you could take your wrapped bitcoin out of compound, convert it directly into bitcoin, have it deposited into an exchange, for example. And I think once that liquid on ramp and off ramp becomes just easier and a bit more accessible for bitcoiners that's going to be when at the moment it's still pretty high friction as that friction is reduced and someone who's got 100 BTC wants to in a single transaction, get it into the compound and they can. I think that's going to be a big deal.
00:18:27.294 - 00:19:12.090, Speaker B: And I think that's when a lot of the people with a lot of bitcoin locked up just sitting on exchanges will start to see it kind of flow in. But the impact of that, I guess, from a sort of tokens perspective is you've got all these D five tokens that some of which have been languishing for years, right? You've got lend KNC ren, even SNX to an extent maker. All of these tokens that have been live for a long time, that over the last six to twelve months have had a bit of a resurgence. Right. And again, it's kind of what I said earlier. It's one of the few bright spots where there's a lot of activity happening, and so a lot of these kind of layer one chains that don't have much activity going on. We're starting to see value flow out of them and into some of these DeFi protocols and DeFi tokens.
00:19:12.090 - 00:19:27.186, Speaker B: And I think that has a very powerful kind of compounding effect. As that happens and the prices increase, people get excited and they start looking, what's happening? Why is this happening? So I think we're starting to see that.
00:19:27.368 - 00:20:21.250, Speaker A: Yeah. And so this even goes back to what we were talking about, a little bit about compound's valuation based on not that much work, I mean, compared to the traditional startup world. And I saw that Tom Shaughnessy of Delphi Digital tweeted that he is seeing what he called a layer one to DeFi trade in full effect, and he said, quote, investors will sell graveyard layer ones for momentum DeFi plays where tokens make sense. And then he also said he was interested to see how VCs would handle this because many of them had already invested quite a bit into different layer one protocols. And he was saying, like, if they were to invest in DeFi now, that sort of puts them at ODS with their previous investments. And then there's also the fact that a lot of these DeFi projects are small enough that they don't necessarily need that much venture capital. So what do you think of those thoughts?
00:20:22.150 - 00:21:14.034, Speaker B: So I think there's a couple of things there. There's a lot of value locked up in projects that are not going anywhere really, right? If we're honest, right, there's a lot of tokens. If you go through the top hundred tokens, right, there's a lot of dead chains and dead projects that don't have much momentum. And then when you're looking through the top hundred and you're looking at what's actually happening, which are the projects that are really delivering, and there's interesting stuff going on, it's almost invariably a DFI token. It's some kind of DFI token. It's maker, it's ren, it's lend, it's all of these different tokens. And I think that if you add up the total value that's kind of stuck in these older projects that are not super liquid but also not really going anywhere, there's billions of dollars there, right? The total DFI market cap of actual project tokens is maybe 1.5
00:21:14.034 - 00:21:45.838, Speaker B: billion. So there's billions of dollars worth of money locked up in layer one chains that needs to go somewhere as this kind of shift happens. And where is it going to go? It's going to go to Ethereum and it's going to go to some of these DeFi projects. That's Tom's thesis, and I very much agree with it. And I think that it's very exciting, obviously, to be in the DeFi space and kind of see this playing out. It's what we've been talking about for a couple of years now and it's finally the rest of the market's catching up.
00:21:46.004 - 00:22:04.020, Speaker A: And so if you were to guess how a future DeFi bull market would play out, what are you thinking? Is it all these different factors about BTC coming to DeFi and then the proliferation of stablecoins? What factors do you think would come into play and how would that look?
00:22:04.470 - 00:22:58.206, Speaker B: I think there's some element of like, we haven't yet seen kind of the capitulation moment for a lot of these people with these, theses that they had around like l one competition with Ethereum, right? I think there's still a lot of kind of hope out there that this is going to play out. But the longer we go, the less likely that feels right. There will obviously be competition, and competition is good. And we may see one or two competitive chains to Ethereum getting some level of traction, but there's 50 or 100 of them, right? They're just not going to survive and it's going to be very hard for that to happen. And so I think that, as you see, those projects kind of wind up right now. It's hard to wind up a token. It's not like a company where you just kind of say, okay, we're going to shut our doors and wrap it up, right? Tokens just kind of live on as zombie tokens for a long time.
00:22:58.206 - 00:23:41.934, Speaker B: Right. I think that at some point I look at something like XRP, right? XRP has an $8 billion valuation, and there's a lot of people out there holding XRP that I think are going to be in disbelief when the thing that they've been talking about, which is the remittance rails being taken over by crypto, happens. But it happens with stablecoins on ethereum. And I think at some point you have to just capitulate and accept that that didn't work. Right. So where does that $8 billion worth of XRP go? Where does it flow to? It has to flow into Ethereum and Stablecoins and other projects. So when something like that happens, that's like a tectonic shift in the market, right? That's the third largest market cap token that potentially doesn't have a value proposition anymore.
00:23:41.934 - 00:23:58.806, Speaker B: Right. And again, a lot of us have been saying it doesn't have a value proposition for a long time, but at some point, reality has to set in and that's going to kind of play out. So again, that's my kind of thesis that I think that we will see this shift in the market, but it's coming. It's not here yet. I think we're on the edge.
00:23:58.998 - 00:24:21.502, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of amazing how this first mover it's not even a first mover advantage. But you're right, there are a lot of these zombie tokens that have huge market caps and it's taken a while for other things to catch up. Well, anyway, thanks so much for coming on Unconfirmed.

Bolton Book claims that Trump told Treasury Secretary to go after Bitcoin. The Washington examiner has a tidbit on an excerpt from John Bolton's new book, the Room Where It Happened. That involves bitcoin.
00:25:24.318 - 00:26:10.142, Speaker A: The publication reports that in May 2018, in a conversation about trade with China, President Trump told Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that instead of negotiating trade, he should, quote, go after bitcoin for fraud. Minuchin's response was if you don't want me on trade, fine. Your economic team will execute whatever you want. Last July, Trump made a stance on bitcoin known tweeting I'm not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Next line. JP Morgan Chase on Bitcoin passed its first stress test, but no safe haven. In a note to investor clients, JP Morgan Chase analysts said that bitcoin is not uncorrelated to traditional investments such as stocks.
00:26:10.142 - 00:26:58.738, Speaker A: They observed, quote Bitcoin saw severe drops in liquidity around the peak of the Cris in March, but that disruption was cured much faster than other asset classes. They concluded that cryptocurrencies passed their first stress test at this time. However, they made this caveat quote There is little evidence that bitcoin and others served as a safe haven. I e digital gold. Rather, its value appears to have been highly correlated with risky assets like equities. This all likely points to the continued survival of the asset class, but likely still more as a vehicle for speculation than as a medium of exchange or store of value.

The target market for the staking API will be large exchanges, wallet providers, custodians, and crypto hedge funds who can use this as a white label service. Stefan Coolikin, president and CFO of Ether Capital Corporation, tweeted that Ether is, quote, about to become a yielding instrument with annual returns of up to 20%. He further elaborated in a tweet storm quote Warren Buffett famously said he'd prefer all the farmland in the US. Instead of all the gold in the world. Why? Farmland is a productive asset on which you can earn cash flow. Cash is king.
00:27:36.762 - 00:28:27.818, Speaker A: Understandably, Buffett doesn't value bitcoin either. With staking, however, you can turn your cryptocurrency into a productive asset that generates a yield. You're now holding farmland, not gold. However, Stefan warns the yields of 20% would likely occur earlier when there's more risk and then drop to two to 3% as staking becomes more relevant. He concludes with staking as blockchain's answer to a yield instrument, it's just a matter of time before staking networks like Ethereum get the attention they deserve from traditional finance.

Next Headline Quadriga Downfall Due to Fraud says Ontario Securities Commission The Ontario securities regulator took the unusual step of publishing the findings of its investigation into the collapse of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga CX, saying that it, quote, resulted from a fraud committed by Quadriga's cofounder and CEO Gerald Cotton. The ten part report details how, by the time it ceased to operating, Quadriga owed 76,000 clients $215,000,000 in assets, but only 46 million was recovered to pay out for securities regulator report. It's a riveting read showing how Quadriga did not store clients crypto assets specifically for them, nor did it store them in secure, offline multisig wallets, as Cotton claimed. Instead, most assets were held in hot wallets and placed on other crypto asset trading platforms. Even then, many of those were simply being traded and spent by Cotton, with $28 million worth of Klein assets lost trading on those platforms. But most of all, Cotton traded with Quadrika customers using fake money.
00:29:49.318 - 00:30:45.770, Speaker A: 97% of this trading was through an account under the name Chris Marque, though others were called Scepter Jerry R. PO, the regulators write. Quote Cotton credited these accounts with fake crypto assets and fake fiat currency through manual adjustments to Quadrigo's internal ledger. For example, in 2017 and early 2018, he credited the Chris Marquee account with single deposits of $100 million and $50 million. By 2017, the exchange held 20,000 fake bitcoins, and Cotton had lost $115,000,000 by trading fake assets and covering those losses with the assets of new clients, effectively running a Ponzi scheme. Although Quadriga touted its high volumes, in reality Cotton was party to at least 35% of all trades in bitcoin settled in Canadian dollars on the platform. Plus, he also siphoned $24 million of client funds to himself and his fiance.

Next headline Former CFTC chairman published his argument that XRP is not a security christopher Giancarlo, aka cryptodad, who is now senior counsel at the New York law firm Wilkie Farngallagher, co authored, with a Wilkie colleague a paper titled Cryptocurrencies and US securities Law Beyond Bitcoin and Ether. It argues point by point that the cryptocurrency XRP, previously known as Ripple's, does not qualify as a security. According to the four prongs of the Howey test, however, Ripple, the company which owns the vast majority of XRP, is a client of Wilkie Farn Gallagher, and the paper, quote, relied on certain factual information provided by Ripple in the preparation of this article. Next headline Bancorp vulnerability highlights issues with ERC 27 Tokens Bancorp found a vulnerability in its latest smart contracts deployed on Tuesday, putting $450,000 worth of user funds at risk. Though they were able to white hat migrate the funds to a safe wallet blockchain. Engineer David Meehall pointed out that the issue stems from a fundamental design flaw with ERC 20 tokens, since, he says, quote, the user makes one transaction to allow the DAP to access their tokens and another to run the transaction.
00:32:14.002 - 00:33:16.700, Speaker A: Due to current gas prices, many people just enable limitless transactions so as to do the call approve just once, as he says, but now you've given unlimited control of your funds to another contract. However, he notes, the ERC seven seven token standard makes it so that the recipient can never access more tokens than the user sent. The drawback, of course, is that ERC seven seven tokens are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, which is what happened with Len FME. But as he says, at least these don't put user custody funds at risk.
