00:00:00.650 - 00:00:37.782, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. This has been the biggest news week in crypto, quite possibly for all of crypto history. Sympathies to everyone who has lost money or has had their funds stuck, or who simply feels betrayed. I hope that all of this gets resolved for all of you very quickly. The Friday show on Unchained is typically a short interview followed by a recap of other news. But this week we have an hour long discussion between Jordan Fish, aka Kobe of Uponly TV, and Eric Voorhees, founder of Shapeshift. It's a fantastic discussion unpacking the FTX fiasco, how this could have happened and what it all means.
00:00:37.782 - 00:01:20.210, Speaker A: One note that there were some technical difficulties, so Kobe's portion cut out a bit and we didn't know until after we wrapped. He was gracious enough to re record those answers, and we did our best to edit it all to be as seamless as possible. After the interview, we have a briefer than normal news recap and then a truly special Fun Bits, a standup comedy special with comedian and author Ginny Hogan, all about the FTX finance drama. Be sure to listen to the end for that. Just a quick note before we begin.

Here to discuss are Eric Voorhees, founder of Shapeshift, and Jordan Fish, aka Kobe, crypto investor and host of up only TV. Welcome, Eric and Kobe.
00:02:39.594 - 00:02:40.638, Speaker B: How's it going?
00:02:40.804 - 00:02:41.520, Speaker C: Hello.
00:02:42.050 - 00:03:22.374, Speaker A: So let's just start by processing the recent news, meaning like, what broke in the last several hours to give readers some context, since events are essentially changing by the minute. We are recording at about 11:00 a.m. On Thursday. And to give a really brief recap of events this week for listeners who may have missed the blow by blow, which was happening kind of in real time, mostly on Twitter. This week there was a bank run on FTX SPF himself. Sam Bingman Free, the founder and CEO, said that they saw about $5 billion in withdrawals on Sunday, sunday alone. At a certain point, it became clear they could not process all the withdrawals, which just should not happen in an exchange.
00:03:22.374 - 00:04:01.622, Speaker A: That just should not be possible. An exchange should put your coins in cold storage, keep some of them in the hot wallet, maybe for day to day operations, but otherwise their job is to keep that shit secure. So apparently this is not what happened because Tuesday morning FTX revealed that they did need to ask Binance to try to acquire them. Wednesday we found out that the size of the hole in FTX's balance sheet was $8 billion. So Binance ended up pulling out. They said the financials and obviously all this regulatory risk was not something that was suitable for them to acquire the company. And it kind of looked like FTX was headed toward bankruptcy.
00:04:01.622 - 00:04:56.842, Speaker A: Maybe still looks that way. Late Wednesday night, Justin's Son tweeted further to my announcement to stand behind all Tron token holders, and he listed a few of them. We were putting together a solution together with FTX to initiate a pathway forward. Sam actually did reference that negotiation as well, both in internal Slack message, which Kobe posts on Twitter, but also in some tweets that he posted. So who knows what will happen, but bankruptcy probably is maybe the direction this will go. And then, like I said, we're recording Thursday morning, but when I woke up at least I found out that Reuters reported that Alameda got loaned some unidentified amount of money from FTX after it lost $500 million due to the Voyager bankruptcy, which you might recall was triggered by the implosion of Three Arrows Capital. So Eric and Kobe, let's just start with all you know with this Reuters piece.
00:04:56.842 - 00:05:09.870, Speaker A: Actually, I'm curious, do you think that the Voyager bit and this loan that happened after that was the start of any kind of commingling, or do you think that FTX and Alameda had been commingling funds previously?
00:05:10.930 - 00:05:48.218, Speaker B: I don't have any specific knowledge on this. Commingling is an interesting word. I'm very curious, like what was specifically happening. The most likely seems to be that a loan was made from FTX to Alameda collateralized with FTT. And on the surface that looked sound until you realized that FTT is a relatively small cap token that can go up and down drastically, whereas the debt was probably denominated in dollars. And that's a really good recipe for a disaster. So that's, I guess what unfolded this week, but I think a lot of the specifics are still to come out.
00:05:48.218 - 00:05:49.610, Speaker B: We don't really know.
00:05:49.760 - 00:06:42.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I would have been surprised if they were.com England previously, but I was surprised that they were insolvent at all. Like, I thought there was a sub 1% chance that this would be like the outcome when the rumors began. So maybe my opinion doesn't have that much weight, but Alameda and Sam used to be the CEO of Alameda, right? Alameda and SBF were kind of the same entity and SBF and FTX are also the same entity. So I imagine at some point they were extremely close and then maybe for regulatory reasons, they tried to distance them a little bit. Sam stepped down from a CEO of Almeda and was FTX only. And I guess how distant did they ever really get is the question to answer.
00:06:42.880 - 00:07:24.250, Speaker C: I would not have thought in a million years that they would be like just slushing the bucks around together. And I think that it's likely in the lunar to celsius to three AC meltdown. Alameda got really hurt and they patched it up. Then it aligns with like Bret leaving FTX, us and Sam Trabs leaving Alameda around a similar time to that FTT transfer that Eric mentioned. But sometimes people have the confidence to do this because they've successfully done it a few times before. So they don't think about it, they just go, oh, we'll just do that thing again that worked for us last time and get out of the hole. So who knows?
00:07:24.670 - 00:08:11.560, Speaker A: Yeah. One thing, without going into names, I would just say let's not speculate on why people left, let's wait for them to make those. But I think some of them have publicly said, know, I didn't leave for anything related to this. I think some of the people that you mentioned maybe truly had no idea, actually. But anyway, one other thing though is just what you were saying about how you just never would have expected that FTX would even be in this kind of position. I am curious about that. There's a few different kind of versions of SBF out there, right? It's like the one who is constantly testifying in Capitol Hill and just is sort of chummy with the regulators and just like you would imagine someone like that.
00:08:11.560 - 00:08:18.810, Speaker A: Let's put it this way, if you're actually doing something shady, you're probably not going to want to get too close to people. Like that is maybe a way to put it.
00:08:18.880 - 00:08:20.490, Speaker B: That's an interesting assumption.
00:08:21.310 - 00:09:06.358, Speaker A: Yeah. Actually right when I said it, I just realized because of course people have been tweeting at me that he was like trying to buy himself protection. But then there's this other side of SBF that everybody has been pointing out in recent weeks, which is this is just a real conflict of interest. There were a number of situations where FTX or Alameda participated in deals with projects that were launching and got coins on the cheap. And then the exchange might know, I guess it was perpetuals or something on these coins that really had no volume. And then people suspected that Alameda was trading on that and making money on these coins that they got cheaply. Basically, dumping on retail is essentially what a lot of people implied.
00:09:06.358 - 00:09:13.834, Speaker A: I looked at a number of these things. It was one of those things where it's hard to prove, right? But there were a lot of insinuations.
00:09:13.882 - 00:10:13.220, Speaker B: A lot of yeah, I think that also distracts a little bit from the really egregious behavior here. So private parties trying to get good deals and make a profit on the deals with their own property is one thing. And I'm not so concerned about a conflict of interest between those two firms. There clearly was because they were owned by the same people to a large degree. The problem here is lending out customer money without telling the customers and then going a step further and acting as though you're not, and dismissing others in the industry for doing the same thing that was being done at that moment. That's the egregious behavior here. It is appalling that Sam would be speaking to regulators about counterparty risk and the safety of customer deposits while at the same time being insolvent with his own customers.
00:10:13.220 - 00:10:20.050, Speaker B: That's like sociopathic behavior and is just downright fraud.
00:10:20.790 - 00:11:49.806, Speaker C: Yeah, I 100% agree with Eric. The other stuff you mentioned, like opening markets so that Alameda or other entities close to FTX, like friends can hedge these bags that they've got cheaply, they can effectively proxy sell on perps coins that they have locked and not supposed to sell for four years. To take advantage of this high FDV type, low float setup is maybe anti customer or the markets are much more useful to insiders than they are to retail traders. But it's just a totally different degree of thing than just stealing customer deposits and lying about stealing customer deposits. And part of the reason I would have never have guessed they were insolvent is they sort of had the game rigged in their favor, right? So they were able to do these things with these markets that allow them an advantage over any other market participant, such that they should just be printing so much money all of the time. Like, they had the exchange, they owned the venue, they had all the data for people's positions on the venue, they had markets that they wanted to hedge their own positions like it were off venue, and somehow they still managed to lose $10 billion. Make sense? They must have been the worst traders of all time.
00:11:49.806 - 00:12:32.154, Speaker C: So that's why I was so shocked. If you have an exchange that prints eight to nine figures of fees per day, you raise $2 billion. There's a $10 billion hole. But it means they must have lost like 14 billion or something in the last year. So that's why I would never have expected it. I think a mixture of it is just a different degree or a different magnitude of fraud to the behavior that could have been seen as a bit sharky and maybe not ethical, but welcome to crypto. And then literally just lying and being so incompetent that despite all your advantages, you still manage to lose ten yards.
00:12:32.154 - 00:12:33.440, Speaker C: It makes no sense.
00:12:34.130 - 00:13:06.870, Speaker A: Yeah, and let's talk about that first bit where when I said that he was kind of the face of crypto to regulators and people, I tweeted that it's like the person that you thought was Hermione ended up being voldemort. And to my mind, hermione is like the goody two shoes. Kind of like kissing up to the teachers and whatever. And so that's why I said SPF appeared like that. But I was curious what your take was on what he was doing with regulators, if he was actually doing what it looks like he was doing.
00:13:07.020 - 00:14:27.554, Speaker B: It's clear that he doesn't come from the same ethos as many in the crypto world who believe that what we're doing is antithetical to federal regulations. And they have all sorts of philosophical, economic, moral reasons for that. He was not of that cloth and he didn't lie about that. He was very pro regulation or as people like to euphemistically say, pro regulatory clarity. And he was willing to sit in Washington and invite down these know with a smile on his face and putting forward that the industry supports it because he has this huge exchange. He's very well known, millions of customers, and so he can say like, yes, the industry will support this, the regulators want that, because then to them it feels like they're doing good and they get a bunch of his donation money and in return he gets to help craft that legislation. And what was really worrying a couple of weeks ago when I had that debate with him was how readily he was going to sacrifice DeFi, essentially sacrifice decentralized finance such that the centralized financial regulations would be more in his favor.
00:14:27.554 - 00:14:44.310, Speaker B: That was super concerning, and I think that's why the community was so outraged with what he was saying there. But no one at that point thought he was also committing like a multibillion dollar fraud. So that's new and surprising.
00:14:45.130 - 00:15:52.534, Speaker C: Yeah, it's just such an order of magnitude different. I can even understand someone being having different regulatory opinions and fighting for the things that they believe are best, but I just end up speculating and going too conspiracy theory when I think about these things. Now, his parents are from a deeply political elite background. They're both like lawyers, apparently. His mom's friends with Elizabeth Warren and stuff. And I wonder how much of this egregious fraud that was happening influences what you do in those venues. Like, do you fight for what you really believe in if you know you have this hole and you have this thing coming up? Or do you cozy up to regulators a little bit more? There's this video of him in Congress testifying about the financial crisis and how there was this opaque debt that was being borrowed against and repackaged and borrowed against, and all these, this daisy chain of debt and how that cannot happen on FTX, that is impossible.
00:15:52.534 - 00:16:41.178, Speaker C: It's transparent and crypto, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And at the same time, he's doing the exact same thing that he described in Congress as being bad and not possible with crypto and ironically, is possible with FTX, a centralized exchange that acts somewhat like a bank. But is not possible with DeFi this thing that I guess allegedly I still don't know the details, but allegedly he was arguing to regulate more strictly and stuff. But again, rumor and conjecture. So yeah, I don't know, man. I just wonder how much the fraud influences what you do in those venues and how you behave with regulators and stuff. I don't know.
00:16:41.264 - 00:17:21.610, Speaker B: I mean, if crypto prices had rallied over the last six months, this wouldn't have happened, right? Like, this would have been covered up and the solvency would have regained itself and it could have been worked out. But of course, to run a company of that size and to be holding billions of dollars of customer money, that can never be your assumption. You have to assume quite the opposite. And if you wanted to be loaning out customer funds, just tell the customers you're doing it and give them some of the yield. Tell them what you're doing. That's all it requires. The fraud is in doing it without telling them, and then the double fraud is in doing it and then saying you're doing the exact opposite.
00:17:22.830 - 00:18:22.490, Speaker A: Yeah, some of the stuff he was saying in his now deleted tweets were, FTX is fine, assets are fine, FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. And it's so interesting to me, have you ever deal with little kids, like trying to explain to them how important it is to not lie? And then as adults, all you guys are saying is if he had been transparent, if he hadn't lied. It's really the lie that is actually what is the crime here, which it's interesting. And actually this goes back to the theranos comment, because I also followed that very closely and just in all the stuff that I learned about what she was doing, it's interesting. I know it's going to maybe sound crazy, but I don't know if you guys remember, her voice is fake. She has a normal voice, but fake made it deeper. And people who knew her before said, yeah, it didn't used to be like that.
00:18:22.490 - 00:19:24.720, Speaker A: And some employees were like, oh, at the company party, she sort of fell out of her voice and we heard her real voice and stuff like that. And it's like for such a little lie that's when you cross the line, it's just like at any moment that you're going to lie. When you're willing to lie, then the lies, you can't ever just do one lie because you essentially have to keep creating stories around the lie and just keep going. And it almost feels like maybe obviously we don't know all the facts here, but it seems like maybe something like that happened. But even when Eric was like, oh, they could have potentially traded out of this or whatever if the price of the coins had gone. Know, it's like just what you were saying. No, when you have that moment where you're like, okay, one of my entities is in trouble, you know that you are not supposed to touch the funds of your customers and the other entity, but he crossed that line and it's like, from that moment, then all the other lies just go from that.
00:19:24.720 - 00:19:47.270, Speaker A: Like Kobe, I feel like you mentioned this, like, he could have very well been like, one company maybe won't be successful, the other one is going to be a great company. I can make money off the trades, whatever. And who knows, maybe he was like, if they're both successful, I can give away more to all the people that deserve my effective altruism.
00:19:48.730 - 00:20:47.386, Speaker C: Yeah, what I just don't understand is how you can have this exchange, which is worth 40, OD billion dollars and prints eight figure nine figures in fees per day, and yet risk all of that in order to bail out the failing hedge fund. Right? Like, you have a hedge fund that you're also co founder of and maybe contributes more to your net worth than the exchange does, even. But it's failing. It's not doing well, whereas FTX is doing well. FTX is succeeding. But you risk the thing that's winning in order to prop up the thing that is clearly not able to perform in the market if it needs this bailout. I can't see a world where a person decides to do that and says, well, in order to save half of my net worth, I guess I will risk everything.
00:20:47.386 - 00:21:00.800, Speaker C: I will risk customer funds, I'll risk this successful business investor relationship, everything in order to prop up a failing hedge fund. I just can't imagine how you end up in that place.
00:21:01.490 - 00:21:45.482, Speaker A: Yeah. Eric, since you have experience with exchanges, I was kind of curious for your take on all know, I don't know if you saw Jesse Powell tweeted, it was such a great thread. But I'm just going to quote one of them. He said, red flags, acting like you know everything after showing up to the battle eight years late, nine figures, buying political favor, being overeager to please DC. Huge ego purchases like nine figure sports deals, being a media darling, seeking out puff pieces, which, by the way, I don't know if you guys saw the Sequoia thing. I mean, I know they invested in him, but I was like, oh boy, this is embarrassing. EA virtue signaling.
00:21:45.482 - 00:21:52.590, Speaker A: And then the last one was, of course, FTT. Yeah. I was curious for your thoughts as an exchange owner or previous.
00:21:53.090 - 00:22:35.130, Speaker B: I mean, it's hard to not be super pissed. And what I'm pissed about is with Shapeshift, when we created, it was in the wake of Mount Gox collapsing, which almost took down the industry. They were 80 or 90% of the entire exchange market. And we were so dismayed because it had been years of work trying to get bitcoin credible, trying to get people to take it seriously. And then the most important exchange, through some combination of incompetence or actually insiders stealing money, $500 million is lost. And that was so much money back then. And we built Shapeshift to not ever hold customer funds.
00:22:35.130 - 00:23:00.406, Speaker B: We weren't like, oh, you know what the problem is, Mark Rpellis isn't trustworthy. We are. So we will take all the deposits of customers. That's a recipe for just repeating the same mistakes. And so we built Shapeshift to protect customers by not holding the money at all. This is like the magic of crypto, that you can do that. You can never have a noncustodial exchange system in the fiat world.
00:23:00.406 - 00:23:56.454, Speaker B: They can't exist and crypto blockchains come along. Suddenly you can build these amazing tools that systematically remove risk from finance systematically. And then we as Shapeshift get nothing but hell from regulators, get nothing but hell from The Wall Street Journal, get nothing but hell from the financial establishment that doesn't like us because we actually provided privacy to users and we actually protected them systematically. And then FTX comes along, donates millions of dollars to the politicians and is like this darling in DC where he then goes and is invited to speak and craft regulation. And the corruption of all of that is so blatant. And my hope for this example and tragedy, as bad as it is, is like, wake up to what crypto can actually do. Wake up to how DeFi works, where you simply remove the need for trust.
00:23:56.454 - 00:24:24.686, Speaker B: We don't need a licensing regime because that's just meant to improve trust. We've removed the need for trust. This is a huge breakthrough for humanity. And the politicians, the regulators do not appreciate this at all and they continue to vilify it wherever they can. It was disgusting to see Sam inviting that down on DeFi and then to see what he did with this customer money is so ironic and tragic and I hope it wakes some people up.
00:24:24.788 - 00:25:08.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually want to ask you two follow up questions to that. The first one is about, I mean, you kind of referenced the Wall Street Journal piece that ran that implied that I don't remember all the details. It was like maybe like terrorists are using shapeshift or people were like money laundering using shapeshift. I am really curious about this because I just feel like we see this tension so much in crypto in general, where obviously I think it's a good thing if criminals don't use crypto to launder their money and whatever. And yet at the same time, I totally agree with you about customer privacy and protecting their funds and not creating a honeypot and all that. So I was just curious to hear kind of like what you think is the best way to resolve the tension between those two.
00:25:08.676 - 00:25:53.470, Speaker B: I think the way you resolve it is to recognize like a first principle, which is the presumption of innocence. Customers are not criminals, therefore if they're not even accused of a crime, they should be permitted the decency of privacy. I don't know why this makes me like some radical. This should be a fundamental part of American culture that if you haven't been accused of a crime, you have the right to privacy. I mean, I thought there was like an amendment, like the fourth amendment that guaranteed that, that enshrined it and it's violated every single time someone goes to an exchange and has to surrender their personal identifying information just because some regulator wanted to capture it. The regulators want to make their job easier and in so doing they are happy to violate fundamental rights of an entire population.
00:25:53.810 - 00:26:01.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's what is the default. Because at the beginning of your statement you said customers are not criminals, but sometimes they are.
00:26:01.970 - 00:26:34.234, Speaker B: Absolutely. And so allege a crime and go after the criminal if there is a suspicion of wrongdoing. Allege it like this is how the court system works, right? You get some evidence and you allege that a crime happened. And then when people are accused of crimes, there's a reasonable argument that some of their freedoms start getting stripped away while you figure that out. But that's like a case by case basis. You find the criminal, you go after them, you accuse them. And if you have done a good job as the authority, you bring convincing evidence and you convict them.
00:26:34.234 - 00:27:06.740, Speaker B: And we have such a backward system now where the government believes that exchanges that all financial intermediaries, for example, should be spying on everyone, everyone and reporting all that information back to the government when none of those people are even being accused of a crime. That's so different. And for all the people that care about law and order, where is the law and order in that? That's not law and order, that is tyranny. And it's just sad that it's such like an extreme position these days.
00:27:07.110 - 00:27:37.040, Speaker A: And then the other thing I wanted to ask you about is when you were talking about how Know was going to DC and being all buddy buddy with the regulators and lawmakers, I was know you only mentioned it in the context of the Dccpa and how that obviously was going to make DeFi, not really DeFi. And I was wondering, did you have any inkling that he was a bad actor for crypto when it came to regulation before that time or either of you or in general, did the crypto community feel that way?
00:27:37.570 - 00:28:14.220, Speaker B: I didn't really know. I only got aware of his position when he posted his blog about his suggestions for regulations in the industry, and there were some big red flags in that. And so that's what I was calling out. Let's just say I was a little suspicious of him when I learned that he's like the second largest donor to one of the political parties. That's not good. So something was already amiss there. But the degree to which he was causing bad things to happen was not apparent until that.
00:28:16.830 - 00:28:40.306, Speaker C: Don't know. I don't know, man. I didn't think Sam seemed very well in the debate with you, Eric. It was so one sided and kind of awkward to watch. After a while, he seemed like a little bit sick or something. Clearly a lot of stuff going, really. I don't really know.
00:28:40.306 - 00:28:50.886, Speaker C: And I'm certainly not an expert on the reg stuff, and I think it's extremely complicated. I don't really know what to say.
00:28:50.988 - 00:29:13.582, Speaker B: Have the regulators ever actually prevented an exchange from collapsing? Is there a single example where they came in and like, hey, we discovered the fraud and we're shutting these guys down because we are the government, we're here to help. Has that ever happened? There was no insolvency there. They shut down BTCE because they didn't like where it was coming from. They called it money.
00:29:13.716 - 00:29:26.234, Speaker A: No, no, but actually the stolen funds from Mount Gox were laundered through BTCE. So I think that's why it got shut, I think.
00:29:26.292 - 00:29:41.254, Speaker B: But that wasn't the case where they were stealing customer money and there was an insolvency. So the question is, like, have the regulators ever prevented a collapse of an exchange on insolvency grounds? I don't think there's a single example, no.
00:29:41.292 - 00:30:13.890, Speaker A: But theoretically they should be able to do that. Because, for instance so I did get Chainalysis to send me the balance sheets of ETH on ftx.com and FTX US. And you can see that FTX was in the red on ETH. Actually. Interestingly, it showed that they were in the red on ETH back in January for a short period, and then of course, again just in the last few days. But when you look at the balance, there's a big drawdown in June.
00:30:15.190 - 00:30:18.980, Speaker B: Where were the regulators then? Too busy taking photo ops, I guess.
00:30:21.670 - 00:31:10.130, Speaker A: The charts I have, they're not interactive, so I couldn't look too closely. But it looked like around the time that Voyager announced that they had the exposure to three AC, and I saw another chart showing that around the same time FTX and FTX US received a huge influx of FTT. So just everything that Reuters mentioned checks out when you look in that regard. But you guys so we're going to take a quick break to hear from the sponsors who make this show possible. DeFi Saver is an all in one management app for the top lending protocols on ethereum, including Aave, Maker, Liquidy and Compound. They have dedicated protocol dashboards with options for quick leverage adjustment and. Self liquidation as well as automated liquidation protection options with stop loss, trailing stop and automated unwinding options.
00:31:10.130 - 00:32:00.174, Speaker A: They also have loan shifting tools for collateral and debt swaps and instantly moving positions between different protocols. You can try DeFi saver today on Ethereum, arbitram and optimism. For years you've heard about the promise of blockchain technology and yet high fees, security risks and unreliable chains have been the reality. It doesn't have to be this way. Avalanche believes innovators deserve Web three infrastructure they can count on with the flexibility and tooling to build anything they want, any way they want. Chosen by global leaders like KKR, Deloitte, Lemonade and Mastercard, avalanche has built a strong reputation as one of the world's fastest, most reliable blockchains. To learn more about Avalanche, visit Avox network or follow on Twitter at avalanche.
00:32:00.174 - 00:32:30.570, Speaker A: Avox explore the platform millions are using for its speed, stability and scalability. Avalanche create without limits. Back to my conversation with Eric and Kobe. So some other bits of news that broke this week are that the SEC, CFTC and now DOJ are all investigating based on what we're talking know, the deleted tweets, the actual facts that are coming out versus what he was know. Am I wrong in thinking this is likely to end in criminal charges?
00:32:31.250 - 00:32:48.610, Speaker B: I don't know but it seems like CZ did a better job investigating than any of the regulators did crypto. Twitter was aware of the problem based on service level blockchain forensics and the regulators come in after the collapse. Where is the accountability here?
00:32:48.680 - 00:33:33.050, Speaker A: I know but did you read CZ's tweets? Because he was just as shocked as everybody else. At least the way he told it in his Tweets was that it literally was just like, oh, Alameda's balance sheet looks a little bit risky. Like, we know. Get this FTT off of our balance sheet to cover our risk. And then he had no idea that all of this would end up in Sam calling him Monday night or Tuesday, being like, hey, the SEC, CFTC and now DOJ are all investigating. And as we were talking about, he has these deleted tweets in which what he was saying doesn't comport with the facts that have emerged since. So I was curious, do you guys think this will end up in criminal charges?
00:33:33.210 - 00:34:18.926, Speaker C: I mean I hope so, right? It's like an egregious fraud if it doesn't what is the point of the system at all? At least what it was Mount Gox it felt like at least what I understand of Mount Gox it was like a technical mistake which Mark then tried to cover up to make users whole. Right, so like a hack or some bad code somewhere, which then Mark was not honest about. Whereas this just seems to be like we store customer deposits and then we just continually lied about it because stealing customer deposits is not good and people would not use our exchange. Mean. I hope so.
00:34:19.028 - 00:34:49.802, Speaker A: Eric, before you even answer that, I was just like, what do you guys think of the fact know, blockchains and transparency show a lot of this stuff and actually could be used to prevent these kinds of situations. And yet most likely at the moment, just based on everything that's happened, my sense is that regulators are going to want to do the traditional type of regulation and not go with this more technological solution. And I was curious what you thought of that too.
00:34:49.936 - 00:35:49.580, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really frustrating when the technology for complete transparency, real time auditability is here and the regulators not even won't adopt it, but they actively vilify it and then aren't themselves solving any of these fraud. Like what probably happens here is years of court cases and depositors getting some tiny fraction of their money back many years from. And like, whether Sam goes to jail or not, I don't really care. What I care is people learning the lesson to stop using custodians, to stop using centralized financial services where this kind of thing can happen and has happened over and over and over again. The solution is like right in front of us. These decentralized protocols solve these very problems. We don't have to care about people's intentions, we don't have to care about human mistakes in the moment.
00:35:49.580 - 00:36:31.754, Speaker B: We have to care about code mistakes, but that can be viewed and audited and fixed. And there's just such hesitancy for people to step into the actual promise of crypto because they're comfortable in these little walled gardens. Especially when they say that they're the safe, regulated way to buy and sell bitcoin, which I think was literally FTX's slogan for all of their advertising. It reminds me of like that underwater fish with the little light, like the light of regulation, the deep sea fish, and then everyone's like, OOH, they're safe and regulated and they go toward it. It's just kind of tragic. Hopefully people learn.
00:36:31.952 - 00:36:43.020, Speaker A: What do you think of the fact that FTX US and in general any of these US entities don't have these problems because there are such strict regulations in the US.
00:36:44.050 - 00:36:56.430, Speaker B: They also don't have the customers. It doesn't vindicate anything. I mean, the reason that nine out of ten FTX customers are in the offshore one is because the US regulatory burden is so high that no one actually wants to use the US version. Right.
00:36:56.500 - 00:36:57.360, Speaker A: Is that true?
00:37:00.630 - 00:37:32.422, Speaker B: I made that number up, but I know that the international one. I'll disclaim that I made that stat up the number of international customers and the volume of FTX international was dwarfing US. Right. So same thing with binance, right? There's a binance us. How does that compare in terms of volumes to the real binance? It's almost insignificant. The reason customers go elsewhere is because they prefer those services, because they're not burdened with all the garbage that the US regulatory system puts down. Where's the accountability for that damage done? By the regulators.
00:37:32.486 - 00:37:40.014, Speaker A: And then how do you account for the success of Coinbase, which obviously is mainly us, and has more than 100 million customers or something?
00:37:40.212 - 00:38:18.790, Speaker B: Coinbase is the exception that proves the rule and they've done a very good job over a very long period of time and they've worked tooth and nail over a decade to gain that customer base. And I know it's frustrating to them that so many customers leave to other jurisdictions. I remember back when all the ICOs were going on and Coinbase felt they needed to be too conservative to list a lot of the assets, and so Binance would list everything, and the customers all went out there because people wanted to trade these things. So Coinbase has done an amazing job given the constraints of the regulatory system in the US. But they're at a constant disadvantage.
00:38:18.950 - 00:38:41.074, Speaker A: Let's also now talk about this little news Bit, which broke shortly before we started recording, which is that Tether has frozen $46 million of USDT held by FTX following a request from law enforcement. What do you guys think of that? And people were saying that it looked like FTX might have been doing something with a curve pull to try to break the USDT peg or something. I'm not sure.
00:38:41.272 - 00:39:12.000, Speaker B: Yeah. My hope is that Circle or Tether would freeze these accounts based on their own judgment. They see these flows better than anyone, and if they see a big blow up, they have at their discretion the ability to freeze these things. I hope they're not waiting around for some law enforcement to suggest it, because that could come way too late. But again, it's a good reminder that these centralized stablecoins are not permissionless. So everyone that uses them needs to know that.
00:39:13.970 - 00:39:56.140, Speaker A: One other thing that we have referenced a few times is the existence of FTT itself. And I was curious what you thought of exchange coins. You might have seen there was like a little dust up with Alex Gladstein saying that this sort of proves, know, Bitcoin versus all the other coins, blah, blah, blah. And then other people were fighting back, saying like, no, it's just about you shouldn't kind of have these exchange coins. Yeah. Do you feel that this vindicates that Bitcoiner notion that when people kind of create this funny money and it's like a little bit more centralized, that it leads to these shenanigans, and really it just shows the power of Bitcoin? Or what's your take on it?
00:39:56.670 - 00:40:19.906, Speaker B: The maxi is trying to make this into like a Bitcoin versus crypto thing is kind of gross. This isn't a Bitcoin versus crypto thing. This is a custodian versus noncustodian thing. This is a trust versus trustless system thing. This is a centralized versus decentralized thing. There's nothing wrong with an exchange making its own token. Absolutely nothing wrong with it as long as they're being honest about what it is, how it works, all that kind of thing.
00:40:19.906 - 00:40:54.494, Speaker B: There's nothing wrong with it. And even though FTT now has a huge blackmark on it, bitfinex created their Leo token years ago and actually solved their own exchange hack through some very clever financial engineering with their token. That whole project doesn't get enough attention, but they basically solved a hack that was existential to them. It wasn't the government that did it, wasn't a regulator that came in and made those people whole. They did it and they did it using their own token, and they've been very successful through that. So creating a token is fine. Let the markets be free.
00:40:54.494 - 00:41:16.550, Speaker B: Anyone should make whatever tokens they want and they can market them as long as they're being honest. There's nothing wrong with that. What was wrong here was giving away customer money to another party and then lying about doing that. Yeah. The focus, though, just needs to remain on the real crime here, which was the giving away of user assets and saying that they weren't doing that.
00:41:16.700 - 00:41:17.302, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:17.436 - 00:41:23.750, Speaker B: Everything else is somewhat important details, but that is the real fundamental breach of trust here.
00:41:23.900 - 00:41:48.750, Speaker A: Yeah. And actually, while we were talking, my assistant put in the document that the Wall Street Journal reported that SBF told an investor this week that Alameda owes FTX about $10 billion. And that all in all, FTX had $16 billion in customer assets. So that means that FTX lent more than half of its customer funds to Alameda.
00:41:49.170 - 00:41:51.200, Speaker B: It doesn't necessarily mean that.
00:41:51.730 - 00:41:52.480, Speaker A: No.
00:41:53.330 - 00:42:01.874, Speaker B: For example, if FTX had a bunch of its own cash, the loan could have been part customer funds and part its own cash. But point still stands. It's a huge amount.
00:42:02.072 - 00:42:26.060, Speaker A: Yeah. So where do you think this kind of ends up in terms of contagion issues? Are there any other entities that you think might get hit? Because obviously this all got kicked off way earlier from other entities and we saw that all of these have knock on effects. So curious to hear what you thought about that.
00:42:26.430 - 00:43:04.280, Speaker B: Yeah, the answer is certainly there will be effects. The question is just how big and how bad? Who's affected? Lots of people in the industry, I'm sure, are trying to figure out counterparty risk right now. And the echoes of how this kind of thing works and how the financial crisis happened in 2008 are pretty loud. Again, I sound like a broken record, but in DFI, you don't worry about this stuff because everyone understands where all assets are at all times and contracts execute as the code is written. In fiat systems, in custodial systems, there is just this opacity that you can't get around.
00:43:04.970 - 00:43:09.286, Speaker A: But do you want to name who people seem to be kind of worrying about?
00:43:09.308 - 00:43:11.642, Speaker B: I don't know. Yeah, I really don't know. Yeah.
00:43:11.696 - 00:44:15.486, Speaker C: So if you have a financial relationship with Alameda in any way, such that Alameda owes you money, I mean, those are the obvious ones. Right? So who are the lenders that have lent money to Alameda. I read somewhere that obviously Alameda does a lot of market making for projects. So projects will give a supply of tokens to Alameda and Alameda will use that to create market depth, but they're supposed to give those tokens back at some point. Whether or not they'll give those tokens back, I guess, is on the cards. Now a lot of projects seem to loan money to Alameda as well. So like Project Treasuries, similar to the three AC thing where if you were invested in by three AC or Alameda, they would also say to you, we'll take a $50 million loan and we'll give you this 10% annually, or something on that.
00:44:15.486 - 00:44:50.358, Speaker C: So there may be some contagion beyond just lenders. There may be some projects who will lose their treasuries and need to raise in a very bad raise environment. Obviously everyone that has money on FTX, they saw multicoin has like 20% of assets under management or something on yeah, I think with 10%, 10% on FTX. So there's a lot of balances. There probably industry balances and again, like crypto company balances. So I think those are the main things. Like a few lenders might go bust, people that had a relationship with Alameda.
00:44:50.358 - 00:46:07.582, Speaker C: How many of the other big exchanges or user facing crypto companies were lending to Alameda? Obviously FTX were because they're really close, but Alameda had a reputation as being like money printers, right? Like similar to three AC where they were like, oh, these guys are extremely profitable. So was Exchange B, C and D also saying they're a safe place to put some of our money? Whether that's just money that the exchange owns or maybe someone else is also loaning out customer deposits, those are the things I think are worth watching. And in these times, when something starts blowing up and you don't know what the daisy chain of who's relying on who to pay back money is, I think the best thing to do is just to withdraw anything that you have on any custodial exchange to something where you own the you know, no matter where you have money. Really. Maybe Coinbase is the only exception because they're like a public company and you can go read their financial books and stuff like that. But yeah, I think those would be the main places. I also saw something that's solid the Solana like wrapped bitcoin and Solana wrapped assets are issued by FTX or Alameda.
00:46:07.582 - 00:46:11.060, Speaker C: So there may be even some contagion in Solana DeFi too.
00:46:11.510 - 00:46:12.660, Speaker B: Yeah, great.
00:46:13.030 - 00:46:31.740, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we wrote an article about that on Unchained that came out Thursday, so people can check that out. Kobe, you can tell me, do you have sort of an inside line into what things look like inside FTX? Because you are the one who know the slack message from Sam and.
00:46:34.670 - 00:47:52.580, Speaker C: Mean Sam was effectively lying to my face right up until the day before this broke because someone was talking to him about this and said, will you go on my podcast? Will you go on up only TV's the podcast to talk about this? And he said, yeah, well, I'll go on it. And this was maybe the 7th or the 8th. So we started a group chat with Sam and we were arranging a time and it's like, cool, right? I'll have a nap and then when I get up, we'll do it. And then when I woke up, it's like, oh, we're going to delay it now, we'll definitely do it this week, but we're delaying it. So right up until this whole thing blew up, he was pretending things were fine and was, I guess, going to come use our podcast to tell some more lies about how things were fine? Perhaps. But for some reason everyone knows my telegram handle and I tweet information, so people just keep sending me snippets. And then occasionally a couple of cryptojournalists, when they don't feel like they can publish the information, perhaps for political reasons, just say, we verified this, what do you think? And then anomaly, I just leak those things.
00:47:52.580 - 00:47:57.880, Speaker C: Which is what happened with the Slack thing. A cryptojournalist sent me it.
00:47:59.690 - 00:48:02.982, Speaker A: But you said that you had verified that. It did, actually.
00:48:03.116 - 00:48:30.560, Speaker C: So the anon was a cryptojournalist and I verified it was someone that works at FTX. Is this slack message real? Basically. But beyond that, no, not really. As in the dark as everyone else is, apart from reading the rumor mill, typically when a lot of this stuff happens, there's a bunch of telegram chats of like, deeply crypto native people.
00:48:31.890 - 00:48:48.402, Speaker A: Right. But your sense is what's mostly being reported, which is like even that all of this was kept to a small number of people at an extremely high level, to the point where a lot of other high level people just didn't even know. Is that what your sense is?
00:48:48.536 - 00:48:58.646, Speaker B: I'm dismayed to hear that someone like Zane would have 50% of his net worth on any custodian. Why do people leave so much money with custodians?
00:48:58.758 - 00:49:04.346, Speaker A: I mean, he's worked at so many exchanges, he's worked at Okx and or.
00:49:04.528 - 00:49:30.754, Speaker B: All the more reasons. Maybe not at Binance, but it's depressing how much risk people expose themselves to. And the Noob I get right, the Noobs used to their bank account, they'll leave all their money on FTX, I get it. But come on, people, we got to do better than this. Do not leave half of your net worth among any set of custodians. It's just foolish. And it's not at all what the whole point of crypto is.
00:49:30.754 - 00:49:34.020, Speaker B: If you're doing that, you're doing it wrong.
00:49:34.710 - 00:49:50.506, Speaker A: So that's a good message for everyday listeners. I was curious, we kind of have been addressing what takeaways regulators should have, but I know a bunch of regulators listen to my show, so if you want a platform to send them a message, what would you guys say to.
00:49:50.528 - 00:50:39.990, Speaker B: Them, yeah, okay, thanks for the platform. I'm sure all the regulators are going to be salivating over this because they see crypto company loses billions of dollars and they want to solve that by making a bunch of laws to any regulators out there who can think about what they're doing before they regulate. Consider that this is an issue of custodianship, that this only happened because a custodian run by people could make subjective judgments about the assets within it. This happens in the banking system. This happens in the custodial crypto system just the same. And if you want to put regulations on those people, I get that. Do not put regulations down on DeFi.
00:50:39.990 - 00:51:32.366, Speaker B: Assuming it is the same model, like DeFi solves these very problems. It solves them at a code level that can be audited by anyone in the world in real time. And we have that technology now. So if you care about the billions of dollars that was lost from this and you don't want that to keep happening and you're not familiar with the magic of DeFi, you owe it to everyone to go learn about that and understand that stuff. And please do not assign a bunch of regulations that just pull DeFi back closer to the fiat financial system that we already have. For me, because I had to focus the whole time on what he's saying because I have to be ready to address anything, and he just went off on these crazy tirades. And to me, it came across as someone who actually has not considered the first principles of what crypto is all about, which isn't surprising for someone who only arrived like three years ago and is in Washington DC.
00:51:32.366 - 00:51:41.626, Speaker B: Trying to get everything regulated. But with all this now coming to light, I think there were some other stressful things going on under the surface that are kind of obvious when looking at it now.
00:51:41.728 - 00:52:17.906, Speaker A: Yeah, and I know you have to go, Eric. In a minute, but just the last point was, I actually asked him this when I last interviewed him, because when I was doing research on him and I realized he was making all these political donations. I asked him. Oh. So when you make your donations, is your purpose more of your effective altruism philosophy, or is it more to further the interests of crypto? And it was interesting when I was listening to your conversation with him, I'm not a video person. I actually listen to things mostly. And even though, yes, I had seen the screenshots, but I could hear in his voice that he sounded kind of agitated.
00:52:17.906 - 00:52:47.620, Speaker A: And it really felt like you're right, that he hadn't kind of thought of a grand vision and already got too worked up in the details and was trying to figure out. So if we use this language and are you okay with this or that? Not just taking a step back and thinking about, like, okay, when I go into this, what am I going to stand for? What am I not going to stand for? But already just trying to just mark up the paper without thinking beforehand what he was willing to do.
00:52:47.990 - 00:53:00.440, Speaker B: His positions were not based on any consistent set of moral principles, and when you get into a debate about ideology and you don't have a consistent set of moral principles, you're screwed. And he walked right into that one.
00:53:01.290 - 00:53:19.980, Speaker A: Yeah, you could hear it, like I said, just in his voice, he was too caught up in all the details and not thinking big picture. All right, well, I know you have to go. You guys, this has been amazing. Thank you both so much. Is there any last thing you want to say about where can people find you or what you want them to know or think about this?
00:53:20.350 - 00:53:43.300, Speaker B: I'm on Twitter sometimes at Eric Voorhees. And yeah, just for everyone who's suffering out there from losses or risks or worries, just move through it step by step. It's never as bad as you think it is. You'll get through it. Many of us who are OGS in this space have suffered immense losses as well. And just be strong and use it as a learning opportunity and move forward. Nothing's more important than your own life and well being.

The Department of justice seizes $3.36 billion in bitcoin the US. Department of justice seized 50,000 bitcoins from James Zhang, the hacker who stole from Silk Road, a dark web marketplace. The raid happened in November 2021, when the seized bitcoin was worth $3.36
00:54:45.414 - 00:55:12.282, Speaker A: billion, which represents the second largest seizure in the history of the US. Government. Additionally, Zhang pleaded guilty to wire fraud and could face up to 20 years in prison. OFAC updates. Its tornado cash, sanctions the US. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control modified its sanctions against CryptoMixer. Tornado Cash revoking the initial designation and redesignating to clarify what person Tornado Cash is.
00:55:12.282 - 00:56:09.780, Speaker A: According to the redesignation, the entity known as Tornado Cash is the unincorporated association of Tornado Cash's founders, associated developers, and the Tornado Cash Dao OFAC has not, however, designated any of those individuals at this time. Coin Center's Peter Van Falkenberg tweeted that these changes do not alter the advocacy group's strategy. In its lawsuit, the SEC wins its case against library credit. The securities and Exchange Commission won its case against Library, a decentralized content hosting platform. A judge ruled that Library violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens as unregistered securities. Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Digital, tweeted The Library judge reasons that even if a team is completely silent about efforts, no promises, no contracts, but premines tokens, that alone creates a sufficient expectation of profits from their efforts in common enterprise to pass the Howie test. Very bad result.
00:56:09.780 - 00:56:37.414, Speaker A: Miles Jennings of a 16 z had a very different take. Results of the Library case should be the final nail in the coffin of the utility token approach. For most projects, an ICO and no credible claims of decentralization doesn't work. USDT trades at a discount amidst the FTX crisis. Tether's Stablecoin USDT slightly lost its peg to the US. Dollar. USDT traded at a 3% discount, and it dropped to $0.93
00:56:37.414 - 00:57:24.758, Speaker A: for a few seconds on Kraken. The Trondao announced a purchase of over $1 billion of USDT to safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market. Openc Respects creator Royalties Openc, the largest NFT marketplace by trading volume, announced it will continue to enforce creator royalties on its platform. The announcement comes after many marketplaces decided to move to an optional royalties business model and may represent a relief for many creators. Miners are still in trouble this week. Bitcoin miner Iris Energy defaulted on a $103,000,000 equipment loan after the company disclosed it was in financial trouble. Moreover, Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital and Stronghold Digital Mining posted their third quarter results.
00:57:24.758 - 00:58:12.026, Speaker A: All of them missed analyst estimates, and their shares decreased in value. Michigan's death no Evidence of Foul Play Police in Puerto Rico have found no evidence of foul play in the death of maker cofounder Nikolai Michigan. Days before his death, Michigan had tweeted that the CIA and Mossad will torture me to death. Inflation pushed crypto prices during a negative week for the crypto markets, which lost over $200 billion in total market capitalization. The Consumer Price Index report was presented on Thursday, October's. Inflation came in lower than expected by analysts, and crypto prices rocketed, but not enough to make up for this week's losses. All right, time for fun bits this week.
00:58:12.026 - 00:58:34.740, Speaker A: Some of you may have noticed that I tweeted that I thought it would be great to have a comedian give their take on the FTX debacle. This week, I ended up commissioning Jenny Hogan, a stand up comedian and author of I'm More Dateable Than a Plate of Refried Beans to write and perform some jokes on what has been an absolute humdinger of a week. Please enjoy.
00:58:36.150 - 00:59:02.540, Speaker D: So I didn't follow crypto all that closely until I wound up in a relationship with a crypto engineer. He worked in an ethereum startup. Well, I say it was a relationship. We were never official, and he wanted us to be. He would always ask me if I was dating other people, and I was always like, josh, you of all people should understand the concept of an asset only having value because of how much other people want it.
00:59:03.150 - 00:59:03.610, Speaker B: Okay?
00:59:03.680 - 00:59:09.820, Speaker D: I saw what happened to Luna. I'm not going to let that be me. Yes, I'm dating other people.
00:59:10.830 - 00:59:11.338, Speaker B: Okay?
00:59:11.424 - 00:59:46.102, Speaker D: So because of him, unfortunately, I do still pay attention to the crypto markets. Crypto Winter, where we've been for the last eleven months, started to heat up the other night. Whenever I hear about the crypto world fighting, I feel like it's that scene in Mean Girls in the Gymnasium, where Lindsay Lohan realizes that every subgroup has its own drama, even the huge, huge, huge losers. I'll say it up top. I think it's really fun when the crypto markets act like the regular financial markets. I don't like change, and it's kind of homey and comforting to know that a rerun of 2008 is coming up. It's nostalgic like.
00:59:46.102 - 01:00:10.346, Speaker D: Let's put on the Friends finale. So here's to FDX, the Lehman of crypto. Okay, let's get into it. What we have is a war between two men who both go by their initials, CZ. And SBF, both celebrities in the crypto world, and the guy you just swipe left on on hinge. In the real world, CZ. Is basically the bad boy of crypto.
01:00:10.346 - 01:00:58.030, Speaker D: He runs Binance, which is not, as the name suggests, finance for bisexuals, and he would never talk to DC regulators. He's super anti regulation. He's in his mid forty s and left a traditional finance career to work in crypto, which I believe is what they call a lateral move. Think of him like James Dean, without the cool jacket or cool personality or cool anything. He's also, fun fact, partially responsible for funding Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which I have mixed feelings about. I'm mad that he helped Elon by Twitter, but I'm grateful that he's helping Elon go broke. SDF, the founder of FTX, was the good guy, which of course, is how women describe men who can't get laid.
01:00:58.030 - 01:01:12.580, Speaker D: He's super young and was sometimes called a crypto savior. That's right, like the crypto version of an essential worker. He promised to give away his billions of dollars, which, well, he just might have done.
01:01:13.030 - 01:01:14.466, Speaker A: We'll get to it.
01:01:14.648 - 01:01:58.690, Speaker D: So a week ago, he had $16 billion, which is insane, because I saw a photo of him and I had no idea that getting a haircut cost $16,000,000,001. He's done a lot to raise his public profile, including a Vogue spread with Giselle, who, he was told five minutes before the shoot began, is a very famous model. All of that is to say, no one suspected SBF was doing anything shady with money. Giselle has never made a bad choice in her entire life. It started on Sunday. CZ tweeted that Binance was liquidating any remaining FTT, the coin issued by rival exchange FTX. Binance was once part of FTX, but it spun off like a malignant tumor.
01:01:58.690 - 01:02:20.810, Speaker D: Cece claims he had to. Dump the FTT and listen. I think it's nice when crypto guys get to experience dumping things. Due to revelations about FTT, which we soon learned was that SPF was getting high on his own supply. And by that I'm referring to crypto, not weed. They're very different. Weed is mostly legal.
01:02:20.810 - 01:03:02.642, Speaker D: Someone discovered that Alameda SBS other firm, sometimes called its sister firm, making it one of very few women in crypto, held a huge amount of FTT its own coin. And it turns out FTT was pretty illiquid. CZ said he needed to drop the FTT because he was learning from Luna, which is insane. I did not realize crypto people learn from their mistakes. Anyway, after Finance dumped all this FTT 23 million coins, the price of FTT went crazy. Well, it went from $24 to 24 50 to 22 28 in just one day. Which is, to be fair, not all that unusual for a crypto coin.
01:03:02.642 - 01:03:44.770, Speaker D: Alameda then offered to buy FTT for $22 each, which seems weird, like if you're getting in trouble for holding too much of your own currency, don't buy another 23 million of that currency. That's like when I told my ex he was sleeping with too many women, and then he slept with 23 million other women. Just kidding. I've never had an ex who was successful at getting women to sleep with him. Did you miss the part about dating a crypto guy? Anyway. Then on Tuesday, Finance agreed to buy FTX. Yeah, it turned out FTX was totally insolvent, and people couldn't get their coins out.
01:03:44.770 - 01:04:24.754, Speaker D: I've dated a crypto guy, so I know what it's like when they just can't perform. It's not a good situation. CZ offered to save crypto for now, and SBF got humbled. SBF, who once made his reputation bailing out troubled crypto firms, is now on the receiving end of the bailout. He lost 94% of his net worth. How's he going to keep himself afloat with a mere $994,000,000? A lot of people who will never have as much money as him are dunking on him for being poor, and honestly, I'm here for it. But even just in the last couple days, it turns out that CZ scrapped the whole deal.
01:04:24.754 - 01:05:11.710, Speaker D: I guess his offer hinged on Binance first performing due diligence, which, of course, being a crypto exchange, meant they had to first learn what due diligence was. He said their problems were beyond his ability to fix. And then he tweeted out a list of advice for crypto users, one of which was to ignore the prices, which seems much easier to say when you have a billion dollars on hand. SBX is now on the brink of collapse, and SBF said he needs $8 billion in emergency financing. I don't understand. Can't he just like mine for that? Anyway, recently, Justin and his son announced he's going to find a way to return FTX and tron users to normalcy. But I've met a lot of crypto guys, and I find that highly unlikely.
01:05:11.710 - 01:05:30.280, Speaker D: A lot of people are concerned that this means that the crypto markets will have to follow the same rules as the traditional financial markets. But I assure you, it's not that many rules. Don't worry. You can still be SEC regulated and melt the entire economy. Boys, the big banks do it all the time.
01:05:30.970 - 01:05:59.450, Speaker A: Thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about the collapse of FTX. Eric and Kobe, check out the show notes for this episode.
