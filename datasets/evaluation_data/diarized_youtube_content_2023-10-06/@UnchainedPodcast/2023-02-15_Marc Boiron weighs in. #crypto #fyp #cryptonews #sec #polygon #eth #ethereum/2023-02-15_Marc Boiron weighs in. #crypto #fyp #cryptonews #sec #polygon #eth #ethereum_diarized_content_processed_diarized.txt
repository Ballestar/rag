00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.494, Speaker A: This literally has nothing to do with Staking itself. And the reason I say that's because FUD on crypto, Twitter is like, amazing, right? And everyone's talking about like, staking is going to be illegal. Staking is a security. And that's not at all what this is. And frankly, that would be like an absolutely I know there's been discussions about it, but it would be absolutely absurd outcome. That would not be logical at all. And I can't understand the legal basis for it at all.
00:00:22.494 - 00:00:53.260, Speaker A: And so it's really focused on custodial, Stake, Staking. And I think most importantly, and I think Coinbase was, frankly smart to make this distinction, which is like, how this is actually done is really important and frankly, how it's marketed as well. Right. So you've got the marketing that Coinbase does that is kind of focused on, hey, first of all, we're moving towards a really DeFi friendly company, and, hey, you can come stake here. You can secure networks. It's fantastic, right? And then you had Kraken that was more focused on, hey, come earn this return.
