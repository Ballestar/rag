00:00:59.422 - 00:01:06.286, Speaker A: app now. Today's guest is Michael Morrow, chief Executive Officer at Genesis. Welcome, Michael.
00:01:06.478 - 00:01:08.500, Speaker B: Hi, Laura. Good to be here.
00:01:09.190 - 00:01:40.730, Speaker A: Let's start with the big news. This week, tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and also added bitcoin as a form of payment. You started Genesis as the first digital asset trading desk all the way back in 2013, which was quite a different era in bitcoin, and the industry back then looked quite different. And so I just wondered, given your experience in the trenches of this industry for so long, what would you say is the significance of Tesla, one of the biggest companies in the world, putting some of its reserves into bitcoin?
00:01:41.230 - 00:02:46.730, Speaker B: So you're right, we started the first OTC desk in bitcoin back in 2013, so call it eight years ago now. And if you were to say, hey, Tesla or any company like that would be putting bitcoin onto their corporate balance sheet back then, I don't think I would have believed you. Right. You think about trading firms, you think about asset managers and hedge funds, corporates, that wasn't sort of a target audience, certainly, at the time. And I'm excited to kind of talk about this because the Tesla thing is a result, right? It's a buildup and an evolution of the asset class, as well as kind of the market infrastructure, which led to Tesla's investment on bitcoin that got announced this week. And so it's certainly come a tremendous evolution and progress within the ecosystem. And the exciting thing about it is, yes, it's great.
00:02:46.730 - 00:02:55.940, Speaker B: Elon Musk and Tesla and a billion and a half, big number. This is just the and, you know, love to kind of chat about all of that today.
00:02:56.870 - 00:03:09.340, Speaker A: Yeah. So your company actually has a new offering that relates directly to this news. But before we do that, why don't we just give the audience an overview of what products and services janice has been offering over this time.
00:03:09.710 - 00:04:13.086, Speaker B: So, as I mentioned, we started our bitcoin trading desk in 2013, really kind of catering towards high net worth individuals and whatever sort of adventurous institutional accounts wanted to buy bitcoin back in 2013. This is when the price of bitcoin was around $80. And for us, we said, hey, there's no block trading in bitcoin really kind of happening. And the only real exchanges that had volume were mount gox and bitstamp, right? That was pretty much the only two that were around at the time. And we said, okay, if bitcoin is to be an institutional asset class, we were a broker dealer. So we had sort of the regulatory oversight from SEC and FINRA. Let's be the broker dealer in bitcoin, let's be the trusted regulated counterparty and try to get as many of kind of the hedge funds and institutions and high net worth guys to kind of get involved, right? And we started it knowing that, hey, maybe bitcoin goes to zero.
00:04:13.086 - 00:04:52.470, Speaker B: And I know we still talk about that today as a possibility, even though every day that bitcoin doesn't go to zero, it becomes less likely that it does. But back then, that was a real thing, right? The possibility of an $80 bitcoin going to zero was far greater than what it is today. And frankly, mount gox happened right, less than a year after we traded launched the Jesk. And we're like, oh, maybe this is it. Maybe this is kind of the bitcoin going to zero moment after kind of the big hack. But over time, trading was really what we focused on. We said, hey, let's try to build some holders.
00:04:52.470 - 00:05:41.130, Speaker B: Let's kind of transition bitcoin from the early, early guys right into the real early guys and saying, okay, let's kind of help facilitate that transaction. But OTC trading was all we did right from 2013 to 2018, really? And why? Because the market wasn't ready for anything else. For us to try to build kind of the traditional institutional market infrastructure in bitcoin in 2014 1516. And anything else other than block trading would have been premature. 2017 changed the game. The last kind of the bull market, really. Yes, it was retail focus, and we saw a lot of the kind of the ICOs and whatnot, but it really kind of raised press awareness.
00:05:41.130 - 00:06:38.202, Speaker B: It certainly raised attention of GPS at hedge funds and who really kind of took notice of kind of crypto as an asset class, really for the first time and got involved personally. And once they got involved personally in kind of 2017, it opened up the possibility that maybe they'll put it in their fund, right? And the institutional kind of the pie of institutions willing to get involved really kind of increased at that point in time. Then we launched our lending business in 2018. That was really a function because, hey, now there are more institutions getting involved. Maybe people would want to hedge, maybe people would want to start shorting. And we've really kind of been of the view that a two way price discovery is perfectly normal, natural and healthy for the ecosystem to ultimately survive and evolve into an institutional asset class. Yet there wasn't a way to do it right.
00:06:38.202 - 00:07:11.334, Speaker B: We had BitMEX for a long time as kind of the derivative platform for Hedging and Shorting. CME introduced the Bitcoin Futures product at the end of 2017. But in early 2018, there was no way to do it in the spot market. And so we said, okay, let's create this borrowing lending market around crypto. We get stock loans and borrowing stock exists in other markets. Let's bring this to crypto. So we launched our lending business in 2018 and then we bolted on custody in May of last year.
00:07:11.334 - 00:07:43.354, Speaker B: We acquired a digital asset custodian called Vault based in the UK. And then we also launched a derivatives trading desk. So we got involved in facilitating transactions of options in crypto, also in May of last year. So what we are today so we are a crypto prime broker. We facilitate spot and derivative transactions, both buying and selling. We offer the ability to borrow and lend crypto and US dollars backed by crypto collateral. We also custody assets for third parties.
00:07:43.354 - 00:07:59.110, Speaker B: We have clients taking advantage of the ability to buy on Genesis, lend some of their assets through the platform, or have just Genesis custody as a one stop shop prime broker platform geared entirely towards institutions.
00:08:00.010 - 00:08:06.086, Speaker A: And so your latest offering is Genesis Treasury. How did you come to launch that and what does that service offer?
00:08:06.268 - 00:09:14.270, Speaker B: So for a long time, I think when we thought about possible buyers, possible people who might be interested in the asset class, as I mentioned, corporates were not really on a really, you know, I think Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy kind of like, changed the game as it relates to possibilities of what Bitcoin might be able to know. And his firm kind of took their firm position in Bitcoin and obviously kind of doing it at the scale and magnitude that they decide to kind of jump, I say jump in with both feet. I feel like if he had more feet than that, he'd jump in with more, right? And really doing it. I think it really kind of said, well wait a minute, maybe we've been missing out on a potential market segment here. Maybe we've been too narrow in thinking about who could do this, who could own this. And so we said, okay, let's start targeting this. Let's say, hey, if you're a corporate CEO, CFO or treasurer.
00:09:14.270 - 00:10:00.406, Speaker B: Now there's this idea around Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset is a thing. It is happening and it should be on your radar because if you don't, other people will. And to date, the market has given you credit. The stock market has rewarded you for having Bitcoin on your balance sheet or having some sort of Bitcoin or blockchain play as part of your product and services and said, okay, let us be the one to educate you. Let us be the one to tell you how all of this works, the trading and the custody aspect. Yes, of course, but these are corporates. These are larger companies with compliance departments, with finance and accounting and legal.
00:10:00.406 - 00:10:18.020, Speaker B: Let us hold your hand. Let us explain to you everything you need to know and really kind of pass on all of the knowledge that we've gained in our eight years of doing this to help you allocate some percentage of your corporate treasury into Bitcoin. I think that's really what this offering kind of this effort is really all about.
00:10:18.790 - 00:10:37.654, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to talk a little bit more about corporate interest in Bitcoin. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

So what was so interesting about the story that you told is I actually thought you were going to say that you started getting more queries, but it was more like proactive from your end.
00:11:05.780 - 00:11:13.646, Speaker A: But then would you say that with all this news that this interest has picked up? And if so, what has that looked like inside of Genesis?
00:11:13.838 - 00:12:05.070, Speaker B: I think the beauty of Bitcoin really, and I'm reminded of this all the time, is that we're a New York based company with a lot of kind of and primarily our trading clients on the spot side are sort of US based. So we tend to really have this US based lens when we kind of look through various market opportunities. What's been fascinating about this effort is as we were thinking about launching our kind of our marketing effort around Treasuries, to your point, we were getting simultaneous inbound requests and the inbound requests from corporates were international. We were getting interest in saying, OK, yes, I get what Michael Sale or MicroStrategy have done, but I can do this if I'm sitting in Latin America. I can do this if I'm sitting.
00:12:05.150 - 00:12:09.430, Speaker A: Probably like the corporate equivalents of WinsIS Casares or something.
00:12:09.500 - 00:12:39.022, Speaker B: Absolutely. There's kind of the patient zero right, in the corporate world and kind of the Michael Sailors and said, I subscribe. I believe that makes sense to me. And yes, I can sit somewhere around the world and do this. And so what we realized was kind of the opportunity is really global and it's not really like industry specific, right. Any level of company, public or private, have the ability to do it. And so we've really been hard at work.
00:12:39.022 - 00:13:16.140, Speaker B: Look bitcoin hit its all time high this morning yet again. And there was lots of news around BNY Mellon and kind of the crypto custody product and all of it at the same time. So we're busy servicing a lot of trades, but we're really also busy answering these questions from these corporations. How do we do this? What do we need to learn? Help me educate my board, right? And so the transaction is the last piece of it. It's really kind of the education and kind of getting them comfortable with the entire process that we're really busy doing.
00:13:16.510 - 00:13:33.014, Speaker A: And you spoke at MicroStrategy's Bitcoin for Corporations event last week. Would you say that that kind of kicked off a new wave of interest? Or did you see that based on even news from Square and Mass Mutual and Rougher and the others, what have been kind of the catalysts that you've noticed?
00:13:33.162 - 00:14:33.534, Speaker B: It's interesting. So the inbound requests and kind of the corporations we've been working with preceded the MicroStrategy event. However, at the same time, the Bitcoin for Corporation event really kind of allowed people to appreciate is kind of the bitcoin as collateral narrative. What I mean by that is we launched our lending business three years ago, and a big portion of our current lending business is folks that are posting their bitcoin that they've purchased as collateral and borrowing US. Dollars against it. And the idea that bitcoin is good collateral is new. Certainly as treasurers and CFOs are getting up to speed on bitcoin in the asset class, I think a part of them are like, okay, great, let's say I lock up, whatever, 510, 20% of my corporate treasury reserves in Bitcoin.
00:14:33.534 - 00:15:22.686, Speaker B: Let's say I do it. What if I have US dollar expenditures? What if I have to tap into my treasury to meet some expense or to do something else related to corporate development? Do I have to sell my bitcoin? Right? And obviously, selling the bitcoin to get it us dollars has tax consequences up or down. And I think people are like, wait a minute, I can get access to US dollars without selling my bitcoin is a newer concept. So people now are like, so I'm not locked into bitcoin and I don't have to actually sell it. To get liquidity is part of kind of the education process. Again, as people really learn how far this industry has come. This was not a thing 2015 2016.
00:15:22.686 - 00:16:00.778, Speaker B: This ability to kind of borrow and lend against bitcoin as collateral is really sort of a manifestation of just the last couple of years of development that's happened in the space. And that's what I tried to highlight in my session at the MicroStrategy event was, hey, you can borrow against this. And arguably, Bitcoin is the best collateral in the world for anything, being that it trades 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it trades billions and billions of dollars every day. What other asset can you get liquidity on at 03:00 A.m. On a Sunday morning? Right, you can't, except in Bitcoin.
00:16:00.954 - 00:16:49.840, Speaker A: So I totally understand everything you're saying. I can imagine there would be this demand. I just wonder how the conversations would be different if it were kind of like right after what looked like to be some kind of peak. Because we've all seen Bitcoin tends to trade, of course, in this upward trend, but there have been times when it's probably been trading below what its value probably is and then above also what its value probably is. And so what do you imagine a conversation would be like with a corporation at that time? Would it simply be that the ratio of any loans they might take out has to be within a certain range? Or that what they put into Bitcoin should not be money that they would want to touch for x number of time period or whatever.
00:16:50.370 - 00:17:11.346, Speaker B: I think all of the kind of the volatility market risk related to kind of putting Bitcoin, their balance sheet is also part of the education process, right? MicroStrategy went kind of like full bore 100% of their corporate treasury and took out debt on top to go buy more Bitcoin. Right. That's on one hand, however, their timing.
00:17:11.378 - 00:17:17.558, Speaker A: Is so good that this is probably not going to be an issue for them, but anyway probably right, but at.
00:17:17.564 - 00:17:22.406, Speaker B: The time that's a significant risk as a publicly traded company to be able to do.
00:17:22.508 - 00:17:22.834, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:22.892 - 00:18:23.120, Speaker B: Then on the other hand, you had square that I think put 1% of kind of their corporate treasury into Bitcoin. There you go, you have 1% to 100%. There is now a full spectrum of possibilities and I think within that band a company is able to figure out what level of participation in Bitcoin is comfortable for their risk appetite, right, and to kind of be able to deal with the volatility. And two, as it relates to the loan to value question as related to the loans. Yes, your loan to value absolutely matters, which is why for us, we are certainly lending at over collateralized to Genesis. So folks are posting more in Bitcoin as collateral than they are getting in dollars in the loan. And there's obviously margin calls should the price of Bitcoin fall, meaning the price of the collateral falls within a certain band and they'll be posting additional collateral to Genesis at the same time.
00:18:23.120 - 00:19:03.260, Speaker B: LTV also affects the interest rate, right. The more they are putting as Bitcoin and collateral, the less risky alone it is certainly to the Genesis. And so we were able to offer a lower interest rate for the client to be able to do with their US dollars. So ultimately there is an LTV conversation to be had and there are certainly benefits to posting more Bitcoins and kind of be able to enjoy that US dollar at a lower rate. But frankly, what else are you doing with your bitcoins, right? It's sitting in cold storage in some facility. And so this is a way for them to be able to put some of that bitcoin to work.
00:19:03.790 - 00:19:36.340, Speaker A: And another issue that publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin will have to deal with. This is from my understanding, so please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, but with GAAP accounting rules, the value of the Bitcoins by the end of the quarter will be determined by the lowest value at which they were traded in the quarter. And so obviously, that seems like a negative aspect for those corporations. But is there any other way around it, or is there any situation in which that could be a positive, or do you think that potentially the rules around this might change?
00:19:37.190 - 00:20:29.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're referring to kind of the lower of cost or market as kind of the accounting methodology within gap to account for bitcoin as an intangible on your balance sheet. And frankly, you have to do it this way as a corporation, because investing in bitcoin is not their core business, right? If it was their core business, then accounting treatment would be different. But for this, they have other business lines in fintech or tech or it related businesses. And certainly gap accounting kind of gets companies to react that way. It's good in a way because most of these companies are not playing this for the short term game. Right. You book the asset on your books, and certainly if it trades down, gap accounting forces you to kind of recognize the unrealized loss and kind of book it that way.
00:20:29.254 - 00:21:22.262, Speaker B: But if price appreciates, the highest you can book it at is the price you paid for the asset, and you can't really realize the benefit of it until you are either selling it and kind of realizing the ultimate gain. Accounting itself, I don't think actually drives the reason for an investment decision, and it certainly shouldn't be the reason why you do anything. It's kind of either favorable or unfavorable accounting treatment. Ultimately, these companies have conviction. These companies are willing to put especially these publicly traded companies are putting shareholder value money into work in bitcoin. Have to have that certain level of conviction. So, yes, the accounting is kind of the temporary what does it look like on your balance sheet? But the ultimate reason to do it is much greater than that is kind of the idea around, hey, we really kind of believe in bitcoin, and this is a long term hold play.
00:21:22.262 - 00:21:33.020, Speaker B: And so I don't really kind of need to mark to market my intangibles all the time to kind of show how smart an investment it was that we made.
00:21:33.630 - 00:21:50.800, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, for any shareholder who would freak out about that, then they probably don't understand the value proposition of bitcoin. All right, well, so I wondered from your institutional niche within bitcoin, what do you expect to happen over the next year.
00:21:51.570 - 00:22:51.780, Speaker B: So I said earlier, right at the beginning about Tesla's investment kind of just being just the beginning. And it's funny, throughout 2020, throughout last year, we talked about the macro investors, kind of the legendary jump paul Tudor jones and the Stanley drucken. Millers kind of coming out and saying, hey, I'm long bitcoin, or I'm a believer in bitcoin, gave cover right to other macro guys to start investing in bitcoin. It was no longer strange. And I really do think kind of the elon musk and jack dorsey coming out and saying, put bitcoin in the balance, gives corporates cover to do just the same. And frankly, it's funny now the media narrative is, why aren't you putting bitcoin on your balance sheet? CFO? It's turned around so much so that every interview right now that's happening, that question gets asked. And so I fully expect companies to continue to do this.
00:22:51.780 - 00:23:13.430, Speaker B: And as I said earlier, the phenomenon is global. This isn't just a us only thing. I think we'll continue to see the corporates kind of putting bitcoin onto their treasury, especially in countries where their fiat value is kind of depreciating much, much faster than just kind of holding the dollar.
00:23:14.090 - 00:23:25.280, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I expect the same. I actually honestly saw a few mainstream stories going the other direction, and I was like, I don't think you're talking to the right people because they don't know what's going on.
00:23:26.930 - 00:23:40.946, Speaker B: There are lots of companies we're working with, and this is a movement. This is happening. And like I said, I think it's one of these you either kind of run with it and adapt or get left behind.
00:23:41.128 - 00:23:46.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. All right, well, this has been so fun. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.
00:23:46.622 - 00:23:48.270, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me.

First headline big banks and credit card giants continue swiping right on crypto. Bank of New York Mellon, the nation's oldest bank and a custodian of $41 trillion in assets, is making a move into crypto. According to the wall street journal, the bank will hold transfer and issue bitcoin and other cryptos on behalf of its clients. Quote, we are starting with the anchor in this space, which is custody.
00:24:59.254 - 00:25:41.450, Speaker A: Mike demisi, head of advanced solutions at BNY mellon, told CoinDesk he went on, then it comes down to what our clients need from us. So that's not just safekeeping of these assets, they want to leverage them for lending purposes, they want to leverage them for collateral. Then we are also looking at issuing digital assets like Tokenized securities real assets. BNY is the first large US. Based custodian to release a plan for storing crypto as it would any other asset. Although BNY declined to say which crypto native companies it is using to build out its solution, it did confirm that the bank is relying on outside partners. Mastercard announced it will offer its merchants the option to receive payments in select cryptocurrencies later this year.
00:25:41.450 - 00:26:37.350, Speaker A: The company's philosophy towards cryptocurrency is simple quote It's about choice, Mastercard vice president for blockchain and digital asset products Raj Damandaran wrote in a blog post. Mastercard is not attempting to pressure consumers or businesses into using crypto, he said. Rather, they are here to, quote, enable customers, merchants and businesses to move digital value however they want. Demandaran later highlighted the four key items Mastercard is seeking in its crypto asset selection process consumer protection, strict compliance protocols, adherence to local laws, and consumer demand. According to CoinDesk, Mastercard has previously interacted with crypto through partnerships with wirex and uphold, but those programs were only for payments, not settlements. This will be the first time Mastercard will be accepting crypto payments without converting it to fiat for merchants. Next headline as ETH futures launch.
00:26:37.350 - 00:27:21.610, Speaker A: Analysts say Ethereum's future looks bright. CME Group, the world's largest derivatives marketplace, launched an ETH futures product on Monday. In an interview with a block, Tim McCourt, CME's managing director and global head of equity products, said ETH contracts were traded roughly 388 times to the tune of roughly 19,400 ETH, or $33 million. McCourt said quote the response to Ether has been overwhelming. According to CME, each contract is made up of 50 ETH and priced in US. Dollars, with the minimum trade size being five contracts. The enthusiasm about ETH futures spilled over into the price of Ether, which roared past one $800 on Tuesday, over triple its price.
00:27:21.610 - 00:28:07.430, Speaker A: When the CME futures were announced in midDecember, it was still trading around there as of press time. Also, Ethereum, 20 reached a milestone, indicating a bullish future. Over 3 million ETH is now staked on the network. Chao Wang, cofounder of Masari Research, tweeted that the earliest traditional financial institutions that bought BDC are already looking at ETH, if not bought already, and rightfully so. The most used crypto network and plus future of finance, plus a potential deflationary monetary policy narrative, make it extremely compelling. He projects the price of ETH will be between $5,000 and $20,000 by the end of this bull run. Next headline bitfinex repays Tether ahead of schedule.
00:28:07.430 - 00:29:19.482, Speaker A: Last Friday, Crypto Exchange and sister company to Tether, bitfinex announced that it had repaid a $550,000,000 loan to Tether. In a statement on its website, Bitfinex said, quote, all interest due on the loan has been paid, the loan has now been repaid early and in full, and the line of credit has been canceled. According to the block quote Tether initially opened a credit line worth $900 million for Bitfinex, of which $750,000,000 was used by the exchange because Bitfinex was in need of short term cash in 2018. At that time, Bitfinetsks lost access to $850,000,000 in customer and corporate funds when they were seized by a payment processor, Crypto Capital. Bitfinex repaid two installments of $200 million on the loan in 2019 and 2020, leaving the balance at $550,000,000, which they paid off this week. This was the third and final installment of payments to close out the loan, which was due in November 2021. The financial lifeline has been heavily scrutinized since April 2019, when the New York Attorney General's office alleged Bitfinex used Tether's loan to secretly cover the exchange's shortfall.
00:29:19.482 - 00:30:10.702, Speaker A: In other stablecoin news, Tether's market cap recently crossed the $30 billion mark. Next Headline DFI Roundup The St. Louis Fed released a DFI research paper last Friday, which concluded that while DFI is still, quote, a niche market with certain risks, it also has interesting properties in terms of efficiency, transparency, accessibility and composability. The paper was written by Fabian Shah, a professor for distributed ledger technologies at the University of Basel. Next in the Roundup DFI Protocol Yearn utilized its treasury to pay back victims of the 9.7 million die flash loan attack last week.

Next Headline Mev is Becoming a Problem on Ethereum A recent research report by Paradigm on miner extractable value, aka mev, highlighted the potential pitfalls that come with allowing miners to arbitrarily, include, exclude, and reorder transactions within blocks they produce. Paradigm defines mev as, quote, the measure of profit a miner can make through their ability to arbitrarily, include, exclude, or reorder transactions within the blocks they produce. The report indicates that while most miners are not exploiting this feature now, within the last three months, Paradigm says, quote A small but meaningful portion of the hash rate has been observed exploiting mev themselves revenue sharing with traders. Rather than allowing permissionless, fee auctions and selling access to private memory pools, Paradigm believes miners will pursue even more exotic forms of mev, potentially even colluding, which could end up harming users and ethereum, creating a sort of invisible tax on the protocol and encouraging consensus instability. Additionally, Paradigm says mev can be seen on Bitcoin as well, though it is less of an issue there.

Reuters recently reported that German prosecutors have confiscated from a bitcoin miner a stash of 1700 bitcoin worth about $81 million as of press time. However, all they have is this hardware wallet. What they don't have is the man's password to unlock it. The bitcoin miner was sentenced to two years in prison for installing bitcoin mining software on other people's computers without asking permission, which is how he built his stash of 1700 BTC. He already served his time and maintained his silence about the password throughout while the police repeatedly tried to crack the code.
