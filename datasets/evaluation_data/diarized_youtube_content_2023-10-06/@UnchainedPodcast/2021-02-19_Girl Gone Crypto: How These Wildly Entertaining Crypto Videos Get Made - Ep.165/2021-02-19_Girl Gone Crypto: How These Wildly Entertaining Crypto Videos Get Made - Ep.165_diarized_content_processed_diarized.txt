00:01:06.878 - 00:01:08.206, Speaker C: Welcome, Leah.
00:01:08.398 - 00:01:13.860, Speaker D: Laura, thank you so much for having me as a guest on the show. I'm definitely excited to be here and chatting with you.
00:01:14.950 - 00:01:20.102, Speaker B: Great. Yeah, I'm so excited to talk with you. So, everyone, by the time this show.
00:01:20.156 - 00:01:21.686, Speaker A: Comes out, I will have been on.
00:01:21.708 - 00:01:54.290, Speaker B: Vacation for almost a week. And so before I left, which is at the time of this recording, I was looking for a fun interview to do since I wouldn't be able to do a show tied to the news. And Leah, you have some of the most fun and entertaining and smart videos on crypto that I've seen. You're well known for your weekly crypto news videos called The Crypto Minute, in which you recap the news with one liners that you shoot in a variety of different costumes and settings, but you also do a variety of different styles of interviews. So why don't you give us an overview of your crypto video work?
00:01:54.440 - 00:02:26.700, Speaker D: Yeah, so as you said, I do this kind of fun, entertaining infotainment, if you will, type of news recap from the week and just try to think of really creative ways to kind of talk about the news, like you said, with various costumes and shots and things like that. So it's been fun to kind of evolve that. I started that video series about six months ago and then kind of tune out as well. I do interviews and other kind of educational content as well, but I would say that The Crypto Minutes probably my favorite type of video that I make.
00:02:27.470 - 00:02:55.220, Speaker B: So why don't you walk us through what it's like to create one of your recaps? And I actually picked one that I really love, which is your 2020 end of year review. And for listeners, I'll actually play the video now on the video, so you can see that if you're listening on audio, you can listen to the audio. But I really urge you to find the link in the show notes and actually watch the video if you can, because the full context really just brings to life the full experience.
00:02:55.590 - 00:03:13.290, Speaker D: 2020 year, new view. Let's go. Bitcoin has risen from $3,600 in March all the way up to $28,000 in December, which is over 600% increase. Bitcoin having try bitcoin tripling this year created some big institutional whales. Hi, I'm Michael Saylor. This went to zero. Happy birthday, bitcoin white paper.
00:03:13.290 - 00:03:27.886, Speaker D: I'm a savage ethereum to put on a house. The Fed printed $9 trillion this year. Do infinity and beyond. Bitcoin is the best performing asset this year. And decade. 50 shades of grayscale. Come here.
00:03:27.908 - 00:03:29.018, Speaker C: I got the goods.
00:03:29.194 - 00:03:41.490, Speaker D: NFTs who was a hot d five summer careful buying food tokens or else you could get sentenced to eternal yam nation. Let's talk about bitcoin. Is it all season yet?
00:03:41.560 - 00:03:42.034, Speaker C: No.
00:03:42.152 - 00:03:43.362, Speaker D: Is it all season now?
00:03:43.416 - 00:03:43.730, Speaker B: No.
00:03:43.800 - 00:03:54.390, Speaker D: Is it all oh, my God. Hi, Jack. The bitcoin pizza would now be worth $270,000,000. Well, hey, all you crypto cats and kittens PayPal. Welcome. 2021 is going to be smoking.
00:03:55.850 - 00:04:35.620, Speaker B: So, Leah, that was amazing. Loved that. Can you tell us how you choose the different ways you'll portray these different news events? Like, if we just contrast some of the scenes in this video. You've got the one where you've got the glasses and cardigan outfit with the chart showing the rise in bitcoin, kind of this, like, educator look or librarian look or something. And then in the next one, you're juggling these tequila limes to discuss the bitcoin price tripling. And then a cut know, you pretending to be Michael Saylor in a whale costume. So how did you come up with those different ideas? Know, piece that all together?
00:04:36.790 - 00:05:17.886, Speaker D: Yeah, so generally what I do is just kind of throughout the week, know, find list out different news stories. And then for this one in particular, obviously, it was like the year in review. So I was really going through the past year, what were some of the biggest stories that happened? So I'll kind of list that all out and then just, I guess, really sit with it and think about if there's any interesting or fun or creative way that I could maybe portray that, whether it's a play on words or if it's maybe a costume. Like you mentioned the Michael Saylor, he's become a big bitcoin whale with MicroStrategy, right? So I was, like, could do a whale costume with the limes. It was talking about the price of bitcoin tripling. So it's juggling three limes. So I don't know.
00:05:17.886 - 00:05:31.494, Speaker D: It's just sometimes it's just trying to be playful, trying to poke a little bit of fun at things, but make it kind of educational as well. So? Yeah. I don't know. I guess just spend some time just kind of really thinking through each line.
00:05:31.692 - 00:05:41.450, Speaker B: And so how long does it take you to create these 1 minute videos? And when I mean that, I don't mean, just the filming of it, but from the brainstorming to publication.
00:05:42.270 - 00:06:00.590, Speaker D: So each video probably takes between six to 8 hours to produce, just depending on, I want to say how many costume changes there are, but really like the process of thinking through the lines, then filming and then editing and distributing. But, yeah, probably about six to 8 hours.
00:06:00.740 - 00:06:06.340, Speaker B: And so for each of these shots, do you have to do multiple takes or are you so good that you tend to get it on the first try?
00:06:06.950 - 00:06:23.560, Speaker D: So some of them take a few takes, but actually my sister helps me film them, which is a lot of fun because then we just get to hang out every week and kind of film these videos together. But every once in a while we'll get one in the first shot and I'm like, all right, we got a one take wonder here today.
00:06:25.210 - 00:06:36.490, Speaker B: Awesome. Because sometimes there is this other person in video who actually yeah, she does look a little bit like you and has the same color hair, at least. So that's your sister, I presume?
00:06:36.990 - 00:07:00.980, Speaker D: Yeah, she's a super creative person. And so I was like, it'd be fun to have someone help film because you can get a little bit cooler shots than if it's just me with the tripod. And also, it's a little awkward, especially if I'm filming outside, to just have me in a tripod, like outside filming things. And so it makes it a little more comfortable to have another person there filming as well. But it's just kind of a fun excuse to get to hang out as well.
00:07:03.590 - 00:07:19.720, Speaker B: Because I'm really impressed. Let's put it this way. Normally with this kind of thing, you have different people in all these different roles, like the writer and then the actor and then the director, et cetera. But you're kind of like doing it all, am I right, or do you outsource different parts of this?
00:07:20.170 - 00:07:51.410, Speaker D: So I do most of it myself. I do have a friend of mine that's in the crypto community that is just I think he's like super creative, so sometimes he helps me come up some shot ideas. I'll be like, hey, I haven't thought of a good one for this line yet. What do you think? And so I've got a friend that I can kind of bounce that off of. And then sometimes while we're filming, my sister might come up with an idea. So I kind of feel like I've got this great kind of group of creative people that are helping to contribute. But in terms of deciding on the news stories and doing the editing and all of that, I do that myself.
00:07:51.560 - 00:07:56.680, Speaker B: And so, in general, what are the biggest challenges, challenges that you face in creating these videos?
00:07:57.210 - 00:08:16.460, Speaker D: That's an interesting question. I would say it's really just deciding which news stories to cover, especially right now, there's so much happening all the time that it seems like when I started this series six months ago, I was like, okay, what else could I include? I need to find five more stories. And now I'm like cutting stories because there's just so many things happening every week.
00:08:18.430 - 00:08:27.754, Speaker B: I totally hear you on that. I totally get it. When you do start, I'm assuming so maybe you start with, like, 20 ideas.
00:08:27.802 - 00:08:28.014, Speaker C: Then.
00:08:28.052 - 00:08:37.630, Speaker B: How do you whittle it down to which ones you're going to include and yeah, what are your favorite memories of creating some of these ideas for how to portray one of the news events?
00:08:37.790 - 00:09:22.254, Speaker D: Yeah, so usually when I'm going through and kind of deciding which ones to pick, it'll either be one, this is such a big story, of course I have to cover it this week, or two, I just have a funny idea for it. So sometimes that prioritizes it. And so in terms of memories or favorite kind of moments from filming these Vlogs or the Crypto minute, I have to say I'm glad you picked the 2020 year, in your view, because that was the one I probably had the most fun with, just coming up with different things. I've also kind of started posting some blooper reels here and there because sometimes things go really wrong on set when we're doing these and the shots go crazy.
00:09:22.292 - 00:09:23.790, Speaker B: What are you, examples?
00:09:24.450 - 00:09:58.246, Speaker D: Okay, so I was talking about sushi, and so I had a plate of sushi, and I was trying to Imitate a rug pull. So I was like, tripping. But anyway, the sushi went flying. I was trying to hang on to it and just things like that. I have one of those money printer guns whenever I'm talking about maybe like Janet Yellen or the Fed or quantitative easing or printing money, and it just makes a mess, like these fake dollar bills all over my living room. And sometimes I'll find them later. Actually, this was kind of funny.
00:09:58.246 - 00:10:19.700, Speaker D: I had a friend over, and she found one of these fake they're fake $100 bills somewhere. And she's like, look, $100 bill? And I was like, oh, it's fake. And she was like, Why do you have fake $100 bills in your couch? It was just like I had to explain the whole thing. It's a lot of kind of fun moments, I guess, come up from that.
00:10:21.430 - 00:10:25.386, Speaker B: Where did you get that fake money printer?
00:10:25.518 - 00:10:30.790, Speaker D: Oh, just amazon. I think it was, like $20. It's been a great purchase.
00:10:34.570 - 00:10:37.720, Speaker B: I guess you'll reuse the whale costume as well.
00:10:38.410 - 00:11:01.440, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. I've got some good staples that I feel like will come out more often. Like, I've got a good whale costume. I've got some good bear ears. Now, if I'm talking about bitcoin bears, there's a few that I was like, I should probably I've got an astronaut costume now to talk about going to the moon. So been trying to think about staples, a unicorn costume. If I ever talk about know those kinds of things.
00:11:02.370 - 00:11:13.700, Speaker B: Oh, my god, I love it. You're like the living crypto mascot. All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk about how girl gone crypto got into crypto. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:11:14.630 - 00:11:49.150, Speaker A: Join thousands of people from around the world who are earning bitcoin while creating a more sustainable energy future with sun exchange. On the sun exchange platform, you can easily buy solar cells that power schools, businesses, and other organizations in sunny emerging markets. You'll earn bitcoin for 20 years from the clean energy you generate while offsetting your carbon footprint. Unconfirmed listeners get their first solar cell free by visiting sunexchange.com.

00:11:50.050 - 00:11:57.860, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with leah thompson, aka girl gone crypto. So, yeah, tell us your crypto origin story.
00:11:58.710 - 00:12:53.250, Speaker D: Yeah, so I first heard about bitcoin actually, back in 2011. I had a friend who filled his entire apartment with mining rigs, was super into mining bitcoin. And so that was my first impression of bitcoin, was, what is this super nerdy weird computer thing? I mean, the apartment was so hot with all these mining rigs running. It was just this very kind of OD first experience. And so I kind of thought at first I was like, oh, well, that's cool that you're doing this, but bitcoin is maybe for people, for nerds if you want to overclassify. But then I kind of kept hearing about it. This same friend was kind of poking me to buy bitcoin, and I wish I had listened to him earlier, as I'm sure many of us do, but in kind of early mid 2017 is when I really started getting more into crypto myself.
00:12:53.250 - 00:14:35.220, Speaker D: And so I ran across this blogging platform called steam it, and I don't know if you're familiar, but it basically is where you can earn crypto for posting. So anyway, I started doing that and I started earning crypto. And what was really interesting about that is it caused me to really go down the rabbit hole and start asking a lot more questions once I physically had some crypto in my hands, like, well, what gives this value? Can I convert it to real money air quotes for those listening? Which is funny now, to think of it that way. What is this thing called an exchange? What is this thing called a wallet, a hardware wallet? Just really started to ask all those questions and start educating myself more and learning more on crypto and then started kind of poking around, seeing what other coins maybe I might want to invest in and then got to experience the whole last Bull Run and have just kind of been here in the Crypto space, kind of casually between I would say that time and then kind of mid 2019 is when I decided to launch Greg on Crypto. But the way that kind of came about even is really interesting because I was blogging on Steamit pretty consistently, almost every day, even though I wasn't blogging or making videos about crypto related things, because it's a pretty big at the time, it was a pretty big art community. So I was doing random, like, Ukulele covers and recipes, just, I don't know, really random things. But people started asking me to come speak at crypto conferences because a lot of the people that were on that platform were obviously based within the crypto world.
00:14:35.220 - 00:15:05.422, Speaker D: And I was like, me. What are you talking about? I don't talk about crypto. But they just thought my story was interesting, of earning crypto for playing my Ukulele and all of these things. And so I started traveling and speaking at a few crypto conferences. And after about a year or so of that, I was like, you know, I should just try launching a crypto channel. It would be a great way for I'm obviously passionate about it. It's where I've been choosing to invest time and energy and funds and all of those things.
00:15:05.422 - 00:15:25.140, Speaker D: And so that could be kind of a fun way for me to learn more. I could interview people. I could just kind of grow my own knowledge while also making content, because it just kind of felt like the universe was pushing me in that direction. About mid 2019, I launched Grogon Crypto, and then here we are.
00:15:26.550 - 00:15:39.110, Speaker B: How did that journey go? How has your user base grown? What were some of the pivotal moments? Do you feel like there was a particular video or scene that you shot where that really caught people's attention?
00:15:40.250 - 00:16:27.634, Speaker D: Yeah. So when I first started making content, I mostly just did interviews because I'm like, you know what? Even though I've been in the crypto space at that point for a few years, kind of educating myself, I didn't feel like I really could make videos, really, like, speaking and educating. Yet I was like, I feel like I still have so much to learn. So I just started interviewing a bunch of people. And that was the majority of my content for probably the first year or eight months to a year. And since I've kind of pivoted to get a little bit more into some more of the creative stuff, which is more of what I'm doing now, which is also I'm still doing interviews. But one of the kind of pivotal moments, actually, that I think really has given way to a lot more of this kind of more creative content I've been doing was JK.
00:16:27.634 - 00:16:58.818, Speaker D: Rowling was tweeting about bitcoin. It was this huge thing. Now, obviously we've had more celebrities tweeting about bitcoin recently, but that was like a really big moment in time. And I don't know why, but I just was like, oh, I should make a response video that's like Harry Potter themed. I don't know where that idea came from exactly, but I called it the Muggles Guide to Bitcoin. And anyway, I just kind of put it in Harry Potter terms. And that's just been such a fun piece of content, even to this day, even though I posted it back in May.
00:16:58.818 - 00:17:24.458, Speaker D: People like the first thing they'll say to me is, I love your Harry Potter video. Or I never could get my kids to watch information about bitcoin, but they love your been really that was just a really fun not just a fun piece of content on its own, but I think it kind of opened my eyes a little bit. Like, wow, people like this kind of sillier, maybe more fun, but still smart kind of content. And so I think that was kind of a turning point for me too.
00:17:24.624 - 00:17:29.900, Speaker B: Yeah, that is a great video. It has a quarter of a million views. And did she ever respond to that?
00:17:30.210 - 00:17:34.800, Speaker D: She didn't, but that's okay, I've come to terms with it.
00:17:35.410 - 00:17:48.370, Speaker B: Well, hopefully she's watched it because it is a really good explainer. I love it. And out of curiosity, when I was watching it, I was like, wait, did she have to get copyright permission? I was just wondering how that works.
00:17:48.440 - 00:17:50.066, Speaker D: Because there's kind of a lot of.
00:17:50.088 - 00:17:53.906, Speaker B: Scenes from Harry Potter and I was like anyway, I was just wondering how that part works.
00:17:54.008 - 00:18:40.260, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a really interesting question. And so all the research I had done, and to be honest, I'm still not 100% sure that I'm correct on this. Is that footage if it's not the main purpose of the video and if I'm not using any audio from the video is eligible for use under kind of fair use kind of things. But to be honest, I am more cautious now as I'm going forward. Because even if something might technically be under fair use, that doesn't mean that you might not run into issues in the future. And so as my kind of channels have continued to grow, I've been more conscious of that sort of thing. For those who haven't seen it, I recorded with the green screen and then put a bunch of Harry Potter footage behind me that's actually still something I'm not 100% positive on.
00:18:41.670 - 00:19:04.170, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, well, maybe we can look that up because I was wondering because I think it's like a two minute video or something, but it is a bunch of different scenes. It's not like one continuous, you know, what are all the different social media platforms that you reach people on and what do you find are the differences of the crypto audience between these different platforms?
00:19:04.510 - 00:19:53.386, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question. So Twitter is probably the platform I'm the most active on. And I feel like with Twitter, one thing that I love about that in terms of the audience and the people that are there is it's such a mix of kind of OG cryptos, and then you've got traders, you've got people that are new to crypto, you've got people that are kind of in this middle section, I would say, where maybe they understand a certain amount, but they want to learn more. And there's maybe certain topics that they're like. I don't totally get that yet and so that's kind of my core audience. I would say that I'm really thinking about when I'm making a lot of more educational kind of content is the people that know what the word blockchain means, they know what some of these things are, but some of these maybe finer details know, wanting to kind of dive into a little more. So I like that.
00:19:53.386 - 00:20:41.080, Speaker D: On Twitter you have such a mix. On YouTube, I would say it's also a mix, but definitely have a little bit more of the beginner kind of people are searching for information, they're searching know, they're trying to learn actively and so you maybe have more of that crowd. TikTok is another platform that I'm pretty active on making some more of that kind of creative type content that we've talked about, but in more of like a TikTok format. And those are very beginner entry level, I would say, in terms of their understanding of Bitcoin and their interest in it. And so that's been really actually kind of exciting for me to get to speak to that audience of people that are truly like, maybe they know what dogecoin is and that's about it. But I'm seeing more and more interest in terms of learning more about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in that kind of realm as well.
00:20:41.850 - 00:20:51.722, Speaker B: And so is this like a hobby for you? Are you able to make income this way or how does this combine with your other work?
00:20:51.856 - 00:21:32.602, Speaker D: Yeah, so I have actually just recently, only about a month ago, quit my day job, if you will, and have gone full time here in crypto, which is really exciting. I worked for the same company and it was a tech company, I worked there for like eight years. And so it was a big decision to leave that and kind of jump into this. But yeah, I've been really grateful. I've got some awesome sponsors that have helped to support my channels. But also it's kind of funny. This isn't something I really set out to do, but I joke that I have a video production company because crypto brands will reach out to me saying, hey, we need to get these tutorials made for our website about our wallet or our project, whatever it is.
00:21:32.602 - 00:21:51.582, Speaker D: And are you interested? Can we hire you to make videos for us? And so that's been kind of an unexpected additional kind of line of work, if you will, is just kind of working with some of these crypto brands to help distill down their message of what they're trying to say and make educational content about their products for their customer base.
00:21:51.716 - 00:21:52.622, Speaker B: Oh, that's great.
00:21:52.676 - 00:21:53.374, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:21:53.572 - 00:21:56.580, Speaker B: So now that you've made the leap, what do you have planned next?
00:21:57.670 - 00:22:29.626, Speaker D: I'm just so excited for 2021 to really double down on all of this, to make more content, to make the content better. I'm always thinking about how can I up the production quality? How can I make it more interesting? So I'm just really excited to I don't know if this sounds cheesy, but to say just kind of explore my own curiosity and excitement and see what people are getting stoked about and do more of that, I just think 2021 is going to be a really fun year for making content great.
00:22:29.728 - 00:22:45.138, Speaker B: And before we go, are there any other favorite videos that you want to urge the listeners to watch or just maybe favorite scenes that you want to give a backstory for? For some of the I know you told us some of the bloopers, but if there's any other stories you want to add.
00:22:45.304 - 00:23:57.160, Speaker D: One of the things that I've been really kind of working on and having some fun with is taking my more educational videos and adding in elements of what I do in the crypto minute to those. And that's been a more recent change that's been a lot of fun where maybe I'll do an explanation video. I have like a two minute Crypto Explainer video series where I try to take topics and kind of break them down in just a couple of minutes, but adding in kind of costumes and kind of silly footage and broll and things to make them a little bit more engaging. Because really my goal is to make learning about Crypto Feel a lot more approachable and fun. I know that a lot of content can feel a little bit technical and a little overwhelming, and if you're just trying to learn about something and it's all like these big hour long videos that might feel a little overwhelming to dive into and so just kind of short bite size tutorials.
