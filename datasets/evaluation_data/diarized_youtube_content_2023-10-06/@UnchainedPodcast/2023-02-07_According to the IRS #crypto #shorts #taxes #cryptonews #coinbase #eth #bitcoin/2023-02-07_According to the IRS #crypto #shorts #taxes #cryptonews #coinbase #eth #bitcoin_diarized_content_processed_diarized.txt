00:00:00.250 - 00:00:32.326, Speaker A: Just remember these five situations and if you fall into these five situations, you could have a taxable event and a liability. So number one, just cashing out crypto pretty self explanatory. You have bitcoin, you sold it and made a profit. You got to file taxes. Number two is crypto to crypto trades. Even though you are not necessarily realizing cash in hand, you still had to pay taxes if you are making a gain. The third situation is when you spend cryptocurrency or an NFT to buy a goods or service that triggers a disposition event and you might have a taxable liability there.
00:00:32.326 - 00:00:56.810, Speaker A: Number four is when you earn crypto that also triggers a taxable event. That's what Lawrence just described. You can earn cryptocurrencies to wagers staking income, mining income, yield, interest type products, and et cetera. And the final bucket where you could be subject to tax access would be airdrops and hard folks. Airdrops happen frequently in the industry.
