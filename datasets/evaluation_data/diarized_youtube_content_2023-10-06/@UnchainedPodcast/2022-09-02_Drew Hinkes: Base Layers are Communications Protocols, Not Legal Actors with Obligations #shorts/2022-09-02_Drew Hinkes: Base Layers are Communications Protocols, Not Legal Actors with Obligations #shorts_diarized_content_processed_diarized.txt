00:00:00.250 - 00:00:32.370, Speaker A: You can make an argument that, for instance, banks are regulated, but the Swift protocol by which banks communicate with each other is not regulated. OFAC doesn't tell the Swift network don't send a message here. It tells participating banks don't honor messages. From this bank we saw with Russia. For instance, Burbank, which is largest bank, I think in Russia, used to be a member of Swift. And there was political pressure placed on Swift so that the member banks, which include non US. Banks, would discontinue communications over Swift with Verbank.
00:00:32.370 - 00:00:52.810, Speaker A: So it may not be the cleanest analogy, but there is an argument to be made that we should think about the base layer, irrespective of whether there are entities that are providing services on the base layer, as if it's a communications protocol and not a set of legal actors with obligations.
