I'm here again for the Blockchain Summit, which is hosted by the Bitfury Group and Bill Ty, who was a guest on the podcast last year and whose amazing episode you should definitely check out. This year's summit is where I met today's guest, Roya Makbub, a serial entrepreneur and president of Digital Citizen Fund, Digital Citizen Brew. And Eddie eddie.
00:01:20.658 - 00:01:26.850, Speaker A: And in 2013, she was named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. Welcome, Roya.
00:01:26.930 - 00:01:28.886, Speaker B: Thank you, Laura, for having me here.
00:01:29.068 - 00:01:44.240, Speaker A: So, Roya, out of all the Bitcoin entrepreneurs I've ever interviewed, I would say you have the most different and most inspiring story. And you're also using Bitcoin in one of the most different ways. So you're originally from Afghanistan. How did you get your start with technology?
00:01:45.010 - 00:02:25.990, Speaker B: Well, at age of 16 years old, I heard about that. There is a box that a magic box that you can touch and you can connect with the world and you can ask any question that you want. And then also you can talk with the people while that meeting with them and they are ready to answer your questions. So for me, at age of 16, I hear that there is Interclap just open in Harat. And I went there and that's for the first time when I used the Internet and used the computer and I found out that there is a new world outside waiting for me to explore it. And that's what everything's changed for me from that point on. I decided to make technology the center of my career.
00:02:26.070 - 00:02:31.002, Speaker A: So what were you doing back then? Was it just like you were googling questions or what?
00:02:31.056 - 00:02:34.670, Speaker B: I mean, before using the computer?
00:02:34.820 - 00:02:35.086, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:35.108 - 00:03:11.482, Speaker B: Like when you started yeah, I was googling when you put any infrared, like any words, you could get thousands of news or get a lot of the articles. That was very interesting because at Herod in 2003 the Taliban just left it and it was very limited books in the library and it was very old books and then mostly coming from Iran and then we didn't had any updated information and for me was fascinated at this small box. We can find any information. Thousands of the books or millions of the books are available.
00:03:11.616 - 00:03:13.498, Speaker A: And did you speak English at that time?
00:03:13.584 - 00:03:33.518, Speaker B: No, it was in Farsi. You could also find a lot of information. But I learned English actually through social media. I mean, through chatting. I hear that there was a Yahoo messenger. You could go to the public and then you could chat with the people. And for me it was interesting, but I was very shy and very unconfident person.
00:03:33.518 - 00:03:47.306, Speaker B: But when I started chatting with people, it's increased my confidence and I learned more and I tried to learn and I had a book to checking the words and in English, and I can write. So that's how I learned.
00:03:47.358 - 00:03:50.946, Speaker A: Wait, are you serious? Did you have any formal education in English?
00:03:51.058 - 00:04:10.518, Speaker B: Not that much, there was some books that were available but later on I had classes in our university that I took it because we were lucky and we had the German as our teachers. The only way to communicate our teacher were English. Was English.
00:04:10.694 - 00:04:18.238, Speaker A: That's amazing, I'm so impressed with that. So then you also started a company at a young age, how did you come to start your first company?
00:04:18.404 - 00:04:41.240, Speaker B: Well, I started working in university It coordinator for three years and then I went to move to minister of higher education and work as project manager of the It department and then at that time I meet with Paul Brankley and Nadaraskoid, he was on the Secretary of Defense at that time.
00:04:41.770 - 00:04:43.270, Speaker A: Like an american.
00:04:43.420 - 00:05:10.602, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. And then they were coming and then they had a concept to bring building a technology center in Harat. And that we were discussed about that. But at that time I said, okay, we created a lot of the software and it was mostly free. And we showed us software and applications to a team that he brought from Silicon Valley. And everyone is encouraged us. And then we said, that why we don't make it commercialized.
00:05:10.602 - 00:05:13.770, Speaker B: And then that's how I started the software.
00:05:13.850 - 00:05:17.666, Speaker A: Oh interesting, you developed it for the ministry but then you we developed it.
00:05:17.688 - 00:06:01.360, Speaker B: For university and ministry but it was a team of the girls mostly and also there was boys as well but we built most of the educational software free and giving to the public. We didn't tell at that time that maybe might be able to make it commercialized and make money. But then when they came and they're discussing about big projects and then they said, why we don't start it. And then I started my first company and at the same time Task Force Sustainably operation. They builded an incubator in Was. Who was it task force for? Business civilian operation. It was a program by DoD of US.
00:06:01.360 - 00:06:03.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:03.892 - 00:06:04.190, Speaker A: Okay.
00:06:04.260 - 00:06:21.026, Speaker B: They built an incubator, the first incubator in Harat and they brought IBM and Google but the IBM advisor mentor were like I was one of the seven companies that we were in that incubator.
00:06:21.138 - 00:06:23.446, Speaker A: And what did your company do and what was it called?
00:06:23.548 - 00:06:48.446, Speaker B: It was called Afghanistan Sofia. Before that incubator build we started to working in the coffee shop and restaurants because we didn't have a place to work. And my work was we provided services in It infrastructure, procurement of the computers, building the networks for universities and then also we're building the software or giving the consultancy on the application.
00:06:48.548 - 00:06:49.886, Speaker A: So like it services.
00:06:49.988 - 00:06:53.102, Speaker B: Yes, it full. It services for it.
00:06:53.236 - 00:06:55.202, Speaker A: And how old were you when you started that company?
00:06:55.336 - 00:06:56.818, Speaker B: I was 23.
00:06:56.984 - 00:06:58.722, Speaker A: Wow, that's amazing.
00:06:58.856 - 00:06:59.634, Speaker B: Yes.
00:06:59.832 - 00:07:04.180, Speaker A: And who were your investors and clients like how did you find business?
00:07:04.630 - 00:07:56.946, Speaker B: Well I was trying first to working with the US government and then it was good working with the US government. We could make money with the contracts but the problem was that the people were conservative and because we were mostly female engineers they didn't like that we work with them. So they started to rumors and giving other names to the conservative leaders. So we decided to work on the government AF and government's contracts. But then the other problem was AF and government contract was that based on the law women could participate but once you get a contract they make your lives like a hell to paying your payments. So my biggest problem was corruption was exist at that time and many of the contracts and with the government. And then the other problem that I had it was that they don't paying on time and I want to go.
00:07:56.968 - 00:08:02.760, Speaker A: Back earlier when you were saying when you were trying to get private clients they were giving your names to who again?
00:08:03.450 - 00:08:23.210, Speaker B: No, the private clients didn't give us our names. I mean when I was starting working for the US government for some of their contacts or NATO so then conservative and the people who didn't like that they're giving our names to the local Taliban and informed them that oh these people, they are women, they are working with military.
00:08:23.810 - 00:08:26.574, Speaker A: But what was the purpose of that? They're giving your name to Taliban because.
00:08:26.612 - 00:09:10.134, Speaker B: They send other threats to us. They didn't want their threats or they were just telling you that you shouldn't work with them or you are not anymore Muslim so they're making a lot of names for you. It wasn't only that you work for the US government also the broader problem was that if you work with a man outside it wasn't at all acceptable. And when we started in technology we were the first company as a female and I was the CEO but we had also male like a coworker. But the problem is that it wasn't problem. But it was problem for the society of conservative and male dominated that many of my employees were women and the young girls. So that wasn't acceptable.
00:09:10.134 - 00:09:45.650, Speaker B: If we giving hension or we work with, we go to the military places and became everyone's make it like a lot of rumors that they never mentioned that we were getting these contracts or if we work because of our ability, because we have to have the ability and we have talented to work to get this. They make it rumors. Oh, they do blah, blah. That's why they get the contract. So they make it that rumors was created was danger for our reputation and as well to living in that conservative society.
00:09:45.730 - 00:09:49.430, Speaker A: And you also mentioned that they put a spy in your company.
00:09:49.580 - 00:10:26.420, Speaker B: It was after that I became as a time hundred. They started to spy my company because my company grew very fast. And then I started to hire a lot of the women and also the men to working inside of my company and also work online for me. And then my competitors that didn't like that and they are mostly we call them it industry because they get the most at that time they got all the biggest contracts in it. So they put it on the spy to giving an information of whatever I had in projects, what I'm doing and everything is outside. Wow.
00:10:27.110 - 00:10:31.958, Speaker A: And also the government it sounds like was making things difficult for you. So how did you solve these problems?
00:10:32.124 - 00:11:06.754, Speaker B: Well, it was very difficult because in governments at that time it was elections going on and then Prison Cares A didn't sign the agreement. Former Prison Cares he didn't sign the agreement. The security wasn't that good. It wasn't only for my company, it was for many of the companies at that time. They had the challenges of very difficult times with the government. And the problem with the government, they didn't support my work. So that was the biggest challenges because when I went to complaining and asking them to support, they never really very supportive of to help me at that time.
00:11:06.872 - 00:11:13.620, Speaker A: And you also mentioned during the summit that your employees were even attacked. What happened?
00:11:14.070 - 00:12:07.246, Speaker B: Well, when it was in 2012, I backed that. Why what's happening after then I did a contract what was a contractor. Then I pushed back by society because they started to make rumors and then they also put they broke him our window of our office and then they sended trades in my house. And then that I moved to Kabul and then my team were in Rod. But I decided to be staying in Kabul not only to be more safe, but also just because Kabul was a bigger place that we could find the clients. And then I decided that okay, I should not be relying on the contracts anymore and I shouldn't be relying on private sectors that they don't want to work with the women. And I decided to become a citizen and using the advantage of the free market and finding the clients outside of the border.
00:12:07.246 - 00:12:59.542, Speaker B: So that's why I reached out through the LinkedIn. Someone invite me to the LinkedIn to create account and I went there and said, oh wow, this is a great place. I started to find clients there and that lead me to find an investor there that he was Italian American, lives in New York, we never met and he contacted me and then we discussed about different projects and then he interested in one of my ideas and one of our projects and he invested. And then that investment helped me to make money with advertising and network and then that's for traffic. And then I decided to giving back to the community. So when I started giving back to the community, we building the It centers inside of the schools and then we're teaching the girls about how to work with the computer.
00:12:59.676 - 00:13:02.310, Speaker A: And is all of this the Digital Citizen fund?
00:13:02.460 - 00:13:14.506, Speaker B: Digital Citizen funds. Yeah. Now they are all moved to the under digital Sum funds umbrella. At that time, my company building with the profits that we made with the platform called Woman and X.
00:13:14.608 - 00:13:18.218, Speaker A: Okay, but keep going with how you were doing that you were building these.
00:13:18.384 - 00:14:03.002, Speaker B: Education centers at that time, I feel that okay, I could overcome lots of the challenges and it's because of the technology and Internet. It's helped me to not connect to the border of country, of the domestic life, or a country that some people can make a decision about my life or my company. And I overcome a lot of challenges and struggles that we had and it's also break down the barriers for me. But I know that there are still millions of tickets who are outside. They're just like me. They're curious, but giving no vision to explore the world. They wanted to know more, but they don't know what's truly possible for them.
00:14:03.002 - 00:14:48.674, Speaker B: And that's why I decided to giving back. And I talked with my partner, my business partner, and he was totally agree. And then he says and he said, I send the 50% of free or profits, I will send 100% to building the centers. And that's how we started building the It centers. We first started with one schools, we're building one It centers for them and we got a lot of the positive. And see the girls, when I see these girls go online for the first time, it always break the memorize of the first time I use the Internet ad and Kathy Harat, you could literally see the changes in your face. These women and girls, they have their entire life just talk with close relatives and the family member and they said that they are connected with the world and they have a digital voice.
00:14:48.674 - 00:16:00.538, Speaker B: They have a voice to talk about their stories that no one wanted at that time listen to them. And the other thing is that these women and girls their entire life depending on the men and for the first time with the skills of the technology, with the skill of the internet, they feel the financial independence and this has the power how the conservative nations can change their view on the woman. So when I started building these centers, we also started to provide a training for them and then we said, okay, they learn, so what's the next finding opportunities to find a job for them. So the platform that we build it with Francesco, was called Woman and X. It was a technology that allowed the women to write blogs and upload movies and they're working online and we pay to those who write the original content and better content. We paid for some of the content provider and that lead us that we can keep continue. And then at that time I had hundreds of people who started working for me online and then we had built two offices, one in Harat, one in Kappal.
00:16:00.538 - 00:16:16.290, Speaker B: And then we started to hiring people not only from female, but also from male that they do marketing. It was easier to do it through men to go to work with the private sectors and talking easier than the women to deal with them. So that's how I started to work.
00:16:16.360 - 00:16:26.962, Speaker A: And I actually want to go back to when you stopped working with Afghan companies and the government and found your own citizen or your own clients outside. Where did you find those clients?
00:16:27.106 - 00:16:28.534, Speaker B: Mostly through LinkedIn.
00:16:28.662 - 00:16:30.278, Speaker A: Right, but like what countries?
00:16:30.454 - 00:16:58.162, Speaker B: Mostly it was in America. And then the good thing is that when I found my business partner and when he was in my company, in my idea, we shift our contract base to only focusing on working on that platform, Woman, X and develop the software. So we shifted it was just the blog. Okay, yeah. And then that platform make us enough money that we keep continue.
00:16:58.296 - 00:17:01.150, Speaker A: And the money you were generating revenue from ads?
00:17:01.230 - 00:17:26.682, Speaker B: It was from advertising and ad network and also the traffic we got 6000 of the public domain and also some from private filmmakers donated in our platform. So we created generated views and then we had like 2 million, some of them on and then we had also the months that we had 5 million viewers that they came to our platform. Great.
00:17:26.736 - 00:17:32.010, Speaker A: And I actually just also wanted to ask you about your family. Did they fully support you in all this or did they also have reservations?
00:17:33.070 - 00:18:24.542, Speaker B: When I was started, before I started my company, my family, my father was very open mind and that's why he was very supportive of what I do. My mom as well, and then my brother were at the beginning, conservative. I mean, of course, if we're living in conservative and very male dominated country and that's why they were at the beginning not happy. But when I started to social media really empowered me and I started to talk at the home and then giving the ideas at the beginning I started ignoring whatever I had an idea. But later on they started think differently. And it's very important when you're living in such conservative societies to have support of the family. If I didn't have the support of my family, I wouldn't be able to do any of these things.
00:18:24.542 - 00:18:56.594, Speaker B: Of course I motivated my family. I involved with everything they did and that's why they keep continue to support me. And where there was a time that the newbies and the men and our community they came to my father and they told that they have to stop me. He has to stop me. He had to stop me because I am dishonored the family. And I'm working with the military, I'm working with the parents and I'm taking pictures. It's not good for a Muslim woman.
00:18:56.642 - 00:18:58.540, Speaker A: Wait, I'm sorry. Who was this that came to your family?
00:19:01.390 - 00:19:24.190, Speaker B: Our society is different. The community members are like the Shora or the people that they know my father. So they reach out to friends of my father and the people who work my father worked with them. So they came and they told my father he has to stop and otherwise I might end up to be very dishonoring the family. So they have to stop it now.
00:19:24.260 - 00:19:25.642, Speaker A: And what is your father saying?
00:19:25.716 - 00:19:49.198, Speaker B: My father says that he said that he fully trusts me and he knows what I'm doing and he involves in everything and he wouldn't stop me and that's why I keep continue. But of course at that point when I receive a tax and swell it wasn't a good time to stay in herald so that's why I left it to Kabul.
00:19:49.314 - 00:19:55.574, Speaker A: Okay, and then is it at Digital Citizen fund that you were having difficulty paying your users?
00:19:55.702 - 00:20:32.658, Speaker B: It was with a woman and X platform. So we had difficulties because when the number of user increased and then we had a problem after paying the students. And many of these female students didn't have a bank account. I mean almost 99% of them didn't have a bank account. Then why not? Because based on the law of Afghanistan, women can have a bank account when they become 18 years old. But based on the culture it was mostly cultural barriers. And there are many of the family they didn't believe on the banking system or still even it's not about female.
00:20:32.658 - 00:21:21.622, Speaker B: I guess that maybe only 30% of the Afghans trust the bank they're still using the hawala system. I don't know if you hear about Howal system is hawala system is started. This 8th century is for many years was the only way trustful transfer of the money. So it's like I trust someone and then I give the money to this person and this person knows that another person and then he called that person to give a quote to that person and that person gave the money to others oh my God. It's kind of like similar to bitcoin, but it's not like really, but it's kind of at that many still in Afghanistan and many other countries are still using the Howal system.
00:21:21.676 - 00:21:23.506, Speaker A: It's like an 8th century bitcoin.
00:21:23.698 - 00:21:55.762, Speaker B: Yeah, they call the bitcoins as a 21st century of how Allah system. So that's hilarious. Yeah, the problem that and then there was also other issues that women I mean, the bank is the same. They have to go to the bank and register. They have to have every of documents and they have to have permission of the families and family didn't want to open a bank account for them. So it was a lot of the struggle that we had. And then we decided to use a PayPal account.
00:21:55.762 - 00:22:26.970, Speaker B: And PayPal didn't work in Afghanistan. And then we decided to use mobile money. And then the problem with mobile money was if we send the money, it still was. Expensive because the receiver and transfer still caught the money. So it wasn't very affordable that we send it through and at that time it wasn't really worked. They had this concept for years through USID program, but at the time that we wanted. They didn't really implement it in a way that we could use it.
00:22:26.970 - 00:23:18.022, Speaker B: So we were just looking to find a base because the number of users get increased and we didn't know how to paying. These employees. And for me, it was difficult because the money came to my bank account. And then it was also danger for me because if people find out, oh, she had a lot of money, they keep knocking and stolen. The money exists. And every time that I went into bank to get the money to distribute it, I had to brought my brother, cousin and also my other male employees to go with me to the bank to get the money and then we go together because it was difficult. And then the other problem was with the money is when you distribute the money we didn't only had the female who write the blogs, but we also had some male, but some of them, especially from male, they get the money and then they came back in and didn't deny.
00:23:18.022 - 00:23:23.194, Speaker B: And you show them the signature and they said, this is not my signature. So this was another issue there.
00:23:23.232 - 00:23:25.102, Speaker A: Wait, I don't understand. They deny what?
00:23:25.156 - 00:23:26.880, Speaker B: They deny that they get the money.
00:23:27.970 - 00:23:29.518, Speaker A: They want to be paid a second.
00:23:29.604 - 00:23:45.522, Speaker B: Yeah, for the second time. And then it was another challenge for my employees to managing of how keeping the records of these people that they get pay and then they want second times. It's like we had these difficulties a lot actually.
00:23:45.576 - 00:23:52.598, Speaker A: I also want to go back when you said you to go to the bank with your male relatives and employees the bank account was in your name, right?
00:23:52.684 - 00:24:37.574, Speaker B: Yeah. The reason is to protect us to get the money from the bank and going back to the home. And at that time, there were a lot of criminals that if they find out that you have a lot of money in the bank and when you go and coming back and forth, it was more safe to go with a couple of men. And then it was more like I think we had the trust to the people in the bank or we didn't trust environments. We decided to have some people to protect us to go and bank. And then the other thing, these are issues that I have to give the money to the different schools and the different people to come and then they distribute the money to the users. And it was a challenging for us to keep record of every person.
00:24:37.574 - 00:24:46.466, Speaker B: Banking was good if we could send to everybody and we could keep every records. But unfortunately, they didn't have a bank.
00:24:46.578 - 00:24:48.120, Speaker A: So then how did you hear about.
00:24:49.050 - 00:25:41.126, Speaker B: Then my former business partner, Francisco one day sent me an article about bitcoin. And he says, what do you think about this? And then I was reading, I was a bit skeptical, and then I said, what does it eat? And then I was reading and then he keeps sending me the article and he was so fascinated about bitcoins, and he said that royal, I'm going to move to bitcoins. And I said, at that time, I think the price of bitcoin was $800 in 2013, I guess. And then I said, yeah, it's interesting. And then when I read about the concept, it was so similar to how all the system and I was like, okay, so maybe I can explain to the people easier. And then when I started to tell students that the users how we're going to pay them, I was used the how wallet. And then I just told them that this is a new version of digital of the how.
00:25:41.308 - 00:25:51.034, Speaker A: I love it. And it's crazy to me that the system didn't change from the eigth century until the 21st century, but they replaced it with the digital version of the same old system.
00:25:51.152 - 00:26:16.450, Speaker B: That's amazing. But I mean, bitcoins has a lot of feature. I mean, blockchain and bitcoin has a lot of features that they can keep the records and a lot of other things. But still it was very easier to explain everybody. And then I said that this is the money that you can keep it. I mean, to explain to for Afghans when they don't patch something, it was difficult that they accept. But when you're talking about how SSM was easier that they can understand.
00:26:16.450 - 00:27:13.814, Speaker B: And we told them that they can keep their money in digital wallet. And the good thing is also was in the way that we browsed the bitcoins in Afghanistan was that when the students at that time when the female starts to make money some of the family take with force the money from them and they couldn't buy the things that they want. It was always when they make money, someone is taking from them. And I wanted that they have a freedom of what they make it. And of course I was totally support them, that they can support their families. But also for those who wanted to save it and wanted to keep it for their future, for their education or for whatever they needed for their lives, it was good to keep it in their digital wallet. So we teach them about how to build the e wallet and then how to keep the bitcoins there and then that's how we brought it and then another challenge was how they make it cash in case that they need it.
00:27:13.814 - 00:28:06.162, Speaker B: So then my company decided to also make them cash in the rate of what's in the market. And then we also talking with a couple of the shops that if that time that if the student has to get received bitcoins to encourage them, they can buying the stock. So we talked with some of the shops that they had the closing a new uniform for the school or going outside and they accepted in case that we immediately make for them a cash. And we discussed with them we teach them about bitcoin. So it wasn't going well. And then we decided also to talking and then there was also time that we decided to building. We also decided to building and then there was call it like there was a cart that we built it the student who had make Bitcoins if they wanted to buy online books so then we could buying for them online books.
00:28:06.226 - 00:28:07.158, Speaker A: Like a debit card?
00:28:07.244 - 00:28:44.130, Speaker B: Yeah and then we received the books in our office and then we could send that to Afghanistan and distribute it to the students and we encourage many of these students to keep their Bitcoins. If they couldn't go to university in Afghanistan they can study online and paying for the university in Bitcoins or they can make it to cash later and that was how we started in 2013 and 2014 and the platform worked very well and then we started working in Pakistan, we started paying the users in Pakistan, we started also in Egypt, we started in Mexico and it's growing very fast.
00:28:44.280 - 00:28:45.730, Speaker A: How many users were you?
00:28:45.800 - 00:29:36.514, Speaker B: We had more than 60,000 subscription. And then the user that we provide, at least I guess that 25% was trying to contribute it, but some of them really contributed and we make more money. And that was also another reason that we talked rethinking to how to bring the changes was when the user increased the money that we had is get less and less because we had to distribute it to many of the content contributor and I found it out that the adkins when they. Write in the blogs, they didn't write in the quality that they get more money. So that was all a decision that we decided to making a new platform or new things that to educate the girls that I started Ad platform and it still is under development, but that's my next platform that I'm going to work on that okay.
00:29:36.552 - 00:30:18.100, Speaker A: So we're going to break now for an important word from our sponsor Onramp. But we'll come back and learn more about Edie Eddie.

00:30:18.100 - 00:30:22.210, Speaker A: So, yeah, why don't you continue with Eddie eddie, what are your goals there?
00:30:22.280 - 00:31:02.640, Speaker B: So with Eddie Eddie, we are trying to bridge the gap between education and job markets and we are trying to educate in the kids and teenagers mostly to learn about vocational skills that created a job for them later in the market. And right now we are in very early stage and we are hoped that that would be my next company. I brought the platform that we built in the US. And then we registered there and we got the offer of investment. Hopefully great. Hopefully we get the money and we can start to work on this platform.
00:31:03.330 - 00:31:07.220, Speaker A: What did you do with the was it women X?
00:31:07.670 - 00:31:19.794, Speaker B: Women X? In end of 2014, we closed the platform and then we decided to just provide a training in blockchain and what the blockchain is and what the Bitcoin is keep continued through digital some funds.
00:31:19.842 - 00:31:21.058, Speaker A: Through the same organization.
00:31:21.154 - 00:31:21.414, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:21.452 - 00:31:21.846, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:21.948 - 00:31:34.250, Speaker B: And then right now we train the girls. They learn about Bitcoin concept, they learn about how to make a wallet. And then right now they also started to learn about ethereum and they learn also about blockchains.
00:31:34.590 - 00:31:36.550, Speaker A: Are you teaching them to code in addition?
00:31:36.630 - 00:32:08.726, Speaker B: Yes, in addition, some funds we provide training, encoding, they learn about how to code and they learn about ICT. From first they started to learn how to work with computers because many of them, they never saw a computer or they never had access to computer. So we provided training from Basic. They learn about computer, then they learn about social media. After social media, the students who are in advanced classes, then they came to learn about coding. When they learn about coding, they learn about bitcoin concept. They learn about blockchain, they learn about ethereum and they learn about concept of this.
00:32:08.726 - 00:33:07.650, Speaker B: Because I believe the education and awareness is great things that we can promote and advocate. That how our governments can use blockchain in the future and that's how we have to start it from early ages that teaching the kids and they are very wiling to learn and they are more interested to learn. We also traditional some funds provide financial literacy that is just started and we're teaching the kids that how to manage the money from level of home to entrepreneurship. So when we say that we came to advanced classes, we combine of those students who learn about coding, we take their students to work with those who learn about financial literacy to start up businesses. So we have 100 women this year, they started to working together or they started by themselves, saw tops in five industries agriculture, food, fashion, handcraft and robotic and games.
00:33:07.730 - 00:33:13.962, Speaker A: Yeah, well maybe you can give some examples of some of the companies but then I want to talk about the robotics too.
00:33:14.016 - 00:34:00.310, Speaker B: Sure. We have one of students that she came to our classes to learn about coding and also social media. She learned about ice cream, she learned how to write to make an ice cream from Italian recipe. And she went back home and she told her father that she wanted to start business in ice cream. And her father she's crazy and he didn't want to listen. For six months she had a struggle to convince her father to get a machine to make him ice cream. And then her father told her that she only can do it for her relatives, only the family not outside because her father was feel that shame or whatever, he didn't wanted to support her.
00:34:00.310 - 00:34:19.806, Speaker B: But then she started doing and then the new birds and their relatives started to order and giving for the events and the parties that they had. She make a very delicious ice cream right now she's distributed to all the restaurants in Harat. And her father, brothers and mom joined to her business and they're working as.
00:34:19.828 - 00:34:21.838, Speaker A: A family business and they're all working for her.
00:34:21.924 - 00:34:23.630, Speaker B: All working and she's a boss.
00:34:23.790 - 00:34:24.402, Speaker A: Love it.
00:34:24.456 - 00:35:15.742, Speaker B: Yeah. And then we have another student in agriculture, her father had big farms but her father had a struggle how to make money with the farms that they had and agriculture business. And her daughter Parvana, she's coming to our classes and she learned about the business classes and how to make the business plan and marketing and accounting and everything and she also learned about how to coding. So she came to her father and she told about her business idea. Her father also didn't want to listen to her. And then she reached to her teacher and the teacher convinced her father came to the classes and listened to her pitch. And then her father for the first time listening to her daughter's pitch of the business and the ego of the men that never listening to the daughters.
00:35:15.742 - 00:35:53.486, Speaker B: Her father was really impressed with her daughter and it has never come to her mind, his mind that her daughter capable of this and she can do it, she can be like a son. And now her father changed all of his business based on what her daughter suggests. And now not only they dry the Spanish and they make a pocket and they bring it to market. It was interesting that no one has come to their mind that they can do dry the Spanish and making money. And this is to brought from Iran. They always like for years and years we brought from Iran, but no one thought to do it. Very simple things and she did it.
00:35:53.486 - 00:36:06.770, Speaker B: And then now she's working on her website to making online businesses into selling the dry fruits and everything that they have in their farms to make it dry and sell it out. Wow.
00:36:06.920 - 00:36:18.134, Speaker A: So, going back to the robotics, I also know that you sponsored that girls robotics team that made so much news recently, but it almost didn't happen. Tell the story of the obstacles they faced and how they overcame them.
00:36:18.252 - 00:37:09.480, Speaker B: Sure. And Afghanistan team. I mean we started about robotic in end of 2016 when justice, the prisoner of first school wall, contacted me and he told me about the amazing program that he has and he wanted to do the first Olympic game in DC. And he asked me if I know a team of the teenagers that are in high school that they can participate from Afghanistan. So I started reading research about that to finding this team, but I couldn't and it was difficult. And then I said, oh, well, I have all the programs in my school, so why shouldn't I start a team of the girl to come for robotic? Because everyone thinks how the time robotics were boys. So we made it tech test exams from 150 students.
00:37:09.480 - 00:37:55.402, Speaker B: We took 22 and then get 20, then 315 students to come to our program. But the problem was when we started, we had a problem of the training. Because many of these kids didn't know about robotic. And some of them they little bit know about very simple concept of robotic. And the challenges was that the families talked their daughters out of the programs. Because they said that first they don't want to let their girls go to us and then what robotic means. So they took it only six families remind and then we had problem with electricity, internet connections, and of course again with the training and trainer.
00:37:55.402 - 00:38:36.930, Speaker B: And then in the March of 2017 when first global, some robotic kids stay in our custom. So customs didn't want to give the robot kids because they have never saw something like this came to Afghanistan. And they say that it might be danger, maybe it's come to the wrong hands and be ISIS use it against of the government. So they didn't want to give to us and then we keep continued to talk with them and we brought all the documents and showed them but didn't work, they didn't care. We told them that it's a competition when they hear that it's a female team so they didn't care at all at that time they didn't want to give up their bots. It's three months to stay with them.
00:38:37.000 - 00:38:38.942, Speaker A: This is just a component to build a robot.
00:38:39.006 - 00:39:14.986, Speaker B: Yes. And then we had these challenges. And then the girls went for the first time to do the interview in the US. Embassy. And unfortunately, with a respect of the decision of the counselor, they were rejected, the entire team. Rejected and they came back and we talked with Joseph and then he talked with the state department and then they says okay, we will give another chance to the girls to come for the second time and then immemorial we still keep continued to ask the government to give us the robotic kits that we can work with that. And then they didn't.
00:39:14.986 - 00:40:21.246, Speaker B: So then the girls started working with the handmen, the staff with carton plastic and they started building their own small robot to learn how to work. They build like small cars, they build a trend, they build for themselves to dry hair, dry, dry hair, dry hair and then the building is a small service and to motivate to keep continue and then they invited for the second time interview and unfortunately the second time was in the middle. The appointment was at a time that if you remember it was early of June and there was an attack in Kabul, there was a protest going on. It was so bad it was three days after it was three times attack. Then there was a protestant in the streets and the security wasn't good at all and the families didn't want to let the girls to come at that time. And then many of these girls again crying, asking, begging their families to allow them for the second chance. At least they have opportunity to come and present their robots and competition.
00:40:21.246 - 00:40:43.686, Speaker B: But at the end the family allowed for one day. We brought the kids to Kabul and we sent them to embassy with the hope that at least a few of them get access. But unfortunately again everyone's rejected and it was quite fitting to see that our entire team rejected.
00:40:43.718 - 00:40:45.674, Speaker A: And what was the embassy's reason?
00:40:45.872 - 00:41:43.594, Speaker B: Well, there was a couple of things they did, but they don't tell exactly the reason. But there was a couple of things was one is that the limited number of the b one b two for African citizens. And then second that there was another concern is that maybe the girls staying over staying in United States, which we believe that these kids were under the age of 18 they couldn't speak English and then they had a problem of the family was very difficult to get their family's permission to come for one week. And in any case, the girls back and they were very upset, but disappointed with the decision. But then the girls decided to build their robot in any way they wanted to send their robot. So they build the robot during the Ramadan and then before eight they complete the robots and then they send it to the US. And then we tried to find another team of African Americans here to be representative of them.
00:41:43.594 - 00:42:59.322, Speaker B: But in meanwhile we started to also when we find out that we are only one of two teams in 163 countries that we are one of two countries that denied visa we get upset that because my students fatima says that I always thought Americans are our friends because of 15 years of relationship with United States and what United States and other international community did for us in terms of woman empowerment, in terms of the education for women, in terms of the woman rights and democracy. So we couldn't believe that our team of a girl couldn't come here but our new birds could come in like Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, all of them could come in but our team couldn't get then. And then we started to talk with the press. We are very thankful. The first magazine Rosie was Forbes the first one and then after they had a lot of other media in the press who contacted us and we continued to talk with mean I think it was power of the media they covered.
00:42:59.406 - 00:43:01.042, Speaker A: Finally President Trump felt pressured.
00:43:01.106 - 00:43:31.198, Speaker B: Exactly they made this stories and then the congressmen Joe Carty and Susana they started to also write a petition that get 53 other congressman signature to ask from the city department to give us the visa. And then it was just when I saw that article oh something's going to be happened. It was a week before and we didn't get any preparation, we didn't know what's going to happen and then the next day President Trump approved that the.
00:43:31.204 - 00:43:37.330, Speaker A: Girls continue and then afterward the reaction in Afghanistan was a little bit different than what you expected. What was that?
00:43:37.400 - 00:44:20.654, Speaker B: Yes. And it was when the time that we didn't get the visa and we started to do press and everyone's talk about many of the press wrote about and showing the girls and even Bernie Sanders Sonato, Bernard Sanders. Wrote in his Facebook and Sonato Shaheen's, and everyone's talked about that, but my government and my people get so silent. And they didn't talk about this. And we tried to approach them and ask them to just say one. A few sentence that they are proud of because it doesn't matter if they didn't get the visa just to create a hole for other girls and other families that we can continue the Steam program in Afghanistan. And unfortunately didn't work.
00:44:20.654 - 00:45:49.862, Speaker B: But when President Trump approved and the first person who recognized us as Afghanistan team was Afghanistan in DC. I'm very very thankful to him and he wrote that he's proud of our team and he came to airport and he came and I think also deputy on the security department also joined and then yeah, the girls came here to the airport. When they arrived they just surprised with all of this media and all the attention, everyone came and I think that was quite proud moment for Afghans or I think it's supposed to changing. For centuries, women's ability was ignored. Not only women, even our voice getting ignored by our community, our societies, our government, but now, no it didn't. And then when the girls back, president Ashafrani is on the call and they meet with President Ashafrani and first lady, they meet with chief executive of Dr Abdullah, they meet with former President Kaze, they meet with the minister, they meet with the parliament representative and everyone's happy and proud of them. And it was for the first time that the girls from Afghanistan participated in the science and technology, in something that it never happened in centuries.
00:45:49.862 - 00:46:37.706, Speaker B: In the mean I feel that oh my God, something has changed. They become as a symbol of hope, but they become as a symbol of unity. And these girls bring a light in the heart of the Afghans. Of course we got a lot of threads by conservative, but I see also the men in our community, especially Harat, they jump in and they stand with the girls and it's never happened in the past. I mean if a woman get threats by local and conservative local Taliban, by Taliban or conservatives, usually you can see less people wants to be involved to support. But for these girls we saw that.
00:46:37.728 - 00:46:43.386, Speaker A: It'S happening and it's interesting that it was a 180 like just over such a brief time period.
00:46:43.498 - 00:47:26.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I was surprised and seeing reading the comments and reading that how many Afghans support and they said that they are proud of these girls. And the great things is that I feel that now our leaders, our people believe the woman's ability in the science and other technology. So this is very important for us. And now I hope that they hear our voice and led not only for the female, the young girls, but also for youths, for men, for the boys as well, to give them an opportunity that they can change their lives and they can design created things that they can change their lives and their communities. This is very important.
00:47:27.310 - 00:47:35.710, Speaker A: So actually I want to go back to Bitcoin. I know you're not using it right now, why not? And tell us what you're thinking about. Maybe a token.
00:47:36.130 - 00:47:43.722, Speaker B: Well actually I personally use the Bitcoins, I invest on the bitcoins and we do the trades with Bitcoins.
00:47:43.866 - 00:47:46.318, Speaker A: What do you use it for? To pay your sister.
00:47:46.494 - 00:47:55.626, Speaker B: I mean with my sister Lahan. I do the trades and then using the bitcoin ethereum, we invest it personally.
00:47:55.678 - 00:47:57.122, Speaker A: Trades? You mean like you're trading?
00:47:57.186 - 00:48:24.374, Speaker B: Yeah, trading. My sister doing it. She was also the first teacher to teach the kids how to work with Bitcoins. And I have to say that with the Bitcoin we lost a lot of the money as well because the price goes up and down. But we build it on the Bitcoin. So we keep some of our bitcoins. But now we decided that to working on new concept.
00:48:24.374 - 00:49:33.086, Speaker B: Because this women who start their business, so what's the next for them? They have to sell their product. And still the banking has this issue. And it's very difficult to buying and selling through the online banking system in Afghanistan with a lot of bureaucracy and procedure that they have. So we are going to start a new platform, this online marketplace that these women all the skills that we have in our program plus the other businesswomans that they can participate here, participated in the platform and they can sell their goods online and buying the goods online and they will use the Bitcoins in this platform. And we also provide in the training. It's not only for just sell and buy, this platform also provides training for the females about what's the market, what's new in the market and all the news about the business marketing and everything we provided. And then this woman have a platform that they can communicate it, do battles together, do partnership or do meetup places.
00:49:33.086 - 00:50:38.578, Speaker B: So all of what's going to happen to this marketplace and it's good things that coming here at Blockchain summit at Nick Holland. Such a lucky I am is that to hearing the like. Everyone here has a beautiful story. I know they have very inspiring story that they're working in different technology and using the blockchain and Bitcoins for different industries. And I got some kind of idea that we wanted to implement in our marketing place or Afghan marketplace that hopefully when I beg and I'm trying to make some partnership and visually or through that we will be able to make this happen in Afghanistan. Because we can simply use for giving loin, social loin to the woman through P two B in this platform that the woman can start their businesses and get a loin with a loan. Yeah, and then we can also using the blockchain for technology of insurance for this woman.
00:50:38.578 - 00:51:01.342, Speaker B: So they can send the products outside of the US side of Afghanistan. But using the insurance for the protection of jewelries or whatever they build it. So there are lots of technologies that exist in blockchain that sometimes we don't aware, but in such kind of the amazing subject we can learn about others and how we can collaborate it.
00:51:01.396 - 00:51:07.620, Speaker A: Right, but you were saying also because you were saying that you might use Bitcoin but then you also said some people suggested to you to use your own.
00:51:09.590 - 00:51:40.970, Speaker B: Trying? Yes. We went to singular University two weeks ago and I talked with the students there and we discussed about this platform. Some of them suggest that why you don't use your own coins, building your own coins. So we are working on that as well to see that if we can building our own coins in this platform or we use in bitcoin. So this is two things that we are still trying to figure out that which one is better for us. Bitcoin has a value. So that's important about bitcoins.
00:51:40.970 - 00:52:16.306, Speaker B: It's a value. It could be for anything that we can use that. But if we have our own coins, it's also much easier. And it would be coins to support women and that would be in the platform. And we can easily work with that. But we have to work on the concept and figure out that what is best for us to use. And I have to mention that the marketplace is not going to be only for Afghanistan, but it will be as a pilot project for Afghanistan because this digital symphony has programmed Mexico, Brazil and other countries that we wanted to try to make it bright.
00:52:16.306 - 00:52:27.514, Speaker B: I mean, bring it to other countries as well to help the women that they are in the business. This is mostly for small businesses and medium sized businesses that they can support them.
00:52:27.632 - 00:52:37.646, Speaker A: Well, this is amazing. I'm so excited that I got to meet you and to learn about your work. So where can people learn more about you and also get in touch with you?
00:52:37.828 - 00:52:43.354, Speaker B: Digital Sound funds is our website. We have to update it, but it's our website that they can learn about our projects.
00:52:43.482 - 00:52:46.202, Speaker A: Digitalcitizenfund.org, yes.
00:52:46.266 - 00:53:14.922, Speaker B: And then they can find me through Twitter. My email address is there. And I'm always trying to respond to email fast. And yeah, we have a Twitter account. We have a website that you can contact with us. And I wanted to get the opportunity to announce one of our project to support digital town fund. It's a new initiative that we started.
00:53:14.922 - 00:53:44.942, Speaker B: It's called digital town brew. We created a coffee and a tea that we bring a spice. We're buying the spice special, spice like background from Afghanistan and from our students that are working on the farms. And we will bring it to us. And then we bring the coffee from Central America. We made a very delicious blending of this formula of the coffee. It's very good for depression, for the health, for the heart.
00:53:44.942 - 00:54:01.142, Speaker B: And as well, it's a unique product that supports education and technology access for dupling countries that women have the ability to learn about new skills and they can get their financial independence.
00:54:01.286 - 00:54:03.318, Speaker A: Okay, great. Well, that's so exciting.
00:54:03.414 - 00:54:04.186, Speaker B: Thank you.
