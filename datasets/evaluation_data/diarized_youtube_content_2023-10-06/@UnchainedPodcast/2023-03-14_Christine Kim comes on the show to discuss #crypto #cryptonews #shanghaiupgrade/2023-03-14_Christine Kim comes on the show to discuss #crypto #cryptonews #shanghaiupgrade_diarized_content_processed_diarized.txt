00:00:00.250 - 00:00:50.220, Speaker A: Well, two of the biggest reasons why I don't think there's going to be a ton of full withdrawals happening on the network is because if validator node operators really needed that liquidity, they already could have gotten it to some extent through liquid stake derivatives, through tokens like Steve, through tokens like RAF. And also I think that ETH prices nowadays have significantly declined since what we saw a couple of years ago. And so most validator node operators don't have a ton of gains to realize by unstaking their ETH entirely. I think we're going to see a larger number of node operators actually want to restake and just continue to earn. We saw Lido, for example, have their biggest daily inflows Ever just a couple of weeks ago, which I thought was really bullish for the sentiment going into hi.
