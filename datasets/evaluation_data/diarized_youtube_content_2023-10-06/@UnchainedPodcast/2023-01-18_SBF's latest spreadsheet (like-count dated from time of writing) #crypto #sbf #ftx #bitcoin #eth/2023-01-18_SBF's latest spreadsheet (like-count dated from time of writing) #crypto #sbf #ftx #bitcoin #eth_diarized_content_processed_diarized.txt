00:00:00.090 - 00:00:34.646, Speaker A: Sam Bankman Fried seems to be taking the fifth well, the fifth insistence of his innocence, maybe the 179th. I haven't kept track. In his latest public spreadsheet, he claims that FTX US is solvent. Or as his lawyers like to say, no comment at this point. For Sam Bankman Fried, FTX US's solvent is the new I swear this never happens to me. FTX's lawyers Sullivan and Cromwell claim that the company is facing a significant shortfall, but SPF claims that they're failing to count about $428,000,000 in US bank balances. Also claims that part of the problem is that the lawyers are using a snapshot of FTX's assets from a day later than they should tend to agree with him.
00:00:34.646 - 00:00:35.574, Speaker A: I think the fact that the value.
00:00:35.612 - 00:00:36.386, Speaker B: Of FTX's.
00:00:36.418 - 00:00:39.430, Speaker A: Assets plummeted overnight is definitely part of the problem.
00:00:39.500 - 00:00:41.206, Speaker B: Most humiliatingly of all, his.
00:00:41.228 - 00:00:42.022, Speaker A: Substac post.
00:00:42.076 - 00:00:45.318, Speaker B: Had a mere 17 likes. That's what your Aunt Tina gets for posting thanks for.
00:00:45.324 - 00:00:46.194, Speaker A: The birthday wishes.
00:00:46.242 - 00:00:47.750, Speaker B: To her 46 Facebook friends.
00:00:47.820 - 00:00:48.658, Speaker A: Yet I have to assume.
00:00:48.674 - 00:00:49.314, Speaker B: That SBF.
00:00:49.362 - 00:00:50.106, Speaker A: Is very confident.
00:00:50.178 - 00:00:59.370, Speaker B: In this analysis, which is why he locked comments on the Twitter thread about it. Hard to find a winner here, except perhaps McKinsey Consultants, who are rejoicing in the fact that they're no longer the least likable Excel power users.
