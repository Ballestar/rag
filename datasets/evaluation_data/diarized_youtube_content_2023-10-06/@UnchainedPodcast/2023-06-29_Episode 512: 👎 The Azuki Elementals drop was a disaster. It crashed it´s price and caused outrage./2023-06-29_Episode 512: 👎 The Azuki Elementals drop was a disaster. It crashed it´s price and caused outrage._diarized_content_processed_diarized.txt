00:00:00.410 - 00:00:46.294, Speaker A: The long story short is, once they were revealed, the big reveal that everybody was waiting to see what these cool new NFTs were, well, they're shockingly similar to the original collection of Azuki's. In fact, I challenge pretty much anyone to go onto OpenSea or Blur or your favorite NFT platform and compare Azuki's to Azuki elementals. Basically, it's the same collection. And so, in essence, what has occurred is they've, I think, like, know the number of Azukis out there. Yes, they have a different name, but they're Azukis. They're basically know Tom's flipping back and forth between Azukis and elementals and you won't be able to tell the difference. And there's a couple differences.
00:00:46.294 - 00:01:22.290, Speaker A: Like, there's a couple new traits that the elementals have that the original Azukis don't have, and there's slightly more frequency of cool elemental things like fire and lightning and earth and all this stuff. But fundamentally, they're a Zukis. And they basically use this as a way of massively increasing the size of the collection. And so everybody's up in arms. The price of Azuki has dropped like 40 something percent pretty much instantly upon this reveal. And crypto Twitter is captivated by this new mechanism called sell more of the original NFT.
00:01:23.610 - 00:01:29.210, Speaker B: There are two main lessons from this. First is Robert retiring from NFTs. Was a Psyop.
00:01:31.630 - 00:01:35.146, Speaker C: Total scam. Total scam. Clearly you are still very plugged in.
00:01:35.248 - 00:01:49.038, Speaker A: No, I'm an observer. I may dabble here and there. I will, for disclosure purposes, state that I do own two elementals. One that I got for free and one that I purchased below the mint price.
00:01:49.204 - 00:01:50.638, Speaker C: Okay, very good.
00:01:50.804 - 00:02:05.010, Speaker B: The second thing is, and I think I saw someone sort of hinting at this, but Azuki was maybe one of the only big of the large cap NFT projects not to do a fundraise. So maybe this is like they needed cash.
00:02:05.160 - 00:02:11.190, Speaker C: Oh, they were trying to do a fundraise? They were trying to do a were they were going out to market alongside the same time you I don't remember.
00:02:11.260 - 00:02:13.478, Speaker B: But did they get it? Did they close?
00:02:13.644 - 00:02:56.102, Speaker D: I think they did, but also, I don't think they needed the money. I think they were making a bunch of money on royalties and even primary mints last year. So I feel like it's like NFTs, they're all trying to figure out their business model and how this whole thing works and looks sustainable. Like, do you try to turn this into a media business or like a gaming business, or is this a pure art play and you try to make money on royalties or you sell plushies, I guess, if you're penguins. But I feel like the trick here, really, the grail, is being able to do continuous new primary issuance. Like being able to sell $40 million worth of JPEGs is like, fucking crazy.
