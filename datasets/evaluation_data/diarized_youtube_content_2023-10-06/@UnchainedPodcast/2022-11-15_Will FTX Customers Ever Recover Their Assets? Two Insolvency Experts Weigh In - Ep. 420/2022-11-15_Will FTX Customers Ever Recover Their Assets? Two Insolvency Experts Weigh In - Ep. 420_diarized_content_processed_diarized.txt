Today's topic is the bankruptcy of FTX. Here to discuss are Wasi lawyer, a lawyer specializing in restructuring and insolvency, and Thomas Brazil, founder and CEO of 507 Capital. Welcome wasi and Thomas.
00:01:39.574 - 00:01:44.320, Speaker C: Hi, Laura. Honestly, I'm glad to be back, but not really.
00:01:45.570 - 00:01:46.942, Speaker A: Thanks for having me on.
00:01:47.076 - 00:02:19.420, Speaker B: Totally get it. To catch listeners up since Friday's episode, we'll just start with the very basic development that prompted this episode, which is that FTX, FTX, US and Alameda, as well as other entities totaling about 130 altogether, are all filing for bankruptcy. There are more than 100,000 creditors, and according to the block, there's $8.7 billion in assets. However, it looks like also a good chunk of it is missing. Why don't we start with just what the basic bankruptcy process will look like?
00:02:19.870 - 00:02:36.270, Speaker A: Sure. I guess I'm like the American bankruptcy person here. Less crypto, more bankruptcy. Yeah. So they filed in Delaware. Not that surprising. I guess people were maybe thinking since they were Bahamian, or predominantly Bahamian, that they would file in the Bahamas.
00:02:36.270 - 00:03:06.678, Speaker A: The Bahamian cases I've been involved in were not pretty for a number of reasons. I think the laws are a bit restrictive and I actually am glad they filed in Delaware, or at least in the states. The Chapter Eleven process is very used to dealing with complex, sophisticated cases. You have Voyager and Celsius already going on in Southern District of New York. This is in Delaware. There won't be many differences. There are some differences in how things are interpreted from federal district to federal district, but for the most part it's federal bankruptcy law.
00:03:06.678 - 00:03:35.002, Speaker A: I don't know if we want to go into this, but the petitions were basically empty, which is pretty shocking. You don't always see that. It shows you the speed with which the whole thing unraveled. Or at least maybe the unorganized nature with which FTX was even know, with not real proper governance, structure boards, things like that in place. So there's a lot of information that hasn't come out. I'll just talk about the bankruptcy side. The petitions are generally filed with petitions, board resolutions.
00:03:35.002 - 00:04:07.222, Speaker A: You have your top 20 or 30 creditors depending upon the district you're in, so it's all top 20 creditors, unscrewed creditors, and then you normally have a whole slew of what I call first aid motions as well as a first day declaration from the CFO or CEO or founder or majority shareholder or something like that. Some executive officer of the company. None of that stuff was there. They're all blank. Just, we're going to file here's our emergency petition. We've got no information to file here this morning and we just need protection now. I assume it was because of the backdoor of the Bahamas.
00:04:07.222 - 00:04:28.926, Speaker A: People basically taking money off through the Bahama either accounts or I guess there was some NFT swapping that allowed people to take money off as well through the Bahamas. So there was a real little subunit of people that were doing this. And maybe wazi you maybe have some more color than I do on that, but those are things that are missing and we could talk more about the bankruptcy.
00:04:29.118 - 00:05:16.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we'd probably expect to see some of those documents sort of emerge over the course of this week, which would actually be very helpful for sort of understanding what state they're in right now because everyone just has speculations at this point as to what happened. People probably have a reasonably good idea, at least the structure charts have come out, the balance sheets have come out, you've got a reasonably good idea, but there's still some questions sort of floating around as to exactly how big the hole is, so to speak. Where the hole is, is very important as well. What assets and what liabilities are in there, where they sit, are they in FTX, US, FTX, international elementa. These are all very important points which I think we'll start seeing as these filings come out over the course of hopefully this week. But I completely agree with Thomas. I think they pretty much Sam.
00:05:16.398 - 00:05:47.900, Speaker C: When the Binance deal fell true, I think Sam was sort of running around trying to find emergence liquidity bits and blobs, trying to keep things running a little bit. That's why there was a very strange tron facility. Maybe we could discuss it later, Thomas. I'm not sure what you make of that. It just looked know, adding an even messier structure construct into a very messy structure and then as you say, the Bahamian lupo was probably the one know, fuck it, we need protection now. Freeze everything. Let's go from there.
00:05:47.900 - 00:05:51.820, Speaker C: But obviously they froze everything and then they got hacked for 450,000,000.
00:05:54.530 - 00:06:13.218, Speaker A: I wasn't totally following the news flow on that. It seemed to me that I don't know if capital actually left the entity. It's clearly within what's called the preference period. Clearly either a preference or fraudulent transfer. So anything that left will be clawed back the same probably with these Bahamian offshoots. We can unpack that at some point.
00:06:13.304 - 00:06:17.406, Speaker B: Well, define what is that preference period in the Bahamas?
00:06:17.438 - 00:07:09.880, Speaker A: It's actually a six month look back, but I have a feeling that we'll be going by the 90 day preference period under the US Bankruptcy Code, which is like, if you want to Google it, it's 547 of the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy estate is generally when you file this thing called the estate is created and that estate has many powers or two large avoidance powers, as they call them, are preferences and fraudulent transfers. A preference is a preferential payment made within 90 days of the petition, and a fraudulent transfer is basically a transfer within two years. That was for there are other prongs to this, but let's just keep it simple. For non equivalent value, like, I gave you $100 and you only gave me 50 back in value or donations to Democratic parties. There's one right there. So very likely to be a preference fraudulent transfer.
00:07:10.330 - 00:07:46.786, Speaker C: I would love to discuss the sort of preference and clawback issues in a lot more detail. I mean, I get a lot of DMs about it. A lot of very sort of sensible, intelligent people are asking those questions right now. It is complicated because of the way FTX structured their terms. There is a world where it's not a sort of preferential payment to a creditor because you're never a creditor in the first place. I think we can unpack all of that, but I don't know. Laura, do you want to start us off with how we got here and maybe we start talking about what is happening within the tree entities, tree groups, if you will, and how we even ended up in the state.
00:07:46.968 - 00:08:36.894, Speaker B: So we did a big show on Friday about everything that happened, which is why I started with the bankruptcy. But yeah, I'll give a little bit of the background. Essentially Sam bankman. Fried has two companies. One was the trading firm Alameda Research, and then the other was the exchange, FTX. And for the longest know, the last time he was on my show, I did ask him about this kind of apparent conflict of interest and he said they're two separate entities. Yes, I own both, but there's like a wall between them and actually other people that I've interviewed who interacted with them, like third parties said that their interactions were that FTX and Alameda were very different in their minds.
00:08:36.894 - 00:09:33.870, Speaker B: So that was really interesting. Essentially a few weeks ago, CoinDesk reported on the financials of Alameda and it showed that Alameda's balance sheet was heavily reliant on FTT tokens, which were tokens created by the FTX exchange. They offered kind of like discounts and stuff for activities you would do on the exchange. And it know to the point where it showed, like, basically this is a very illiquid balance sheet. If they were to actually try to recoup what they're showing here value wise on their balance sheet, it wouldn't work. And CZ, the CEO of Finance, happened to have $580,000,000 of FTT tokens on Finance's balance sheet because years ago he had invested in FTX. And once they became competitors, sam bought him out of his stake and part of the payment was an FTT token.
00:09:33.870 - 00:10:37.090, Speaker B: So CZ tweeted that he was going to be selling his stake. And Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, tweeted, I will buy your FTT from you at $22. And of course, because it's crypto Twitter, everyone's like, what's the importance of $22? So essentially CZ said, no, we're not going to do this in a closed door way. I'm going to sell all the tokens on the open market. And the FTT price kind of held up for a short while, but then it began to collapse and people became concerned about their funds on FTX. So there was a bank run, and later Sam said that it was $5 billion of customer deposits that were being withdrawn on the Sunday alone, which was Sunday, I guess, November 6. And he during that time was saying things like, assets on FTX are fine, the exchange is fine, we're just processing withdrawals, blah, blah, blah.
00:10:37.090 - 00:11:50.458, Speaker B: And then we all woke up last Tuesday morning to the news that things were not fine, and they actually needed potentially binance to buy them to resolve what at that time maybe people might have thought were liquidity issues. Then ultimately, after binance backed out, it became very clear that this was much more than something like that. And not only that it was insolvency, but it was likely fraud. There's a lot more details around this has been reported by other outlets. I don't remember which, but I think the three that to my mind have had the most scoops are like Reuters and the Wall Street Journal. So Bloomberg, as you know, I don't remember which outlet reported which scoop, but some of them were saying things like that sam had this little backdoor that enabled him to commingle the FTX and Alameda Research funds, and that at some point Alameda suffered from the contagion from last spring. And because they were in the hole, FTX lent them, I think it was like $8 billion or $10 billion of customer funds.
00:11:50.458 - 00:12:21.114, Speaker B: I don't remember the exact number. And what Alameda did was put up collateral on FTT. So I think that is at least part of the issue. I read other things saying that actually this commingling of customer funds with Alameda's trading activities happened even before. I'm not clear on that. I didn't report on that in particular. What ended up happening was that people that still had their money on the exchange were freaking out.
00:12:21.114 - 00:12:57.346, Speaker B: And that's when we had these shenanigans around people trying to get KYC, I guess. And so once they had the paperwork showing that they were Bahamian or through some other way they could do that, then they were able to withdraw funds, maybe illegally. You saw this all go down on Twitter with people tweeting at them, literally, things like, don't do this. What you're doing is illegal. But anyway, yeah, then ultimately, Friday morning is when we woke up to hear the news that FTX, FTX, US, and Alameda amongst the other 130 entities were going to file for.
00:12:57.368 - 00:13:19.286, Speaker A: Out of curiosity, why do you guys think that you were able to get out the back door with the Bahamas? I mean, my CCP suspicion when I was reading the Bahamian Insolvency code is that any customer that has their account sort of frozen could have involuntarily filed FTX down in the Bahamas. That was my only suspicion of why they would allow people in the Bahamas to continue to withdraw.
00:13:19.398 - 00:13:43.234, Speaker B: Yeah, the securities Commission released a statement on Saturday saying that. So I guess on Friday, FTX had said something like they were being ordered by the Bahamian Commission to enable Bahamas customers withdrawal. And then the securities Commission on Saturday released a statement saying that they had never ordered that thing in, that just.
00:13:43.272 - 00:14:27.822, Speaker A: On these involuntaries, they could really create jurisdictional issues. And I've seen big debtors get into little fights over if there was an involuntarily filed in a foreign jurisdiction or even in the States, but in the wrong district that you didn't want to be in, it creates real havoc. And then you can end up, like splitting up the estate. In this instance, we were talking about it earlier with all the commingling of assets because there really was this backdoor, and the balance sheets were all kind of sloshing around together to either fill each other's holes, either in a real way or in a fake way. I mean, the States really need to be substantially consolidated anyway. They probably will be, but we could talk about that.
00:14:27.876 - 00:15:01.260, Speaker B: Well, let's just talk about it right now. So given all the facts that we know at the moment, which obviously things are still coming out, I mean, this just looks so messy, right? There's the one to $2 billion in assets that are missing. There's the 130 entities. There's the sheer number of kind of weird assets that they're listing here, which I can give some detail on that, but I was just curious for your overall take at the moment, what do you think are kind of the main flags? What do you think, given what we know now will happen in this process?
00:15:01.790 - 00:15:58.586, Speaker C: Okay, so my take in it is I've seen that structure chart of 130 entities on it, and my first reaction was, it's not that bad. Like, I've seen frauds and restructurings and bankruptcies with like 900,000 over entities on it. So I must say, I was able to make some sense of it and sort of be able to sort of carve that up into sort of broad groups. So I think broadly, what you have here is you have your under, the bit that says West Realms Shy is that's your FTX US arm. And then you've got your Alameda stuff and all the Elemeda Ventures, which is another sort of group in itself. And then you have the FTX International Group, which has all of the know companies in Germany, Nigeria, Singapore, Switzerland, et cetera, under it. When you look at the back door, as you call it, well, Sam was right in the sense that they are separate entities legally.
00:15:58.586 - 00:15:59.962, Speaker C: That's right. He wasn't lying.
00:16:00.106 - 00:16:00.462, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:00.516 - 00:16:39.510, Speaker C: FTX Trading Limited in Antigua is a different entity from Alameda Research. But there are a lot of agreements between Alameda Meta Research and FTX Limited. If you look at the structure charts on the Ft, and the big one there is the Intercompany loan agreement. And I suspect, and I'm very sure that it is this intercompany loan agreement that's created this massive hole in the FTX balance sheet. Because, look, if we think about it, and if Alameda and FTX were actually separate, a bank run on FTX would not sorry, Alameda going in insolvency wouldn't have affected FTX.
00:16:39.670 - 00:16:40.378, Speaker A: Correct.
00:16:40.544 - 00:17:09.350, Speaker C: The fact that the bank run happened and FTX went under meant that something fishy was going on. And what was going on was that FTX was very, very likely the lender under this intercomplany loan agreement to Elimeda, which is the borrower, and as you say, likely to bail elementor of positions, likely to finance Elemeda, bailing out Voyager and all these other guys. It's very likely what has happened.
00:17:09.500 - 00:17:27.050, Speaker B: And so when customers now are trying to get their money back or the creditors or whatever during what sounds like is going to be a multi year process, I'm curious, what does that loan agreement mean for them? Are those funds considered Alamedas because of the agreement?
00:17:28.190 - 00:18:10.554, Speaker C: No, essentially, let's just assume there's $5 billion that's owing from Alameda to FTX. Right. And what needs to happen is that that position needs to be unwound and that Alameda needs to pay $5 billion back to FTX. Now, the question is whether Alameda has $5 billion paid back to FTX. If it did, we wouldn't be in this spot of border because Alameda would just hand over $5 billion of cash and FTX would hand it back to its customers. The thing is, Alameda is stuck in some very questionable and very illiquid assets, which is making it very difficult to pay back on. That mean.
00:18:10.554 - 00:18:29.440, Speaker C: Personally, my thinking, as I've sort of shared a couple of times is that at some point a voyager like deal sort of makes sense. Makes sense for someone to come and take out FTX and then sort of seek to liquidate Alameda, because I think Alameda is dead. It's gone, it's not coming back.
00:18:29.970 - 00:18:32.560, Speaker B: But do you think that will happen at some point.
00:18:33.730 - 00:19:47.202, Speaker C: According to you, if you recall, when Voyager went under, FTX offered $0.72 on the dollar, effectively to customers who could then sort of move over to the FTX platform when they made the bid. If you recall, initially, there was a little bit of it wasn't really done properly in that Voyager went and complained to the court that FTX had submitted a term sheet outside of the biding process and so on and so forth. And in that letter, which they filed to the court, they said, look, we have over 80 interested parties, so there needs to be a competitive process. So it could well be the case that if there's 80 interested parties in Voyager, presumably FTX, which was if we take the Alameda bullshit out of it, it was an exchange that apparently was operating at 250,000,000 operating profit a year and had investors like SoftBank, Tamasek, Sequoia, BlackRock, these are all big names in there. So it was a very functional business on its own. And God knows why Sam decided that he had to ban the bank and use customer funds to essentially fuel Alameda.
00:19:47.202 - 00:19:51.478, Speaker C: He should have just wound down Alameda the moment everything should hit the fan.
00:19:51.574 - 00:20:36.242, Speaker A: Just to touch on the Voyager process, I think it was robust, but just from people I've talked to, probably a lot of people looking, but very few people actually having the capital and the ability to transact. So that's what I would worry about here. And we can unpack this, but three six three sales or auctions? Bankruptcy auctions. It would be very tough, in my opinion, given what I've known from the other auctions, to see a bidder actually show up. So I'd love to see wazi, this was your idea. I mean, I think a tokenization, an actual debt for equity swap, like the good old days in bankruptcy when that has actually occurred.
00:20:36.386 - 00:20:39.190, Speaker C: That would be so interesting. I really want to see that happen.
00:20:39.260 - 00:20:47.340, Speaker B: Wait, okay, you need to explain this to people. Like, you guys are talking to each other, but you need to talk to the audience. So what's a three six three thing?
00:20:48.030 - 00:21:28.310, Speaker A: I'm sorry? It's the section of the bankruptcy code that lays out what you do to run, basically an auction for the assets. So if you were going to sell your assets to the highest bidder I mean, I'm not like a scholar on bankruptcy, but the move in the last probably 20 plus years is, don't bother doing debt for equity swaps, just do a three six three sale. So just do an auction. There's no valuation fights. We're just going to do an auction, sell the assets, the highest bidder wins, and then we're going to liquidate out the estate. I would call it the rise of Liquidating Eleven. So chapter eleven, which these are, you can get releases for third parties, which everybody loves a release who doesn't want to release, meaning you can't be sued.
00:21:28.310 - 00:22:00.002, Speaker A: And meanwhile the assets are sold to the highest bidder. That's what people pushing back with in Voyager, with the gentleman Steve, who was the founder, and I'm sure Mishinski would love a release, but I don't see that happening. And now that I would say the premium buyer for these assets in this restructuring cycle, because let's go with the assumption that crypto is here to stay. This isn't just like the end of crypto is because I don't want people like that. I don't want to go there. Just turn on a different channel. This restructuring cycle, the large buyer is gone.
00:22:00.002 - 00:22:22.198, Speaker A: I think the only real choice is a tokenization. Well, it doesn't have to be a tokenization, but a debt for equity swap. So creditors become the owners of your business and there's some sort of tokenization feature which I think could be very interesting. And Wazi and I were going on Twitter back and know you do have codes in the section of the bankruptcy code that allows you to exempt security offerings to creditors.
00:22:22.374 - 00:22:52.686, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, that is really interesting. Let's talk about that later. There's a few really basic things I want to be sure we you know, earlier when you talked about how it's being filed in Delaware, not the Bahamas, I was curious because much has been made about how FTX was us, it was an offshore exchange. What does that mean for customers? Since we could presume that the majority, I guess, of FTX customers are not Americans, does that mean anything for them.
00:22:52.708 - 00:23:32.670, Speaker C: Or no, yeah mean, I can probably try and take this one because I've had a lot of questions on this one. When I said, look, FTO is going to go into Chapter Eleven, and a lot of lawyers said they're going to go to Chapter Eleven, and people started saying Isabel Hami and entity, how can it go into Chapter Eleven? Et cetera, et cetera. All right, so here's the ridiculous thing about Chapter Eleven. Basically every company in the world could probably go into Chapter Eleven if they wanted to, because it's very sort of well established case law. Then apparently what you need to get into Chapter Eleven, I don't know the exact statute, thomas maybe knows what the wording is, but essentially you need to have property. You need to have property in the US. And apparently the definition of property in the US.
00:23:32.670 - 00:23:58.442, Speaker C: Is so wide that if I had a company, let's say in the UK, or at a company in Argentina with no business in the US. Nothing in the US. And I decide, hey, I want a Chapter Eleven, I could just open a bank account in the US. Hire a us. Lawyer, and now I have property in the US. And that allows me to file for Chapter Eleven. And why do I want the chapter eleven? Because the US Courts, the jurisdiction of the US.
00:23:58.442 - 00:24:25.486, Speaker C: Courts, and the moratorium you get is a worldwide one. You basically get a stay on all your liabilities across the world. So you've got customers in Hong Kong? Singapore. Not Australia. We can talk about it later, Europe, so on and so forth. Well, they can't make claims for you anymore. Trade, creditors, guys you sponsor stadiums for, everything stopped now you have time to sit down for, I think it was a period of 120 days.
00:24:25.486 - 00:24:47.682, Speaker C: If you want to take the 120 day exclusive period to figure out a plan. So it gives you sort of space to think, figure out what's going on, get the professionals in. And that is sort of why chapter Eleven is sort of so widely used. It's incredibly expensive. Lawyers and the financial advisors are going to make killing out of this, but it's probably a good thing, given the circumstances.
00:24:47.826 - 00:24:51.260, Speaker B: And so talk about the Australia bit, what's happening there?
00:24:51.710 - 00:25:51.498, Speaker C: Right, I looked into this earlier and again, this is not legal advice, it's pure speculation, et cetera, et cetera. But what's happened in the announcement is to say, look, we are putting everything into chapter eleven, we're putting FTX us in chapter eleven, we can talk about FTX us later, but we're carving out FTX Australia. And that was very interesting to me because I got a lot of DMs from Australian guys going, what's happening to me? What's going on here? Can you explain? Why are we screwed? Right, the honest answer is I don't know what my feeling is. It's probably a reasonably good thing. I look back at the structure chart, I look back at the terms of service, which the Australian customers sort of entered into when transacted FTX, and they haven't transacted of the FTX Trading Limited, they're the big FTX international company. So if you will, they've sort of transacted of the FTX Australian entity, which is sort of a subsidiary. So my hope, at least for the Australian guys, best case scenario, is that all the degen stuff that was happening with Alameda, FTX International and so on and so forth, didn't affect the Australian side of things.
00:25:51.498 - 00:26:27.000, Speaker C: And so when everything went down, they went, all right, this is fine, we can just put this into administration, wind it down, potentially refer, turn funds to users, potentially sell it to another Australian compliant exchange. And the reason for that, ironically, is probably because of regulations, because the Australian regulators could have been sort of stricter, maybe that's why. But this is potentially, I don't know, potentially good news. Potentially we'll see, because I think the Australian administrators are moving quite quickly on it and according to some sort of tweets have been going around, I think they're going to hear in like two days or something.
00:26:27.790 - 00:27:10.482, Speaker B: But then what that means is the Australian customers, their funds will just be treated as their funds, because I don't know how the missing assets plays into this. Does everybody get kind of an even haircut or how does that work? And then also it's not even just the missing assets. But then, as I kind of alluded to earlier, I don't know if people saw the spreadsheet of FTX's assets, but this is kind of bananas to me. First of all, we'll talk about the liabilities. So they owe $5 billion in USD. They owe $1.4 billion worth of Bitcoin, they owe $672,000,000 worth of ETH.
00:27:10.482 - 00:27:44.798, Speaker B: There's like a whole bunch of other assets also in the liabilities. I'm just calling out the big ones. Then. Their liquid assets were $472,000,000 worth of Hood equity, $200 million of US dollars in ledger prime, some other staples, and fiat currencies. Then it went into what they called less liquid tokens, which was 550 more million dollars of FTT, which probably needs to be zero. $2 billion of serum. Again, it's undergoing its own issues right now.
00:27:44.798 - 00:28:14.940, Speaker B: $982,000,000 of sol, and then totally random coins that nobody ever heard of until this whole disaster happened. And then hilariously, under illiquid. So they had Twitter equity at $43 million. They had some coin called Trump Lose that wasn't even on Coin Gecko, and it was listed for $7.4 million. And I was just like, I was just like, okay, did a child make this up? I don't know.
00:28:15.390 - 00:28:25.870, Speaker C: If we're FTX creditors, we are all hoping that Trump loses 2024 now so Sam can double up on the bed and add a $7 million to the bankruptcy estate.
00:28:26.850 - 00:28:47.720, Speaker B: Yes, you're probably correct about that, given not only the whole but then what I just explained about the assets, clearly people are going to get back some fraction. So for the Australian people, especially, if that moves more like, how do they know what fraction it will be? Unless they're how does that part all work?
00:28:49.850 - 00:29:48.006, Speaker C: I think there's some question about what is this balance sheet, right? Like, what are we looking at? Are we looking at FTX International's balance sheet? Are we looking at Alameda's balance sheet? Are we looking at know, merged balance sheet? Which is weird to consolidate the balance sheets of two allegedly independent companies with massive Chinese walls between them? Is FTX us. Liabilities in this as there's a lot of questions here as to what this balance sheet actually is. Because when I looked at it, that was what I was trying to understand as well. Are all the liabilities customer deposits? Do we know this or are there sort of loans with other people? Are there sponsorship deal? I mean, there's sponsorship deal for N Arena. Where is everything, right? But what I can say is that this balance sheet, I'm assuming it excludes the Australian entities because otherwise it would be part of the same process. But maybe I'm wrong. Like, end of the day, we need to know what this balance sheet you.
00:29:48.028 - 00:30:07.870, Speaker A: Do get siloed off in large restructurings. Just from my experience, you will see siloed off entities. You're supposed to kind of respect the legal structure unless there's like hopelessly interconnected. And the way. Wazu is describing. It is like you have separate illegal entities, but you might have intercompany loans going back and forth. And so it's not like you don't have claims on anything.
00:30:07.870 - 00:30:22.210, Speaker A: It's just sometimes you'll have something siloed off because of regulatory reasons. Like, I don't know, you'll have a group of entities in Australia that for whatever regulatory reason, never touched anything. And it's a small piece of the pie FTX US.
00:30:22.280 - 00:30:22.706, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:22.808 - 00:30:23.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:23.112 - 00:31:06.980, Speaker C: FTX us that siloed off. And when Sampus came out and said, FTX US uses a fine, everything is back one to one, that was somewhat believable. Right. Because he's going to DC, his lobbying, he's going to make sure at least his US side of things is completely clean before attempting something like that. Right. And presumably it probably was a lot cleaner because, again, if you look at a structure chart, you don't see the same amount of strange intercompany loans, intercompany agreements between the US side of things and the US side of things and the sort of international side of things. So it does make me wonder what the reasoning for putting the FTX US into the Eleven is.
00:31:06.980 - 00:31:57.140, Speaker C: Is it to sort of realize some value out of that so he can pay off international creditors? Because what I did here sort of in the rumor mill, was that he was trying to sell FTX US and then use the proceeds of that to sort of fill the hole at the FTX International side. Maybe it's the case that FTX US had entered into BlockFi, entered into loans and perhaps those credit support, and therefore it sort of poisoned everything and there was, to some extent, a little bit of intercompany exposures and liabilities there. Not very sure. But presumably the FTX US side is cleaner than the FTX International side. And I was actually going to ask Thomas this. Like, if it goes to Eleven, do you think the FTX US customers are in a different class from the FTX International customers?
00:31:57.830 - 00:32:28.442, Speaker A: Hey, I'm sure they'll try to stay separate. Just like the mean, you know, I don't actually know because I haven't seen anything. Literally, there's been nothing filed in the bankruptcy court. So it's pure speculation. I worry that you're going to see so much intertwined balance sheet, whole plugging stuff that it's going to be impossible to unwind. Yeah, we really don't know what was in FTX US. Honestly, I don't know.
00:32:28.576 - 00:33:00.322, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the other messiness.

So, yeah, the whole FTX US thing was, you know, kind of just went over that. But I think what really stuck out at me was the fact that the day before they filed for the bankruptcy, sam tweeted that FTX US was fine, which maybe now it shouldn't have surprised me because obviously a lot of things he said during that period were false.
00:34:36.782 - 00:35:02.842, Speaker B: But anyway, I do want to talk about one other thing that kind of happened in that period after Binance pulled out of the deal, which is that Justin Sun struck some deal for holders of various different Tron tokens. And I wondered, maybe this goes into kind of the clawback issue, but I wondered what would happen to that. Are those users good? They got their money and they're out? Or is this going to end up being dragged into the bankruptcy too?
00:35:02.976 - 00:35:03.646, Speaker A: Oh, boy.
00:35:03.748 - 00:36:03.760, Speaker C: I don't even know where to start with the Tron facility. I mean, obviously I think Justin wants to protect his own users and wanted to come in and provide that sort of confidence that the industry would sort of at least help its own ecosystems, which is great. But when this deal was basically announced in what, a two to three hour span, I told myself, look, there's no lawyers have looked at this, right? Clearly it was kind of a handshake deal, probably over the phone, and nobody's really thought through the repercussions of this, nobody's really thought through how this is going to play out. And presumably Sam was very desperate at a point of time. Presumably he was just picking up the phone, calling people, give me some emergency liquidity. Maybe if I can get Justin Sun to backstop all the tron stuff, give me a one for one for all the tron stuff, and then I can maybe call CZ and be like, all right, help me out here on whatever binance tokens might be on there. I can start calling all these random people to start bailing out.
00:36:03.760 - 00:36:39.114, Speaker C: Provide me emergency liquidity. That's probably where he's at. At a point of time, right? Imagine you're like the golden boy of crypto and your entire world's just collapsing around you. He's probably not in a very good state of mind. And yeah, this tron facility, no idea what it is, no idea how it's structured, no idea how it's worded. And I think I tweeted this. It would have been really nice if Justin Sun tried to put something like this in after it went to Chapter Eleven so that it will make more sense, it'll be more structured, it wouldn't just add more complication to the whole thing.
00:36:39.114 - 00:36:43.254, Speaker C: I think that's my take on it. I don't know what it means for Clawbacks Thomas.
00:36:43.302 - 00:37:24.730, Speaker A: I may have to think about it more, but my initial reaction is it's clearly too close to the filing and if someone got a better shake than they would get through the bankruptcy or there was value that was pulled from the bankruptcy or the estate, I should say, it's clearly going to be reversed. The whole thing is ridiculous. All this stuff leading up to the bankruptcy, you have to really paper it well and then there has to be contemporaneous exchange of value and all papered correctly by real lawyers to be able to have it even defensible in court to prevent, quote unquote, clawbacks. I hate this word clawbacks, but now I'm using it. Jesus. But avoidance for the transactions to be avoided.
00:37:25.150 - 00:38:13.400, Speaker B: All right, well, a similar incident that happened around the same time was what we were talking about, the Bahamian Loophole. However, I was curious because a lot of people called out ALGON Trading as one of the accounts that very explicitly kind of stated what they were doing and how they were going to pay $100,000 to anybody who could help them get KYC so they could remove their funds. And I didn't get to watch this in real time, I kind of pieced it together using screenshots afterwards so hopefully I got the story right. But I was wondering what you thought would happen to people like Algod Trading and then also anybody who helped people like know, as wasi mentioned, for instance, if they were minting NFTs that were worth exactly the user balance, know whatever user they were mean.
00:38:14.670 - 00:38:57.430, Speaker A: I don't know if it's illegal to pay someone a large fee to help them do something, I won't comment on that. But clearly, again, some transactions that will be scrutinized to be unwound. Wazi brought up a good point, which is like when you have customer deposits, these are demand deposits. Look at the terms and conditions and if you look at the very simple defenses to preferences, you have ordinary course of business. And also from the 2005 update of the US bankruptcy Code and Babsi, which is the update, you also have ordinary business terms. You have like two good decent arguments against preferences for retail clients. But this might rise to the level that is a little different.
00:38:57.430 - 00:39:19.454, Speaker A: It's not in the ordinary course, you'd be bribing someone to help you NFT your way off of the exchange before you get NFI'd or whatever. I'm trying to go with something there, but you know what I mean, it rises to a new level. I don't think it would rely on the same as you refer to as firmative defenses for preference there hard to say that's in the ordinary course.
00:39:19.572 - 00:39:47.880, Speaker C: I think when I saw it, I was like, look, we're just living in a simulation at this point. This is absolutely ridiculous, that someone's buying KYC information and then bribing someone publicly to register that KYC information so he could cash out money, and then allegedly went about trying to buy people's deposits on $0.10 on a dollar so he could use the same loophole to cash out money. Maybe that's just the best distress debt trade ever, right? But there's so many things wrong.
00:39:48.510 - 00:39:58.700, Speaker B: After they got KYC, they tried to help other, quote unquote help I shouldn't use that word. Wow. Yeah. Anyway, and I think the other part, that.
00:40:00.670 - 00:41:05.630, Speaker C: This point has made me very uncomfortable with the whole clawbacks thing. And I'd like to think back because we're not familiar with Voyager and Celsius. With Voyager and Celsius, the terms and conditions sort of state that if you deposit and we had this discussion last time, Laura, I think, with Adam right about custody and who owns what with Voyager and Celsius for the most part, unless you opt into the custody product. If you deposited a bitcoin into Voyager Celsius, you gave them the right to on lend that bitcoin, to generate yield on it, to hypothecate it, to do stuff with it, right? Because that bitcoin is no longer yours. What you have is a claim against them for one bitcoin on demand when you want it back. What we have, according to FTX's terms, is something incredibly different, which is it specifically states that title doesn't leave the customer, which sort of implies sort of we have the same relationship as if there was a sort of custody arrangement in place where I've given FTX my bitcoin, but I've not given it given it. They're just storing it for me.
00:41:05.630 - 00:41:59.458, Speaker C: And what's happened is, when I ask for it back, at that point, am I just taking back what's mine legally, physically, be possessing it, or am I claiming it back as a creditor and they have paid it out to me? Now, if I'm claiming it back as a creditor, and they have paid it out to me, it's a very, very clear, unfair preference to me. Very clear. But is it like, am I claiming as a creditor? Maybe not, because title never left me. But this creates a terrible sort of moral quandary, right? Because if you can't acknowledge that means that FTX who had breached their own terms and conditions by effectively stealing, converting user funds, funds that legally belong to the users, to plug their own holes on their own sort of trading firm, then do they then get to pick winners and losers? It just doesn't sit right with me.
00:41:59.624 - 00:42:31.302, Speaker A: No, it's a very good question. And Celsius and Voyager, everybody was looking at the Terms and Conditions and how they all changed and changed and changed. And in a weird way, like the custody product in Celsius, the custody product itself is likely a preference because it was created 89 days before the petition. But let's go back to FDX. So on. FTX I haven't read the terms and conditions. And what's interesting about bankruptcy law, this is like I can actually add something to this conversation is it's kind of a conduit for all sorts of different laws, all the state laws.
00:42:31.302 - 00:43:18.202, Speaker A: And so if these contracts are it's, believe it or bank, this is why the US I actually love the US bank's code because it'll actually look through to, like, okay, this was a contract under Bahamian law. I mean, maybe it said New York law, I don't know because I haven't seen term condition. But if it said Bahamian, then they're going to look at whether there's a custodial relationship as you're framing it under Bahamian law. And it'll be super interesting to see what the court says. It kind of throws a wrench into the entire bankruptcy process, though, because if everybody has quote unquote title, they never gave title to the estate, then what assets are in the estate? Well, technically nothing, because everybody is not a state property. They just said, we never gave title, we'd like our property back. And if that were the case, it's kind of weird issues around equity here because then it doesn't make any sense.
00:43:18.202 - 00:43:45.778, Speaker A: You can't even be in bankruptcy. There's no assets to even administer. So I'm not saying that's the wrong determination if the TOCs or the Terms and Conditions say that you never gave title, but I've seen cases where that is an issue where almost all the stuff is non estate property. And the judges have a very sneaky way of saying, like, maybe it is, maybe it is not. But I'm not going to rule in it right now because if I do, basically there's no case for me to know.
00:43:45.944 - 00:44:33.006, Speaker C: I've got to throw a spanner in the works here. It's an English law governed Terms and Conditions, and I discussed this with another law in the Space Gone Be Good on Twitter, incredible lawyer that bounce ideas off more senior than I am. And he had some thoughts on this, and he said, according to the dogs, and these are English law dogs, the assets are probably held on trust, and therefore legal title may have passed to FTX, but the beneficial title in it may not have. Which means now you're in the realms of talking about trust law and FTX, working on FTX, sort of dealing with those assets, sort of lending them onto LME. There was a breach of trust, potentially fraudulent.
00:44:33.198 - 00:45:23.150, Speaker A: And what's interesting, there is some case law in the UK on this very issue from many years ago. I'd have to go back and find it, but it's from like 2014 or 15. There was an exchange that went under and there was an issue around what the terms and conditions, who had title? Was it a custodial relationship or were these held in trust? And actually there were two other decisions, or I guess one decision. They just both look at the same decision in cryptopia, which was in New Zealand, which are very interesting. In both cases, they said that they were held in trust, but at the same time, I believe they allowed the kind of estate to be administered. But I think it does lead to more litigation around the people that were in breach of trust, the SBFs of the world that were not following the terms and conditions.
00:45:23.310 - 00:45:32.598, Speaker B: Okay, you guys, we need to just back it up and just make sure because I could barely follow, I was trying to follow, but let me try what that would mean.
00:45:32.684 - 00:45:51.782, Speaker A: Oh, actually what's interesting, Laura, is what that really technically means is any other creditors are absolutely screwed because all the properties in the estate belongs held in trust and for the benefit of the customers. So the customers are going to come way before any other creditor. Sorry, go ahead. Wazi.
00:45:51.926 - 00:46:17.090, Speaker C: Sorry, Laura, I'll try and sort of explain it in non lawyer terms with Voyager and Celsius. Right. We had a lot of arguments around custody because it was sort of PvP between the people who had funds in custody and the people who had funds in the earn and yield products right. Who were creditors. Because the guys who had funds in custody or on trust will be arguing that this part of the assets need to be ring fenced out of the estate.
00:46:17.590 - 00:46:19.138, Speaker B: Okay, I remember that.
00:46:19.304 - 00:47:07.330, Speaker C: Right. So I'm taking, let's say 300 million out and I'm getting one for one dollars because this was always my property, it never passed through Voyager, and therefore I'm just taking back what's always been mine. It's just been in a vault. Now with what's happened on FTX, imagine if everything was in a vault. So everyone's saying my stuff's in a vault, but there isn't enough in that vault because someone's been taking this stuff from the vault and doing weird stuff with it. So, like what Thomas was saying what Thomas was saying was, all right, well, if everyone says they have their stuff in a vault, then there's no estate left. Like, there's zero, because you've just taken the whole safe away, there's nothing to fight over anymore, and all you're doing is you're then going after SBF, you're saying, hey, there's a fraudulent breach of trust, or something like that, trying to claim that stuff from him.
00:47:07.330 - 00:47:12.854, Speaker C: So that's sort of the point we're trying to make here. Around title and around custody, around trust.
00:47:13.052 - 00:47:22.346, Speaker B: But when you said that there were cases like that in the past, how did they get resolved? There must be some kind of precedent around how to deal with situations like this.
00:47:22.528 - 00:48:06.470, Speaker A: Not in the crypto context and in the non crypto context, for instance, we were involved in I think it was a catfish co op and everybody had a packet claim. I'm pretty sure that was a fact pattern, or maybe it was some sort of processor of something where there were pack of claims. Don't worry about it. But basically, if you make fresh vegetables and things you're supposed to have this packet claim stands for something, someone can Google it and basically your goods are held in trust. So the problem is the processor ran out of money, filed for bankruptcy, and now you've got all these guys who say, oh, everything's held in trust, Your honor. And he's like, well, yeah, but then there's 10 million of you guys saying you're all held in trust. There's no estate, property.
00:48:06.470 - 00:48:42.078, Speaker A: How am I going to even sell off the assets to give you anything for held in trust? But the one nice thing about it is, for instance, Voyager is going to have a huge claim against the FTX estate and that'll be subordinated if it's held in trust. That's a good way to think about it. There's a good example of actual concrete, which is if they have a 300 million or even a billion dollar claim against the estate, it's going to be subordinated if customer deposits are considered held in trust and if they're under English law, which is what happened, I'm going to get the case and send it to you. But I can't remember the UK one, but the one in New Zealand was and that one all the way up to the Supreme Court.
00:48:42.174 - 00:48:48.686, Speaker B: And wait, so when you guys are citing these cases from other countries, like, what bearing does that have here?
00:48:48.728 - 00:48:50.886, Speaker A: Well, the English one are you saying English law?
00:48:50.988 - 00:49:00.534, Speaker C: I mean, we're probably looking at English trust law. Yeah. So if the documents saying English law, we're looking at English trust. And then wait, I'm sorry, the FTX.
00:49:00.582 - 00:49:02.470, Speaker B: Documents say that English law applies.
00:49:02.550 - 00:49:36.200, Speaker C: Correct. English law applies. So you have got a company that's incorporated in operating out of the Bahamas who's filed for Chapter Eleven in the US with terms and conditions that potentially create a trust over customer funds being under English law. So, yes, we are looking at few jurisdictions here and sort of Australian New Zealand, Singaporean, I think it's a Singaporean case. Keon and D two, c two. But let's not go into too much detail here. So all of these sort of Commonwealth countries and their own rulings on trust will be very relevant because all of it stems out of the English law of trust.
00:49:37.130 - 00:50:23.694, Speaker B: Okay, there are like 5 million different rabbit holes we could go down, but let's make sure we hit at least the big ones, because another wrench to throw in here was of course the hack on Friday night, where $600 million worth of tokens were drained out of the exchange. I happen to be asleep. I don't know why I miss all the fun stuff. But during that period, telegram posted a message saying, FTX has been hacked. FTX apps or malware, deleted them, delete them, don't go on the FTX site as it might download Trojans. So I was curious, first of all, by the way, people think it's an inside job, which that's also interesting. So keeping aside who did the hack, let's just look at what happened and how that affects the proceeding.
00:50:23.822 - 00:50:50.170, Speaker C: Well, you now have less liquid assets in the estate to distribute, right? You could try and recover them. I'm not sure how successful you're going to be. Look, I mean, when I saw it, I'm like, this burning dumpster fire just managed to explode. It was absolutely unbelievable. When they filed the chapter eleven. I genuinely heaved this. Our relief going, finally there's going to be some sanity to this.
00:50:50.170 - 00:51:11.698, Speaker C: No. Suddenly FTX is draining. Has its wallets drained? Its apps become malware? That's just insane. I genuinely was wondering what I was just asleep and dreaming in some sort of nightmare at that point. But from a legal perspective, I don't know, what can we do? It's like, all right, we just lost the money, right? We just lost 450,000,000.
00:51:11.864 - 00:51:12.834, Speaker A: Can we claim it back?
00:51:12.872 - 00:51:13.454, Speaker C: Hopefully.
00:51:13.582 - 00:51:52.960, Speaker B: I know nothing has been proven in this regard, but just because this was the prevailing theory, I do want to ask this question. So if it turns out that it was an inside job, meaning one of the quote unquote, inner circle that has been reported to have known about the loan from FTX to Alameda, which is SBF himself, but also Gary Wang and then Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, obviously the CEO of Alameda. So if it was of that already, has that perhaps level of culpability, alleged level of culpability, then does that affect anything at all or no.
00:51:56.450 - 00:52:15.560, Speaker C: It'S definitely criminal. And we would like to say that someone's going to go to jail, but I'm a cynic at this point, and I'm assuming that they're just going to disappear for three months, go on a holiday to Thailand or Vietnam or somewhere in China or maybe the Middle East. And then when the next big crypto implosion happens, they are going to come.
00:52:16.490 - 00:52:36.350, Speaker A: Mean, I hope we can trace it. It just makes it that much harder and it just adds to the know, lawyers to help retrieve it, even if, you know, they're going to multi jurisdictional litigation potentially to recover it. And even if you get it back, maybe if it gets part of a forfeiture, then you'll have to hire lawyers to go after the forfeiture.
00:52:36.850 - 00:53:22.986, Speaker C: Thomas makes a very good point, by the way, in that you've got to do the sort of risk reward on actually recovering the assets, right? Like if you have no idea what has happened, and then you go and spend five mil on a firm to help you, investigations firm to help figure out what happened. They find out, they bill you five mil, you're paying the five mil out of the bankruptcy estate. And then you have to go find lawyers in the specific jurisdictions, try and freeze those assets. Debt money is coming out of the bankruptcy estate. You could basically go on this sort of wild goose chase and all the way at the end, oh, tough luck, he's just run off with a wallet, hardware wallet, we can't do anything anymore. And you're just throwing $20 million trying to track down assets. So there is a sort of risk reward calculation there, whether you even I.
00:53:23.008 - 00:53:47.460, Speaker A: Would like to think that one's big enough to try to go after, but yeah, I hear you. No, it's a real thing. I mean, even when you talk about preferences, let's talk about the backdoor like risk reward on Bahamian. I mean, even if someone pulls out a few million dollars, you're going to have to prove it with facts. I mean, these are facts intensive questions, as my attorney would tell me when he doesn't want to answer one of my questions. But he's not wrong. Wazi knows what I mean, but he's not wrong.
00:53:48.550 - 00:53:50.260, Speaker C: I know exactly what he means.
00:53:51.030 - 00:54:29.780, Speaker A: So you have to pick and choose your battles on some of the stuff because it is a dollar and cents game. You're trying to get the best recovery for creditors. There's no vendettas, and hopefully that's how the estate will be pursued. I'm sure it will be, but that's just something to keep in mind when people are like, oh, why aren't they doing this, why aren't they doing that? But what's the point? That guy doesn't have anything to go after anyway and the jurisdiction isn't great and it's a small amount of money. So there will be people that, hey, they got money off the back door and they'll be like, oh my gosh, it's amazing. I got 200 off and I got made 100% recovery. And it's like, is it really worth the estate's time to go after that person? Probably not exactly.
00:54:30.390 - 00:55:02.634, Speaker C: Yeah. If you have withdrawn $5,000 and someone sends you a letter saying, hey, our records are that you have clawed back some money, sorry, you have taken some money out, we want to claw it back. And assuming obviously it's not legal advice, you maybe should have comply if you want to be completely on the up and up. But if you didn't comply, what are they going to do? It's going to cost them a lot more money to come in and try and get that rest at $5,000 from you. But that's just like my take on it. It's completely a risk reward thing because the whole point is to maximize recoverability. Right, right.
00:55:02.672 - 00:55:05.566, Speaker B: I just think $600 million is a very different situation.
00:55:05.668 - 00:55:24.674, Speaker C: That's a very different situation. Yes, absolutely. We're absolutely hoping that we'll be able to recover the $600 million. Yes, that would be ideal, and it would be negligence, I feel, to not try and figure out if you could try and get the $600 million back.
00:55:24.872 - 00:55:58.158, Speaker B: Right, okay. Yeah. Because when you made that example, I was like, wait, I think this is a different situation. Okay, but speaking again of, oh my God, just so much craziness. So the deployer contract for FTT tokens created 192,000,000 new tokens on Saturday that was worth $380,000,000. And finance had to call that out and say it was halting deposits of FTT to the platform. How does that affect things? Are they just worthless or I don't even know how they had that value.
00:55:58.158 - 00:56:02.254, Speaker B: But anyway, what is your take on how this affects things with the token stuff?
00:56:02.292 - 00:56:12.642, Speaker C: I don't even know, honestly. The token stuff just adds a whole new level of complication to everything. First of all, like you said, how much is FTT even worth now?
00:56:12.776 - 00:56:13.122, Speaker A: Right?
00:56:13.176 - 00:56:27.560, Speaker C: Because the fundamental value of FTT, when you think about it, is that, well, the exchange is going to operate and they're going to buy it back from you, therefore increasing its price, but it's not operating anymore. So what's the value of FTT? Probably mark it on zero.
00:56:28.170 - 00:56:28.920, Speaker A: Right.
00:56:30.010 - 00:56:34.346, Speaker C: So I'm not sure how that plays out. The serum stuff is a lot more interesting, though.
00:56:34.368 - 00:56:50.446, Speaker A: This depends on FTT. There's a really open question around when you strike the claim, does it strike to the petition date or not? And so, like, people with FTT, do they get that even though the asset's not there? Do they get the liability as a claim? But anyway but it's an open question. We honestly don't know. Celsius is going to have the same issue.
00:56:50.548 - 00:56:53.434, Speaker B: Wait, and I'm sorry, what is that? To strike something dangerous.
00:56:53.482 - 00:57:29.754, Speaker A: Okay, if I have $100,000 of FTT, do I have a claim for 100,000 FTT or do I have a you all spoke about it last time we were talking about Celsius. Or do I have $100,000 claim because at the time of the petition, like when they first filed the bankruptcy petition, the claim is struck. And that matters because if I own FTT, I'm like, I'd really like the petition date value. And if I'm a creditor, I'm like, no, you were in a poopoo coin, I won't use the S word. And so you got nothing. Or we're going to treat it differently. So there is some issues around that.
00:57:29.754 - 00:57:45.518, Speaker A: I definitely think it's probably going to be struck at the petition date, but it is a little hairy for the people that own FTT. And the same thing with Celsius. I wanted to talk about the subject of the moving of the manager or moving of the chain with serum.
00:57:45.694 - 00:58:18.042, Speaker B: Yeah, but wait, just one thing that I wanted to say about the petition date. Issue is that it strikes me that with Mount Gox to tell me if I'm wrong, but it seems that the petition date is what was used to determine what creditors would receive. And so it's sort of one of those things where in different cases, people might want a petition date and for others they might not. Which is just funny because it really just depends on which coin they had. But frankly, I personally think it's better if you just get your asset back.
00:58:18.096 - 00:58:20.614, Speaker A: Well, if it's held in trust, it depends.
00:58:20.662 - 00:58:21.834, Speaker C: I mean, if your asset is worth.
00:58:21.872 - 00:58:50.198, Speaker A: Shit, hey, if it's held in trust, you don't get a choice. I can return you your property. I never had title, but if it's not held in trust and you're general to your creditor, I'm just saying the legal arguments cut both ways. So the guys that have FTT, if it's all held in trust under English law, trust law, then let me just give you your property back now. You're made whole. See you later. They're like, yeah, I made whole, but now it's a zero.
00:58:50.198 - 00:58:56.246, Speaker A: You're like, I gave you a property, I gave you your phone. That's what you wanted. Yeah.
00:58:56.268 - 00:59:26.706, Speaker C: I think in terms of sort of legal ambiguity and questions, this FTX element, sort of bankruptcy is a lot more complex than Treac and Voyager and Celsius put together. You've got very similar questions, but you also have some very different factual matrix that complicates things even more. The only thing that even comes close is to be honest, is terror. I think terror creates a lot of problems as well from a legal perspective. But we're not talking about it now.
00:59:26.888 - 01:00:05.198, Speaker B: Okay, well, we'll move on to serum because yeah, this was yet another this is just quite the saga. I mean, it just kept going. I just feel like I've barely slept for over a week, so okay, the serum project, I believe it was Saturday, they forked because apparently someone at FTX had some admin key that enabled updates, but obviously there was nobody there or maybe whoever had that might know deployed malicious code or something on the project. So they forked it. I don't know what that means for the people who held serum on the exchange. What, do you think I'm going to.
01:00:05.204 - 01:00:12.190, Speaker C: Go on the offensive and ask Thomas for his views? Because I have no freaking clue. I mean, I have my thoughts, but Thomas, you could go first.
01:00:12.260 - 01:00:33.830, Speaker A: So there have been cases where the GP has filed for insolvency and the LPs have decided to move the manager, and that's been decently allowed. Sometimes the states have tried to fight it. So that's what I would I would characterize the question in that way. Wazi any thoughts mean? It's different. It's crypto.
01:00:34.170 - 01:00:51.210, Speaker B: Right, but wait, so talk a little bit more about what that means when you say that. So then what does that mean? So then the creditors, what, they can put a claim on those forked CRM tokens where they can't or just explain it in non lawyer terms.
01:00:51.280 - 01:01:33.654, Speaker A: So, like, okay, if you have a non debtor who has a management agreement with a debtor, but as part of the non debtor, they're allowed under their contract to change who the manager is. That's kind of allowed. We're like paraphrasing things that can get quite technical because it really depends on what the agreements say, but if they're allowed in their contract to do that. And so in this instance, if the governance token I don't know exactly how serum works, but if the governance token or someone who controls the governance function is kind of allowed to do it and it doesn't affect it's going to be a question of whether it's a breach of the automatic stay or not for someone to fork, I guess the chain. But wazi. Do you have another way of describing.
01:01:33.782 - 01:02:48.018, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I've thought about this a lot, actually. So I thought about this after Terra Luna, when they fought the chain to basically in my head as a restructuring lawyer, they basically fought the chain as what looked like equity holders to sort of shed all of the debt and start all over again. And I asked this question, I went, how does this even work? But obviously that wasn't properly challenged. And then when Treac went down, I actually thought about this again, going, wait a minute, tree AC had a ton of Lunar tokens as a thought experiment. Is it possible for Lunar to fork again and just take out three AC tokens? Just be like, all right, we just deleted all their tokens on the new chain right? Now it stops becoming a thought experiment because it's actually happening with serum, where they're sort of forking and potentially taking value away from the tokens on the old chain. So the way I'm thinking about it is that let's say you've got a company. Let's say you've got like a fast food joint that's sort of calling to insolvency, but the very next day your employees or part of the management team rock up next door, open up exactly the same fast food joint, call it Fast Food Joint 2.0
01:02:48.018 - 01:02:53.380, Speaker C: and start running it the same way. How does that play out?
01:02:54.150 - 01:02:54.834, Speaker A: I'm not sure.
01:02:54.872 - 01:03:15.878, Speaker C: Because they're taking value out of the estate, right? Because what's valuable about those tokens is that there is an ecosystem around it. There's a use case for it, there are developers spotting it, there are users on their network. If you simply just clone it, move all the users away, move all the developers away and drain that token of value, as you say, is it a breach of the authority?
01:03:15.894 - 01:03:16.346, Speaker A: I don't know that.
01:03:16.368 - 01:04:10.230, Speaker B: It just I just need to clarify a fact here. So are you saying that when they forked it, that they removed all of whatever serum was held on FTX, or just whatever amount FTX owned as part of its I guess maybe like a venture investment or something. So presumably FTX had two types of serum, right? Whatever it received from being involved with the project and then whatever customers held on it. So there's kind of two different types of serum that could potentially be affected here. So let's talk about the two. If you're a customer with serum tokens on FTX, how will this affect you? Does this mean you still can claim a value on those serum tokens or not? Let's just start with the customers.
01:04:10.400 - 01:04:14.430, Speaker A: Wazi, do you know how you interpreted the customers are affected?
01:04:17.970 - 01:04:21.966, Speaker C: I'm going to think about it further. I honestly can't have a good you.
01:04:21.988 - 01:04:24.960, Speaker A: Would get the fork too if you own the original. No.
01:04:26.610 - 01:04:33.700, Speaker C: Would you get the fork thing? But you're not getting it. But then it's hacked, right? This is a hacked serum. So they foxed it.
01:04:35.030 - 01:04:39.590, Speaker B: Oh wait, I'm sorry. I thought in that tweet thread that it was a developer.
01:04:40.890 - 01:04:42.082, Speaker C: I have to look at the tweets.
01:04:42.146 - 01:05:30.818, Speaker A: In a bit more detail. I thought the news was that they were basically kind of like forking it to deal with the fact that FTX wasn't going to be able to perform and they were just going to move the community over. That's happened some. There are some bankruptcy cases, I mean, at least the ones that I've been involved with that's happened. There's an asset management firm where all the guys basically left and set up shops across the street. Like on Wazi's example when they were an asset management firm and there was nothing to preclude them, there were no non competes and they just got up and set up shop next door and it wasn't a breach of the automatic stay. The same thing when we had there was a Ponzi scheme case we were involved in that had real estate investors and the LPs were limited partners in the real estate deal were allowed to change the manager, the general partner manager.
01:05:30.818 - 01:05:51.870, Speaker A: And that wasn't a breach. Even though I think the trustee did try to fight it because of course, it severely cut the value stream because they were going to lose the 2% management fee or whatever they were going to get. Plus they were still entitled some other things. But I thought that was the news. Maybe I misunderstood what they were trying to do with the fork.
01:05:52.850 - 01:06:44.830, Speaker B: Yeah, and by the way, yeah, it was a community member, which is totally fine. It was saying it's a dow or something. Okay, this actually maybe is a good segue to the other thing I wanted to ask about, which was obviously there's 250 startups or different token projects that received funds from FTX Ventures. So what happens to the equity or tokens that FTX Ventures owns? I did see so Chris McCoy, some of you might know on Twitter, I think he does something called Storecoin or something like that. He's been suggesting that these projects buy back their equity or tokens so customers can get their money back, and then the projects get to remove FTX from their cap table. Miles Jennings of a 16 Z basically thought this just did not make sense because it contradicts everything about existing law. But what do you guys think of that suggestion?
01:06:45.570 - 01:06:57.890, Speaker C: I agree that you can't just unilaterally delete tokens or unilaterally delete the equity you've given out. Presumably a lot of these are done by Safes or SAFs. So you can't do it.
01:06:57.960 - 01:07:00.900, Speaker A: That's a clear breach of the automatic stay. That's an easy answer.
01:07:01.590 - 01:07:09.026, Speaker B: No, but he's saying that they buy back, not delete. He's saying that's fine, but the hold.
01:07:09.048 - 01:07:50.660, Speaker A: On a second, back up a second purchase property. And so the estate has rights, and if you want to buy it back, you can engage the estate to buy it back. I was hoping we would end on a nice point, which is like, what are the recovery pathways for creditors? And one of the biggest ones is this big portfolio of venture deals. And look, some of them can end up over a very long period of time, leading to decent recoveries. And I was giving the disco one we were talking offline, and there's CMGI or whatever, these were two, like.com, busts that as part of their business, they had a big venture arm, and the venture arm over like a very long period, like a ten year period, ended up making the estates entirely solvent. Of course it took ten plus years for that to happen, but that's neither here nor there.
01:07:51.030 - 01:07:53.394, Speaker B: Well, no, I mean, it could be very relevant here.
01:07:53.432 - 01:07:55.758, Speaker A: It could be very relevant. No, this is a silver lining.
01:07:55.854 - 01:08:00.920, Speaker B: Yeah. Because this could take ten years. Am I wrong or how long do you think it could take?
01:08:02.410 - 01:08:05.814, Speaker C: It could take ten years, it could take six months. Depends on what deal you end up with.
01:08:05.852 - 01:08:31.822, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I mean, I guess you could have someone come in and come up with some restructuring plan. But even if you do that, unless you sell the venture portfolio in one fast swoop, which I don't think is likely, I think the unwinding of that will take many, many years. But if someone wanted to buy back the tokens or the equity they gave, they'd have to buy it back at whatever the market price know, and the estate would have to engage with them, say, like, we want to sell it versus holding onto it.
01:08:31.956 - 01:08:57.880, Speaker C: I'm actually just flipping over to the structure chart, looking at it right now. The FTX venture arm is actually fairly ringfenced away from FTX Trading Limited. It's owned by this company called Paper Bird Incorporated. And the way it's linked to Eleometa is there is an intercompany loan agreement between Paperbird and Alameda Research. So that's sort of how FDX Ventures is sort of linked to this entire shit show.
01:08:58.910 - 01:09:06.060, Speaker B: So what does that mean? Since Alameda clearly is probably I don't know if more insolvent is even.
01:09:08.510 - 01:09:14.400, Speaker C: Matter of it's basically just a matter of unwinding all of these transactions to sort of see where we end up.
01:09:14.930 - 01:09:21.470, Speaker A: The money is going to have to flow through to the intercompany loan. I mean, it's an intercompany loan. An intercompany yeah, yeah.
01:09:21.540 - 01:10:14.610, Speaker C: The intercompany loans are the pipes. So these intercompany loans are basically the pipes by which Sam and FTX LME that were sort of funneling funds when we now that we've sort of frozen everything, we're going to start if we're in a liquidation scenario, we're going to start unwinding everything and sort of see where we end up. Right? Because let's say this Paperbird Incorporated owes Alameda money. Assuming that's the case, right, let's say they've borrowed money from Alameda to make their venture investments. Then Alameda calls back this loan from Paperbird. To do that, Paperbird has to go to subsidiaries to liquidate its venture holdings in order to upstream proceeds into Paperbird to then pay down Elemeda. Alameda then owes intercompany loan to FTX Trading.
01:10:14.610 - 01:10:27.030, Speaker C: It will then sort of take the proceeds it's recovered from Paperbird and sort of pay down its loan to FTX Trading. It's basically we're basically just unwinding all these transactions at this point.
01:10:27.180 - 01:11:10.100, Speaker B: Okay, so another solution, which actually wasi you tweeted it was you and I saw Zayn Tackett, the head of institutional sales, maybe at FTX, he used to work at Bitfinex at the time that it was hacked and they ended up issuing a token that actually worked. It did eventually make customers whole there. And you tweeted a similar suggestion. And I was curious. First of all, actually, why don't you describe how this would work and then talk about how this is similar to the Bitfinex situation where it's different. Just give the ODS of how likely this is to pan out or to happen and pan out.
01:11:10.950 - 01:12:16.134, Speaker C: Okay. I mean, to some extent it's basically a sort of a modified debt to equity swap, which sort of practitioners in the space would be quite familiar with, except we've sort of adapted it for the crypto space, so it's now adapt to token swap. So we're basically looking at so in the chapter eleven, you've got all your assets frozen, right? And now you're looking at a plan to potentially maximize revenue, potentially maximize recoveries for creditors. So what we have here are broadly, I said there are three groups. There's the FTX US Group, there's the FTX International Group, and there's the Alameda Group. The Alameda Group is the sort of trading arm which has lost a crap ton of money, which is why it had to borrow money from FTX International, and that's why it tipped FTX International into insolvency as well when it couldn't make money to pay it on the bank run. So the thinking is this, right? You've got a bunch of customers who have money stuck in FTX International, and FTX International cannot pay back these customers.
01:12:16.134 - 01:13:22.846, Speaker C: Right now, so what you could do is you plunk that hole in the ftex International balance sheet and issue customers recovery tokens, which will, over time, depending on how you structure it, whether you do it the Fnac style, you make it look a little bit more like equity. It basically turns FTX International sort of solvent again, balance sheet, solvent again, because you've gotten rid of those liabilities. These are now sort of assets on, yeah, you've gotten rid of those liabilities or you've deferred them even, depending on how you've done it. And it came to me sort of in the middle of the night because I thought, wouldn't it be an incredible comeback story if one of the best exchanges in the world was run so fraudulently and run in such a horrible manner? And then at the end of day, you have a debt to equity swap and you turn into essentially a decentralized ownership, but centralized exchange that's run by the community, for the community, which is by traders, for traders, which was the FTX. Logan so I thought that was quite.
01:13:22.868 - 01:14:04.298, Speaker B: An interesting idea just to kind of distinguish it from the FTT token, which many people are aware was part of the demise or was part of the cause of the demise of FTX. The difference here would be that it wouldn't be something kind of like more centralized, but basically a community owned token, hopefully more properly decentralized. Is that kind of what the difference would be? What's ironic is that that was part of the reason that FTX went under. But now you're saying a solution would be for FTX to have a token. So I'm trying to explain why this would be better and not okay, let.
01:14:04.304 - 01:14:35.890, Speaker C: Me sort of explain from a start. It'll take maybe three to five minutes, but I'll go into it in not too much detail, but some level of detail. And I've sort of gone through this in my thread a little bit, but I'm assuming not all of the viewers have sort of read it. So I'll sort of just run through it quite quickly. So, according to Zayn, as you say, we have about 8 billion of liabilities, 900 million of liquid assets. You mentioned this earlier. You have got the semi liquid assets and the illiquid assets that you were talking about earlier, including Trump to lose 2024.
01:14:35.890 - 01:15:25.730, Speaker C: What we're looking at here is that there is a hole in the balance sheet. By a hole in the balance sheet, it means that there are more liabilities than our assets right now, therefore rendering this company insolvent and incapable of operating. Let's just assume, okay, we've also lost $450,000,000 right to the hack. So let's just assume semi. Worst case scenario, I'm hoping it's more than $3 billion, but let's say there is a $3 billion hole in the balance sheet that needs to be fixed some way or other right now. We are in the chapter Eleven now, and the good thing about Chapter Eleven is you can sort of pick and choose out assets and liabilities, which you otherwise would not be able to do outside of a Chapter Eleven because you've got all the it's what you call a clean buy. You're able to sort of have a court sanctioned transaction that sort of releases you from any potential liabilities.
01:15:25.730 - 01:16:05.086, Speaker C: Quick Segue this is why we really didn't think a finance deal outside of a Chapter Eleven was going to work. Because if CZ bought FTX, CZ were to deal with the burning dumpster fire while it's still on fire. Whereas in this Chapter Eleven, you can sort of put out the fire and sort of pick through the ashes and see what pieces of it is still saveable what's not saveable what you leave in there, what you don't leave in there. So a Chapter Eleven is actually a really good thing because now you can start in this case at least a Chapter Eleven is a good thing because you can go in there and sort of pick out bits and pieces that you want. So this proposal assumes that CZ isn't going to save us, justin sun isn't going to save us. We're going to have to do it.
01:16:05.108 - 01:16:05.634, Speaker A: All on our own.
01:16:05.672 - 01:16:39.386, Speaker C: There's no money, there's no money coming in, right? So what is valuable in FTX right now? In the FTX group? What's valuable is you have customer goodwill. The users user base in crypto well, at least a few months ago was very, very valuable. So you've got your user base, which means you have to assume their liabilities, right? Because you can't be like, oh, come over exchange, by the way, you're worth zero. So you have to assume their liabilities. But what else do you have? You have got potentially good assets in there. Potentially there's some assets they are liquid or assets they convert to cash. Potentially good assets in there you could take with you.
01:16:39.386 - 01:17:07.326, Speaker C: There's potentially the trading engine, the FTX engine, the FTX, the brand is worthless now, but everything that made it work, the structures, the know how, so and so forth, there's something that's valuable, you could take it with you, assuming that you're allowed to take the licenses, you could take the licenses with you. And the licenses sort of make your life a lot easier because otherwise if you rent your own exchange, you're going to have to apply for licenses all over the world. FTX already has some of those, especially those in the US, which I assume are going to be quite valuable.
01:17:07.518 - 01:17:08.260, Speaker A: Now.
01:17:09.030 - 01:18:18.730, Speaker C: You've taken all of that out and now you've got all of those good assets and you've got those customer liabilities. You take it all out, you put it in a new company, right? So now what you have is you have the capacity to run FTX 2.0. You could run an exchange that has really good UI UX, really good trading engine, stuff that people like with the licenses, potentially with the sort of I'm not sure if you can still get the banking facilities and all that. You get all that good stuff, but you also have a ton of customer liabilities which you cannot currently meet because you just don't do liquidity. What you do now is you basically try and you offer the customers a swap on their debt, right? Instead of the sort of scenario I use was, let's say you have taken all the liabilities and liabilities, let's say it's $8 billion, right? And let's say you've only got $4 billion of assets left, right? $4 billion of assets. Some of it is trump to lose 2024. So it's not like you can immediately turn that into cash to meet withdrawals forever.
01:18:18.730 - 01:19:08.298, Speaker C: So what are you going to do? So what you could do is say, all right, I've got 8 billion in liabilities, I've got 4 billion in assets, including some very illiquid assets. That's fine. I'm going to swap 50% of my liabilities into tokens, right? So if you had $100,000 on FTX, you now have $50,000, which you can use, you can withdraw, you can do whatever the hell you want with it, you can trade with it. $50,000. The other $50,000 gets converted into a token. And I've sort of called them FTX recovery tokens, FTR, if you will. Now, what FTR is meant to give you, and at least in this sort of initial pitch I had, there's probably other ways of structuring it.
01:19:08.298 - 01:19:53.078, Speaker C: But to keep it quite simple, what FTR could do is it gives you a percentage of the trading revenues of the new exchange. Now, we're assuming this new exchange works, right? The assumption here is that a new exchange is born. We use employees that are competent, we have a competent management team. People still want to trade on it because it's a decentralized ownership owned by the community, but centralized exchange with transparency and people still want to use it. Right? If people still use, it's going to generate fees, it's going to generate cash flows. And you can, over time, use the cash flows from running this exchange to pay back your users, the people who hold Ft recovery tokens.
01:19:53.174 - 01:19:56.602, Speaker B: Yeah, this is super similar to the BFX token back in the day.
01:19:56.656 - 01:20:33.506, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And because they are tokens, you would then sort of have a market for them, either officially or unofficially. Right. Where if I don't price this, I want to get out of this at, fine, you can get out or I want to hold onto it. Maybe over time, the value of an FTR token will be a lot higher as the exchange sort of ramps up in value. So that creates a sort of liquidity as well. For someone who's holding 50 grand in cash on the exchange and 50 grand in FTR tokens, you could be, all right, I don't want this giving you 20 grand and I'll give you my FDR tokens.
01:20:33.506 - 01:20:46.138, Speaker C: So that sort of takes you to a point where your balance sheet solvent because now you're 4 billion assets, 4 billion liabilities. Right. I go into a bit more detail in my Tweet. Maybe you can maybe twin share it or something.
01:20:46.304 - 01:20:47.990, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes.
01:20:48.150 - 01:20:59.582, Speaker C: Yeah. So essentially to sort of make those illiquid assets a bit more liquid and sort of talking about how you could do governance structures around it. But I don't want to take up the rest of this show.
01:20:59.716 - 01:21:27.766, Speaker B: Well, one thing that I did want to add was that I don't know how closely you looked at the structure of the BFX token, but if I remember correctly, so because there was a market, you could, like you said, just be like, I'm just going to take my $0.20 on the dollar, I'm happy with that. But the other thing is that you could actually cash it in for equity in the company. I saw that. Yeah. And then the last bit was, yeah, you could just hold onto it and wait to see if the value of it would rise. So it would be like one to one.
01:21:27.766 - 01:21:35.914, Speaker B: But yeah, these are all kind of really interesting things that happened back then. And you're right, I mean, it worked for so no, just to add from.
01:21:35.952 - 01:22:20.630, Speaker A: A US bankruptcy perspective, many times you'll have either a company sold or restructured, but then you have two other pockets of recovery. One is maybe like a liquidation trust with some special assets in it and sometimes also in addition or as part of it, a litigation trust. And so sometimes you'll get units in these things. And so what's nice about tokenization, this is ripe for disruption from crypto, is these probably things probably should be tokenized. And so you could swap up whatever you want. So you want to keep the litigation trust, but you want to sell the venture portfolio, but you want to keep the equity in the nuco. So if you have probably three tokens, I thought that was the way that Wazi was kind of pitching it, or I don't know if you were, but I'll add to it that people can pick and choose their poison.
01:22:20.970 - 01:22:22.310, Speaker C: I think that's brilliant.
01:22:23.390 - 01:22:50.274, Speaker A: You want to own the venture, but you don't want to own the equity or you don't really want to own litigation because that's not really your thing. But you want to be longitude, crypto things. So the venture portfolio plus the equity and the nuco. So that's the fun part about crypto. There's exceptions for security offerings under 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. I mean, there are some limitations to it, but for the most part you should be able to issue equity again. That's good flexibility of the US Bankruptcy Code.
01:22:50.274 - 01:22:52.900, Speaker A: I'm just going to keep saying good things about US Bankruptcy Code.
01:22:55.830 - 01:23:05.042, Speaker C: I really like the thought, actually, Thomas, I actually really wasn't thinking about literally carving up to that level. But that would be very interesting if we did end up carving in the venture portfolio.
01:23:05.186 - 01:23:07.800, Speaker A: Was it $1.5 billion put in it?
01:23:09.210 - 01:23:30.110, Speaker C: Yeah, you could tokenize the venture portfolio, the Alameda bet that bits and pieces of it. There's a lot of ways to carve it. That's interesting, actually. I'll be really keen to actually see this play out. I mean, I think it may be unlikely because presumably someone's going to have to step up and try and lead or run this whole thing.
01:23:30.260 - 01:23:42.290, Speaker B: Yeah, well, that's what I was going to say. So these ideas are floating out there, but for any of them to actually be implemented, then, how would that happen? What is the process to try to make that happen for any listeners who are so inclined?
01:23:42.790 - 01:24:14.266, Speaker C: You need creditor support. Essentially, you need support from the customers because that's kind of how a Chapter Eleven plan works, right? I think it's a tweeted majority in at least one class of creditors in order to approve a plan. So you definitely need creditor customer support for it. I mean, I sort of thought that plan out in the span of like 2 hours and there's a lot of better things you could do with it as Thomas has sort of just improved the plan on this show right here. Yeah, you need customer support. And I've really got DMs from people going, this is great. I've got eight figures.
01:24:14.266 - 01:24:32.274, Speaker C: I've got eight figures. I know people have nine figures on FTX. How do we do it, et cetera, et cetera. Maybe it happens, I don't know. But we kind of have to wait. I think we have to wait a bit for more documents and more information to come out on FTX on the status of all the entities and not what's possible.
01:24:32.392 - 01:25:09.742, Speaker A: Totally. And just to add to that, clearly it's about creditor support. The other thing is, and you mentioned it way earlier in the show, Wazi, is they have the exclusivity period for the debtor. That means if it's a debtor in possession, assuming there's no I mean, usually it's in the case of there's no fraud, like actual fraud traditionally, and there'd still be breaches of trust. You were moving around money you shouldn't have, but you didn't just abscond with money, then you'll be a debtor in possession case. And therefore the debtor generally gets 120 days exclusive period after the petition date to file their own plan. And so my point in sharing that is they sort of drive the bus.
01:25:09.742 - 01:25:43.042, Speaker A: You saw this with Voyager and Celsius. So in Voyager, the Steve gentleman sort of quickly stepped to the side and was like, let's just either do a debt for equity swap or and they have, like toggle plans. So you have two plans going at once. But he said, let's do a plan where everyone gets the equity of the company and we'll also market the company, see if someone will buy us. But. In Celsius, you saw a lot more pushback, basically, because the guy driving the bus, there probably other people in addition to Machinsky, but Alex Machinsky was, hey, I want to try to hold on my equity. Let's do, like, a new token.
01:25:43.042 - 01:26:26.342, Speaker A: We're going to call it Phoenix or whatever the hell we're going to call. You know, there was a bit more back and forth because he was trying to maintain control, and he thought, hey, maybe the mining assets is worth a lot, and I can give that to creditors, and the mining is going to save us. So you see different things being proposed because the debtor has so much control. In this case, I don't know how SBF maybe I guess he's left now, but who actually drives the bus and what their agenda is and how they view these things, because they do drive it a lot. Yes, creditors have a lot of input. At the end of the day, creditors vote on it, but it's kind of know, you vote, but the guy giving the sermon is the priest, and so a lot of people listen to him. So it's like the guys are driving the bus.
01:26:26.342 - 01:26:52.654, Speaker A: The chief restructuring Officer or the executive decisions are going to make a difference in the way these cases go. It'll be super interesting to watch how creditors come out, and I would love to see a tokenization. Whether there's a new coer, you just liquidate and everybody gets I would love to see that. I think it's the right thing to do. I think it's also kind of like a crypto solution for a crypto problem, which is we got into these C Five problems. We just sort of dig ourselves out. And I love the idea.
01:26:52.654 - 01:26:53.006, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:26:53.028 - 01:26:54.894, Speaker C: I think it's sort of us cleaning our own house. Right.
01:26:54.932 - 01:26:56.820, Speaker A: Well, there's no central bank coming.
01:26:57.590 - 01:27:19.450, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's good that you brought up Voyager because I did want to ask about how this affects some of the other bankruptcies, since Voyager obviously had this deal with FTX, and I think they were buying the debt, or I forget what the phrasing is. So describe what the relationship was up until this week and then how all these events will affect that.
01:27:19.600 - 01:27:50.210, Speaker C: So there was a plan in place for FTX to acquire the liabilities of Voyager customers, and Voyager customers would get about $0.72 on a dollar. I think FTX was sort of paying another $100 million on top of that or something. That plan was sort of approved to go to the creditor vote. Sort of creditors were going to vote on it. I believe the latest news is that obviously the deal is no longer on the table, and Voyager is now considering other plans. I'm not sure if you've heard otherwise.
01:27:50.710 - 01:28:21.120, Speaker A: Some interesting thoughts here. So if you all remember, SBF had lent some money to them, and then he subordinated as part of the plan. So that's clearly off. So the creditors are going to not want to subordinate. So that sucks for Voyager, but at the same time, Voyager is going to have a pretty substantial cause of action to offset that debt, probably against the estate of FTX, right? Because he's in breach of contract. I mean, he was supposed to close.
01:28:22.210 - 01:28:27.530, Speaker C: Wasn't there some sort of loans flowing from Voyager to Alameda?
01:28:27.690 - 01:28:28.574, Speaker A: I'm sure there was.
01:28:28.612 - 01:28:33.566, Speaker C: I recall there were some loans flowing between them as well. So presumably I'm wondering whether you could.
01:28:33.588 - 01:28:45.330, Speaker A: Even yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure you can net it if it's on the netting is going to be interesting. I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do counterclaims where you can net. But then the other thing is, wazi if you're right and that just means.
01:28:45.400 - 01:28:47.554, Speaker B: That the two cancel each other out.
01:28:47.752 - 01:28:48.498, Speaker A: Yes, correct.
01:28:48.584 - 01:28:49.062, Speaker C: That's right.
01:28:49.116 - 01:29:04.070, Speaker A: Yeah. They'll be like, I owe you $100, but I paid you $50 some other time, and so we net that or something. I don't know. So you net the counter claims against the other, but wazi if they're all held in trust and you've got a claim.
01:29:04.230 - 01:29:06.026, Speaker C: Exactly what I was going to say.
01:29:06.128 - 01:29:09.674, Speaker A: I know. Almost do your thunder. Say it.
01:29:09.792 - 01:29:14.874, Speaker B: Wait, explain it. Explain it. People like me don't know what you're talking about.
01:29:14.992 - 01:29:45.190, Speaker C: All right, think of it this way, right? Netting, it means, like, let's say I owe you $100 and you owe me $100. So we're just going to call it zero, right? We'll just set off against each other. The thing is, if all the assets are held on trust, which means that my estate is of zero and you can't net, I'm claiming $100 from you anyway, so tough luck. Did I explain that wrongly?
01:29:46.570 - 01:29:55.786, Speaker B: Because the customers on FTX might actually just own might just be able to get their assets back, quote, unquote, one to one, or whatever the ratio will be.
01:29:55.808 - 01:30:15.266, Speaker A: Well, it's held in trust. You can't sort of go into the trust yeah, because you'd have a claim, but your claim would be an unsecured claim. It's an unsecured general unsecured creditor claim. You wouldn't be non estate property via this trust. English law trust distinction. Yeah.
01:30:15.288 - 01:30:26.302, Speaker B: The Voyager customers are non secured creditors, but then the people are customers there potentially in trust.
01:30:26.456 - 01:30:56.942, Speaker A: Yes. You know, what I'm saying is that their lawsuit against the FTX estate and Sam would be a general unsecured claim. And now when you go into that docket, the FTX docket, what do we say? We said that, well, all the property is actually held in trust, so you got a claim. The problem is you're behind all this trust property that can't be paid back, so all that trust property bucket can't be filled. So you're definitely not getting anything on your journal and secured claim against the right.
01:30:56.996 - 01:30:59.198, Speaker B: Right. So then they wouldn't cancel each other out.
01:30:59.284 - 01:31:01.534, Speaker A: Yeah, they would not cancel each other out.
01:31:01.652 - 01:31:07.130, Speaker B: So then, basically, FTX customers are going to be in a better position than the Voyager customers.
01:31:07.300 - 01:31:10.500, Speaker A: I mean, these are all very fact intensive questions.
01:31:11.190 - 01:31:30.806, Speaker C: Yeah, these are all very fact sensitive questions, but there potentially is a world where the Voyager estate pays out money to the FTX estate without getting anything back, thus making it worse for the Voyager customers, but theoretically better for the FTX customers.
01:31:30.908 - 01:31:42.426, Speaker A: Could very well be because of course, remember, he subordinated that debt and he didn't have to do that. I'm not sure what the debt was. Wasn't like $75 million or something?
01:31:42.608 - 01:31:44.366, Speaker C: Something like that? Yeah, something like that.
01:31:44.468 - 01:31:48.126, Speaker A: I think their claim against the estate is going to be more than that. You're talking about?
01:31:48.148 - 01:31:49.146, Speaker B: Steven aaron.
01:31:49.338 - 01:32:19.770, Speaker A: No. In the Voyager plan, sam, Alameda, FTX, whichever entity it was, they subordinated their claim to customer account claims. I don't know if you remember, he was like all high and mighty, oh, we want customers first, and we're going to subordinate this $75 million check we wrote on. So that's off. I mean, the creditors didn't agree to that, and I'm not sure they'll be bound to. The plan is not going to be approved. So then that's now back to being a claim.
01:32:19.770 - 01:32:21.260, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:32:22.910 - 01:33:13.914, Speaker C: To sort of explain that altogether again, I think what Tom is saying to sort of remind everybody, when Voyager went down, alameda lend 75 million to Voyager, and then Sam was all high and mighty, going, oh, don't worry about the $75 billion. We'll pay all the customers back first. So forget about the Alameda $75 billion. All right, it's cool, don't worry about it. Right. And the thing is, now that the plan is gone and Sam is out of the picture, and the role of the guys running FTX now is to maximize the size of the bankruptcy estate, you're probably not bound to agree to subordinate your $75 million claim to the Voyager customers. So now you're putting a claim in there as well for the $75 million back?
01:33:14.112 - 01:33:18.762, Speaker A: Well, the subordination was part of a plan that's not going to be approved now. The bankruptcy plan is off.
01:33:18.816 - 01:33:19.420, Speaker C: Correct.
01:33:21.250 - 01:33:21.998, Speaker A: Right.
01:33:22.164 - 01:33:24.938, Speaker B: The one with Voyager. Between Alameda and Voyager.
01:33:25.034 - 01:33:25.630, Speaker A: Right.
01:33:25.780 - 01:33:41.140, Speaker B: Okay, last bit now to talk about is BlockFi. It was a similar situation with BlockFi where they struck some deal with FTX. Can you explain what their relationship was before all the events of last week?
01:33:43.030 - 01:33:46.680, Speaker A: He bought it. I don't know. What was the relationship?
01:33:47.930 - 01:34:37.346, Speaker C: I believe that the relationship was that Blockfly was running to some liquidity issues and then FTX, or FTX US, apparently provided a 400 million dollar revolving credit facility correct me if the numbers are wrong, but it sounds about right. Which would allow BlockFi to continue its operations. When the news came out, everyone was very worried about Blockfly because, hey, you guys borrowed money from FTX and they may start recalling their loans. And if they pull their loans, how are you going to service your own customers. Sam came all the time saying FTX US is fine, everything is backed one to one, blah, blah, blah. And then Blockfly came out saying, don't worry, our counterparty was FTX US. It wasn't the Alameda FTX International shit show.
01:34:37.346 - 01:35:03.966, Speaker C: So we're good. A day later they cease withdrawals, saying, well fuck. So I'm not 100%. Obviously we haven't seen the loan documentation. It could well be the case that they genuinely were contracting with FTX US, but maybe there was a guarantee coming in from somewhere else. Maybe there was sort of other borrowers in the structure. We don't know.
01:35:03.966 - 01:35:18.722, Speaker C: But it looks like contagion is already happening, it's already starting. And I'll be very interested to see how this plays out over time. I think BlockFi is most certainly in a whole world of trouble. There will be other guys who are.
01:35:18.776 - 01:35:21.070, Speaker A: Going to file because they have to file immediately.
01:35:21.150 - 01:35:24.002, Speaker C: Really well, Thomas is very direct about.
01:35:24.056 - 01:35:35.702, Speaker B: It, but yeah, FTX US, since FTX US filed for bankruptcy, that would make sense because BlockFi is $400 million, probably.
01:35:35.756 - 01:36:29.030, Speaker C: In a bit of trouble. I'm very, very interested to see the documents that Alameda FTX file. Because you recall Accord, it's also ironic now, right, that Seb was going around saying, oh, there's a lot of exchanges and platforms, they're secretly insolvent. And you recall the period where he was walking around saying that he wanted to be the JP morgan of the crypto world, bailing people out left and right, etc. Well, if you got a bailout from Sam or Alameda, you're probably shitting yourself, right? Like because you've just delayed the inevitable, right? Let's say you've taken money, let's say you've taken money from FTX International, Alameda FTCs, whatever. You have taken money from them. They have gone up to Chapter Eleven, which means that they are going to be pooling all of those loans, all that financing they're giving to you, which were there because you needed to pluck a gap in the first place.
01:36:29.030 - 01:37:20.610, Speaker C: Which means you just ripped off the Band Aid and the wound is still gushing, which is not good. So we know some people, right? So BlockFi is obviously one of those. We don't know who else has been affected, we don't know who Sam has been handing out loans. Mean people say there's very credible theory going around that Sam did some of these bailouts because he needed to stop them from liquidating the FTP collateral. I think there could be some leaks to that theory, but we don't know the things, we don't know what Sam has been doing behind the scenes. And if you look at the fallout from Terra, you look at the fallout from Tree AC, people tend to keep very quiet about their finances saying everything is fine. If you tell us that we are insolvent, we're going to sue you for defamation, blah, blah, blah, until they actually file for insolvency.
01:37:20.610 - 01:37:21.946, Speaker C: So it'll be interesting to see what.
01:37:21.968 - 01:37:25.146, Speaker A: Happens, what comes out all right, you.
01:37:25.168 - 01:37:32.880, Speaker B: Guys, this has been a mammoth episode. Is there anything that we didn't cover that you think listeners should know about?
01:37:33.570 - 01:37:47.220, Speaker A: I really think that over a very long period of time, it's possible the venture portfolio leads to OK, recoveries. I got us. And the causes of action here are going to be absolutely astonishingly. Amazing. They're gone for a decade, but we covered that.
01:37:48.070 - 01:39:04.982, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it could go on for a very long time. Like, Thomas's venture portfolio could well bail everyone out, who knows, right? Everything goes to the moon in the next three cycles before this is all over, and suddenly FTX is incredibly solvent and everyone gets made whole all the time. Which is why it also quite makes sense if you then tokenize bits and pieces of it. I'm really hoping we end up with some sort of crypto native solution to this problem, because the problem, if you ask me, has never been it's not really about a centralized exchange, it's simply the fact that centralized exchange was being run in this irresponsible and honestly rather fraudulent manner. We still need centralized exchanges, if you ask me. I mean, maybe I'm a bit more of a Tart five boomer lawyer, web two lawyer, whatever, but end of the day, if you want sort of mainstream adoption, it's a lot easier for someone to say, hey, this is the point where I go in, connect my bank account, buy some crypto and so on, right? Not everyone's going to self custody. They should, and over time, as they I mean, that was almost my own journey into it, right? When a lot of people, you come to crypto, the first thing you do, you go and buy crypto on an exchange like binance, like FTX.
01:39:04.982 - 01:39:45.190, Speaker C: Over time, you get involved in the more degen stuff and you go, all right, you know what, I need my own MetaMask so I can go on uniswap and swap out and buy some shitcoins and so on and so forth. Right. But it's still helpful to centralized exchanges, if you ask me. They need to be run in a manner that's a lot more transparent, a lot more compliant. I think CZ is sort of really starting to lead the way in that for all the good he's doing, I still think Daunting is a good thing to have, like one exchange dominating literally all of the market share. So, yeah, it'll be really cool to see a centralized exchange that's being run in a decentralized.
01:39:47.130 - 01:40:15.150, Speaker B: So. But the last kind of takeaway for anybody who has funds on FTX would be or FTX us or really any entity involved would be that if the community somehow manages to go this token route or community dow based route, then they could presumably kind of resolve it much more quickly and get access to at least some of their funds much more quickly. Is that the upshot?
01:40:15.730 - 01:40:47.370, Speaker C: Yes, that is the upshot, but the community, you would probably need to organize. I don't know, maybe if you have eight, nine figures, you want to do this DM me or Thomas or Laura, we'll put something together. Yeah, but for everyone else, because I know everyone else is very worried about this. What do I do? Do I have to sue someone? Should I lawyer up? Can you be my lawyer? I've had a lot of these DMs. It's terrible. And I know it's like life changing money to a lot of people. It's an absolute, complete tragedy in the space.
01:40:47.370 - 01:41:22.322, Speaker C: But I would say, don't waste your money lawyering up unless you have like eight, nine figures on there. Because at this point, there really isn't much you can do. Just kind of like, wait for the process to play out. When if, for instance, the community does rally and there is a push to run this sort of restructuring plan, you will have a chance to sort of come on board. If there isn't and it goes straight to a liquidation, you will have a chance to vote. You will have a chance to prove for your dad and so on and so forth. But it sucks.

01:41:44.964 - 01:42:00.740, Speaker C: Can follow me on Twitter at lawyer. I tweet the most when shit really hits the fan and things start going bankrupt. When that isn't the case, I tweet random stuff about a hentai anime penguin project, which most people probably don't care about.
