00:00:00.330 - 00:00:44.950, Speaker A: My guess is that it will be slightly lower. So I don't think it will be higher, but I don't think it's going to be dramatically lower. I just think there's a lot of people who have liquidity needs. But I do think that the overall staking derivatives ecosystem is expanding quite dramatically. Like there's a lot of different staking derivatives. There's also things like Eigen layer which will allow you to sort of stake your assets and provide them to certain networks for services on chain like Oracles or other things like that. And so there's sort of a sense in which that there's a bunch of opportunities, yield opportunities tied to staking that are sort of growing over the next few years.
00:00:44.950 - 00:00:58.220, Speaker A: And I expect the recovery time from maybe a slight dip to not be not very long in some sense. To me, the only single origin organic yield on chain right now is.
