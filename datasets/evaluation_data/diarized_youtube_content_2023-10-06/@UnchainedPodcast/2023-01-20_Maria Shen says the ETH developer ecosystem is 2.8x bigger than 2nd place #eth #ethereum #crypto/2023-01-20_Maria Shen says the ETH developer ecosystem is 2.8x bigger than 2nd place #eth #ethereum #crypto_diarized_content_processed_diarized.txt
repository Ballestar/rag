00:00:00.170 - 00:00:40.710, Speaker A: Is our fourth annual report now and year after year, ethereum is the biggest developer ecosystem by by a long shot. So even today, their developer ecosystem is 2.8 times larger than the next biggest ecosystem. So they dominate, and they don't dominate just by a little bit. They dominate by a lot. And a lot of that has to do with how easy it is to be a developer in Ethereum. I think solidity may not be the easiest, working in blockchain may not be the easiest, but there are amazing learning resources for anyone who wants to get started in solidity, for anyone who wants to get started in EVM compatible kind of ecosystems.
00:00:40.710 - 00:00:59.290, Speaker A: That resource is probably the richest that we have in crypto. And so we kind of see that 16% of all new develop that come into crypto start in the Ethereum ecosystem. So Ethereum is kind of this starter pool for anyone who's coming in and they're able to retain.
