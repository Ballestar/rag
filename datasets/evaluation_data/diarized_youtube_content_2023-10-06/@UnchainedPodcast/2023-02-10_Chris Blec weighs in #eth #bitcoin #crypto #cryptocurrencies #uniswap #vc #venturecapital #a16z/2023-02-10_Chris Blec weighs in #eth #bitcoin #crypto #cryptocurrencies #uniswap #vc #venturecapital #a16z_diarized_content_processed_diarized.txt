00:00:00.170 - 00:00:56.540, Speaker A: My personal opinion is it's a horrible system if you're trying to create a decentralized, autonomous organization, which is what a Dao is supposed to be, right? So if you have a situation like we've seen before with Uni, with MakerDAO, with a bunch of other DAOs out there where these small token holders operate, and they do the work and they vote on things and they're able to do what they want to do until something that they want to do goes against the interests of one of those large whale organizations or whatever it might be, then that whale organization comes in and just votes on those certain proposals that do go against their financial interests. That is a problem, right? Because you are creating this illusion that it is decentralized and that it is people powered when in reality, it's always being watched by the actual owner. In this case, a 16 Z.
