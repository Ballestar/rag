00:01:24.250 - 00:01:52.998, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Welcome to our panel. It starts with the charts. My name is Laura Shin, and I host the podcast and video series unchanged. I've covered crypto for nearly six years and was previously a senior editor at Forbes, where I was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full time. Our two guests today are Peter L. Brandt, futures and FX trader and author and publisher of the Factor report, and Willie Wu on chain bitcoin analyst and writer of the bitcoin Forecast, a market intelligence newsletter.
00:01:52.998 - 00:01:54.690, Speaker A: Welcome, Peter and Willie.
00:01:55.430 - 00:01:59.042, Speaker C: Hey, good to be with you, Laura. Good to see you again.
00:01:59.096 - 00:02:02.420, Speaker D: Willie, likewise. Looking forward to this.
00:02:03.190 - 00:02:28.330, Speaker A: Peter, let's start with you to get the big picture on what is happening with bitcoin, you recently tweeted, bitcoin is undergoing its third parabolic advance in the past decade, and I think you have been recently saying it's even undergoing a fourth now. And you've said to see that number of parabolic advances is extremely rare and even historic. So can you explain why it is so historic?
00:02:28.910 - 00:03:13.514, Speaker C: Oh, sure, I'd like to. Laura, your production folks have a chart that shows the parabolic advances in bitcoin in an accelerating market that is accelerating the acceleration. And I've traded for 46 years. I've studied charts over really centuries. I'm kind of a chart nerd. I love charts, and somebody would have told me that there would be a market during my lifetime that would not only experience a parabolic advance, but experience four parabolic advances, not just on an arithmetic scale, but on a log scale. I would have bet my life against that.
00:03:13.514 - 00:03:54.214, Speaker C: This is just unbelievable. People get caught up in the daily motion and the daily moment of bitcoin without realizing we're seeing a market advance unlike anything we've ever really seen before. To have four parabolic advances on a log scale in the course of a ten year period is just unheard of. I would challenge anybody to find a price chart of any asset or any commodity item that has gone through this. And so we're really witnessing history. This is history in the making. This is something that history books will be written on.
00:03:54.214 - 00:04:32.962, Speaker C: As a trader, it's just unbelievable that I can participate in a market that is going through a situation like this. This is just spectacular, spectacular ride. And everybody that's involved in Bitcoin can know that they're really taking part in history. Willie will better describe, really the underpinnings of history and what it really means in terms of real world finance, monetary system and so forth. That's not my specialty. I'm a chartist, I'm a trader, I'm a chartist. But as a chartist, this is just something so special, I really can't even express it.
00:04:33.096 - 00:04:41.880, Speaker A: And just briefly, before we turn to Willie, can you also define a parabolic advance for the members of our audience who aren't familiar with these technical terms?
00:04:42.250 - 00:05:11.390, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, we all know what an uptrend is. And a parabolic advance, Laura, is an advance that accelerates over a period of time. Not only does it go up steadily, but it goes up in an accelerating manner. And we can find all kinds of stock charts that have had one or maybe two parabolic advances on an arithmetic chart. But to have a parabolic advance on a log chart is just spectacular.
00:05:12.610 - 00:05:18.130, Speaker A: And so, Willie, how would you put Bitcoin into a historical context as an asset?
00:05:18.630 - 00:06:10.340, Speaker D: Yeah, it's an interesting one because I see Bitcoin more as a new technology rollout, and we never see new technology being traded on a live market. Before Bitcoin's, the first time we've had know, the internet exploded onto the scene and we had a whole lot of new technologies. But you'll notice that those startups that were forging those technologies, they were not listed on a stock exchange till very much later into their maturity phase. So here in Bitcoin, we've got from X number of months into it, from 2009, we had a live price of Bitcoin. And you just can see the crazy volatility in that market. And that is normal for burgeoning new technology. Anyone who's been in a sea level startup will know how schizophrenic the ups and downs of that ride is.
00:06:10.340 - 00:06:35.660, Speaker D: One day you're on top of the world and you're going to conquer the world, and the next day all doom is here and you're not going to survive the next month. And we've had a number of these journeys in Bitcoin, even through the first ten years, many years into it. So what we're seeing here in my eyes is this new technology finding price discovery in a phase that we've never seen before.
00:06:36.270 - 00:07:02.318, Speaker A: And Peter, just to draw out one more comparison between crypto and traditional markets, much has been made of how crypto trades differently because it trades 24 7365 across global markets, and also because of how the movements are often affected by memes. And I wondered how you would compare the way bitcoin trades to the way different types of traditional assets trade.
00:07:02.494 - 00:07:30.822, Speaker C: Well, I guess I'd break that down in two ways, Laura. One way is just from an historical perspective, the magnitude of the advance, the nature of the advance in bitcoin really can't be compared. It isn't a class by itself. Of course, we have some other crypto coins that have had a similar move. But I think in my mind, bitcoin is the legacy. It is crypto. Crypto is bitcoin, bitcoin is crypto.
00:07:30.822 - 00:07:59.298, Speaker C: And obviously we do have some of the other coins and altcoins and so forth. And so we can't compare it, but in some sense we can. It's interesting you work for Forbes. The editor of Forbes in the 1920s. There was a guy by the name of Richard W. Shellbacher schaubacher in 1934 published a book which lays out the classical charting principles that charters use today. He was the author of classical charting.
00:07:59.298 - 00:08:37.780, Speaker C: And so the types of chart construction that he wrote about 1934, we see on a regular basis in bitcoin rectangles, head and shoulders, trend lines, all of those things not only apply to bitcoin, but really characterize bitcoin as a classical chartist. I think bitcoin is the purest market there is. And so it complies with what I know to be history in terms of classical charting, but at the same time, from a more broader picture, from an historic picture, it's one unto itself.
00:08:38.390 - 00:09:11.386, Speaker A: All right, so now let's turn to discussing this current cycle, which I think in some ways has surprised some bitcoiners, even at the same time that they knew all along it would happen. And Willie, in one of your recent newsletters, you wrote, quote, bitcoin is undergoing the largest supply shock in its history. The steepest price rise seen so far in 21 has been supported by strong fundamentals. And then you wrote, my macro top target has now increased to previously it was 250K. Can you elaborate on what you meant.
00:09:11.418 - 00:10:18.802, Speaker D: There, going back to the supply shock we've just never seen in the history of bitcoin so much of the coins being scooped up and bought and locked away by very strong holders of the coin. And we can see this from tracking the flows of coins out of the exchanges, where typically people speculate or buy and sell their coins and they have a set inventory, some of which is allocated for speculation. And we've just seen an unprecedented amount of depletion of that inventory. If you look back in the 2017 bull market, we saw like a five month depletion of inventory. And that was enough to propel the bull market of 2017 right up to the 20,000 from what initially was about one and a half $1,000. When that inventory depletion ended, and now we're kind of in this zone of eleven to twelve months of inventory depletion. We've not seen this before.
00:10:18.802 - 00:10:54.750, Speaker D: And you can look on chain and look at the holders and you can see the wallets that the holders, the behavior of the wallets by the holders. And there's a category where we term a liquid. These guys are just accumulating, buying and accumulating without any history of selling. And these guys are just hoovering up the coins. So there's a real supply shock. There's less and less coins each week that goes by that's available to be bought. And so obviously there's a mismatch between demand and supply and that has launched the price vertical.
00:10:54.750 - 00:11:51.978, Speaker D: And for some technical traders that do trade indicators on the price fluctuations, they are all screaming overbought, overbought, overheated. Whilst if you look into the ledger and see the demand and supply of the coins by fundamental investors, you can see that it's fully supported. And so I run a very simple model, it's a mean reversion model, which is in simple terms as a moving average on the market cap, all time moving average. And you can use that to predict tops. It has predicted every top in bitcoin history. And so currently that top target is launching upwards. And at the start of this year, January, it was zoning into an area of $200 to $300,000 by December.
00:11:51.978 - 00:12:10.210, Speaker D: And December of this year is typical to what we would expect for the end of a bull market. If we get that, not saying that will happen this time around, but if we do top out in December, that target now is lifted to above 300,000 because the trajectory of that upper band.
00:12:10.290 - 00:12:27.980, Speaker A: Of that moving average, well that's really exciting. And so earlier when you were talking about all these holders who are buying, moving the bitcoin off exchanges into wallets that do not really have a history of selling, who do you think those groups or people are?
00:12:28.910 - 00:13:37.970, Speaker D: It's very unusual because normally what you expect is as more retail comes in, more mums and pops, ordinary people off the streets, they tend to buy their coins and hold them on their exchange wallet because it's just a very easy experience. So we've had this general trend of more and more coins being stored on exchanges, like the Coinbases of this world. It's a very easy to use experience, but in this particular cycle we're seeing huge amounts of coins move off exchanges and being locked away under their own custody. And that's the signature of institutional players coming in and high net worth individuals, they tend to store their coins under custody and in cold storage. So those clues and just the sheer size of the purchases, you can see the size of the withdrawals coming out from the exchanges. They just really point to institutions scooping up coins. So it's very unlikely it's anything else but the institutions.
00:13:38.390 - 00:13:48.754, Speaker A: And by that you mean like Tesla MicroStrategy the corporate treasurers that are buying Bitcoin? Or are there any other institutions you would include in that bucket?
00:13:48.802 - 00:14:46.534, Speaker D: Yeah, institutions is kind of a menagerie, really, because in simple terms, it's just coins held by a custodian for a whole lot of people, whether that's Tesla and their shareholders or fund managers. So it's looking like we've got hedge funds coming in, we've got the corporate treasury led by Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy, and now the latest is being Tesla. But we've also seen announcements that it's pension funds as well. Grayscale said that they had a lot of strong buying from there. I've just seen that New Zealand has announced that one of their funds for pensions has bought into Bitcoin in October. So, yeah, across the gamut, there's all sorts of institutions buying right now. It seems like the word is out that Bitcoin is now a valid investment alternative to gold in these times.
00:14:46.732 - 00:15:08.750, Speaker A: And so then if we were to zoom out and kind of look at Bitcoin in its trajectory of, let's say, like historical adoption, if we were to look back 50 years from now and look at this moment in time, then where would you both say Bitcoin kind of is currently in its historical adoption period?
00:15:09.250 - 00:15:52.694, Speaker C: I have a question, Laura, I'd like to ask Willie, because his comments really I found really super interesting, because I don't really dig into what happens to coins as they flow into the blockchain. They get taken out of exchanges. That's his expertise, not mine. But what I have noticed looking at the exchanges in terms of the bid offer spread, what happens on the bid? What happens on the offer side is oftentimes when a market blows off and we hear some people say, this is a big bubble we're blowing off. Bitcoin is a bubble. There are characteristics of a bubble. One of them is that markets go up fast with bids.
00:15:52.694 - 00:16:36.502, Speaker C: There's aggressive bids that take place in the late stages of a bull market that kind of blow it off and all those bids come in and chase the market's FOMO. What we know is retail FOMO takes place within the whole market. This market is very different. What I've noticed is the market is not necessarily going up on aggressive bids. What's happening is an offer comes in and just immediately gets taken. And so this nature of the bull market is such that what I see is whenever something is offered, it's just taken immediately by somebody who's willing to take the offer. So rather than going up on bids, it's going up on higher offer prices, higher and higher offer prices.
00:16:36.502 - 00:17:04.558, Speaker C: That may sound like there's really no difference to people who I'm familiar with how markets behave, but for me, as a technical trader, that's really significant because it shows me that there are big names, there are deep top pockets that are saying we're not going to chase the market, but whenever something gets offered, we're willing to take it. And that kind of resonates very well with what Willie described.
00:17:04.734 - 00:17:24.698, Speaker D: Yeah. So you're saying that whenever there's a big offer on hand, large enough for very large purchases come in, they'll take it because there's not a lot of offers that size that's on the table, and they're just waiting for whenever there's an offer, they'll take it. Yeah, that's know, I have another question.
00:17:24.864 - 00:18:05.398, Speaker C: That I'd love to ask. You know, Willie refers to Bitcoin as a technology, which it is. But the interesting thing for me is in those cases where I have seen an asset or a market or a commodity have the kind of parabolic advances that we're seeing. What they have been primarily is currency markets. They've represented the destruction of a currency, a monetary system. They have been the currency against the dollar. So, in other words, how many of these currencies can $1 buy? We saw it in the German mark in the 1920s.
00:18:05.398 - 00:19:05.286, Speaker C: Your production guys may have a quick chart of that. It's not a very good chart, but it does show it. We've seen it in third world currencies in Africa. This is marks per US dollar in the 1920s. And what it shows is we went from kind of late 19 teens of five, six marks per dollar, and then we go into really the destruction of the mark at that point, which was obviously connected with a previous political structure, but we saw the mark become worthless. And we've seen that with third world currencies, african countries, Latin American countries. And so when we look at Bitcoin, beyond just being a technology, but being a form of money, the only other charts that I can see when I look back in history that had a similar parabolic move have really been currency charts that have been the destruction of that currency.
00:19:05.286 - 00:19:20.078, Speaker C: I'm just curious as to how Willie relates to Bitcoin also as a form of money, as a monetary system, because monetary systems are the only places where I've seen charts that have a similar parabolic move.
00:19:20.244 - 00:20:05.034, Speaker D: Well, it's absolutely fascinating, Peter, because I look at this chart and I go, yeah, that's exactly right. I'll flip those currencies and I'll go, US. Dollars per bitcoin. And that's essentially what we're tracking, this destruction of fiat currency as Bitcoin starts to suck in that monetary base. I think what we're witnessing here is the birth of a new monetary base, which is no longer based on fiat. It's based on consensus, agreement that this has value. And this thing is a value that can be stored online, digitally, moved across borders within seconds.
00:20:05.034 - 00:20:52.234, Speaker D: And so it's an Internet age technology. It's a new Internet age monetary standard, and it's one that is going to keep up with the world's needs into this digital age. If you think about what happened with the industrial age, we moved from essentially commodity money in gold, silver, copper, and we moved into trading currency like paper backed by this commodity. And that was really to keep track of an industrial age economy. Obviously, it's too slow to ship bars of gold around the world. So now we're in a digital age. It's very similar in that Fiat is just so slow and broken.
00:20:52.234 - 00:21:48.974, Speaker D: If anyone that thinks Fiat works well, they're only using it in a local stance within their country. Once you start to do cross border payments, it's very slow, it's very painful. And so we're in this phase, I think that we're moving and crossing deeply into a digital age. And to go back to the first point that Laura posed, where are we now looking? If we were pan as the future and look back, we're currently just barely above 2% of the world having exposure to Bitcoin. Even fewer that are actually using it to transmit funds. Most people are holding it to get exposure, but it's growing. This thing has been growing for eleven years nonstop, at a doubling every twelve months.
00:21:48.974 - 00:22:39.230, Speaker D: So that puts us at 4%, then 8%, and so forth. And we're currently on track for 1 billion people having exposure to Bitcoin as an asset class in the next four years. So by 2025, one 8th of the world population will have exposure to this monetary base. So it's happening very quickly. And in terms of Internet era like where we are right now, it's equivalent of 1994 for the rollout of the Internet. And I believe from memory, someone might be able to pull it up in the next four years. We're going to teleport into 2005 for the Internet rollout equivalent, which, if you think about that, 94 was very slow dial up Internet.
00:22:39.230 - 00:23:02.454, Speaker D: Very few people used it, but it was growing quickly. And then 2005, we had everybody on Facebook, the iPhone was just around the corner and the Internet was available to everybody on the planet if they needed it. So, yeah, the next four years is going to bring a lot of changes to the financial system, that's for sure.
00:23:02.652 - 00:23:18.438, Speaker A: And why do you think that timeline is being sped up for crypto? Is it because we already have the Internet built now? Is that why you were saying this leap of ten years in the Internet era is going to be accomplished in five years in crypto?
00:23:18.614 - 00:24:21.946, Speaker D: Yeah. New technologies are built on older technologies and the propagation of information goes faster and faster. So if Bitcoin could be built on sailing ships and we can transmit transactions on a piece of paper, which you can actually do, obviously it would take months for that piece of paper to transmit to another continent, but now we can transmit that in milliseconds across the internet, so that's speeding things up. And you'll see, if you plot the progress and adoption of new technology, we call this S curves, because that's max how much penetration, the rate of penetration, they're slow at the start, they go exponential, and then they kind of cape off as you reach saturation. Those s curves are long and flat and slow for the earlier technologies like radio, then TV. And then we had, I guess, what do we have? Mobile phones and internet. And so each curve became faster and faster.
00:24:21.946 - 00:24:44.440, Speaker D: And so it's a natural trend that this technology bitcoin expands faster. Yeah, it's probably the biggest thing that's happened to money since the invention of money, I would say. It's not just a one in a hundred year thing, it's a one in humanity event.
00:24:45.130 - 00:24:59.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree. I've also heard you make comparisons to the way bitcoin trades or the way people invest in bitcoin to shares of internet startups. Can you talk a little bit about how those are similar and or different?
00:25:00.290 - 00:25:55.870, Speaker D: I think I've kind of covered it earlier in that the trajectory is very upward, like a seed investor. I'll put it this way. When bitcoin was around, even, say, four years ago, and the times before that, the first six or seven years, everyone said, this thing is not real, it's a bubble, it's going to pop. And no one gets 10,000 x return in such a compressed amount of years. That's a tulip bubble. But anyone in technology that has invested in seed level startups with a valuation of maybe typically a seed level startup is valued at $6 million at the start. And if they go IPO and then become the next Uber, amazon or so forth, you're now talking in the tens to $100 billion of valuation.
00:25:55.870 - 00:26:48.874, Speaker D: And that journey takes around six to ten years. And so, right there in new technology, investors at the seed level are very comfortable with the idea of getting 10,000 x on a winning technology. And that's essentially what we're seeing with bitcoin. Those types of gains are very routine in new technology rollouts. The only difference right now is that bitcoin just so happened to have a publicly tradable price that everybody could see and retail. Anybody in the world had access to buy that asset right at the get go. And interestingly, the institutions, the smartest money in the room, they weren't allowed to because regulatory bars prevented them from actually directly buying the asset.
00:26:48.874 - 00:27:02.420, Speaker D: So it's kind of flipped the whole thing on its ends, where bitcoin was open to everybody else except the big money. So I find that very interesting.
00:27:03.510 - 00:27:44.154, Speaker C: The interesting thing for me, Will, is when I first got involved, and you were involved in bitcoin long before I was. My involvement began in early 2016 when the founder of real Vision, Raul Paul, sent me a chart of bitcoin. I get an email from raul has a chart of bitcoin. It's by February, March of 2016, and Raul says, you're a chart of speeder. What do you make of this thing? And I looked at it and I heard about bitcoin kind of in the periphery. I understood it existed. I didn't know much about it, just thought it was just a currency money that would become another beanie baby or pet rock.
00:27:44.154 - 00:28:11.338, Speaker C: And I look at the chart that he sends, I go, wow, this is crazy. And that's when he introduced me to his exchange. I open an account, I get involved in bitcoin, like March April 2016. Initially for me, bitcoin was a chart. Then bitcoin became just a trade. As a trader in the US. I've always measured wealth based on us dollars, right? I want to collect us dollars.
00:28:11.338 - 00:29:07.850, Speaker C: I want to look and know that my US dollar worth goes up in a steady rate and maybe has some jumps along the way. And so bitcoin was just a trade. But I think really within the last year, my mindset has really changed is that bitcoin is where I would have wanted all my wealth at some point in time. I really look at it very different, because if my goal as a trader has been to accumulate more US dollars, what that now tells me is I had a wrong goal, because my goal was to accumulate the weakest asset in the world, the most depreciating asset in the world, and that's us. Dollars. And so my mindset really changed within the last year in terms of moving from bitcoin as a trade to bitcoin as a measure of wealth.

00:31:33.390 - 00:32:06.200, Speaker A: And Peter, you've also kind of been talking about the way that I think, at least to my mind, what you're saying is that bitcoin maybe is maturing a little bit. You tweeted recently about what you were calling an orderly bull trend, saying that the 2015 to 2017 bull cycle saw eight corrections exceeding 30%, two of them exceeding 40%. And then you wrote, with the exception of the March 2020 smash, the December 2018 to present bull trend has been extraordinarily orderly so far. So what would you say is the significance of that?
00:32:07.290 - 00:32:35.722, Speaker C: I think Willie pointed that out is we have major institutions, major trading operations, investing operations who are just willing to take offers off the table. And as a result, of course, no market goes straight up, day after day, week after week, month after month. So we have volatility. We've had close to a 30%, right around a 30% correction at one point. Another correction of 26%. That's not the end of the world. Markets have correction.
00:32:35.722 - 00:33:11.850, Speaker C: That's what markets do. They go up, they go down. The important point is, which way are they going on a more sustainable basis? To me, I'm starting to look at bitcoin as we all talk about the evil central banks. Everyone's talking about the central banks destroying the monetary system. And I'm starting to look at bitcoin as a POW asset. And that could mean power of the that could mean the money of the people, the people's money. Bitcoin is really the currency of the world, of the world population.
00:33:11.850 - 00:33:29.310, Speaker C: It's a POW. We're prisoners of war to the central banks. And all of a sudden, bitcoin is our own answer to fiat currencies. And I think that's what's reflected in the fact that there's so much interest to actually own that currency.
00:33:29.890 - 00:33:44.034, Speaker A: I love that, actually, because there's actually a bitcoin specific term, POW, which stands for something very particular to bitcoin. So at first I was like, wait, what is he talking about? But we don't have to get into that has to do with the mining. But anyway, Willie, what were you going to say?
00:33:44.232 - 00:34:28.002, Speaker D: I was just saying that, yeah, it's like really going back to the first chart of German marks against US dollars we've been trading to stack more German marks in a time of hyperinflation versus stacking more bitcoin. I think that anyone who's been in the industry long enough starts to have that sort of mindset shift and suddenly you realize, wow, this is real. This is the new monetary standard. That's the measuring stick in which we start to measure everything and. I mean, certainly when I get US dollars or any kind of fiat, I feel like this thing's a hot potato. It's not going to be worth much soon. We had like 25, 30% more US.
00:34:28.002 - 00:35:22.306, Speaker D: Dollars being printed in the last year alone. So I think most people are really in that mode of really parking it somewhere, whether it's real estate, stocks or bitcoin. And to that point, there's about $500 trillion of assets in the world that people are parking money into as a store of value. And so that is the scale of capital that bitcoin is going to take bites out of. We like to call bitcoin this digital gold. Like, it's this really nice to understand thing that traditional asset managers, traditional investors, can grasp. But really, gold is only $10 trillion, and only $4 trillion is used for financial means, where, like, bitcoin is already a quarter of the way there.
00:35:22.306 - 00:36:00.750, Speaker D: And it's not going to stop. You've got stock markets that are near $100 trillion. You've got real estate, which is like 200 and 2250 trillion dollars. Most people that hold these assets aren't looking for a house or two or five to live in. They're holding it as store of value. So once you get a glimpse of something as easy to access like bitcoin, without the trouble of holding assets like real estate, it's going to take a big chunk out of that. So there's no way bitcoin is going to stop at the market cap of gold, which is 10 trillion.
00:36:00.750 - 00:36:25.800, Speaker D: It's going to go a lot higher, which means that we're going to be going into the millions of dollars per coin, which is kind of hard to believe right now, but if you look at the share fundamentals and stretch it off over the long term, that's how cheap bitcoin is today. And that's why the institutions are buying it. And they're buying it because they think it's going to be as good as gold, but it's going to go a lot higher.
00:36:26.490 - 00:37:20.920, Speaker C: I have a question on that, Willie. When I look back at bitcoin as a student of price, we've seen big run ups followed by 80% corrections. We've seen that in the previous three parabolic advances that were violated. We saw bitcoin set back between 89%. And I guess my own sense is that we've seen the last 80% correction. And I'm just curious, let's say we go to your 300 $400,000 mark by the end of this year. What is a big correction in the future as we look forward and might assume that bitcoin will take a rightful place as a global reserve currency, so to speak, or a global reserve asset, so to speak? What kind of volatility do we see five years from now, ten years from now?
00:37:21.610 - 00:38:28.110, Speaker D: It's a really good question. I'm not sure in the first step of it is once we top out, I'm not sure how far it'll fall back this time under the current situation, we typically see an 80% pullback. $300,000 plus 80% pullback kind of brings us down into the $1 trillion range. And I can see right now the price discovery of bitcoin is very strong in this zone, around $1 trillion. You can look at that in terms of the price in which coins last moved on the network, and it's really clustering strong at this zone of $1 trillion. And you'll look at all the past bull markets, you can see as you roll back the clock, you get this very strong cluster at the base of the bull run, which is what we're forming now, and then we go really high. And then it's almost like when we top out, we come back to revisit that very strong cluster, bounce off that as a rejection off that low before we move into the next bull market.
00:38:28.110 - 00:39:24.326, Speaker D: If that pattern plays out, then, yeah, maybe we go to 300. We come back down to the zone here. But I'm not sure. Like, I kind of visit the stuff one month at a time, quarter by quarter, sometimes just on what I'm seeing through demand and supply on the ledger, there is a general trend downwards, and it isn't a crazy, predictable trend downwards in volatility. I think, actually, we're due to start to drop down into the lower volatility range that well, I don't have the charts right offhand, but I think it'll surprise a lot of people how low the volatility can drop. And beyond a certain part of size of capital base, volatility drops to zero because it becomes the new monetary base. If it does become this unit of account, obviously there's different variations on that theme.
00:39:24.326 - 00:39:35.538, Speaker D: It could be part of a basket of assets that becomes the new monetary base, but ultimately the volatility will drop very low because the new monetary standard part of it.
00:39:35.704 - 00:39:48.600, Speaker A: Peter, I wanted to ask you about something that you wrote on Twitter where you were criticizing the people who have laser eyes on their Twitter profiles, and you call that the single most bearish factor for bitcoin. Why is that?
00:39:49.210 - 00:40:34.370, Speaker C: Well, and I'm not bearish in terms of all of a sudden we go into a bear market. What I'm talking about is there are certain things that, as somebody who is an owner of bitcoin, I know people use the word hodling. I just can't go there at mid 70s. I'm not sure I can adopt the vernacular of the new technology or new monetary system. So I still can refer to as holding. I have the L before the D instead of after the D. But, yeah, I mean, over enthusiasm on any market is always kind of warning not to turn from a bull to a bear or to liquidate long holdings or to liquidate an established position, but it indicates people it's gotten a little frothy.
00:40:34.370 - 00:41:28.760, Speaker C: And all of a sudden, when I saw people who I respected on Twitter as seasoned, reasonable investors. All of a sudden, with a new picture with laser eyes, I kind of go, Whoa, let's deck back a moment. Even I even direct Tweeted, a good friend of mine who is really a fine investor and has been very constructive for bitcoin for a long period of time and just said, hey, redo your picture, will you, please? It's scary because more people put the laser eyes, you know, at least the market is going to get choppy for a while and going to stop going straight up. So I think we need to be alert for that type of thing, is when people start pounding their chest in public. I own bitcoin. I own bitcoin. Look at me, I have laser eyes.
00:41:28.760 - 00:41:33.370, Speaker C: That's always going to be a sign that the Marxist police going to take arrest.
00:41:33.870 - 00:41:59.300, Speaker A: All right, yeah. I was just so curious because obviously that is something all the bitcoiners are doing, and I thought it was kind of fun that you took a contrarian stance to that. So to wrap up, I wanted to ask you for the aspiring chartists in the audience, what particular metrics or trading patterns it is that you think are worth paying attention to and why?
00:42:00.470 - 00:42:42.270, Speaker C: Well, let me start off by saying I think bitcoin charts extremely well, but it charts extremely well for somebody that wants to look at the forest and not the trees is somebody who's looking at 1 minute charts, five minute charts, ten minute charts. I've noticed those are not really reliable charts. You have to look at bitcoin in terms of chart construction, at least on daily charts, if not on weekly charts. You can't look at it every day, every minute. You've got to really step back and look at it at a bigger picture. And that's an advice I would give somebody. Don't get so involved that you're buying and selling bitcoin ten times a day.
00:42:42.270 - 00:43:23.642, Speaker C: Look at bitcoin from an historical perspective. This is not something to be playing around with, it's something to be owned. And so I think there's danger of people getting too short term in bitcoin because at some point in time, they're going to get shaken out of their position. And that's when bitcoin really has a period of strength. And so I think holding L before the D is the thing to do. But for those who really are interested in charting, I bring them back to the 1934 book by the senior editor of Forbes magazine, richard W. Shellbacher, who wrote the book technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits.
00:43:23.642 - 00:44:38.710, Speaker C: Excellent book, but it's a great primer on the type of chart construction I've seen in bitcoin, which is triangles, Shakeouts, Trend Lines, Head and Shoulders and that sort of thing. By the way, I do have a chart there that you have on the current chart outlook for bitcoin. I just want to point that out before we end here. But on that chart, what I'm really seeing is I think that currently bitcoin in this current Bitcoin bull market, from a charting standpoint, where the 2015 to 2017 bull market was in the April May period of 2017, kind of where we're at. And that shows that I think we're at that midpoint pause where in 2017, bitcoin swirled around for a month or two before we saw the final move up. And you'll note that the midpoint in 2015 to 17 bull market was at about one half 60% of the total move. If that's true, really, that points to the type of price level that Willie's talking about.
00:44:38.710 - 00:44:46.614, Speaker C: That $200,000 plus is really where this market would take it if this chart interpretation is correct.
00:44:46.812 - 00:44:48.586, Speaker A: And Willie. What about you?
00:44:48.768 - 00:45:18.750, Speaker D: I kind of agree with where we are in that market. Yeah, that's really interesting. You trade bitcoin on any time cycle. It's possible. Whatever floats your boat, really. You can trade the small time cycles and get a feel of how the markets work on a micro level. Bitcoin is interesting because it's the only asset in the world other than the other cryptos that has a blockchain, but it is actually the only one that has a blockchain that has capital flows that is organic.
00:45:18.750 - 00:46:30.246, Speaker D: And so I have a partnership with Glass Node and they provide about over 300 charts, which those 300 metrics, and they measure different parts of the network and the whole industry, the capital flows going through it. And so it's almost like an ECG that's hooked up to this animal called bitcoin. And it's kind of a detective story of like, whoa, what's happening here? Let's check whales buying. Is it institutions? Whatever's happening this week or that week, you can come down to a diagnosis, probable diagnosis. And so that's the new thing with Bitcoin is that we have this open, transparent ledger where we can visibly see what's actually happening. And then you can kind of translate that and make predictions or explanations of what's actually happening with the price chart, which will then sort of express itself through technical trading patterns because traders are trading around these very specific, like patterns. So there's fundamental demand and supply on the blockchain, and that will express through these technical trading patterns.
00:46:30.246 - 00:46:45.294, Speaker D: And so if you're trading Bitcoin, a full picture would be on chain analysis with the technical and mating the two together. And then that's a new thing within cryptocurrencies, really.
00:46:45.492 - 00:47:20.502, Speaker A: Yeah. And what I love about the way, Willie, you do your analysis is that you come up with really creative ways to describe it, like whale spawning season, when you saw the whales coming in and buying up a lot of coins. Or recently, I noticed you have been tweeting about what you call the Rick athlete score, which I'm sure people can figure that out. But, yeah, it's very fun following your analysis for that reason. All right, well, this has been so fun. Thank you both so much for coming on to the real Vision Crypto Gathering.
00:47:20.646 - 00:47:30.666, Speaker C: Thank you for having me, Laura. And it's always a pleasure to participate with Willie. I always learned something I didn't know before, and this has been no different.
