00:00:00.330 - 00:00:30.066, Speaker A: Twitter is partnering with Etoro to bring crypto trading to the app. This is shocking. I had no idea that Twitter did not already allow crypto trading. Why is there so much spam? Etoro is a social trading platform for mom and pop traders. Although if I had to guess, I'd say the crypto traders on the app are mostly on the pop side. Twitter has also launched a cash tag feature where if you type a dollar sign before a stock symbol get the stock price. Although I just tried this with Twitter's own stock and got an error, which is probably a bug.
00:00:30.066 - 00:00:59.130, Speaker A: Apparently, the cash tag symbol has been used 420,000,000 times, which seems kind of suspicious. 420? Really? Why is Elon Musk a parody of himself? Bitcoin is one of the most searched terms, but I imagine we won't get the exact number until it hits 69 million. This follows the news of PBS. And NPR quitting Twitter over being labeled government funded media, which does seem hard. I once interned at NPR, and I can assure you they're funded by basically no one. Must be somewhat relaxing to be in Elon's shoes right now, though. Like, you can't make Twitter worse.
