00:00:00.250 - 00:01:08.514, Speaker A: Um, thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. Bitcoin Dropped to 42K here are two reasons why bitcoin fell by roughly 10% on Wednesday, dropping from a high of just over $47,000 to below 42 $500 before settling in around the mid 43,000s for the rest of the week. The crowd led to $322.86 million in bitcoin liquidations between Wednesday and Thursday afternoon, the largest such liquidation event by over $100 million since December 3, when over $615,000,000 was washed away in 24 hours. The slump coincided with two negative events for bitcoin. First, the network's hash rate, or the amount of computing power securing it, took a hit on Wednesday when Kazakhstan shut down internet access across the country due to unrest over spiking energy prices. According to Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, as of July 2021, Kazakhstan accounted for roughly 18.1%
00:01:08.514 - 00:02:03.278, Speaker A: of mining power in the world. With the Internet off in Kazakhstan, data compiled by the Block's Larry Sermak shows that bitcoin's hash rate fell approximately 12% after Kazakhstan's Internet went down. Data from BTC.com shows similar results, with major pools like F two pool, Ant pool, and via BTC, each losing hash rate between twelve to 19% as of recording time. It remains unclear when or if Kazakhstan's Internet access will return. The second negative event for bitcoin was that on January 4, bitcoin's dominance, a statistic that tracks bitcoin's market share compared to the entire crypto industry, reached 39.3%, marking just a three percentage point difference between the all time low of BTC dominance that occurred back in early 2018.
00:02:03.278 - 00:03:09.490, Speaker A: With bitcoin's latest dip, ethereum is roughly 50% away from flipping BTC as the largest crypto asset on the market. Despite the bearish outlook for bitcoin in terms of liquidations, hash rate and dominance, not every headline was negative. A recent Goldman Sachs client note dated January 4, expressed optimism for the largest cryptocurrency and cited the possibility that bitcoin could hit $100,000 if it were to command a healthy percentage of the store of value market. The Goldman Sachs note comes just after the firm reported that BTC was among the best performing assets of 2021. Speaking of bitcoin, the Block reports that a congressional subcommittee is preparing a hearing on bitcoin's environmental impact. The bloc cites three sources with knowledge of the matter who say that the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is starting to build a group of witnesses to speak on the energy usage of proof of work. Crypto Validation Cryptocrime hit an alltime high in 2021.
00:03:09.490 - 00:03:59.500, Speaker A: According to Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analytics firm, Cryptocrime spiked to an alltime high of $14 billion in 2021. This is a 79% increase upon 2020, when only $7.8 billion worth of transactions were deemed illicit. However, as Chainalysis is careful to point out, an alltime high in crime value is a bit of a misnomer. Crucially, Chainalysis reports that total cryptocurrency transaction volume grew by 567% in the last year, while illicit transactions only grew by 79%. This discrepancy in growth led to an all time low of zero point 15% of all Cryptocurrency transactions deemed illicit. In years past, this number has been between zero 62 and 3.37%.
00:03:59.500 - 00:05:16.690, Speaker A: The CFTC brings enforcement action against Polymarket On January 3, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission announced a settlement with Polymarket, a D Five Predictions Protocol and Disclosure, a previous sponsor of My shows in order them to pay a $1.4 million penalty. Polymarket is a predictions market built on Polygon that allows users to bet yes or no on certain events via smart contracts using USDC. According to the CFTC, Polymarket has run over 900 such events since its inception, including markets on whether Donald Trump would be elected president in 2020 or whether ETH would be over $2,500 by July 2021. In its order, the CFTC said that Polymarket offered, quote, off exchange event based binary options contracts while failing to obtain designation as a designated contract market or DCM or registration as a swap execution facility. In addition to the fine, Polymarket will also begin to wind down non compliant operations by late January. Collins Belton, founding partner at Brookwood PC, called the CFTC order the most relevant and telling regulatory actions for DeFi founders and investors yet.
00:05:16.690 - 00:05:58.926, Speaker A: Belton says the order is significant because it highlights the importance of having a decentralized front end. Wrote Belton. CFTC highlights how Polymarket users are functionally entirely dependent on their front end to access the smart contracts despite non custodial wallets. He added, if your front end is the only means of accessing your platform, regulators have a strong incentive to bring you under their regulatory ambit. Openc is Worth More than a Quarter of Ebay Openc, the largest NFT marketplace by volume by a factor of 3.7, announced a Series C funding round of $300 million, valuing the company at $13.3 billion.
00:05:58.926 - 00:06:46.462, Speaker A: CO2 and Paradigm led the latest round. The announcement comes roughly six months after Openc's Series B, which valued the company at $1.5 billion, meaning Opensea's value increased nine times in less than a year. In addition, OpenSea is in talks to acquire Dharma, a digital wallet provider, in an all stock deal worth between 110,000,130 million. According to Axios, openc's busy week comes as the marketplace's sales are booming. For example, daily NFT sales volume across all NFT marketplaces crossed $200 million only ten times in history. Data from Richard Chen's Dune Analytics page shows that Openc breached $200,000,000.04
00:06:46.462 - 00:07:49.630, Speaker A: times in a row this week. Speaking of NFT sales, the board Ape Yacht Club project had an incredibly noteworthy week. Data from Cryptoslam, an NFT data provider that raised nine point million dollars this week in a seed round backed by Mark Cuban and Animoca, shows that this week the Board AP Yacht Club became the fourth NFT collection to generate $1 billion in sales. Even more impressively, Board Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club, a derivative of the Board Ape collection, accounted for roughly 20% of all NFT sales over the past seven days. While no other project even crossed 6%, the massive spike in BYC NFTs occurred during a week when the NFT project generated a number of headlines. For example, the rapper Eminem became a Board Ape holder, or Hodler, a rare serum which essentially acts as an upgrade for a BYC NFT sold for $5.8 million in ETH.
00:07:49.630 - 00:08:32.046, Speaker A: And lastly, $1.9 million worth of board Ape NFTs were frozen on Openc after an owner had his private keys stolen, which garnered quite a few memes. On Twitter, 30 institutions asked permission to enter the DFI space. On Wednesday, 30 institutions, including coin shares, Celsius and Wintermute, were granted access to Ave Arc, a permissioned deployment of Ave two. Ave Arc was first announced back in June of 2021 by Ave founder Stani Kulachov. Ave Arc allows institutional players to join the crypto fray, where yields range from 0.1% to 8.66%
00:08:32.046 - 00:09:41.910, Speaker A: annual percentage yield on digital asset deposits, a far cry from the yield found in the traditional financial world. DeFi represents a powerful wave of financial innovation, including transparency, liquidity and programmability, and it's been inaccessible to traditional financial institutions for far too long, said Stani Kulachev, founder and CEO of Ave. The launch of Ave Arc allows these institutions to participate in DeFi in a compliant way. For the very first time, each Ave Arc participant must be whitelisted by Fireblocks, a New York based crypto custodian which will require entities to undergo rigorous customer identification processes that will be run per FATF guidelines or Financial Action Task Force guidelines. Fireblocks was approved by the community in November and is the only entity that can whitelist new entities for entry into Aave Arc. More whitelisters should be coming, as evidenced by Siba, a Swiss bank recently proposing itself for a whitelister role via Aave's Governance forum. Speaking of Aave, founder Stani Kulichev said the DeFi protocol is developing a mobile wallet.
00:09:41.910 - 00:10:35.798, Speaker A: Samsung has entered the Metaverse Samsung Electronics announced on Sunday that its latest iteration of TVs would offer customers direct integration with NFTs, where users can discover, purchase and trade digital art through the MicroLED, Neo QLED and the Frame TVs. On Thursday, Samsung took an even larger step into the world of Web three. The electronics company announced that it is opening a flagship store called 837 X in decentraland time for fun bits. Links Dow Wants to Buy a golf Course Linksdow successfully sold out a collection of NFTs this week, raising $10.5 million for the express purpose of buying a golf course. Much like Constitution, dow launched its Governance Token. A Linksdow token dubbed Links is soon to come.
00:10:35.798 - 00:11:21.090, Speaker A: According to Mike Judas, a founder of the Block and Links Dow project lead, the NFT sales saw two tiers of NFTs sold leisure membership and global membership. Leisure membership to NFT left holders with perks like the right to purchase a membership at the first physical Linksdao club, discounts on tea Times and discord access. Global memberships received all the same benefits, plus the right to an extra membership and extra governance rights. Thanks so much for joining us today.
