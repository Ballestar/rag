00:00:01.050 - 00:00:04.286, Speaker A: Hey, guys, before we start, I have a funny anecdote to tell you.
00:00:04.388 - 00:00:05.566, Speaker B: Some of you may have seen this.
00:00:05.588 - 00:00:45.206, Speaker A: On twitter, but I'm sharing in case you didn't, in the uber. On my way to this interview in Berlin, my driver was talking to someone via speakerphone in a foreign language, and I suddenly realized they kept saying bitcoin. My driver spoke limited English, but when he got off the phone, I somehow figured out that he sells bitcoin. And he kept asking me if I wanted to buy. I tried to explain that I'm a journalist or reporter, but he just seemed to be parroting the words back to me. So I wasn't quite sure if he actually got it. But regardless, I just thought it was a hilariously fitting incident on my ride to one of the oldest establishments to accept bitcoin.
00:00:45.206 - 00:00:47.770, Speaker A: I hope you enjoy this great interview.

00:01:45.744 - 00:01:53.422, Speaker B: Today's guest is York platter, crypto anarchist and owner of room 77, a bar in Berlin which accepts bitcoin. Welcome, York.
00:01:53.556 - 00:01:56.226, Speaker D: Hey, Laura, and thank you for coming over to the room.
00:01:56.408 - 00:02:05.300, Speaker B: You began accepting bitcoin at this bar eight years ago, which is practically prehistoric times in crypto. How did you come to accept bitcoin at that time?
00:02:06.970 - 00:03:07.400, Speaker D: The reason is that I was interested in digital currency, electronic cash. Already two decades before the inception of bitcoin, there was a small but vibrant global digital cash scene that had staged around 200 projects trying to create what we had understood back in the 90s, late 80s, namely to use cryptography to create a decentralized digital money. And all these projects failed, either due to technological reasons or due to government shutting them down. And when bitcoin turned up, it didn't take long before many of us understood that a, this works, and b, this cannot be shut down. So naturally we were like, wow, it's finally happening. Here it is, it's happening in our lifetime. So, of course, my first thing was like, I'm going to accept this as payment.
00:03:07.400 - 00:03:15.878, Speaker D: It's a great idea. Best money I've seen before. Of course I want to have it. What best idea is to sell burgers.
00:03:15.894 - 00:03:25.360, Speaker B: And beer for it at that time, though, because it was 2011. How did you accept bitcoin? I mean, we didn't have all the tools that we have now.
00:03:27.170 - 00:04:11.280, Speaker D: Indeed, the first payments here were made by people who brought their laptops typed in 34 digits manually or asked me to send them a payment address via email or something like that. Next step in efficiency was a bitcoin address shortener. So you would only have to type in a short URL into your web browser to get our payment address. Until Andreas Schildbach, who was one of the very first people here joining the first Bitcoin meetup, wrote the first mobile wallet for Bitcoin, the Bitcoin wallet for Android, because he didn't want to have to bring his laptop here anymore. And the rest is history.
00:04:11.650 - 00:04:13.854, Speaker B: Wow. And when was that that he created that?
00:04:13.892 - 00:04:15.950, Speaker D: That must have been 2011.
00:04:17.650 - 00:04:28.254, Speaker B: Yeah, that's definitely a long time ago, especially for all this development. So do you convert the bitcoin immediately to euros, or do you keep it in bitcoin?
00:04:28.302 - 00:04:36.840, Speaker D: Of course we keep it in bitcoin as long as we can. Of course, we also have to pay taxes, so we have to sell bitcoin now and then to do so.
00:04:37.530 - 00:04:40.920, Speaker B: And how many bitcoin purchases do you typically get a night?
00:04:41.530 - 00:05:01.920, Speaker D: I would guess around 5% to 10% on a normal night. Whereas when we have bitcoin events here, or for example, we run the longest running bitcoin meetup on the planet, then it's rather 60, 70, 80% on a night like that.
00:05:02.690 - 00:05:07.520, Speaker B: And does people's willingness to spend their bitcoin correlate with the markets in any way?
00:05:08.850 - 00:05:34.310, Speaker D: Not their willingness to spend it, but the interest in bitcoin clearly correlates with the market price of bitcoin. Whereas then the higher the price, the more people who are actually not enthusiastic about a free, decentralized money for the world, but more interested in making some capital gains.
00:05:35.530 - 00:05:40.026, Speaker B: Yeah, they come here and they ask questions about it.
00:05:40.128 - 00:06:15.300, Speaker D: Of course, the higher the price, the fuller or the more crowded the bitcoin meetup, which is quite annoying to many of the old bitcoiners who gather here to actually talk about technology and don't want to have a camera. Put in their face a journalist asking them how rich they are or some kind of shitcoin promoter sitting next to them, telling them about what the next bitcoin will be or something like that. So actually, bitcoiners enjoy the bitcoin meetups here a lot more when the price is low.
00:06:17.610 - 00:06:28.620, Speaker B: I totally relate to that. So then what are the demographics of the people that typically come here to spend it? And also how have they changed over time?
00:06:29.230 - 00:07:03.860, Speaker D: There is no typical or prototype bitcoin user. Literally, what has changed over time is but that's visible everywhere on conferences and anywhere else in the bitcoin space, is that you have people with suits and with ties who talk about regulatory compliance and the importance of being okay with the SEC. And so on and so on. Those people weren't in bitcoin in the early.
00:07:05.850 - 00:07:11.830, Speaker B: Okay, and so is that why I saw the sign you discourage payments from coinbase circle and BitPay?
00:07:14.090 - 00:07:34.960, Speaker D: Not particularly. The reason for that is that, well, bitcoin has been built as the first digital bearer asset the world has seen. I find it quite absurd to put that into a bank. Coinbase is a bank. They hold your money. They initiate transactions for you. They receive transactions for you.
00:07:34.960 - 00:08:03.414, Speaker D: That's one point. The other point is that when people pay me from their coinbase wallet, they actually don't pay me what they actually do know. They show me the screen. I tell them, I cannot see your payment on the blockchain or in the mem pool, but I sent you the money. They show me their little coinbase screen sent, and I tell them, no, you did not send me money. You asked your banker to maybe send me money. And your banker has not sent that money yet, but it's still not the reason.
00:08:03.414 - 00:09:39.000, Speaker D: The actual reason is especially coinbase, but also the other compliant bitcoin banks, as I would call them, they actually survey their customers not only as much as banks do, but even more than banks do, due to the nature of the blockchain, because they can let me explain. If you take â‚¬10 out of the bank ATM and go somewhere and spend it on mariana or on gambling or whatever, the banker doesn't know in the bitcoin space, the banker does know. Coinbase can see what you do with your money after you took it, after you withdrew it from your online account into your private wallet. They will follow the money over several hops, and they will enforce united States laws everywhere else on the planet. Example here is, it is legal in Germany to make a bet on a soccer game. It is illegal in the United states. So if you pay me with your coinbase wallet and I next day feel like spending some of that money, which is now my money, on something that is legal in Germany but illegal in the United States, then coinbase very likely will shut down your account.
00:09:39.000 - 00:10:07.520, Speaker D: So we actually did that for fun a couple of times, and that's why we have to sign. There is literally no point of leaving your bitcoin in any custodial system and give up your voting rights, give up your evaluation power and so on. And we just want to discourage that.
00:10:09.090 - 00:10:16.218, Speaker B: And did you figure that out because customers weren't happy after they realized that they made a payment to you and.
00:10:16.244 - 00:10:27.494, Speaker D: They'Re, oh, no, you just have to go online. You find thousands of stories of people who had their account shut down and try to find out why and realized, oh, my god, I did this or that or whatever.
00:10:27.692 - 00:10:31.238, Speaker B: So you basically kind of knew, and that's why you put the sign up.
00:10:31.324 - 00:11:23.160, Speaker D: Yeah. And it's also due to my reputation. I authored an O'Reilly about bitcoin five years ago in Germany, and due to my reputation here, I do get invited by government officials for panel discussions and stuff like that, also by law enforcement people invited me and so on. And I do know, as a matter of fact, that Coinbase and other online bitcoin custodians do actually offer the regulators in Brussels to survey their customers. They actually say, we can follow the money much better even than banks, and that's what we're, of course going to do, and so on.
00:11:24.330 - 00:11:26.626, Speaker B: All right. Which is against your philosophy.
00:11:26.818 - 00:11:27.560, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:11:28.010 - 00:11:36.762, Speaker B: All right. So we're going to discuss some other exciting things, such as his Lightning Network point of sale device. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:11:36.896 - 00:11:48.558, Speaker C: Crypto.com is the place you can buy crypto at true cost. You can buy over 40 coins at the lowest possible prices with no fees and no markups@crypto.com.
00:11:48.644 - 00:11:50.990, Speaker B: We grow your crypto for you, too.
00:11:51.140 - 00:12:44.450, Speaker C: You can earn up to 8% per year on BTC, ETH, XRP and more when you deposit in any of the one month, three month or flexible terms. Download the crypto.com app on iOS or Android. Now, will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors. Privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations.
00:12:44.450 - 00:12:59.750, Speaker C: CipherTrace is working on this vision of the future. Sign up to stay up to date on the Privacy Enhanced Compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto. AML reports quarterly, www.ciphertrace.com.
00:12:59.900 - 00:13:09.042, Speaker B: Keepcryptoclean back to my conversation with York Platzer of room 77. Have you gotten other businesses in this area interested in accepting bitcoin?
00:13:09.186 - 00:13:53.720, Speaker D: We did in the early days. This used to be called the bitcoin keats because we actually went out that was in the early enthusiastic times, 2012, 2013. We did actually walk out and try to convince other bar owners, shop owners here on the street to accept bitcoin. We had an enabler team that we sent there to check their infrastructure. How could these people accept bitcoin? Are we going to set it up for them, explain to them and so on? And it was like two, dozens, maybe three dozens of shops in this area accepting bitcoin. They are mostly not here anymore. This whole area is undergoing a very heavy gentrification process.
00:13:53.720 - 00:14:49.720, Speaker D: So it's not that people gave up accepting bitcoin. It's literally the business has changed. And we stopped doing it after a certain time as well, because it was quite a lot of work on one hand. And on the other hand, we realized that most of these businesses didn't get any significant bitcoin payments. None of them had the success as the room had, kind of naturally, because all of that history, that bitcoin history that has been written at room 77 makes bitcoin enthusiasts want to come here and pay in bitcoin, and other shops don't have that advantage. So it was in 20, 12, 13 that was not very successful. Even though there is one or another bar owner who did get enough bitcoin business back then that they actually thanked me today.
00:14:49.720 - 00:14:52.586, Speaker D: They kept, let me put it this way. Yeah.
00:14:52.688 - 00:14:53.498, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:14:53.664 - 00:15:05.486, Speaker D: It was not enough back then to cash it out. Let me put it right. It was just marginal. Why should I do this for these â‚¬25? Just leave it in the wallet and then a few years pass by.
00:15:05.588 - 00:15:19.220, Speaker B: I love that. That's great. That's funny. So I know you just mentioned the meetups. Have there been other businesses that have come out of the community, I guess that has been fostered here.
00:15:21.990 - 00:15:43.146, Speaker D: Out of the community? Of course, there's many berliner startups that came out of this community. That doesn't mean they came out of the room, but the room was always kind of the central place for this community.
00:15:43.328 - 00:15:46.860, Speaker B: I mean, like the meetups, like just people meeting here.
00:15:48.110 - 00:16:13.154, Speaker D: Of course, you have the once a month meeting of bitcoin enthusiasts, and years later you have a lot of startups where many of these enthusiasts are cooperating and are being partners now. Yeah, I guess the hangouts at room 77 did their part for.
00:16:13.192 - 00:16:15.518, Speaker B: And you also mentioned local bitcoins cut.
00:16:15.704 - 00:16:27.442, Speaker D: Well, I mentioned that because jeremiah kangas was also one of the very first visitors to the bitcoin meetup, to the early bitcoin meetup.
00:16:27.506 - 00:16:30.902, Speaker B: And is he a co founder of local bitcoins?
00:16:30.966 - 00:16:34.662, Speaker D: He is the founder of local bitcoins. He's LocalBitcoins.
00:16:34.806 - 00:16:35.500, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:36.190 - 00:16:50.640, Speaker D: And he was hanging out in what we called crypto summer of 2012 and 13. And he was hanging out here. Yeah. And inventing LocalBitcoins.com on table number two here.
00:16:51.090 - 00:16:55.694, Speaker B: I love it. And you also mentioned vitalik, Buterin came.
00:16:55.732 - 00:17:34.542, Speaker D: Here where the saying goes, before ethereum, vitalik was actually trying to convince the rest of the bitcoin community and especially the bitcoin core developers, that smart contracting capabilities should be implemented in bitcoin. But nobody else wanted that. So apparently at a meeting here at the room, he decided to make his own coin. That's what I have heard from the ethereum people. And I do know that they all did hang out here back in the days.
00:17:34.676 - 00:17:36.446, Speaker B: Okay, I can ask them.
00:17:36.628 - 00:18:08.040, Speaker D: We added this one summer. We called it the bitcoin group therapy, because bitcoin people from all over the world kind of were in Berlin, and they went, for example, to the templehofer field and sat down in the sun in a big circle and everybody introduced themselves. Hi, I'm working on this in that project. Until somebody got up and was like, hi, I think this looks like a group therapy vitalik was there, too.
00:18:08.490 - 00:18:17.690, Speaker B: Okay. And so now I think the new thing that you're working on is this Lightning network point of sale device. Can you talk about that?
00:18:17.760 - 00:18:37.410, Speaker D: Well, I'm not particularly working on it, but the people working on it are inspired by room 77. So we did have the first routed Lightning payment in a shop on testnet. We had the first routed Lightning payment on main net.
00:18:37.560 - 00:18:38.594, Speaker B: When was that?
00:18:38.712 - 00:18:41.026, Speaker D: That must have been a year ago or something.
00:18:41.128 - 00:18:42.066, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:18:42.248 - 00:19:32.530, Speaker D: Last year in summer, there was a lightning hackathon here in Berlin, and the guys actually, on Friday evening, came together and said, we want to be able to pay at room 77 on Sunday evening to a POS. System. And Sunday evening, it was done, but that was still a custodial system, and what Christian Rotzall and his friend Ben have now built it's this little device line here on the table that I showed you before, it's literally the first non custodial lightning payment POS system that does not hold its own keys. That mean it can break here, it can be stolen or whatever. Nobody has access to our Lightning channel, but we can still accept Lightning payments here through that thing.
00:19:32.680 - 00:19:34.898, Speaker B: Oh, wow. That's so cool.
00:19:35.064 - 00:19:51.660, Speaker D: That is a huge step. And Christian and Ben did a great job creating that thing. It took them quite a while, so all the credit goes to them. The only credit that goes to me is sitting there and whining about, winner. Can I have my lightning PR system? You promised me?
00:19:53.230 - 00:19:57.158, Speaker B: So how many transactions have you done via Lightning?
00:19:57.334 - 00:20:15.442, Speaker D: Via Lightning? I can't tell you on this thing, less than a dozen or something, because it's, like, literally brand new. It had its first kind of real world deployment on the last bitcoin meetup here two weeks ago.
00:20:15.576 - 00:20:16.018, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:16.104 - 00:20:22.740, Speaker D: And right now, we have in a summer break, so we're only open for the bitcoin meetups. That's why.
00:20:23.670 - 00:20:31.480, Speaker B: I see. All right. But when people want to use it, did they tell you specifically, I want to pay you via Lightning? Yeah. Okay.
00:20:32.410 - 00:20:36.630, Speaker D: When somebody says, I want to pay in bitcoin, we actually ask on chain or lightning.
00:20:37.050 - 00:20:37.762, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:37.916 - 00:21:07.700, Speaker D: And it's incredible how fast mobile Lightning wallets are spreading, because I'm really surprised how many people already pay in Lightning if our Lightning, because it was still kind of bumpy and sometimes not working. Not talking about this device, but the iterations before people actually complained that they cannot pay in Lightning. And we're like, what the hell is going on? I'm on room 77, and Lightning servers down.
00:21:09.030 - 00:21:17.110, Speaker B: It's funny. Well, they're on the very cutting edge. So are there any downsides to accepting bitcoin as a merchant?
00:21:18.090 - 00:22:37.822, Speaker D: I would not see any if you're not. The first downside to room 77 is that whenever a person from the financial authorities, a tax auditor, looks at our place, bitcoin jumps into their face and triggers all kinds of associations with black money and money laundering and whatever. So I believe we are the most audited bar, at least in Germany. We get every extra audit and the auditors look at me like, oh, they asked really not very competent question about Bitcoin and so on. And I once told an auditor lady who kind of tried to imply that we probably cheating taxes with Bitcoin. I told her that I take this as a personal offense, that she thinks that I'm stupid enough to cheat taxes with the 5% of payments that we taken in Bitcoin and not with the 95% in euro cash money. Right.
00:22:37.822 - 00:23:10.250, Speaker D: I literally think it's an insult to me to think I'm so stupid, but it doesn't help. But no, normally there should not be any downside anymore. The old days are over. Bitcoin has arrived in society. Even financial regulators more and more accept its existence. They may like it or not, but they have to accept its existence. They have to accept that the people using Bitcoin are not criminals.
00:23:10.250 - 00:23:19.846, Speaker D: And so I wouldn't think that there's any downside for any merchant nowadays to accept Bitcoin.
00:23:19.958 - 00:23:28.240, Speaker B: And nowadays the way that you accept it is preferably like an on chain transaction. And is it just like you use QR codes to send it?
00:23:29.170 - 00:23:31.870, Speaker D: But I don't care if it's an on chain or a lightning.
00:23:33.730 - 00:23:45.230, Speaker B: But you know, as we mentioned, there have been just a few lightning transactions. So Berlin obviously has also been one of the main hubs for Ethereum development. Do you have any plans to accept Ethereum?
00:23:46.330 - 00:23:47.080, Speaker D: No.
00:23:48.490 - 00:23:49.400, Speaker B: Why not?
00:23:50.810 - 00:24:09.100, Speaker D: Because Ethereum does not seem to have the monetary qualities that I would expect from the better money, from a sound money. That's the simple reason.
00:24:10.370 - 00:24:12.554, Speaker B: But you do accept, I think I saw Monero.
00:24:12.682 - 00:24:56.982, Speaker D: We do accept monero. That's the only altcoin we accept. That has to do with the fact that I do believe that anonymity privacy and functionability are actually the most important next steps that Bitcoin needs to achieve or needs to be optimized in. Monero is an interim solution for that. And I also really like the Monero community. It's kind of a fun place. So yeah, mainly for the reason of anonymity and functionability, we accept Monero.
00:24:56.982 - 00:25:08.510, Speaker D: Whereas I have to say, in Monero, I also don't quite see the monetary qualities that Bitcoin offers, the monetary soundness. This is purely for the anonymity.
00:25:09.090 - 00:25:22.610, Speaker B: All right, well, listeners of my show, whoever visit Berlin, you definitely need to come to this. Mean, it's closed right now, but it still looks pretty awesome to me. So Jorg, thank you so much. It's been great having you on the show.
00:25:22.760 - 00:25:26.654, Speaker D: Thank you for coming over to the room and have a good time in Berlin.
00:25:26.782 - 00:25:50.730, Speaker B: I will, thank you. Thanks so much for joining us today.
