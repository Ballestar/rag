00:00:04.410 - 00:00:35.170, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First Headline Bitcoin in Your Bank Account Fintech firm FIS is partnering with digital asset manager Nidig to bring about an industry first. Customers at hundreds of us. Banks will be able to purchase hodl or sell bitcoin directly within their bank account without having to go through an exchange such as Coinbase or a payment application. Like PayPal, Nidig will handle custody and security. The program has already enrolled hundreds of smaller institutions. As reported by CNBC.
00:00:35.170 - 00:01:22.680, Speaker A: NYDIG is in discussions with several of the larger banks in the US. About bringing them into the program. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have already announced that they will offer bitcoin funds to their high net worth clients, with Morgan repeatedly mulling a similar product. Perhaps the decision of smaller banks to try and front run bitcoin adoption for the everyday customer will pressure the larger institutions to follow suit for their retail customers. With such a plethora of ways to gain exposure to BTC, it is no wonder that Grayscale's Bitcoin trust seems to be struggling. Grayscale's parent company, Digital Currency Group, authorized the purchase of up to $750,000,000 in GBTC shares this week, upping its authorization by $500 million. GBDC has been trading at a discount for three months, meaning the market price of its shares is trading under its net asset value.
00:01:22.680 - 00:02:13.560, Speaker A: Next Headline In an effort to bring more privacy to bitcoin, its taproot activation period begins. Regarding bitcoin the asset all this fuss is about bitcoin's taproot update has begun its three month activation period at bitcoin. DLC put it rather succinctly on Twitter writing Taproot is a soft fork of bitcoin that improves bitcoin's scripts, which will eventually increase privacy and help scalability whilst also enabling more complex transactions. Miners who wish to adopt the update can signal support by adding a signal bit in blocks. They mine. Bitcoin magazine reports that nearly half of the network hash rate is currently supporting the update. If 90% of blocks mined during the next three months include the signal bit, the upgrade will be confirmed for November 2021.
00:02:13.560 - 00:03:00.182, Speaker A: If all that made your eyes glaze over, just hold into this nugget. A benefit of taproot is that mixing coins and disguising transactions will be easier, potentially making the life of the blockchain analytics companies who specialize in tracing fraudulent transactions much harder. Next headline ether streaks past three. K Ether hit another all time high on Wednesday. The token reached $3,550 in the late afternoon, extending a rally that is over 350% in gains just this year. Decrypt reports. That Vitalik Buterin, the 27 year old cofounder of Ethereum owns an ETH wallet worth more than $1 billion, Buterin initially disclosed his personal ETH address in 2018 on Twitter, and the address has been watched closely ever since.
00:03:00.182 - 00:03:53.510, Speaker A: The wallet currently contains a whopping 333 521. Ether cementing Vitalik's place as a hodler perhaps lifted by Ethereum exuberance Ethereum classic's native token, etc. Has skyrocketed in price as well, hitting a record high of about $150 on Wednesday. Etc is a child of the 2016 Dow hard fork and has been hacked three times since then, most likely due to the lower computational power backing the network compared to stalwarts like Bitcoin and Ethereum X. Headline DFI's Unicorn is live in a blog post Wednesday morning, Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume, officially announced the launch of its version three. Unveiled in March. V Three is expected to give users more control over the liquidity they provide, along with better execution for traders.
00:03:53.510 - 00:04:20.186, Speaker A: So far, the market seems to be giving the new update two thumbs up. In the first 24 hours since V Three went live, Uniswap accounted for 44% of all decentralized exchange volume on Ethereum. Uniswap V Two will remain functional as long as Ethereum exists. However, the Uniswap team expects much of the trading to migrate to V Three at some point. Next headline. Who let the doge out? Dogecoin hit $0.69 on Tuesday.
00:04:20.186 - 00:05:05.306, Speaker A: Yes, that really happened. The meme coin apparently is here to stay. Both Etoro and Gemini announced the launch of doge trading on their platforms. Galaxy Digital released a 22 page report on the token titled Dogecoin the World's Most Honest Shitcoin that cites a genuine origin story, longevity and a growing community as strong fundamentals supporting its rise. Dogecoin's market cap is currently the fourth largest in crypto, sitting at around $80 billion. That being said, Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, made a few salient points about Dogecoin that I found particularly noteworthy for investors. Quote dogecoin is infinite.
00:05:05.306 - 00:05:36.886, Speaker A: The system is on track to mint 14.4 million new doge each day and 5.2 billion more doge each year forever. Dogecoin is not decentralized, nodes are hard to run, and there are at most a few hundred unique economic actors running them, and probably way fewer. Dogecoin has had several insane pumps like this before, only to later fall in value by 90%. Next headline bitso Coin Metrics and Showtime announced funding rounds. Three fundraises caught my eye this week.
00:05:36.886 - 00:06:29.366, Speaker A: The Mexico based crypto exchange Bitzo wrapped up a $250,000,000 funding round, valuing the company at $2.2 billion, making it the first crypto unicorn in Latin America to date. Tiger Global and Kotu led the round. Coin Metrics, a cryptocurrency analytics firm and home to some of my favorite content, has raised $15 million, led by Goldman Sachs NFT social network Showtime raised $7.6 million in funding from crypto investment firm Paradigm and DJ Three Lau or Blau. Showtime is headed by Alex Masmech, who previously tokenized himself last April, allowing Alex token holders to dictate his exercise and diet schedule. Next Headline Crypto's first billion dollar deal Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital is set to acquire Bico, a digital asset infrastructure provider, for $1.2
00:06:29.366 - 00:07:09.282, Speaker A: billion in cash and stock. The acquisition, announced Wednesday, will be the crypto industry's 1st $1 billion deal. The Bico purchase could put Galaxy Digital in a strong position to serve institutions seeking access to crypto. Bico has a strong resume itself. The company currently has $40 billion in assets under custody, serves over 150 exchanges and over 400 institutional customers, and processes 30 billion transactions. Monthly time for what we're calling QuickBits PayPal is exploring the launch of a stablecoin. The block reports the payment giant has spoken to at least one stablecoin protocol development firm Avalabs.
00:07:09.282 - 00:08:07.442, Speaker A: In an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box Ebay's CEO Jamie Ayononi hinted that the digital marketplace might accept crypto as payment in the future. He also teased the addition of an NFT platform. Charlie Munger, the 97 year old vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, made clear his distaste for bitcoin during Berkshire's annual meeting, saying, I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization. It was a big week for crypto funds. A 16 z is looking to build out a $1 billion crypto fund, its third, which could ultimately be double its last fund at $515,000,000. Multicoin Capital is launching a 100 million dollar fund to invest in DFI, NFTs, and Web, three applications focusing on the Salana blockchain. A federal court in California is authorizing the IRS to obtain the identities of any user who has traded $20,000 on cryptocurrency.
00:08:07.442 - 00:08:38.210, Speaker A: Exchange Kraken, which disclosure, is a former sponsor of my show. The DOJ is not alleging Kraken has engaged in any illegal activity. Instead, the IRS is focused on finding wouldbe tax dodgers. Coinbase's stock dropped considerably on Thursday, hitting $251 around midday. Coin is down 12% this week, perhaps struggling because of BTC the crypto bellwether, which has stagnated in the mid 50K range while the rest of the market has thrived. Time for fun. Bits.
00:08:38.210 - 00:09:28.994, Speaker A: Doge sitting pays. If you had invested all three of your stimulus checks into Doge over the past year, you would now be sitting on top of $425,000 in fake Internet dog money. With $425,000 in Doge, you could trade that in for 7.45 BTC, 121 ETH, 26 season tickets to watch the Dallas Mavericks from the floor, or one Lamborghini Aventador. For context on how well Doge has performed, bitcoin is up 93% year to date, while ETH is up 350%. Dogecoin's return is above 13,000% this year alone. Oh, and by the way, Elon Musk, the doge father, will be hosting Saturday Night Live this week, meaning that Dogecoin will most likely find a place in next week's news.
00:09:28.994 - 00:10:12.938, Speaker A: Recap second fun Bits maybe crypto isn't so fun. On this week's Unchained the Pod ended with Annabelle Huang, partner at Amber Group, giving advice for women thinking about going into crypto, saying, for the women out there who are thinking about this, it's not as crazy as you think. That's why I had to laugh at a recent thread posted by John Su, marketing director at Brightloom. That certainly pumps the brakes on romanticizing the crypto lifestyle and gives some insight on what actually goes on behind the scenes. I recommend the whole thread, but I'll end the show with my favorite lamentation regarding poor sleep cycles for crypto founders, john writes Crypto never sleeps. And guess what? That also means that you never sleep. Half your audience is in the west, the other half is in the east.
00:10:12.938 - 00:10:42.662, Speaker A: Singapore time is almost entirely during sleeping hours in the US. Have fun with that. Perhaps going all in on crypto might be as crazy as John depicts, but as I can attest, leaping into crypto is totally worth it. Alright, thanks for tuning in.
