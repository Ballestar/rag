00:00:07.610 - 00:00:36.360, Speaker A: I think the most likely case is that there will be at least three forks with the difficulty bomb without the difficulty bomb and proof of stake. I think that the proof of work chain, the main one, without the difficulty bomb does not go to zero and I think maintains a decent amount of market cap up. My current prediction don't hold me to this, it's completely finger to the wind is something like two to 10% of Ethereum two's market cap.
00:00:38.590 - 00:01:17.400, Speaker B: There's never been more institutional capital sort of willing and able to buy ETH in size. Pretty pretty highly convicted around that and there's just a lot more uncertainty around it and it's just gotten a lot bigger. And you had DeFi and then you had NFTs and gaming. You've got multiple use cases that are happening on layer one smart contract platforms and you juxtapose that against BTC's narrative, which is as challenged as I've seen it in the five years that I've been paying attention to this.
00:01:19.610 - 00:01:35.882, Speaker C: I think people in my opinion, don't understand what Ethereum actually is. Ethereum is not money because money has no use. Ethereum has use. You use it to use power the applications on its network. Bitcoin has no use. It's just money. It's like a dollar has no use.
00:01:35.882 - 00:01:42.780, Speaker C: It's just money. And that's why it's a good form of money because its value cannot be conflated with actual utility of other stuff.
00:01:44.750 - 00:01:52.014, Speaker D: I don't really understand. I guess I do understand some of the motives, but in general I just.
00:01:52.052 - 00:01:59.438, Speaker E: Don'T really see a future for it. I'm a core developer where I really understand the code, the logic and the.
00:01:59.444 - 00:02:00.334, Speaker D: Things that go with it.
00:02:00.372 - 00:02:02.942, Speaker E: I'm not a trader, investor or anything of that sort.
00:02:02.996 - 00:02:04.654, Speaker D: So I can appreciate that some people.
00:02:04.692 - 00:02:09.746, Speaker E: Might find some value in a chain like that, but I really don't see a long term.
00:02:09.858 - 00:02:16.680, Speaker D: Long term being a thing. But people said that about ETH classic, so I don't know what's going to happen.
