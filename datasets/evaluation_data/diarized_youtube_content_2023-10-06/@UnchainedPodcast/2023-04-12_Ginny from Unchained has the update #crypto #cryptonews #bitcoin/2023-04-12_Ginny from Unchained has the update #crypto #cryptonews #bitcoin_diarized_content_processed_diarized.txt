00:00:00.250 - 00:00:33.154, Speaker A: I'm really so grateful that Gemini locked their withdrawals or I would have sold mine months ago. The rally may have something to do with speculation over interest rate hikes, which is the closest a lot of finance guys will come to experiencing PMS. I'm not quite sure if it's happening, their mood tanks and it compels them to buy all kinds of weird shit. Speaking of, is anyone interested in buying my gently used Zamboni? The rally could also be because Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against the traditional banking system. JP. Morgan put out report last week that said recent problems exposed weaknesses in the traditional banking system. No offense, JP, but I don't think recent problems exposed shit.
00:00:33.154 - 00:00:59.420, Speaker A: The traditional banking system's been running around naked since at least 2008. Mean, thank God for hedges or it would get arrested for public indecency. A lot of crypto guys are calling Bitcoin's rally a vindication of the crypto ecosystem. I would make a joke about it being Revenge of the Nerds, except that's just a straightforward description of what it is. Others say that it's related to Bitcoin's having event that's happening in 2024, but you don't need a big event for that. You want the crypto market cut in half again. Just ask SDF as a free second right now.
