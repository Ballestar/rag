00:00:00.330 - 00:00:38.582, Speaker A: Right now OpenAI and midjourney. All these companies, they also need to decide what are things that are good and bad. They are actually making decisions for things that this model should not do. And so we're getting into a single company pretty much deciding for hundreds of million of people what's good and bad. And we know how that went before with social networks for example. And so this is kind of extension of this problem and this is going back to what we've been building in blockchain space right. With Dows governance and really trying to figure out how to create an open, inclusive way of deciding on things.
00:00:38.582 - 00:00:59.340, Speaker A: We can actually have this Dows to be driving kind of training data collection that specifically tries to Debia us and find the consensus on what is communities things kind of good and bad or safe or not safe aligned with humanitarian values or not right. And use the UN sounds like principle resolve for that.
