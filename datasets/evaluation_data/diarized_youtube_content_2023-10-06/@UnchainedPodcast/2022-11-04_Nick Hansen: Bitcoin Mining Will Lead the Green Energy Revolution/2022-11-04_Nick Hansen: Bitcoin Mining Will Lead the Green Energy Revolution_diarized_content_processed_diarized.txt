00:00:00.250 - 00:00:42.100, Speaker A: I think that bitcoin mining comes in and makes a really compelling argument as to why it should be used for providing this consistent baseload. As we continue to progress towards a renewable energy future, our generation assets become more and more intermittent. And so there needs to be extra capacity to provide all of the energy for all of the demand that there is at different times. So we also need to also invest in nuclear energy and we've seen miners getting colocated with nuclear energy assets as well. So lots of reasons why bitcoin mining will continue to incentivize and lead the green energy revolution. And I think we're just getting started.
