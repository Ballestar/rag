00:01:17.102 - 00:01:18.466, Speaker A: Signer of the project.
00:01:18.648 - 00:01:19.090, Speaker C: Welcome.
00:01:19.160 - 00:01:20.530, Speaker B: Zero x, maki.
00:01:22.890 - 00:01:26.454, Speaker A: Before we start, I just wanted to say for those of you watching on.
00:01:26.492 - 00:01:30.598, Speaker B: YouTube, zero Xmaki prefers to remain pseudonymous.
00:01:30.694 - 00:01:37.146, Speaker A: Which is why he is wearing sunglasses and a face mask. So SushiSwap has been one of the.
00:01:37.168 - 00:01:41.374, Speaker B: Most dramatic events in DeFi recently, which is saying a lot because it's been.
00:01:41.412 - 00:01:45.966, Speaker A: An extremely eventful summer. A couple weeks ago, SushiSwap forked the.
00:01:45.988 - 00:01:48.894, Speaker B: Code of Uniswap, which was at that.
00:01:48.932 - 00:02:22.086, Speaker A: Point by far the largest decentralized exchange or automated market maker. However, SushiSwap introduced a token on top Sushi, which would reward both liquidity providers and token holders. Then the main dev behind SushiSwap, named Chef Nomi, cashed out after generating a lot of interest in the project and a lot of money for him or herself. Right after Sam Bankman freed the CEO of a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, FTX, who.
00:02:22.108 - 00:02:24.074, Speaker B: Was behind a project that is building.
00:02:24.112 - 00:02:25.914, Speaker A: A Dex on a competing blockchain called.
00:02:25.952 - 00:02:28.762, Speaker B: Solana, made a proposal to build support.
00:02:28.816 - 00:02:44.594, Speaker A: For SushiSwap on Solana. And then, because of the outcry over how Chef Nomi cashed out, chef Nomi was forced to hand over the admin keys to Sam. And then finally, after all that, there.
00:02:44.632 - 00:02:46.274, Speaker B: Was a migration that took place of.
00:02:46.312 - 00:02:49.134, Speaker A: Liquidity from Uniswap over to Sushi swap.
00:02:49.262 - 00:02:55.586, Speaker B: And in the end, $1.2 billion ended up on Sushi swap, while Uniswap was.
00:02:55.608 - 00:03:11.262, Speaker A: Left with $400 million. So now, with that background, hopefully the audience can follow along because just a ton happened in the last couple of weeks. But let's go back all the way to the beginning. Zero X Maki, how did you become a co founder of Sushi swap?
00:03:11.426 - 00:03:22.958, Speaker D: So I got involved in the project by basically being one of the first person to read the white paper or medium article. And from there I joined the discord. It was maybe like perhaps nine person I think.
00:03:23.044 - 00:03:25.326, Speaker C: And I basically was asking questions to.
00:03:25.348 - 00:03:27.294, Speaker D: Chef Nomi and SushiSwap, the second dev.
00:03:27.412 - 00:03:30.382, Speaker C: And we were just having a very.
00:03:30.436 - 00:03:56.950, Speaker D: Honest talk about where this is going. Is this just a food token? Is it just a hot dog or shrimp or whatever is the trendiest meme coin of the day? And I was actually very surprised to see that Chef Nomi actually wanted to push this project forward and do something different, not just a money game. So from there, I just asked if I could join and just be part of the growth of the project and make it something bigger than ourselves.
00:03:57.610 - 00:04:04.790, Speaker A: And why did you want to get involved? What was it that you didn't like about Uniswap? Or how was it that you thought it should be improved?
00:04:04.950 - 00:04:26.066, Speaker D: I never got an opportunity to work in the crypto industry before. I don't have the resume to basically be taken seriously, I think, or just the opportunity to know the people that are involved in the space. I had no connection, I'm anonymous. So from there I saw an opportunity.
00:04:26.168 - 00:04:34.690, Speaker C: Where I could leverage my skills. And I think that Uniswap is something amazing.
00:04:34.840 - 00:04:36.862, Speaker D: I've been like a user since January.
00:04:36.926 - 00:04:41.574, Speaker C: 9, 2019, and the truth is, I.
00:04:41.612 - 00:04:45.186, Speaker D: Think they've been moving slowly and there's.
00:04:45.218 - 00:04:50.406, Speaker C: So many other things we can build on top of the UI that I.
00:04:50.428 - 00:05:00.586, Speaker D: Felt that this Sushi swap could be it. We could empower developers to build on top of it and we would greenlight their ideas or features way faster than.
00:05:00.608 - 00:05:02.400, Speaker C: What Uniswap is doing at the moment.
00:05:02.930 - 00:05:09.280, Speaker A: Simply because it would be decentralized. And so it could attract a lot more people than a centralized team.
00:05:10.530 - 00:05:40.918, Speaker D: I think perhaps we just have divergent ideas of decentralized. I don't think that a decentralized protocol or dex like Uniswap means that people should just be building on their side, on their UI and basically never touch the original one or do a very minor update. And also the support on Uniswap is very lacking. Sometimes you go on their reddit or Discord and moving very slowly. Is it because the team is overwhelmed?
00:05:41.014 - 00:05:41.590, Speaker C: Perhaps.
00:05:41.670 - 00:06:00.670, Speaker D: At the same time, if you come on Sushi swap, when we did the migration, we had over like 6000 support message answered from the community, from people managing the discord. Nobody is paid here. It's all like because they love the project, because they own some Sushi, they wanted to work.
00:06:00.820 - 00:06:03.022, Speaker C: So that is the big difference, I think.
00:06:03.156 - 00:06:08.146, Speaker A: And what was your background in crypto before when you were saying I worked.
00:06:08.168 - 00:06:11.730, Speaker D: In a centralized exchange? Before, it was like an amazing experience.
00:06:11.800 - 00:06:13.954, Speaker C: That I was offered and I work.
00:06:13.992 - 00:06:17.654, Speaker D: In growth, support, all kind of stuff.
00:06:17.772 - 00:06:21.894, Speaker C: I'd rather not name the company, but.
00:06:21.932 - 00:06:24.374, Speaker D: I've never been able to break it.
00:06:24.412 - 00:06:30.170, Speaker C: Inside Ethereum or any decentralized protocol or blockchain.
00:06:30.910 - 00:06:39.754, Speaker A: From your initial interactions with Chef Nomi and SushiSwap, who did you think they also you don't have to say who.
00:06:39.792 - 00:06:41.182, Speaker B: Their exact identity was.
00:06:41.236 - 00:06:43.454, Speaker A: But what was your sense of where.
00:06:43.492 - 00:06:45.118, Speaker B: They were from or what kind of.
00:06:45.204 - 00:07:11.750, Speaker D: So I don't want to feed any conspiracy theories or anything like this. The only things I knew were that we were opposed time zone. They were near Singapore or Asia, they were sufficiently technical. Were the CTO level senior engineers? It's very hard to tell. I don't want to feed any conspiracy.
00:07:12.330 - 00:07:15.174, Speaker C: I know there's been like projects being.
00:07:15.212 - 00:07:17.320, Speaker D: Attacked by some community members.
00:07:17.710 - 00:07:36.270, Speaker C: I'd rather not say. And to be very clear with you, the story is not done yet. We are still in talk with Nomi. There is like negotiation going on concerning the treasury. We know he feels some guilt and.
00:07:36.340 - 00:07:38.814, Speaker D: We are not willing to disclose everything.
00:07:39.012 - 00:07:44.190, Speaker C: Once the whole topic is closed.
00:07:44.850 - 00:07:50.638, Speaker A: All right, yeah, we're going to have to circle back to that in a second. But why don't we go back to the precipitating incident?
00:07:50.734 - 00:07:52.114, Speaker B: How was it that you found out.
00:07:52.152 - 00:07:57.302, Speaker A: That Chef Nomi was cashing out $13 million for him or herself for sure.
00:07:57.356 - 00:08:04.326, Speaker D: So I was doing Maa with the Chinese community at around 04:00 a.m. My time.
00:08:04.508 - 00:08:07.650, Speaker C: So usually I would be sleeping, but.
00:08:07.820 - 00:08:25.278, Speaker D: Since Sushi Swap I've lost the concept of sleep. So we need to move fast and to make things work. So I was doing an Ma with the Chinese community. We had a wonderful question. Over like 400 people tune in in.
00:08:25.284 - 00:08:35.600, Speaker C: The WeChat and from there some people were just saying, hey, something is wrong. There is someone that just moved the dev share.
00:08:36.150 - 00:08:41.474, Speaker D: And then I just looked on Twitter, I just looked on Discord. Chef Nomi just did like a very.
00:08:41.512 - 00:08:45.006, Speaker C: Cryptic tweet saying that he had accomplished.
00:08:45.038 - 00:08:48.402, Speaker D: A lot of things with this project and that he should be rewarded.
00:08:48.546 - 00:08:52.520, Speaker C: Nobody had made him a proposal to get paid.
00:08:53.530 - 00:09:02.250, Speaker D: Maybe he was being scared because of a bug that we found in the migration code.
00:09:02.400 - 00:09:08.074, Speaker C: So a lot of things were probably going through his ad and he basically just cashed out.
00:09:08.112 - 00:09:16.814, Speaker D: I was sending him message on Discord. He was not entering. So that's what led me to publish like an ultimatum on Twitter where if he didn't enter me in twelve hour.
00:09:16.852 - 00:09:19.040, Speaker C: I would reveal everything, the whole story.
00:09:19.730 - 00:09:23.278, Speaker D: He did reach out to me and from there we are still in discussion.
00:09:23.374 - 00:09:26.354, Speaker C: For the next steps. Yeah.
00:09:26.392 - 00:09:43.270, Speaker A: And I think the other thing that was surprising was he did this just like a week after Sushi Swap launched. So it wasn't even like he'd done a ton of work on it, but so at this moment, is Chef Nomi still involved?
00:09:44.330 - 00:09:58.502, Speaker D: Chef Nomi is not publicly involved. He was there helping for the migration with Sam and Alameda research. He is feeling the aid towards him from everyone. He is not proud of his action.
00:09:58.646 - 00:10:02.106, Speaker C: So he'd rather stay in the shadow.
00:10:02.138 - 00:10:05.166, Speaker D: For now. We are still discussing about what is.
00:10:05.188 - 00:10:10.542, Speaker C: Going to happen with the treasury. So I wouldn't comment on this yet.
00:10:10.676 - 00:10:15.718, Speaker A: So he does recognize that it was a mistake or he feels some regret?
00:10:15.914 - 00:10:17.220, Speaker C: Yes, he does.
00:10:17.910 - 00:10:20.610, Speaker A: Okay, but do you know why he did it in the first place?
00:10:20.760 - 00:10:27.954, Speaker D: Maybe he was intoxicated, maybe it was the social pressure. Everyone was calling him a scammer, a charlatan, an opportunistic.
00:10:28.082 - 00:10:31.030, Speaker C: I think it's very hard to understand.
00:10:31.100 - 00:10:32.902, Speaker D: What was going on through his mind.
00:10:33.036 - 00:10:35.606, Speaker C: And perhaps at some point if he.
00:10:35.628 - 00:10:37.638, Speaker D: Returned treasury, he will do like a.
00:10:37.644 - 00:10:42.122, Speaker C: Postmortem by himself and we'll see what happened on this side of things.
00:10:42.176 - 00:10:49.578, Speaker D: But I have no expectation of him sending it back for now. Is it going to be weeks, days, month?
00:10:49.664 - 00:10:50.570, Speaker C: Who knows?
00:10:51.390 - 00:11:07.620, Speaker A: All right, well, I'm sure a lot of us will be tuning in to find out what happens to that, but so in a moment, we're going to discuss the handover of the admin key to Sam Bankman Fried. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:11:08.950 - 00:11:58.622, Speaker B: With the latest ups and downs in the world's economy, investors need new ways to grow their wealth.

00:11:58.622 - 00:12:14.070, Speaker B: Hack Atom Five, coming soon to a dev post near you this October. Visit five hackadom.org. That's fivehackatom.org.
00:12:14.890 - 00:12:17.830, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Zero Xmaki.
00:12:18.430 - 00:12:20.154, Speaker B: How was it decided to hand over.
00:12:20.192 - 00:12:31.980, Speaker A: The admin keys to SushiSwap to Sam Bankman Fried, who's the CEO of Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange FTX and also of liquidity provider Alameda Research.
00:12:32.590 - 00:12:37.966, Speaker D: So the next day, following the devshare fiasco, noshef Nomi reached out to me.
00:12:37.988 - 00:12:41.038, Speaker C: Asking if I wanted the key like the administrative key.
00:12:41.204 - 00:13:05.542, Speaker D: I told him I would rather not because I was not confident in my technical skill to do no migration and transfer everything to a multi SIG. So I instead I proposed two person I proposed Andre from Wi Fi Waifu and from there also Sam because he is someone technical that did a proposal in our discord. He had skin in the game, so I assume he could have been also.
00:13:05.596 - 00:13:07.320, Speaker C: A person that could help us.
00:13:08.010 - 00:13:20.300, Speaker A: A number of people speculated that Sam was Chef Nomi and that he had cooked up Sushi Swap in order to pull liquidity from Uniswap over to Project Serum, which he's building on the Solana Blockchain. What do you think of that?
00:13:21.330 - 00:13:23.674, Speaker C: Know, I think that's like conspiracy.
00:13:23.722 - 00:13:29.098, Speaker D: There's absolutely nothing true in there. We are literally like just tree. Nobody tree.
00:13:29.114 - 00:13:31.920, Speaker C: Anonymous person that got together.
00:13:32.550 - 00:13:38.338, Speaker D: Sam was, I think, understood the power of community and that's why he joined this interesting project.
00:13:38.504 - 00:13:44.786, Speaker C: Maybe he does. As know, with Solanar serum doesn't interest me.
00:13:44.808 - 00:13:55.622, Speaker D: I will be the first one to quit the project if this is pushed forward. And anyway, he was just involved for the migration and multisig from there. The community is going to be leading the project.
00:13:55.756 - 00:14:02.806, Speaker C: So all of the conspiracy are false and shouldn't be taken seriously, in my opinion.
00:14:02.998 - 00:14:09.274, Speaker A: So when you say that he was only involved in the migration and won't be moving forward, what does that mean for the admin key?
00:14:09.472 - 00:14:10.906, Speaker C: It means that the admin key is.
00:14:10.928 - 00:14:13.840, Speaker D: Going to be secured by nine people that were elected by the community.
00:14:14.370 - 00:14:16.042, Speaker C: But he's one of the signers.
00:14:16.106 - 00:14:17.146, Speaker D: Yeah, he is one of the signer.
00:14:17.178 - 00:14:18.560, Speaker C: I'm one of the signer too.
00:14:19.570 - 00:14:22.318, Speaker A: Before the migration on, I guess it.
00:14:22.324 - 00:14:24.942, Speaker B: Was Wednesday, how much liquidity did you.
00:14:24.996 - 00:14:28.206, Speaker A: Expect would migrate from Uniswap over to Sushi Swap?
00:14:28.398 - 00:14:34.402, Speaker D: I didn't have any numbers in mind. I saw on Twitter that some people were speculating on 100 million, 300 million.
00:14:34.536 - 00:14:37.906, Speaker C: We ended up with 1.14 million at.
00:14:37.928 - 00:14:54.086, Speaker D: Its peak, I think. Which was billion. Yeah, billion, sorry. Which is like it's crazy. I wouldn't have expected so much. The thing is, I'm not like delusional. I do know that Uniswap is working on a token.
00:14:54.086 - 00:14:59.146, Speaker D: We might be vampired attacked by another competitor, but as long as we can.
00:14:59.248 - 00:15:04.446, Speaker C: From there, we prove the concept that.
00:15:04.628 - 00:15:07.982, Speaker D: The whole thing, that liquidity is not.
00:15:08.036 - 00:15:18.180, Speaker C: A mode, that volume. Yes, could be. But I think the interesting building phase start now. So that's what I'm most excited about.
00:15:19.510 - 00:15:33.686, Speaker A: So, right after the migration, sushi Swap had 1.2 billion in liquidity and Uniswap had 400 million. Although actually, by the time of recording Uniswap, its liquidity has increased to 700 million. And I just was wondering, were you.
00:15:33.708 - 00:15:37.800, Speaker B: Surprised by how successful this vampire mining scheme went?
00:15:39.450 - 00:15:40.342, Speaker C: Yeah, I was.
00:15:40.396 - 00:15:48.780, Speaker D: But at the same time, I think the community, or like every LP that got involved, they were there for a paycheck, they were there for maybe the ethos of the project.
00:15:50.290 - 00:15:57.710, Speaker C: Liquidity with the days of yield farming is just liquid at the moment.
00:15:57.780 - 00:16:06.946, Speaker D: It's very liquid. I think the project that was able to make it a little bit more under luck is WiFi with their vault and there's like fees if you get.
00:16:06.968 - 00:16:09.170, Speaker C: Out of the pools.
00:16:09.750 - 00:16:12.482, Speaker D: So I think we're going to see more and more of this.
00:16:12.536 - 00:16:15.006, Speaker C: So people trying to lock liquidity, but.
00:16:15.048 - 00:16:16.230, Speaker D: I was very surprised of the success.
00:16:16.300 - 00:16:16.920, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:17.770 - 00:16:19.746, Speaker A: You personally don't own any Sushi.
00:16:19.778 - 00:16:20.600, Speaker B: Why not?
00:16:23.930 - 00:16:28.362, Speaker C: That was understood between the founder team.
00:16:28.416 - 00:16:43.614, Speaker D: That we shouldn't be farming, buying, selling any Sushi, because we already had the dev share that would be shared among us and the developers contributing to the project. Which one has been a recipient before.
00:16:43.812 - 00:16:49.722, Speaker C: Sushi Nomi event, zippo got actually granted.
00:16:49.866 - 00:17:13.766, Speaker D: Some Sushi for his work, doing like, an amazing dashboard, tracking all of the pools, all of the countdown statistic election of the multisig candidates. He has been doing wonderful work and he is actually also a multisig signer. So we are very fortunate to have exceptional community member. And Zippo is just one of ten that I could name on top of.
00:17:13.788 - 00:17:14.840, Speaker C: My head right now.
00:17:16.010 - 00:17:17.754, Speaker B: So since that dev share was supposed.
00:17:17.792 - 00:17:28.810, Speaker A: To be split between you guys, not only did Chef Nomi cash out, but he basically also took money that people were thinking was partly yours.
00:17:29.970 - 00:17:33.966, Speaker C: Yeah, I would rather not go into.
00:17:33.988 - 00:17:46.580, Speaker D: The details, but I can tell you that even if Chef Nomi exceeded his share, let's say, or the whole treasury, we still have more than, I think, four or 5 million at the moment.
00:17:47.350 - 00:17:48.750, Speaker C: At the time of the recording.
00:17:48.830 - 00:17:50.050, Speaker D: Treasury is going well.
00:17:50.120 - 00:17:53.474, Speaker C: We're not too stressed about it.
00:17:53.592 - 00:18:09.594, Speaker D: The project is picking up steam at the moment. We see like a volume of 8 million on some pairs for a one day old dex, which is like, crazy. So we have better spread on the.
00:18:09.632 - 00:18:14.220, Speaker C: Incentivized pool than Uniswap, which is, in my opinion, crazy.
00:18:15.550 - 00:18:19.434, Speaker A: Well, have you been paid at all for your efforts so far, or?
00:18:19.472 - 00:18:27.166, Speaker C: No, I haven't been paid at all yet. There is probably some proposals that will be coming up.
00:18:27.348 - 00:18:29.134, Speaker D: I do have a full time day.
00:18:29.172 - 00:18:32.042, Speaker C: Job and I will have to resume.
00:18:32.186 - 00:18:34.770, Speaker D: This in, I think, four or five days.
00:18:34.920 - 00:18:40.306, Speaker C: If no proposal is accepted, I will still be involved part time or as.
00:18:40.328 - 00:18:41.042, Speaker D: Much as I can.
00:18:41.096 - 00:18:44.286, Speaker C: But yeah, no, I've not been rewarded.
00:18:44.478 - 00:18:47.062, Speaker D: The only people that have been making.
00:18:47.116 - 00:18:50.790, Speaker C: Money in this project are Zippo and Chef Nomi.
00:18:51.770 - 00:19:02.700, Speaker A: How do you feel about working on SushiSwap, which basically took all of its code from Uniswap, which is a team that's been working on this project for years.
00:19:03.230 - 00:19:36.680, Speaker D: I think this was necessary to bootstrap the project. I think that is just to confirm the idea, to see if there's a market or if there is demand for it. Am I proud of just being like, a copy pasted Uniswap? Personally, I think no, but from there we can iterate. We can become the best decks from here. I think that is like a very strong foundation. Whatever happened with Uniswap V Three, I think that we will always have something special going forward.
00:19:38.890 - 00:19:42.360, Speaker A: So what is the vision for SushiSwap going forward?
00:19:42.810 - 00:20:08.046, Speaker D: It is DeFi DApps integration directly on the UI. It is like partnering with indie DApps developers that maybe are currently working at a full time job, but would like to contribute to a side project and are not rewarded for it. It is adding key features like limit orders, top plus jerky on the UI. There's many things we can do.
00:20:08.228 - 00:20:12.778, Speaker C: There is also, like, as you know, the serum proposal.
00:20:12.954 - 00:20:14.834, Speaker D: Is there going to be one, two.
00:20:14.872 - 00:20:17.362, Speaker C: Teams that are going to be building.
00:20:17.416 - 00:20:22.594, Speaker D: On another blockchain perhaps? Am. I sold to serum myself.
00:20:22.792 - 00:20:23.682, Speaker C: Not at all.
00:20:23.736 - 00:20:31.666, Speaker D: I think that if a team from Polkadot wanted to do the same thing and the community voted yes then it would be supported.
00:20:31.858 - 00:20:37.270, Speaker C: We have Dao that's coming quicker than anticipated.
00:20:37.790 - 00:20:39.754, Speaker D: There's a lot of work to be.
00:20:39.792 - 00:20:45.660, Speaker C: Done and I'm very grateful to have so many community member helping on this side.
00:20:46.510 - 00:20:59.390, Speaker A: And what about the high fees on Ethereum that doesn't I mean you sort of have a kind of let's say fair attitude about switching over to another blockchain. But aren't you concerned about the high gas fees on Ethereum?
00:21:00.770 - 00:21:17.250, Speaker D: Yes, there are solutions. Is it L two? I don't think so personally because it's going to break composability unless we can't do it right. Is it going to be a gas token in Sushi swap? Lots of things going on. Is it going to be like incentivizing.
00:21:17.330 - 00:21:20.754, Speaker C: Some wallet to make just one transaction.
00:21:20.802 - 00:21:30.314, Speaker D: A day so it doesn't cost anything for them? It can be easily gamed. We do have to check all of.
00:21:30.352 - 00:21:32.474, Speaker C: This but it could be like something.
00:21:32.512 - 00:21:44.234, Speaker D: Like know your farmer from Archx. So for example if a wallet has been interacting with specific DApps for the past six months we can assume that they are not a fresh new wallet.
00:21:44.282 - 00:21:46.538, Speaker C: And mitigate some of this risk.
00:21:46.714 - 00:21:52.830, Speaker D: We'll see lots of things. To think I'm in there for the long term.
00:21:54.470 - 00:21:57.010, Speaker A: Well, provided you get funding.
00:21:57.990 - 00:21:59.374, Speaker D: Even if I don't get funding I'll.
00:21:59.422 - 00:22:00.820, Speaker C: Still keep working on.
00:22:01.270 - 00:22:22.380, Speaker A: Yeah, it's so much fun. I can tell that you are quite the fan of DeFi and the way that I can tell that is because of your outfit today. And for those of you watching on YouTube you will get to see this but is your ex machi. Why don't you show everyone and tell everyone also so the people on podcast can hear.
00:22:24.110 - 00:22:46.290, Speaker D: This is Ud from Meta Factory and they've been doing some amazing stuff with Merch for DFI. So I've been coping Ud from WiFi some jam pants and everything to be ready for the Tokyo WiFi party with Blue Kirby.
00:22:47.590 - 00:22:48.898, Speaker A: When is that happening?
00:22:49.064 - 00:22:52.386, Speaker D: It's happening when WiFi is going to be 100K so it should be like.
00:22:52.408 - 00:22:53.380, Speaker C: In a few months.
00:22:54.150 - 00:22:58.660, Speaker A: Okay, just like COVID we'll see.
00:23:00.630 - 00:23:22.538, Speaker D: From there. I'll let WiFi community organize that. I'm a very big fan of open communities or like Crunch organization that people calls them. I hope that Sushi can be one of them. Wi Fi is doing pretty great. Yam is amazing too and I think I haven't peaked at Swerve yet but I think they're trying to do something similar and I will be always a.
00:23:22.544 - 00:23:26.506, Speaker C: Big fan of DAOs like people organizing.
00:23:26.538 - 00:23:32.320, Speaker D: Themselves doing something similar. I've been also in touch with Cream finance a little bit to see what they were doing.
00:23:34.390 - 00:23:43.586, Speaker C: I think people should stop seeing fork or everything as attack and more about like they're trying to do something different.
00:23:43.768 - 00:24:12.380, Speaker D: Yes, they're inspiring themselves and stuff but they want to just push the ecosystem forward. I think that the net positive for SushiSwap at the end of the day is going to be that more developers are maybe going to go anon and be sustainable by enabling some sort of their share or something like reward mechanism. Maybe we're going to see also more fair tokens because of this all like you can be fork at any time now. Are we going to see more closed source project?
00:24:12.750 - 00:24:15.630, Speaker C: Perhaps, but I don't think that community.
00:24:15.700 - 00:24:17.440, Speaker D: Are going to support them as much.
00:24:18.530 - 00:24:19.774, Speaker C: And at the end of the day.
00:24:19.812 - 00:24:55.802, Speaker D: I think a lot of people got introduced to being LP for the first time and that's very key because that helps everyone, that helps every traders out there. It helps people to get deep in the rabbit hole. Once you provided liquidity now it's easier to go farming somewhere else. Or if it's not farming, maybe you will start to interact with some dows because now you're in an open organization, people have probably voted for the first time via snapshot. It's like all of this that is amazing in my opinion. And the more choice the users add.
00:24:55.936 - 00:24:57.146, Speaker C: The better it is for them.
00:24:57.168 - 00:24:58.300, Speaker D: At the end of the day.
00:25:01.230 - 00:25:01.638, Speaker C: That'S.
00:25:01.654 - 00:25:03.838, Speaker D: What I think is the impact of.
00:25:03.924 - 00:25:06.030, Speaker C: Sushi swap at the end of the day.
00:25:06.180 - 00:25:47.418, Speaker A: A couple of comments I want to make. One is so just to describe your sweatshirt for the people listening on audio. It's a WiFi sweatshirt and the sleeve says I test in prod. And he's also wearing yam pants which I didn't know existed. I'm surprised you're not wearing any sushi merch. But then one other thing that I wanted to mention is earlier when you said that we might see more non devs getting funded by tokens and stuff, I actually thought that because of how Chef Nomi cashed out that people may not trust anonymous devs going forward as much.
00:25:47.504 - 00:26:04.738, Speaker D: Oh, I don't think this is the case. I think we were just very early and we did some mistakes. We're just going to be devs doing more time locks, there's going to be multi SIG protection for the funds or some sort of to make sure that the devs are not accessible very easily. I think this is just going to.
00:26:04.744 - 00:26:08.340, Speaker C: Be like standard from Chef Nomi was.
00:26:08.710 - 00:26:11.362, Speaker D: Nobody wants that to happen again, I think.
00:26:11.496 - 00:26:15.298, Speaker C: And that is just a lesson for the whole space. I see.
00:26:15.384 - 00:26:23.990, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that makes a lot more sense. All right, well this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:26:24.570 - 00:26:25.830, Speaker C: Thank you Laura.

Hi everyone, thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First Headline Bitcoin Core had high severity bug in 2018 is now fixed Bitcoin's main software had a critical bug that could have split the $190,000,000,000 network in two and allowed attackers to steal funds. The denial of service vulnerability was discovered in the Bitcoin Core software over two years ago, but has not been publicly disclosed until now.
00:27:32.380 - 00:28:22.846, Speaker B: Although it was quietly fixed in 2018, reporting of the bug was delayed because it took node operators longer than expected to update their software. The vulnerability ranked 7.8 on a scale of one to ten, with nine or above being considered critical. Luckily, no attempt to take advantage of this vulnerability was found. Next Headline DFI ushers in record breaking volume in August If you've been following everything in DFI this summer, you will probably not be surprised to hear that August was a record breaking month for onchain volume trading and Ethereum transaction fees. Total adjusted onchain volume, which serves as a proxy for economic throughput, saw a 30 month high. Bitcoin's onchain volume increased by 23% from $66 billion to $81 billion.
00:28:22.846 - 00:29:16.670, Speaker B: Ethereum's onchain volume showed a massive increase of 82%, from 24 billion to $44 billion. Overall, Bitcoin still maintained an onchain volume in August that was almost two times higher than Ethereum's transaction fees on Ethereum. Thanks to the burgeoning, DFI market reached an alltime high of over 40% of total minor revenue, compared to 10% in May. Big names are taking notice of the DFI frenzy as the volume of DFI tokens on overthecounter desks has ballooned over the last quarter. However, these desks still appear wary of trading on decentralized exchanges. Finance announced its own AMM pool for liquidity providers. Dubbed Binance Liquidity Swap, the pool will offer different liquidity pools with instant token swap functionality, although the protocol itself is not decentralized.
00:29:16.670 - 00:30:26.770, Speaker B: As for September, volume on uniswap in the first ten days of the month has already surpassed August's total numbers, and the second largest, Dex Curve, had also exceeded August numbers. Record numbers by Thursday and next week, coinbase Pro will add trading in YFI. Next Headline Swerve reaches Half of Curve's Deposits in Days Just a week after launch, Swerve Finance, the unaudited fork of automated market maker Curve Finance, has gathered deposits worth $525,000,000. That's about half of Curve's total value locked, which is just over $1 billion. Swerve is a 100% communityowned and governed fork of Curve and generated SWRV tokens for users on day one of the AMM launching. Curve, in comparison, did not issue a token from the start, and when it did, an anonymous developer deployed smart contracts without the team's knowledge. Larry Cermac of the Block compared and contrast Swerve and SushiSwap since they are both successful forks of popular DeFi projects.
00:30:26.770 - 00:31:29.046, Speaker B: He says this trend of forking successful DeFi projects will continue. Quote There will be a struggle between the original protocols that have the brand and development talent versus the protocols that have a fairer distribution and more community driven governance. Next Headline Bitcoin transactions are up among small businesses in Africa Small business owners in Africa are turning to bitcoin for the speed and convenience it offers when paying their suppliers. Reuters reports that bitcoin transfers in Africa have jumped over 55% in a year to reach $316,000,000 in June. According to data from Chainalysis, the number of monthly transfers is also up almost 50% to over 600,000, with the bulk of the activity taking place on Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. Driving the boom are the young, tech savvy population of the continent, as well as trade with China. Chain analysis found that East Asia is a top partner when it comes to bitcoin trading in Africa.
00:31:29.046 - 00:32:41.818, Speaker B: Bitcoin has also boosted profits for these businesses, thanks to savings in money transfer fees and reduced foreign exchange fees from converting to and from the US dollar. One seller of mobile phones, Abelaji Odunjo, says of using Bitcoin quote you don't have to pay charges. You don't have to buy dollars. In related News Digital Currency Group announced it had acquired Luno, a retail focused exchange with a strong presence in Africa as well as Southeast Asia. Luno, which launched in 2013, has received funding from DCG since 2014 and the acquisition positions DCG to have a strong presence in emerging markets. Next Headline 700 ETH lost in chainlink attack Nine chainlink node operators suffered an attack on August 30 that resulted in 700 ETH, or about $335,000 at the time, taken from their hot wallets. Exploiting the way nodes respond to queries, the attackers sent price feed requests, which resulted in node operators spending large amounts of gas, which then pushed up the price of Qi, a tokenized form of gas.
00:32:41.818 - 00:33:31.406, Speaker B: The attacker then minted Qi tokens at these elevated prices, later selling them for ETH. Once the node operators were drained of ETH, they were unable to fulfill data requests. The attack lasted 2 hours until a temporary solution to block non whitelisted requests from active DeFi protocols such as Aave and synthetics was implemented. A chainlink spokesperson said the attack did not impact its network despite node operators paying the high fees necessary to continue powering the system. While stating that consumers were not affected, the spokesperson acknowledged that elevated gas prices prompted the attack. Next Headline A DFI trader turned $200 into $290,000 by exploiting a bug in Sci-fi. An anonymous trader says they stumbled into an opportunity that led to them quitting their day job.
00:33:31.406 - 00:34:14.858, Speaker B: A Twitter user named Amplify said that they traded $200 worth of an obscure coin called Sci-fi, a derivative of WiFi, and at the. Time of the rebase. The rebase malfunctioned and their spontaneous trade netted them $290,000. On Uniswap, amplify saw that two Sci-Fi would turn into 15,551 Sci-Fi, which is worth 740 e at the time, or about a quarter of a million dollars. Amplify at first thought it was a UI bug, but figured that if not, they would lose less than $50 in fees, so it was worth trying. Their win was everyone else's loss. The project collapsed.
00:34:14.858 - 00:35:10.478, Speaker B: Amplify says they meant no harm to anyone, while also making clear they saw the developers as responsible for offering a presale for a forked coin and then pushing it forward with unaudited code. They also reiterated they had no idea the bug existed, saying, quote I simply pressed a button because I saw something unbelievable on the other side. On a related note, Twitter user crypto Plato posted a screenshot from the Swerve discord on September eigth showing a transaction in which someone lost $1 million by sending that amount of money to the Swerve token contract rather than a liquidity pool. Be careful. D Phi Traders. Next headline fun Bits Jack Dorsey on making Bitcoin more accessible. In a Reuters interview, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said, quote, I think the internet wants native currency and I think Bitcoin is the best manifestation of that thus far.
00:35:10.478 - 00:36:06.770, Speaker B: He said it was important for people like him and other operators to make Bitcoin easy for people to access, understand and utilize. He said the two critical challenges it faces are the long transaction times and the lack of an intuitive, user friendly interface. Second, Fun Bits East Two Medalla Data Challenge with Ethereum's Medalla Testnet Now live, the Ethereum community has issued a challenge to all Ethereums to document their, quote, best medalla data insights in the most readable blog post possible for prizes of up to $15,000.
