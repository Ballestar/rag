00:00:00.170 - 00:00:38.434, Speaker A: But I do not think this is the end of DeFi. I think that we need to be clear about what the indictment is saying and what it is not saying. It is not saying that simply running a front end is a crime. It's not saying that simply writing code is a crime. It's saying that according to the government, that you're running a financial institution that would have to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. And when you agree to do that thing and you don't actually comply, that is the that is I think the indictment is just a little more specific about what they're criminalizing. And I think that's a good thing for DeFi.
00:00:38.434 - 00:00:49.780, Speaker A: Right. We don't want the indictment to be broader than it actually is. We want it to be as specific as it possibly could be in terms of differentiating what is going to be pursued as a crime versus what is.
