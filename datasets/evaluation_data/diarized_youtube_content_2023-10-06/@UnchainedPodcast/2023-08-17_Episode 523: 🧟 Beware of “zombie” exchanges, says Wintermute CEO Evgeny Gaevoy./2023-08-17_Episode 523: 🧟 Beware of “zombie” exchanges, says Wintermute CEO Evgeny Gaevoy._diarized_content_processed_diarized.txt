00:00:00.490 - 00:00:10.826, Speaker A: My biggest challenge with current environment is like, I think there are a lot of zombies still out there, like on exchanges site, and we don't trade on a lot of them because we actually think that a lot of them are zombies.
00:00:10.938 - 00:00:15.306, Speaker B: Can you elaborate? Which exchanges do you suspect of being zombies?
00:00:15.418 - 00:00:23.134, Speaker A: I wish. Yeah, that's kind of which exchanges do you not trade on? We don't need any. Yeah.
00:00:23.172 - 00:00:28.978, Speaker B: Which large exchanges? Exchanges out of the top ten do you not trade on? No comment on whether or not they're zombies?
00:00:29.154 - 00:00:36.822, Speaker A: Yeah, it's overlapping circles. Pretty much like us suspecting them being zombies and not trading on them.
00:00:36.956 - 00:00:49.250, Speaker B: I mean, look, after what happened with FTX last year, I do feel like it's a bit of a public service to you can say, Look, I don't know, I'm not confident. Caveat of tour, we don't have all the information, but here's where we're not trading.
00:00:49.330 - 00:00:58.140, Speaker A: The hardest bit is you're just like, I mean, I can say it and then I'm just make a lot of enemies for no good reason. And that's basically the unfortunate truth of it.
