00:00:00.090 - 00:00:23.450, Speaker A: Unhook your bras, friends. It's time to let that ether loose. This upgrade marks the completion of ETH transition to a proof of stake system that began in October 2022 with the Merge. Not to be confused with The Purge, which is a film series in which all crime is legalized for 12 hours. Crypto's not like that. It doesn't have the twelve hour time limit. Under the new proof of stake system, winner of new crypto is determined via raffle, which is hard for some of these crypto guys who aren't exactly known for getting lucky.
00:00:23.450 - 00:00:47.830, Speaker A: Some people in Crypto are excited, though, since proof of stake is much more environmentally friendly. Although they really could have picked a better name. Steak, really? Proof of hummus might have been a better sell. Others say that proof of stake would lead to concentrated power in the hands of a small number of wealthy people. Which is just like, chill out guys, look at all our economic indicators. In a couple of years, none of us are going to be wealthy. Others say that this move could be bad because everyone will withdraw their ETH as soon as they're allowed to.
00:00:47.830 - 00:00:59.180, Speaker A: By that logic, in the two years before this faked ETH has been your passed out drunk friend at the crypto party, unable to be moved. Now it's about to be any crypto bros date at the very same party, desperate to leave.
