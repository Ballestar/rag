00:00:00.170 - 00:00:39.330, Speaker A: Digital Currency Group is a conglomerate. And there's tons of conglomerates out there. And whether it's Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate that owns NetJets and Geico and other businesses, or LVMH is a conglomerate and owns tons of companies underneath it that are operating subsidiaries. I think the DCG scenario is really analogous to those where Grayscale is a standalone entity that has common ownership under the DCG umbrella. The same is true of Genesis. The same is true of CoinDesk or Trade Block or, you know, Foundry. And so Grayscale is a standalone entity, separate and distinct from these other businesses.
00:00:39.330 - 00:00:58.650, Speaker A: I have my own management team surrounding me. We have our own budgets, our own governance, our own policies, our own procedures as I shared, our own broker dealer, our own RIA. And so we're not privy to or party to what's transpiring in any of the other entities, despite the fact that they are owned wholly by digital.
