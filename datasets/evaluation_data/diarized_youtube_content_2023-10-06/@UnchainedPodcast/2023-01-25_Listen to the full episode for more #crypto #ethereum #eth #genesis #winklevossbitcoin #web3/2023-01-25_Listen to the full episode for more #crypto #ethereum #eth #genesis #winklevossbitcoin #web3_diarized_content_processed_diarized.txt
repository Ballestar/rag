00:00:00.650 - 00:00:36.680, Speaker A: I think if people can agree to a prepackaged set of terms, it'll be pretty quick. I think if they don't, it's a total cluster. If there's lawsuits from the Winklevi twins, if anything is contested, I think this gets dragged out dramatically. There's already people contesting some of the very simple facts that have already come out. Like, a number of creditors have stood up and say, like, hey, you got the amount that I'm owed completely wrong. Like, one example is like, Cumberland came out and said, oh, it says you owe us, like, 18 or 19 million, and that's wrong. You owe us $40,000.
00:00:36.680 - 00:00:54.330, Speaker A: There's already confusion and dispute of some basic facts. And there's another one that came out, another creditor came out and said $150,000,000 credit was incorrect and that the filing was on an incredibly sloppy manner.
