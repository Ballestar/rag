00:01:28.290 - 00:01:35.190, Speaker A: And Vinny's also been nicknamed the Bitcoin Oracle for his uncannily accurate bitcoin price predictions. Welcome, Vinny.
00:01:35.270 - 00:01:37.066, Speaker B: Thank you, Laura. Good to be on the show.
00:01:37.248 - 00:01:59.540, Speaker A: So heads up, everyone, that we are on the 44th floor of a hotel, the Marriott Marquee, where Consensus was held. And despite our kind of like, perch over the city, you might occasionally hear sirens in the episode. Just want to warn you. So, Vinny, you made a number of big announcements here at Consensus, but let's start with the basics. What does civic do?
00:01:59.990 - 00:02:37.582, Speaker B: Thanks, Laura. So, Civic is a blockchain based identity platform. What it really means is that we've used the blockchain to reimagine how identity would work in the real world. And we're doing it by giving people the ability to store their personal information, their ID information, and anything really around personal data, health records, et cetera, on their mobile device secured by the biometric tools like touch ID that's on the mobile device. And no one else gets to see their information unless they explicitly give permission for it. And so that means that information is not stored on Civic servers. It's a fully decentralized model.
00:02:37.582 - 00:03:17.334, Speaker B: Everyone in the world could be storing their personal information on their devices and we would have none of it. So we can't get hacked and you can't lose your information through Civic because we don't store any of that data. And we're doing that because we think it's important that people have control of their information and then can use it to gain access to places where they need to go. So potentially through an airport or going online, logging into a website, replacing two factor authentication, et cetera. So we see a ton of use cases. What we've done is we've just launched our product, which allows you to log into websites using your phone, scanning a QR code, passwordless entry, and ultra secure.
00:03:17.462 - 00:03:23.626, Speaker A: So walk me through what that looks like. Like, if you are going to an airport and you need to prove who you are, how does that work? Sure.
00:03:23.648 - 00:04:47.810, Speaker B: So that's kind of the long term dream we have is that because the ID information in your phone is so secure and locked down that governments around the world will start accepting civic IDs and civic accounts in the future? We're not there yet, we've just launched. And so right now we're focusing on really the cryptocurrency community, so the web developers, the cryptocurrency sites and exchanges where instead of having to do KYC, which is know your customer, and where you provide exchanges with your passport, your driver's license, and all this information about them really multiple times every time you open up an account. We're trying to make it simple so that you do it once information is verified, digitally signed, certified on your device, private keys are placed on the device, and there's a hash on the blockchain, on the bitcoin blockchain, which confirms that the owner of the key is the owner of the information. So when you go to the next site to sign up, if you've already provided information once, they can trust that the information hasn't been changed and therefore you can log in and you can sign up and not have to go through a full KYC again. So it's really more of a reusable KYC model, but it also means you can just log into websites without a username and password, and by having the app and authenticating through the app, you could gain access. And the good thing about that is because the sites that integrate with us are not storing a username and password for you, or an email address and password. If they get hacked, the hacker can't use that information elsewhere to gain access to your other accounts.
00:04:47.970 - 00:04:57.606, Speaker A: One thing was, so you were talking about KYC, which is know your customer. So what information is it that consumers need to give when they're signing up for civic?
00:04:57.798 - 00:05:29.478, Speaker B: So when you sign for Civic, there are multiple levels of accounts. The basic account really is just email and phone number. And that's not a verified account, that's just a basic civic account. That also means that when you go somewhere, people don't have to send you an email where you have to type in the code or click the link. They don't have to send you a text message. You type in the code again, it's already done. So the website who receives that information from you knows that Civic is verified, that that's your email, that's your phone number, and as long as you're willing to give that information to them, they don't have to have you reverify it.
00:05:29.644 - 00:05:37.206, Speaker A: So that's like if you travel and you want to check your bank balance or something at the moment, then your bank knows that it's still you.
00:05:37.388 - 00:06:15.026, Speaker B: With Civic, there's two types of accounts. You have a basic account where we only verify the email address and the phone number. And then you have a verified account where we verify your email address, your phone number, your address, your first name, middle name, last name, your Social Security number, and really any other information that the website may need about you. And so verified accounts are a very high level of trust and basic accounts have got some degree of trust because that's just an email and a phone number. But in both cases, when you're logging into a website, they can choose what information they want from you and what level of trust that they really want from Civic to verify if you are who you say you are.
00:06:15.208 - 00:06:23.910, Speaker A: So which types of accounts would I use? Just like the basic account to log in with and then which type of accounts would I use the verified account with?
00:06:23.980 - 00:06:56.170, Speaker B: So if you were applying for a bank account, you would probably need a verified account because no bank is just going to accept a phone number and email address. They want to know that your first name, last name, matches your email address, matches your physical address, Social Security number, et cetera. So if we can provide them with that information as being already verified, it makes it a lot cheaper and easier for them to open the account for you versus having to go through an entire process where you have to submit driver's license potentially and passport information. And that's what you have to do right now for exchanges. And so we're trying to make it a lot more easy and more secure to do that.
00:06:56.260 - 00:07:01.154, Speaker A: And then when would I use the basic account with just the email address and phone number?
00:07:01.272 - 00:07:47.438, Speaker B: So for basic accounts, if you were signing up for a social network website or something that doesn't really require a high degree of knowledge, creating an account on a forum, et cetera, they just really maybe even want just your email address. And the best part about the basic accounts is they can also be used for something called private logins. And that means that the site accepting a private login will take no information from you at all. So you can sign up for an app or website, give them nothing except a unique token so that they'll remember you when you come back, but they don't know your email or your phone number and you can test the service out. And if they decide in the future. Well, after seven day of a free trial, maybe we now need to know your email address or phone number. They can then request it from you at that point and then you can decide whether you want to disclose information.
00:07:47.438 - 00:08:05.606, Speaker B: So I think I'm one of many people who have a problem with going to these sites and apps and having to sign up and give all my information just to check out an app. And so we think that the Civic protocol makes it really easy for people to just try things out and if they don't like it, they can leave and the site can't contact them, has no information.
00:08:05.788 - 00:08:16.602, Speaker A: So at the moment of onboarding, how does Civic know that I'm really who I am? Like, what if I'm a fraudster trying to impersonate my so on?
00:08:16.656 - 00:08:49.394, Speaker B: In terms of onboarding, we've been doing this for a while. So last year we launched an identity theft protection product which allows us to really verify your identity. And we've been testing this and a lot of success in making sure that we can verify people's information. So yes, it's entirely possible someone who can fake being you and they can come and enter your information, but they have to have access to your email most likely, and your phone number. They have to do some records matching. We send a postcard to your house to make sure that you actually live with that address. It's got to match public records.
00:08:49.394 - 00:09:16.094, Speaker B: So we go through quite an extensive verification process and we adapt that process based upon country we go into and public records availability. But by and large, the process we go through is the same process that banks and exchanges go through already. So all we're doing is we're making sure that to a high degree we can validate that you are who you say you are. And it may not be 100%, but it's going to be a lot better than a light touch background check.
00:09:16.212 - 00:09:21.242, Speaker A: What types of partners do you envision and how will you get them to adopt Civic?
00:09:21.386 - 00:10:17.438, Speaker B: So that's one of the reasons why we're doing a token sale. We felt that Civic needs to be something which is a community based movement and we wanted to create a platform where people can really get involved and help us change the world and ensure data privacy and security. And it's really as a fundamental tenet of, I think, the cryptography world and this freedom of information and this knowledge of how unsecure our data is everywhere. And so by structuring the token sale in such a way where you can get tokens as part of the network so we're issuing a billion tokens, they'll be used for smart contracting and data transfers, et cetera, and many other things. But in order to get tokens, you can do two things. You can buy them in the token sale or you can earn them. So as a developer, if you choose to integrate Civic, you will be receiving tokens for driving traffic, getting people on board, and depends on the partnership we have.
00:10:17.438 - 00:10:44.154, Speaker B: You will earn free tokens and be part of the network. And obviously we only have a fixed number of tokens, so it's going to go to the people early on who help us build the network and get to scale. And that's one of the best reasons I think we've thought about in terms of reasons for why a token sale makes sense. How do you involve the community? So Civic will own one third of the tokens and two thirds will be sitting in the community and people can choose to buy or earn or both.
00:10:44.352 - 00:10:53.534, Speaker A: And so I understand how you're going to use the tokens to build the network, but then once the network is kind of like sufficiently large enough, will the tokens have a function then?
00:10:53.652 - 00:11:45.086, Speaker B: Well, the tokens have a function effectively from day one once we launch the marketplace because the tokens act as a smart contracting system. So right now Civic is the only ID verification service in the network, so to speak. So we're the ones doing the verification. But the plan and the partnerships we're busy forging right now are for large institutions to come in. They may have 1020 million customers and give their customers their data and allow that customer to use it on other websites through the Civic network. And those websites who then receive the data can validate it. That it was validated by the let's say, for example, a bank, if a bank gave you a personal information on the app or through Civic, said, look, you can now use this Laura to log into a website or to open up a securities account, or to apply for medical insurance, whatever it is.
00:11:45.086 - 00:12:11.062, Speaker B: You could have a situation where the recipient so let's say, for example, it's a different financial institution says, well, we trust this bank, and instead of us doing a whole process on you and spending $1020, they're asking for a one dollars fee or 50 cent fee. We're going to pay them that one dollars fee and we're going to let you open the account instantly because the keys match, your information matches. We're pretty certain that's you so then.
00:12:11.116 - 00:12:27.180, Speaker A: You basically have both of these banks as your partner, right? And you're kind of like the facilitator of ensuring that the information from the first bank is all kosher and that okay, it matches what the second bank would.
00:12:27.870 - 00:12:49.438, Speaker B: So and you take it to the next mean when you have multiple institutions in this platform, you can drive the cost of KYC and ID verification right down. I mean, right now the world's spending tens of billions of dollars on verifying the same people over and over and over. And if we make it reusable, it can be a lot more simpler, easier, faster, more secure.
00:12:49.534 - 00:12:55.442, Speaker A: And then to go back to how you were saying that tokens can be used in smart contracts. What's an example of what that would look like?
00:12:55.496 - 00:13:54.546, Speaker B: So let's say, for example, your profile may have it's called Attestations, so it may have three companies. One bank would say, this is Laura and we verified the Social Security number. You may have a health record, you may have two or three other bits of information, who knows? And when you do a transaction with another organization and they need to get some of this information from you, there needs to be a way of settling for settling. The smart contract will ensure that the person who verified the information gets paid for verifying the information. And it may have to be split between multiple parties and they're in different countries, so they need different currencies, et cetera. And then the contract had to execute in a way that's private because you don't want necessarily the one party to know where your attications came from because there's a privacy issue there. So the smart contracting system is basically ensuring that when a transaction happens, that the tokens get split up between the right parties.
00:13:54.546 - 00:14:02.126, Speaker B: There's a transaction happens, the data is handed over, it's verified, it's checked, and it's all done and secure. And a settlement of tokens happens at both ends.
00:14:02.258 - 00:14:21.258, Speaker A: What's interesting about what you're saying is that in this case, these are like B to B payments, essentially, but your token sale is going to be to the crowd. So what are the ways in which the tokens kind of move between consumers and the business layer? Where is the B to C aspect?
00:14:21.354 - 00:15:03.014, Speaker B: So the BC aspect for consumers is there'll be services that Civic will provide, some background checks, maybe credit reports. We do ID verification, protection services right now, and you could pay for those services using these tokens. We would accept these tokens as a way of paying for services that we're offering the consumers on our network as well. But it's largely focused on the B, two B. It's largely focused on developers. Because think about it this way. If you have tokens which operate in the network and we write smart contracts which you want to execute, and you want to lower your KYC costs, you find other companies that willing to accept these tokens and execute the smart contracts with them on the network using the tokens.
00:15:03.142 - 00:15:06.186, Speaker A: So you're hoping a lot of developers buy in your ICO?
00:15:06.378 - 00:15:11.834, Speaker B: Well, they don't have to buy. They just need to develop on our platform and integrate with Civic and integrate with our network.
00:15:11.962 - 00:15:15.218, Speaker A: And then the tokens, they don't necessarily need to own them themselves.
00:15:15.304 - 00:15:59.594, Speaker B: No. So part of the early adoption cycle is getting especially the crypto community developers behind us and integrating and help contributing to building civic and building the network. And by doing that, we will allocate tokens to them. Okay, so part of the one third one third, one third is a third of the tokens are going to be given away for partners who come on and strengthen the network by bringing users on board, by bringing integrations ways of transferring data, et cetera. So, yeah, if we had partners coming on board that had millions of users and wanted to reduce their KYC costs and their verification costs, that would add a tremendous amount of value to the network. So we would give them a grant of tokens based on the volume they're going to build in the network. And so that's how we strengthen the network.
00:15:59.594 - 00:16:03.422, Speaker B: So think about the strategic partnerships that would build the network would earn tokens as well.
00:16:03.476 - 00:16:08.734, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. So that's really interesting to give away tokens as part of your business partnership.
00:16:08.782 - 00:16:33.498, Speaker B: And these tokens are valuable because there's a limited amount of them. So if you want to be on the network, you need the tokens. And as a company, if you come on board early and you get a healthy allocation of tokens, you may never need to pay for KYC services for a long time because you'll also be earning tokens when people are using the data for your existing customer base. So there's a strong incentive for early adopters with what we're doing right now.
00:16:33.664 - 00:16:42.522, Speaker A: Okay, and then how does Civic itself make money? It seems like you're making money from the tokens, but then are you taking kind of the transactions?
00:16:42.666 - 00:16:51.520, Speaker B: So we write smart contracts for these tokens, and when you execute these smart contracts, there'll be a percentage of the token that goes to us.
00:16:52.290 - 00:16:54.430, Speaker A: Wait, a percentage of the tokens?
00:16:54.510 - 00:17:06.782, Speaker B: Meaning if there was a transaction where one token was exchanged for an information exchange, there may be a percentage of that token which would execute to our wallet as part of the transaction.
00:17:06.926 - 00:17:16.550, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. So one other thing that I was just curious about is you've been active in so many different ways in cryptocurrency, but why did you decide to focus on identity?
00:17:17.050 - 00:17:58.978, Speaker B: So, at my previous company, Gift, we found that identity was a massive problem. People were using stolen credit cards. The fraudsters are very difficult to catch, and the reason is because it's not really a card problem. The argument from the card networks is that, well, it's card not present, so you can't verify who the person is. And so the merchant takes the charge back and he gets the hit. And that's really the issue, is that we haven't really, as a society, solved person not present. How do you know? And how can you digitally confirm someone is who they say they are if they're not physically there? And we've gotten the point now where, I mean, let's be honest, even if someone's physically there, we've had people walk into banks with a stolen driver's license and pretend to be someone else.
00:17:58.978 - 00:18:29.738, Speaker B: It doesn't work right. So we need a better solution. And so identity is one problem that hasn't been solved. I think the blockchain is well suited to that the bitcoin blockchain and other blockchains potentially as well. We focus on the bitcoin blockchain. And one of the things that I think we feel strongly about in the company is the sort of bigger, greater mission is that I'd like to see democracy change on earth. I'd like to see us get a point where voting for a president is inclusive of everyone, not just people who can afford to take the day off and go vote.
00:18:29.738 - 00:18:56.466, Speaker B: And I'm from South Africa. I grew up under apartheid. When nelson mandela was released, I witnessed how people would stand in line for days to go vote. And it's kind of crazy, right? So I come from a world where I was born without a vote. And so as a mission, if I could give voting to the world, it would be amazing if I could let people vote in their mobile phones in any part of the world where they are. Like, if you're traveling while your elections are in a country, you can't really participate. There's a way of doing it, but it's really cumbersome, and voting is not secure.
00:18:56.466 - 00:19:34.094, Speaker B: I mean, people elections get hacked. Good luck hacking the bitcoin blockchain. So if we could get the point where you could use tokens as a way of voting, if you could use bitcoins or any other crypto to vote, it would be very interesting, because the results would tabulate in real time. You'd have results, you'd have guaranteed no double spend, guaranteed no double votes, et cetera. So that was like the origin for the company, civic. And then we thought about the problem more and more, and we realized to solve that problem, we actually have to solve identity first. And because when I spoke to lawmakers around voting, digital voting, sure, the technology exists.
00:19:34.094 - 00:20:11.486, Speaker B: And you can argue that current tech is pretty bad and it's prone to hacking, and yeah, blockchain tech is great, but the real issue isn't. I think lawmakers just don't have faith in the fact that identity is digitally secure and sound, and so they would not be willing for years. I mean, the one conversation I had with a state representative was that, yeah, well, we could probably get there in about eight to ten years time, and that's probably about right. But in between now and then, you've got to get to the point where digital identity is actually solved. So then it becomes kind of a no brainer to use a way of digitally voting. And so that's kind of a long term vision for the company.
00:20:11.588 - 00:20:17.630, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. And on the back end now, are you using bitcoin or ethereum or private chain?
00:20:17.710 - 00:20:35.974, Speaker B: We're using bitcoin. We felt bitcoin was the most secure and nonpartisan type of coin out there. It's global. It's in every country. The nodes are propagated everywhere. Obviously, there's a pending hard fork that may be coming soon. There's some other issues there.
00:20:35.974 - 00:21:26.146, Speaker B: But we think that the long term, the security and it's more the neutrality of bitcoin kind of serves the purpose for voting versus having, for example, we could go with Ethereum, but then there actually are the personalities behind Ethereum and there's a foundation and there's some form of centralization there, if you think about it. Whereas bitcoin, I mean, sure, you have core developers and you've got mining centralization, but largely I think everyone realizes that bitcoin is something which is just purely the technology itself is neutral, so there's no argument from one government that it can be taken over by another government necessarily. And I think we would have bit of an arms race if that happened, because everyone sees bitcoin as a global asset versus controlled by one person or persons right now. I mean, could argue otherwise, but I think to the large extent, I think it's pretty neutral.
00:21:26.258 - 00:21:30.438, Speaker A: A lot of these token launches are happening on Ethereum, but are you doing yours on bitcoin?
00:21:30.534 - 00:22:11.282, Speaker B: So we'll be issuing a pre token using Ethereum, ERC 20. That's because the smart contracting system is not ready and the marketplace is not ready. Obviously we're rolling that out now, but it'll be ready in about, I would say conservatively, I'd say Q One, and we expect to have it ready by then. But the reason we're doing that, reason we're not necessarily using ERC 20 going forward long term, is that we've built on bitcoin. So when we saw what RSK was doing and with smart contracting on bitcoin, on bitcoin, and because our systems are built on bitcoin, it just makes more sense for us to use RSK and not have to try and integrate into Ethereum and have a bridge between two the RSK.
00:22:11.346 - 00:22:12.610, Speaker A: When is that launching?
00:22:12.770 - 00:22:40.238, Speaker B: Well, they're already live on testnet on the testnet right now and seems like everything's going well. So I think in the next couple of months we'll have something there and then we'll test it and as long as we feel that it's secure and robust, we'll roll it out with them. We should be the first token sale that runs on RSK, but we're confident that they can pull it off. But for now, we're going to issue an ERC 20 token and we'll take it from there.
00:22:40.404 - 00:22:44.190, Speaker A: But one thing that you said was you're issuing a pre token. I don't know what that means.
00:22:44.260 - 00:23:18.170, Speaker B: So a pretoken is basically, look, the token is not going to be functional in the sense that you can't really use it for the smart contracting because it hasn't been built in. We haven't written the smart contracts for the ERC 20 token, but you'll be able to, at the time, exchange for the final token. And for some reason, if we decide to stay with ERC 20 or there's some issues, we would basically use that token going forward. But we're pretty confident that the RSK team can execute and get us ready in time to deploy our platform. So we're expecting to be an RSK and be the first. And I think it's also good for Bitcoin. I mean, I'm a big Bitcoin believer and supporter.
00:23:18.170 - 00:23:43.842, Speaker B: I think Bitcoin has got the power to change the world and I'd love to see us doing smart contracts on the top of Bitcoin. I'd love to see us using Bitcoin for a variety of different use case other than money transfers and payments. And I'd like to see us get there. So we're going to keep pushing on that. And if for some reason we hit a limitation and we just can't make it happen, sure we'll use other technologies, but for now, I think Bitcoin can get there.
00:23:43.976 - 00:24:01.866, Speaker A: So just a couple more things about this though. Sometimes they say that if you launch a Token, you should do it when your network is already functional. So that way it reduces the chance your Token won't be deemed as security. But do you feel like you're running that risk doing it this way?
00:24:01.968 - 00:24:35.042, Speaker B: Not at all. Most people are running Token sales and ICOs right now on the back of a white paper with no tech. And we've spent two years building our platform, nearly, and we've got all the infrastructure up and running, we've got the verification processes, it works, it functions. And so the last part is really writing the smart contracts and integrating it into the back end. So I'd say that the platform is nearly ready, a few more months to go. So I don't think that what we're really selling right now is a product. You could use the product today.
00:24:35.042 - 00:25:18.146, Speaker B: And so we're selling network access to the product where you could start monetizing your customer data and earning revenue from it. And so that network access is what we're packaging as a Token and we're selling. So we've also been very, I'd say, circumspect about how we do a Token sale versus every other sale out there. And a lot of people have set up offshore companies and foundations and Virgin Island trusts and whatever, all this fancy tax structuring mess. We've thought about this very long and hard. We've spoken to our attorneys. Perkins crew have been advising us really well in the process and working with Deloitte as well.
00:25:18.146 - 00:25:56.414, Speaker B: And yeah, we could have done all that. We could have gone through this and maybe it would have been okay from a legal perspective, and maybe we could have saved a whole bunch of money on taxes. But the reality is we're not some sketchy offshore company trying to take money and hide it from taxes and do all sorts of fancy stuff. We're actually just building cool tech and we think that we can change the world. And so at the end of the day, we decided to keep it as what we are, a venture capital funded Delaware C corporation with the board, with all the structures done this before. We're going to pay the taxes as we need to. The money flows into.
00:25:56.414 - 00:26:23.366, Speaker B: The company into the US. It's regulated from we're a US company and we're based in Palo Alto. What you see is what you get. We're not going to do anything fancy or crazy and in doing so, we think we're going to walk the straight and narrow line and maybe we don't save as much or we don't raise as much or whatever it is, but it's more important that we do it the right way we think.
00:26:23.548 - 00:26:34.790, Speaker A: Okay, and I also wanted to ask you, why did you not go for VC funding this time? I totally understand the function of the token and all that, but I know initially you were VC funded.
00:26:34.870 - 00:26:36.870, Speaker B: Well, we are. We are VC funded.
00:26:37.030 - 00:26:41.654, Speaker A: Okay, right. But then now you're choosing to raise money another way. Why did you go that route?
00:26:41.702 - 00:27:07.614, Speaker B: So we've raised $5.75 million in funding so far. We actually haven't announced all it, but I think it should be public by now. And so we've raised that much money. It's a good healthy amount of money to get a company to the point where you've got a product launch ready. It's a very difficult building tech in our space because remember, we're dealing with a lot of regulation with regards to identity, consumer information, data. We have to rearchitect.
00:27:07.614 - 00:27:52.402, Speaker B: We've had to rearchitect it so we can effectively store everyone's in the world's information on their own devices. And this is a lot of security that goes into that and a lot of thought and tech and taking us a while to bullet. So when it came to the next stage, well, we could go raise money from a VC and let's say we go and raise some money from VC. What does a VC do for our business? If you think about it, this is a grassroots level, community driven thing. I mean, we need lots of small developers, medium developers, cryptocurrency players, exchanges, et cetera, playing with us. And we need to figure out a way to get these guys incentivized to move to a better, more secure system because money in the bank itself isn't going to get us there. I mean, you've got to get the community to support this.
00:27:52.402 - 00:28:24.590, Speaker B: People need to see this as a better way of logging into websites, protecting their privacy and security. And so also, speaking of VCs, as I do in Silicon Valley, up until a month ago or two months ago, bitcoin Blockchain died. They treated it like 1999, right? 2000, the big bubble crash. And they paid no attention to it. So I spend most of my time in VC meetings educating these guys and having them to bring in more people to educate. And then at the end of the day, I don't think they quite get it. And now you on a treadmill trying to catch up and figure out what's going on in this ICO space.
00:28:24.590 - 00:29:07.638, Speaker B: And it's sad, but this is years of experience that people in the crypto community have had understanding this and how it works. And our VCs are trying to play catch up. And so I'd rather take a view that working with the community and building something which everybody benefits from and people who understand it. So we're targeting the crypto community first will become the early adopters, and that would basically then encourage mass market adoption over time because people would understand why this is important and the value. And it's always just better to have hundreds of thousands of people who are part of a network versus one VC.
00:29:07.814 - 00:29:54.282, Speaker A: This is such an interesting conversation, but we're going to take a break just for a second, for an important word from our sponsor, onramp, and then we'll talk more about your background before civic. And also we'll talk more about bitcoin and crypto in general. With so many companies vying for people's attention now, it's important to stand up from the pack.

00:29:54.282 - 00:30:05.790, Speaker A: Learn more and see examples of its work@thinkonramp.com. I'm talking with Vinny lingam, CEO and co founder of civic. So let's go into your background. How did you get in bitcoin?
00:30:06.370 - 00:30:54.086, Speaker B: So when I was running gift, my previous company, and we launched in late 2012, we got hit by a ton of credit card fraud. I mean, thousands of dollars, and in some days, like five grand in a day from people overseas and whatnot. And it was tough because you're a startup and you have a very tight budget. We hadn't raised that much capital. And so we had to figure out, how do we get past all this fraud? Because the more we turn the fraud filters up, the less sales we had and the more problems we would have with customer support. So it was a fine line, trying to balance and making sure chargebacks were not a big issue. And then around January or February of 2012, I think it was January, I started chatting to a friend of mine, one of our advisors, and he was chasing me about bitcoin.
00:30:54.086 - 00:31:05.514, Speaker B: And I kind of heard about it before when I dismissed it, the usual cycle, and the price is back up again. I was like, okay, let me go buy some. So I wound up buying some coins from wensteus, patient zero for bitcoin, silicon valley.
00:31:05.562 - 00:31:08.134, Speaker A: That's Wensis Casaris, CEO of Zappo.
00:31:08.202 - 00:31:38.486, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is back in 2012. And I know Wences for many years because I was part of endeavor, the entrepreneur foundation organization. If you know Wences, he was always on fire about bitcoin. I watched the run up to $255 and watched it crashed down to like 50. This is very exciting and interesting time. Did a bit of trading, made some money, lost some money, kind of broke even in the end, but I was hooked.
00:31:38.486 - 00:32:07.366, Speaker B: Like, this is going to be the next big thing. And I decided to plug bitcoin into gift. And so we worked with tony gallipi from BitPay, and we integrated. And my developers thought I was crazy, my VCs thought I was nuts, and I even had bets. One of my developers, we would have more a $1,000 in sales in the first day, and he didn't believe it. So I want a bottle of wine from him. But we did, and we broke $1,000 in the first day.
00:32:07.366 - 00:33:03.366, Speaker B: And eventually we're doing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month and eventually millions a month in bitcoin sales. When we sold the company in first data, we had grown the business tremendously on the back of bitcoin, but we already started seeing more payments through credit cards and PayPal. And we took something which is really gift is really a crypto community focused product, and we took it mainstream. So in the end, gift probably was doing less than 10% of its total volume on bitcoin. In the beginning, it was doing 95%, but that helped us get all the merchants on board because we had volume, whereas we wouldn't have had volume, just other credit cards. So bitcoin was instrumental actually in getting gift from a niche audience to the mainstream audience, where now it's probably the biggest online gift card site.
00:33:03.468 - 00:33:09.334, Speaker A: Wait, so I'm so confused by that. Like, 95% of the gift cards being bought on gift were being paid for.
00:33:09.372 - 00:33:40.926, Speaker B: With bitcoin initially because we were just targeting the bitcoin community, right? So we had everyone from the bitcoin community coming and using us. And it was a way of spending your bitcoins and going shopping and buying stuff at all the great stores that we had. And it helped us attract more stores because we had this. I'd rather have like 10,000 super loyal, excited, happy customers than millions of people who don't really do much. And so the thing about the crypto community is they're very passionate. And so when they see a great service, they tell their friends, they get involved. And that's kind of why we're doing the same thing with civic.
00:33:40.926 - 00:33:57.590, Speaker B: We want the community to get involved. I want a million crypto enthusiasts to understand the technology and how we're protecting their privacy and their data, telling their friends about it, and taking the product mainstream. So that's why I'm kind of using the lessons I learned from gift in civic and engaging the community on this.
00:33:57.660 - 00:34:05.082, Speaker A: And people basically were they were holding bitcoin and they couldn't spend it at amazon. So what they were doing, or I don't know, who were some of your.
00:34:05.136 - 00:34:11.354, Speaker B: I mean, Amazon, Starbucks, target, we have all these big retailers still do when I say we gift us.
00:34:11.472 - 00:34:16.686, Speaker A: Oh, wow, okay. And so since they wanted to shop at those stores, but they couldn't spend. Oh, I see.
00:34:16.868 - 00:34:28.770, Speaker B: So we opened up 55,000 retail locations to anyone who held a bitcoin, really back in the days. So you could go to any one of the stores, download the gift app, buy a gift card, and we would have zero fraud.
00:34:29.430 - 00:34:31.406, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Right. And no chargebacks.
00:34:31.438 - 00:34:53.606, Speaker B: No chargebacks. And so we were very happy to take the money, and our margins are much higher. And then we introduced loyalty points which incentivize the network even more. And so we built a network effect around that. So we're kind of doing the same thing with tokens in civic. We're giving tokens to reward users and partners and making everyone feel part of the network and so engaging the crypto community with something which they've comfortable with. So tokens, and that's why we're doing the token sale.
00:34:53.606 - 00:35:06.030, Speaker B: So this is a natural evolution of what I learned at gift and applying to civic and already within just announcing the platform and getting out there, the response has been phenomenal.
00:35:06.530 - 00:35:18.582, Speaker A: So let's talk more generally about bitcoin and crypto. I want to talk about your reputation as the bitcoin price oracle. How did you get into the business of bitcoin price prediction?
00:35:18.746 - 00:35:54.790, Speaker B: Well, I never been in the business of price prediction. I kind of got dragged into that part. I mean, I was in the business of giving fundamentals and talking about fundamentals and advice. So when I said at the coin summit conference in 2014, bitcoin had gone up, and I was watching the data from the back end of gifts, and I could see when people spend when they don't spend based upon the price. So I had a lot of insights that I gained from how consumer behavior followed the price. And so when I sat down at this conference, I think it was march or April of 2014, everyone was like punch drunk. Bitcoin was like $800 or whatever it is, 700, $800.
00:35:54.790 - 00:36:37.594, Speaker B: And they all thought it was going to go to 2000 that year. I asked the whole room and everyone said 2000. And the funny thing is, like a year before that, I was at the San Jose bitcoin conference where bitcoin was $100 or something, and everyone thought, it's not going to go up that much. And I said, a thousand. So we hit a thousand the previous year, and I kind of got the wow, vinny how'd, you know? And then I said, okay, well, it's going to go down and it's going to go sideways for a long time until these issues resolve. And I pointed out, I wrote a blog post about the fundamentals of people spending the money, merchant adoption, lack of on ramps, for bitcoin, et cetera, lack of fear to buy bitcoin, et cetera. And so I was able to make predictions based upon market fundamentals, which I understand, which I communicated in my blog post.
00:36:37.594 - 00:37:21.400, Speaker B: And then about twelve to 18 months later, bitcoin kind of bottomed down to the 200s or roundabout there. And then it started climbing back up again. And then I felt that, okay, the fundamentals change again. So I wrote another blog post called bitcoin awakens, and that was about a year ago at about the 450 mark. And I said all the reasons why I think bitcoin will go to over $1,000 in 2016, and basically hit there, I think, within a couple of hours of spare, depending which exchange you look at, was like, by New Year's Eve, $1,000. And along the way, just my tweets, like I was able to call certain false runs of bitcoin getting started and whatnot, and having fun with Ryan Solkas, because they all thought, oh, this is the next week run. And I was like, no it's not.
00:37:21.400 - 00:37:53.546, Speaker B: And I spoke about the Halving and how the effect that would have and how we would go sideways for a while again. So I made a number of good predictions of bitcoin. The one prediction which I made, which can people kind of hold me to, is the fact that at 1250 at the ETF announcement, I said, look, the ETF is not going to happen, which it didn't. And I said, the price is going to tank and it may not recover very quickly. And I had a price target. I said, look, I mean, it was just a target. I was like, look, on the upside, I think bitcoin goes to 2000, or whatever the number was, if the ETFs approved.
00:37:53.546 - 00:38:07.858, Speaker B: But if it doesn't, it's going to tank to like 850. And it dropped down to 880. And I actually thought, it will go below 850. I think maybe it might even stay there. But my prediction was 850. And I get so much shit for not hitting the 850 number. People don't understand that was more directional.
00:38:07.858 - 00:38:13.514, Speaker B: It was like, hey, it's going to go. The fact that it broke 900 went down is like pretty close to my mind.
00:38:13.552 - 00:38:15.002, Speaker A: 870 and 880, if that's fine.
00:38:15.056 - 00:38:21.254, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So then I get a lot of crap on Twitter. I started just muting people because Twitter is not a place for debate.
00:38:21.382 - 00:38:43.102, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. No, it's not. I like to read the threads, but I try not to engage too much. But wait, so I want to ask, when you were saying that you felt like the market fundamentals weren't there in 2014, but then things changed. So what are some of the things that did change about? Was it, I guess, a year ago? What did you see then that you felt like was going to enable the price to rise?
00:38:43.166 - 00:38:47.906, Speaker B: Well, I definitely felt that the halving coming up would have an impact which.
00:38:47.928 - 00:38:52.022, Speaker A: Was like just about a year ago. It was like eleven months ago or something.
00:38:52.076 - 00:38:53.046, Speaker B: July last year.
00:38:53.148 - 00:38:53.794, Speaker A: Oh, July.
00:38:53.842 - 00:39:14.860, Speaker B: Okay. So about a year ago, that would have an impact and would create a spike. There were just a number of other things like global markets, instability. I wrote about currency, commodity, bitcoin, store of value. The one thing I did, I've said to people is that bitcoin moves up too fast. It's going to create bubbles and crashes and people don't want to listen. So we're going to be in that phase again.
00:39:15.490 - 00:39:17.342, Speaker A: So is that what you think is going on now?
00:39:17.396 - 00:39:27.086, Speaker B: Well, first of all, I think that I did not expect bitcoin to go over the 1251 300 mark. And if it did, I knew it would run because that's typically what bitcoin does, in a way.
00:39:27.108 - 00:39:28.126, Speaker A: And you didn't think it would go.
00:39:28.148 - 00:40:07.566, Speaker B: Past I didn't think it go past 1300 this year. Well, until the scaling issue is resolved and the hard focus results. That's why I didn't believe that. And I also believe that by the price being kept lower, that we'd have quicker resolution on the scaling debate, because at some point it's not profitable to keep mining. So I had a whole bit of a limb on that one. But all that happened essentially, was the price kept rising and people don't care about the technical fundamentals of bitcoin. And so now we're in a situation where transactions below $100 don't make any sense because the fees, it's not in a healthy situation, everyone knows that.
00:40:07.566 - 00:40:38.120, Speaker B: So then the alts are coming in and people are running that, and I don't like to see that. Even though bitcoin is not probably double 1250, I publicly sold at 1250 because I felt that was a short term cap. We've had a run, and the reasons for the run, I'm not so sure are necessarily sustainable. But what it did do is it brought confidence back into the market and the broader markets. And now you have people who have no idea what bitcoin is buying bitcoin, and well, I've seen this story play out before, and we'll see how high it goes before it comes back down again.
00:40:38.810 - 00:40:43.110, Speaker A: And so where do you think this investment is coming from? From people who don't really know what's going on.
00:40:43.180 - 00:41:00.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's from and who are they? Well, I mean, I've had tons of friends contact me. They wouldn't know a bitcoin from an ether. They have no idea what they're doing, and they finish. I buy. I'm not giving people advice anymore. I'm just going to sit back and see what happens. And look, the way I look at it is I've always been a level headed, reasonable person through the years.
00:41:00.414 - 00:41:30.146, Speaker B: And when things are out of whack, on the downside, people think I'm crazy. Like bitcoin $1,000. Are you nuts? Bitcoin going up three x. Are you nuts? And everyone's got different personal risk and personal risk and appetite. So when it comes to personal risk and appetite, I mean, I had a ton of my net worth, double digits, sitting in bitcoin at 1250, and I just didn't feel comfortable with the way the world was. And I reduced my holding significantly. I sold 90% of my coins, but what I have left is still a decent amount of money, but for my personal risk appetite.
00:41:30.146 - 00:42:02.398, Speaker B: And now it's effectively doubled at 20%. Whatever it is, it's a decent amount of money. And I'm happy to support bitcoin, but I wasn't comfortable with the price, given the risks. And if you look at, again, the reasons for the run, some of the fundamentals, you've got fiat that can't go into exchanges, you've got all time. I mean, right now, and I think Bitfinex 360% a year interest to lend dollars to people who are going long on bitcoin at some point. This stuff, I saw this happen in 2013 as well, and it happens. And this stuff unwinds.
00:42:02.398 - 00:42:05.630, Speaker B: And so it's kind of like musical chairs and the music stops. If you don't have a chair, you're.
00:42:05.630 - 00:42:10.934, Speaker A: Going to be the bubble is going to pop this year. And what's going to happen?
00:42:10.972 - 00:42:30.940, Speaker B: It may never pop. I mean, it may never pop. The reality is that markets can stay irrational for a long period of time. Look at the traditional financial markets. You've got bonds which are in a bubble with capitals, cheap, worldwide, everything gets inflated. I mean, people in Japan can borrow yen for 0% interest and go buy bitcoin. So what's going to happen? The price keeps going up.
00:42:30.940 - 00:42:51.502, Speaker B: The velocity of price increase is more my concern. The faster it goes up, the faster it can come down. And the other thing which people forget is that when new money comes into the system, these aren't long term holders, they're people coming in to speculate. They're selling their houses and seeing these stories again, just like we did four years ago. And they're putting all their money into bitcoin.
00:42:51.566 - 00:42:51.938, Speaker A: Really?
00:42:52.024 - 00:43:16.730, Speaker B: Yes. And what happens when the price drops 20%? Well, then it drops another 20 or 30% because people panic, sell the market because they're holding too much and now they can't service it. This stuff always ends badly. And so when you look at the market right now, I'm biting my tongue. I'm kind of like half joking. I bought one Ether at $185 because I told the guy next to me, if I buy one at that price, it's going to tank. Right.
00:43:16.730 - 00:43:44.630, Speaker B: Kind of went down. And the market's just irrational, just largely irrational across the board, right? Like Dogecoin is worth $350,000,000 or something right now. Everyone who kind of knows, has been around for a while and knows that this is an irrational market, doesn't mean you can't make money. I think the biggest mistake you make is shorting an irrational market. It's a bad idea. So I'm not shorting, I'm not going long. I'm just sitting back and waiting to see what happens.
00:43:44.630 - 00:44:03.660, Speaker B: There's a lot of good crypto projects out there right now, and these projects will deliver real value, but there's a lot of noise. And if you can't see the noise from the signals, you're going to lose some money. And that's the way it is. And I think people need to learn lessons as well. So instead of me trying to tell people, hey, there's a bubble, watch out, I kind of sit back and let's just see what happens. And again, I could be totally wrong.
00:44:04.590 - 00:44:26.626, Speaker A: But you think there's going to be a correction. Right now, bitcoin is above $2,000. Like 2500? Yeah. So what do you think would be like a more reasonable price and kind of like, what market fundamentals do you look at to kind of gauge what the value should be? And also what risks do you see right now?
00:44:26.728 - 00:44:45.398, Speaker B: It's not a price issue. It's a velocity of value increase. It's the quality of money going into the system versus the no one can argue a lot of money is coming into crypto in the past couple of months. It's the quality of money. Are these people long term? Are they just speculators, running it up?
00:44:45.564 - 00:44:48.390, Speaker A: But what about things like the potential hard fork?
00:44:48.890 - 00:45:06.766, Speaker B: That's the issue. People putting money in, they don't understand this stuff. And so you got people, even bitcoin do understand it, who say, well, a hard fork will be fine. The reality is that even an 80% hard fork is a contentious hard fork. Then you're going to have a split, and then you're going to have roger, who owns bitcoin.com, and BTC.com and whatever else.
00:45:06.766 - 00:45:30.754, Speaker B: And you're going to have two different flavors of bitcoin. And oh, all of a sudden, the whole thesis of bitcoin only has 21 million units. Well, that's probably 42 million, actually. No, it's 63 million because now there's three chains. This is another conversation that you can have with man on the street who just sees the price going up once you buy bitcoins. So this is stuff where bitcoin can go up to 5000 from where it is today. It can double, it can triple.
00:45:30.754 - 00:45:33.670, Speaker B: The fast it happens, the more likely it's going to crash.
00:45:34.010 - 00:45:43.922, Speaker A: And what are the ODS? Do you think of a split in bitcoin where we end up with two coins or three coins much higher than the market's pricing in okay, but you don't want to name ODS?
00:45:43.986 - 00:46:03.626, Speaker B: No, I don't think it's up to I've written blog posts about this. I've said my piece be known as the guy who tried to prevent the bubble, and I failed, clearly, because it's going to happen. And I think it's part of the learning cycle. We have to go through these bubbles. I don't think one man can prevent the market from being irrational. And if the bubble never bursts, then that's great. I'm happy for bitcoin.
00:46:03.626 - 00:46:11.086, Speaker B: I have bitcoins. I'm not going to be complaining about it, but again, I try to be rational.
00:46:11.278 - 00:46:17.206, Speaker A: Okay, so do you think that the ODS of a split are more than 50% or this year? Yeah.
00:46:17.308 - 00:46:17.910, Speaker B: Yes.
00:46:18.060 - 00:46:25.510, Speaker A: Oh, wow. And so if bitcoin does split, which chain do you think will take the greater market share or be considered the real bitcoin?
00:46:29.450 - 00:46:42.982, Speaker B: That one is a very difficult one because when you say consider the real bitcoin by what? By the market? By the price, based on market cap, based upon what fundamentals?
00:46:43.046 - 00:46:44.686, Speaker A: The majority of people in the whole.
00:46:44.708 - 00:46:48.686, Speaker B: World, people in China, people in Japan, people in Korea, people in the US.
00:46:48.788 - 00:46:49.886, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess so.
00:46:49.988 - 00:47:01.730, Speaker B: How do you average it on everybody? Everyone? Well, BitPay themselves have said they would basically have to run two bitcoins at that point.
00:47:01.880 - 00:47:03.954, Speaker A: They'll operate on both chains permanently, though.
00:47:04.072 - 00:47:21.770, Speaker B: Well, for a while. So they would be operating in both chains. It's kind of scary. Right. So from some of the consumer tech background, when you go and buy one bitcoin, you got a gift and you want to go spend the coins there, and now you get told that, oh, we have the wrong bitcoin. This is just not good for business. It's not good for either bitcoin.
00:47:21.770 - 00:47:57.858, Speaker B: A contentious hard fork is the biggest problem we've got right now, and that was my biggest concern. And I think that it's going to happen and the market's not pricing it in. And so the moment the market gets spooked that this is actually going to happen, and the moment it gets closer to actually happening, the more we are going to see the bubble deflate a bit, maybe temporarily, maybe for a while, I don't know. Again, I never gave myself the Oracle name. People call me the Oracle. It's kind of funny. Again, I like to be pretty even killed about these things.
00:47:57.858 - 00:48:20.266, Speaker B: So when sentiment's low, I look like I'm positive, and when sentiment's high, I look like I'm negative. And it's all perspective thing. Right. So let's see. I want to see us get through this year without a contentious hard fork. And if we do, then I've been totally wrong about everything I'm saying. And if we do have a contentious hard fork this year, then people need to realize that.
00:48:20.266 - 00:48:23.546, Speaker B: Again, I was the guy who tried to stop it, but no one listened.
00:48:23.738 - 00:48:36.820, Speaker A: Okay, well, let's talk more generally also about that ICO trend. You kind of like, made a few remarks earlier that sort of give a hint what you think, but so what would you say is your overall opinion of what's going on right now?
00:48:37.510 - 00:49:06.234, Speaker B: Well, look, I think there's a number of it's like the.com days in a sense, right? There's this new thing. People don't quite understand it. Everyone wants a piece of it. It's like they're seeing their friends do it. the.com bubble and burst was really bad for a lot of people in a short space of time, but really good for majority of the world for a long period of time.
00:49:06.234 - 00:49:46.370, Speaker B: And so you got to have the take the good or the bad. And so when I look at it, google raised $25 million during the.com mania. And we have google today, thankfully, for a lot of things, right? And so I think that you will get some companies and some organizations that leverage it well and are able to use this current, call it environment to build amazing services for the world and make a difference long term. And those will more than pay back all the losses and whatever else. But you can get people who are just like.com days got scammed, scammed, and you're going to have these crazy parties that these companies throw in Vegas and burning $5 million in launch parties.
00:49:46.370 - 00:50:20.414, Speaker B: You can have all that crazy stuff happening. Potentially. You also have the problem that people think that because cryptography and technologies are now distributed around the world, that the culture is the same around the world, around building companies and building organizations. It's not. And so the discipline around building tech companies differs from market to market and how people spend money, how they behave, how they act, how they hire, how they fire, how they build these services. Now I think we're a lot more aligned now than we were 20 years ago in terms of the differences between cultures. But these cultures, there are cultural differences across countries.
00:50:20.414 - 00:50:25.460, Speaker B: I mean, I'm South African. I have invest in South Africa. The culture is different there to the US.
00:50:25.990 - 00:50:34.422, Speaker A: Is what you're saying there. You're saying that because for that reason, then the ICOs in different places are some are going to be more scammy or is that what you're saying?
00:50:34.476 - 00:50:35.478, Speaker B: Potentially, yeah.
00:50:35.644 - 00:50:36.118, Speaker A: Okay.
00:50:36.204 - 00:51:20.966, Speaker B: And look at the culture in silicon valley. If founders go out and buy a Ferrari and drive around the streets, I'm not going to point out examples, but they get hit pretty hard, right? So you don't do that in silicon valley. You don't go buy a Ferrari after you get funding or have people walk around in sneakers and t shirts. A lot more understated. And so it really is about the wealth there. But there are other parts of the world where it's like founders will go buy Ferraris and the culture is to go. It's less intellectual, and I'm not saying it's everywhere, and I'm not saying every company is the same, but there are certain cultures that it's not about the good you do in the world, the technology you do in the world.
00:51:20.966 - 00:51:58.734, Speaker B: It's about you as a founder, and if you're single, the car you drive, and the house you have, and the playboy lifestyle. And I see this as I travel around the world and I look at investments and look at the people behind. So the problem with that is that a lot of people around the world are really good at marketing and selling and not as good as a. Technology. Again, not saying Silicon Valley has the monopoly on this. I mean, you've got great companies in every part of the world, but the moment you pull out the bad elements out of certain cultures don't affect the money if you spent well.
00:51:58.852 - 00:52:07.010, Speaker A: Okay. And also so what are some of the things going on in the ICOs right now where you look at that and you're like, I wish people would stop that? What are some of those things?
00:52:07.080 - 00:52:19.670, Speaker B: Well, first of all, founders taking money off the table and through a token sale and ICOs is just nuts. Teams want to take that. I heard a story about that yesterday, and I haven't confirmed it, and that's the case. And now we're ready.
00:52:19.820 - 00:52:24.518, Speaker A: And by that you mean like, not putting some of it just like immediately.
00:52:24.614 - 00:52:26.198, Speaker B: Yeah, into their pockets.
00:52:26.294 - 00:52:26.858, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:52:26.944 - 00:52:50.978, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's a red flag straight away. I think the notion of uncapped token offerings is a bad idea as well. I think that sends the wrong signal. I think the Dutch auction system was bad, I think, in my opinion, but markets kind of rewarded Genosis on that. So be it. Yeah, I think it's about being fair.
00:52:50.978 - 00:53:15.500, Speaker B: I think about both. Like, you have to create the value for everyone in the network. And so it depends. Our goal is to create a network and make sure everyone benefits from the network in many ways, and I don't think everyone else has the same sort of ambition. So some people this is a get rich quicks game. Some people, basically, because they're outside the US. They can do these ICOs under other jurisdictions, and they can take the money and run, and there's nothing you can really do about it.
00:53:15.500 - 00:53:51.510, Speaker B: And so the people and the team and the quality of the work and the track record is very important to me. Not to say that people with no track record should be discarded, I mean, the quality of the work. But I think you got to find the I mean, I think people go from one end to the other. They go from the end of, well, if it's a venture backed company, must be great to if it's not venture backed, it must be crap. Okay. And I think there's a middle ground here. And there's a middle ground where just because a team isn't venture backed or necessarily have experience, that they couldn't be building something amazing.
00:53:51.510 - 00:54:42.674, Speaker B: But there should be some governance structure in place besides those two guys in a room, who's on their team? Do they have some advisors? Do they have a board member? Do they have someone who is going to look over them and help them? Is there some pedigree? Sometimes you can just argue, well, it doesn't matter. But when you're building companies and you're building technology companies and startups and you're working with people and you're hiring, and the way you treat your people is important. The way you build the culture is important, the way you try to be non racist, non prejudicial, like equal opportunity for women, all these things, I think it's important. I think you can't operate in today's society with the same biases that we've had in the past and you've got to be a bit more forward thinking. And sometimes the technologists who sit in the room come up with this stuff. They don't know how to operate these organizations and these businesses. And so you get the situation where and it's changing now, bitcoin has been largely male dominated.
00:54:42.674 - 00:55:00.246, Speaker B: Now, I don't think it's entirely the technology's fault, I think it's just a nature of the people who were into crypto or whatever else, and this technology cycle were largely, largely male, for whatever reason. Call it education society education shapes boys.
00:55:00.278 - 00:55:04.800, Speaker A: Into techie, financial types and girls into not exactly.
00:55:05.170 - 00:55:48.314, Speaker B: So you can't blame the people necessarily. But then it's also upon us to try and bring in diversity into organizations, so we can't say, well, because society created this problem where it's heavily started towards one group, that we can't fix it. So again, culture is important and I think when you're backing a team and you don't know about their views on culture and what they're doing, I like to look at capital as something which I call a conscious capital. So if I invest in something, I kind of want to believe in a team, I want to believe in what their vision is, their values. These are important things to me. Do I want to invest in a team that is well, would I invest in a team that's racist? No. Would I invest in a team that's prejudicial towards a certain group? No.
00:55:48.314 - 00:56:02.286, Speaker B: So why don't we find these facts out? And the only way you do is by getting to know the people and understanding their vision and what they see and their values. And I think it's a lot easier to align values when you know people versus when you're just reading a white paper.
00:56:02.468 - 00:56:07.042, Speaker A: Oh, wow. So that means that it must be pretty difficult to invest in an ICO then.
00:56:07.176 - 00:56:34.886, Speaker B: I think it is, and I don't think it's again, sometimes it's investing, sometimes it's buying tokens. There's certain tokens you can easily buy because of what it is and it's not really linked to the culture of the company. And it's a distributed model, lots of developers, people just want to use the service people. Exactly. So there's lots of reasons for it. But I think I look this as a startup investor and I've done a ton of investing, I've done Shark Tank on Shark Tank. If I don't get a sense of the people, I've got a cultural alignment with my values.
00:56:34.918 - 00:56:46.606, Speaker A: I don't yeah, I actually so we don't have a lot of time left, but I do want to ask you a few remaining questions. So one of them is about Shark Tank. How did you get on that and how has that experience been for you?
00:56:46.708 - 00:57:16.514, Speaker B: So, yeah, that was a great experience. I was invited to be on Dragons Den, which is like the UK and Canadian version of Shark Tank three years ago in South Africa. I went on it, it was a great experience. And then Sony owns the rights to Dragons Den, so they brought out Shark Tank in South Africa and myself and the other Drag game was selected to be sharks as well. So it was great. Shark Tank is one of my favorite TV shows in the US and I've been watching it for years. So I really enjoyed I sit in Mark Cuban's seat and I get to see all these South Africans pitch ideas.
00:57:16.514 - 00:57:47.950, Speaker B: And one of the deals we did was Augmentors, which was on the show, and these guys came and they were trying to figure out how to monetize this thing and I was like, Guys, why don't you just use the blockchain and why don't you create the rarity of these items? They did an ICO and they sold a million dollars worth of tokens and now it's literally up, like the database up 20 X. Again, the market's frothy, to say the least, so everything's up 20 X. But it was interesting that we were able to take something on Shark Tank. I did the first ever bitcoin deal on Shark Tank.
00:57:48.030 - 00:57:48.786, Speaker A: That's great.
00:57:48.888 - 00:57:51.122, Speaker B: And I was wearing my bitcoin socks at the time as well.
00:57:51.176 - 00:57:51.842, Speaker A: Oh, nice.
00:57:51.976 - 00:57:56.754, Speaker B: And so it was a good experience and again, met some interesting people.
00:57:56.872 - 00:58:00.966, Speaker A: What other projects and tokens are you interested mean?
00:58:00.988 - 00:58:41.614, Speaker B: Shark Tank? I kind of had to talk about database and whatever else because it was a TV show broadcast, I couldn't hide the fact that I was behind it. But I actually never talk about what I like and what I don't like publicly because I do have a large audience on Twitter and a large following. So if I say XYZ coin is going to be big, the price will just move and people will buy because I said so and I just don't want to be responsible for that. So I've largely limited my commentary to bitcoin because I can't move the bitcoin price. Trust me, no matter what I say, it's not going to move the bitcoin price, try as I might. So I limited bitcoin and actually ethereum and a little bit. I'm less affair with ethereum than I am obviously bitcoin.
00:58:41.662 - 00:58:44.030, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I wanted to get what's your take on ethereum?
00:58:44.190 - 00:59:09.420, Speaker B: I don't like the unlimited supply. The numbers aren't enough for me. I know they're trying to move to proof of stake, but when it comes, we can have a look at what the supply looks like, then I'm not sure why, if you do the math, that we need so much ethereum out there at that price. And so I'm still trying to get my head around that. So I don't know, it looks bubbish to me. It looks extremely bubbly to me. But again, I could be wrong.
00:59:09.420 - 00:59:31.506, Speaker B: It's hard to call it top as well. You have no idea. If there's irrational demand for a certain item, then it'll go up in price. It's one of those things. And at the end of the day, it needs to be used in the real world. And Ethereum is arguably a better technology. It's got a different use case to Bitcoin, I think.
00:59:31.506 - 00:59:53.318, Speaker B: I think Bitcoin is real long term store of value. I think Ethereum is more of a settlement layer, smart contracts. It's probably closer to what we're trying to do with Civic. So I respect ethereum. And again, price and value are always two things which people don't understand. I don't hate ethereum. I'm just not sure that the price is aligned with the value long term.
00:59:53.414 - 00:59:56.506, Speaker A: Do you have any price predictions for Bitcoin by the end of the year?
00:59:56.688 - 00:59:59.258, Speaker B: My price prediction for end of this year was $3,000.
00:59:59.344 - 00:59:59.690, Speaker A: Okay.
00:59:59.760 - 01:00:03.402, Speaker B: And I did say we should get there as slowly as possible.
01:00:03.536 - 01:00:03.930, Speaker A: Okay.
01:00:04.000 - 01:00:05.110, Speaker B: No one cares.
01:00:05.270 - 01:00:08.574, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll be there in like, a day. We'll see.
01:00:08.612 - 01:00:14.302, Speaker B: But that was the prediction I made last year. And so I think my annual predictions have been spot on for four years now. So we're pretty good.
01:00:14.356 - 01:00:20.306, Speaker A: Well, we'll check back in and see how you did. Okay, well, where can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you?
01:00:20.488 - 01:00:30.866, Speaker B: Vinnylingham.com is my blog. I do a lot of blogging there. I'm at Vinnylingham on Twitter and then Civic.com is my company. So check it out. If you're a developer, get hold of us.
01:00:30.866 - 01:00:49.258, Speaker B: We'd love to figure out how to get you some tokens and get you up and running. And if you're a user, download Civic. We're going to be giving users tokens as well as part of the distribution. So, yeah, just try it out and tell people about it and use it and give us feedback and tell us how to make it better and how we can better protect your data.
01:00:49.424 - 01:00:51.866, Speaker A: Great. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show.
