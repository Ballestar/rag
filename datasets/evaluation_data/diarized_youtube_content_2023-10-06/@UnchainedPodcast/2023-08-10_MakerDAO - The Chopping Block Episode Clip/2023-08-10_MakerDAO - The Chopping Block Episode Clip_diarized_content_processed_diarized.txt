00:00:00.090 - 00:00:37.574, Speaker A: Are going to learn from this. There was another interesting experiment in DeFi that just took place this week which was with MakerDAO. So MakerDAO their stable coins called Dai. There's this yield that Dai pays out called the Dai Savings Rate. The idea is that if you lock up your Dai into this vehicle, call it, which is the Dai Savings rate, you can earn a yield just by just passively sitting on your Dai. There's a few other kind of cute things like chai which basically allows you tokenize die that's sitting in the die savings rate. But basically the die savings rate for the last however long has not been very popular because the amount of yield that the die savings rate was paying was very low.
00:00:37.574 - 00:00:50.842, Speaker A: I believe it was like, what, 1% or sub 1% for a while. And they recently started jacking up that rate. So that rate treasuries obviously now are north of 5%. The die savings rate was up to, was it like two to 3%?
00:00:50.976 - 00:01:03.950, Speaker B: It's like 3.3%. And then recently they started jacking it up, they went up to 8% about like a week ago or a few days ago. And that's kind of what caused this entire sort of situation now, I guess, with the DSR.
00:01:04.610 - 00:01:35.034, Speaker A: Yeah. So basically there's this thing called the enhanced die savings rate, the EDSR. And EDSR is this experiment to what happens if we jack up the interest rate on Dai to 8%. Now, that's a rate that's sort of at the margin as more people start depositing. And very quickly you had, I think, over half a billion dollars of dye minted so they could capture the yield in the EDSR. That yield has come down significantly. Now it's I think closer to 5% as opposed to eight.
00:01:35.034 - 00:02:39.310, Speaker A: But my understanding of this experiment was that it was a way to kind of see if we offer more yield to borrowers. What is the elasticity of demand such that how much more capital are we going to get into the protocol? And more diminted and potentially more liquidity created for our stablecoin just by offering a relatively small amount of yield that we don't have to pay for a super long period of time. And so I think this is in a way MakerDAO kind of experimenting and trying to model out what happens if we start offering one element of the endgame plan for MakerDAO which is this kind of big master plan that involves potentially yield farming. If we start offering additional yield or juicing the Dai yield, what's going to happen to the Dai supply and how can we model that out? And it seems like Maker is sort of poking and trying to see what happens if we do this. And if we do this, we want to make sure that we're being intelligent about how much we're spending on the yield and attracting more deposits and trying to make a play at becoming this super stable coin let's say. Any thoughts on what Maker is doing here?
00:02:39.460 - 00:02:54.850, Speaker C: Well, I think if they really want to go for it, they should just take Anchor's 18% interest rate and start there because 8%, I mean, that's not going to get you the $40 billion of stablecoins.
00:02:55.350 - 00:03:14.262, Speaker A: Well, the difference is that Anchor guaranteed 18% regardless of utilization, which is completely insane. Maker was only offering this for the marginal dollar and as more people came in, the yield went down. Of course, I was being slightly facetious, but just to be clear for the audience, because I think a lot of people would hear that be like, oh, shit.
00:03:14.326 - 00:03:43.490, Speaker D: Yeah, it is very true. That one thing I've realized being in Crypto for the last five years is there are still lots of people I talk to who don't know the difference between USDC, Dai and UST. And they're all just like, oh, they're all stable coins, all bad, all like there's no nuance to splitting them into good basket. Bad. It is. It is kind of funny. I think the idea of doing these elasticity experiments is interesting.
00:03:43.490 - 00:04:32.434, Speaker D: Although I think this one was kind of obvious that it was going to be dominated by large players because the key metric is the spread between borrowing against your die versus sort of minting new die. So the idea is like, hey, look, if I can borrow die and pay 3% and then I can use that to create new die and earn 8%, there's this 5% spread and I can recursively do that a bunch of times. I think the end game's goals were not necessarily to reward the largest holders, but of course, just structurally such incentives generally tend to be harder to capture for the smaller users. So it's interesting to see they're already kind of changing and we'll see what the outcome of this experiment is.
00:04:32.552 - 00:05:14.098, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels kind of like a wash. Like basically the amount of dye in circulation went up by almost exactly the amount of incremental dye that was added to the DSR. So it was definitely like Tour. And so you have these whales who come in, see this carry trade where you can borrow die at three 4%, deposit it and then 8%. And I think the idea is not wrong, right? It's sort of like a bank offering, like an interruptory rate that obviously goes away after a period of time, but it's not really having the intended outcome of actually introducing meaningful incremental demand for Dai and sort of people actually being able to treat this like a savings account in some way.
00:05:14.264 - 00:06:02.430, Speaker A: Yeah, it does appear like the financialization of Dai is mostly going to appeal to smart traders or going to arbit away pretty quick. That said, I don't know if this was the intended effect, but it did get a lot of eyeballs with the headlines of oh my God, Dai is offering 8%. I don't know if that's good or bad because I think for most people it's pretty obvious that that's a negative interest rate margin for Dai. For some people they might be like, oh, maybe I should start paying more attention to the Maker die ecosystem. I think for some people it's like, oh God, I guess we didn't learn any lessons from 2021. So I'm a little bit mixed about whether even just like the headline of whether or not it's a short lived experiment. The headline of Dai is offering 8% now in the DSR is actually good or bad net for DFI.
00:06:04.210 - 00:06:59.234, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I think a lot of people have PTSD to Terra and Anchor and anytime you say stablecoin or any yield related to a stablecoin, they kind of flash back to that. I think the DSR is also, I think, kind of strange. The end goal is, right, you want this to be an actual currency that is accepted, that people use, that they save in, that they engage in commerce in, and that's really only possible if it's liquid and people actually use it and it's out in the world and there's demand for it with the DSR. Yeah, they have chai, which is sort of this wrapper on top of the DSR that creates a tokenized version of your deposit. But the Dai in the DSR isn't out there in the world, right? If all the dye were in the DSR, it wouldn't really be a very good stablecoin because it would just be locked in this contract and not really tradable. And if you sort of split it between Chi and Dai, then they're not really liquid either.
00:06:59.234 - 00:07:10.406, Speaker B: And so I understand sort of the incentive, but think from a product perspective, it's just not super usable. It doesn't have the right ergonomics for what I think maker is trying to do with it.
00:07:10.588 - 00:08:09.878, Speaker A: It seems like the DSR, it's kind of like the risk free rate or something in DeFi where if the DSR increases, it kind of forces interest rates everywhere to follow in mean, it's not literally risk free for obvious reasons. I mean, it's tied to a particular DeFi protocol, but it seems to have that effect in some way on the yields across DeFi. And it's interesting because I haven't thought about this very much. So I'm curious, Robert Tarune, how you think about this. But to Tom's point, if you raise the rates of the DSR, right, it basically kind of incentivizes people to create Dai, but then kind of lock it up. So essentially just like lock up ether or lock up whatever they're minting Dai with USDC whatever and just have it sit there and do nothing. Whereas if you just instead lowered the interest rate on vaults, you kind of have the same effect, but you increase the circulating die instead of increasing the amount of collateral that's just sitting there doing nothing.
00:08:09.878 - 00:08:14.326, Speaker A: So why would you want to increase the DSR and not just lower the interest rate on vaults?
00:08:14.518 - 00:08:48.022, Speaker C: Well, I think you could. I think at the end of the day, what they're creating is a system in which interest passes from those who are borrowing to those who own the asset. And it really should be the same roughly to increase the interest rate that you're paying or lower the interest rate that you're charging to get to the same equilibrium supply and demand dynamics, roughly. But I think in this case, because the savings rate is so low, it just makes more sense to start on that side.
00:08:48.156 - 00:09:46.006, Speaker D: One tiny thing to note in that regard is interest rates are strictly positive numbers and so they're sort of going down has slightly higher you could think of as higher weight than going up if you have equiprobable ups and downs. Partially this comes from the fact that sort of like the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean. Maybe that's too much of in the weeds on this. But the idea is when I'm looking at things that are ratios and I can only go to zero, like zero is a point of infinity and infinity. I'm always a finite distance from zero, but I'm always an infinite distance from the maximum possible rate. So I'm sort of like biased. And so that sort of means that your lever going down, which is sort of the collection rate is less effective than the increase rate in some way.
00:09:46.006 - 00:10:06.160, Speaker D: It's like less elastic, which is why you might see the experiment behave better by doing increase the interest rate paid by 10% versus decrease the borrower cost by 10%. It's unfortunately this like tiny there is some tiny bias to those two, but with technical detail.
00:10:06.770 - 00:10:41.750, Speaker B: Yeah, this Monet supply who's involved in maker governance talks about this sometimes of know, there's sort of this mental model of how we think maker works, how we think DeFi works of market is very efficient. Capital is very fluid. People move to normalize rates across different venues. In practice, it's actually not that elastic. When you actually adjust interest rates, a lot of people still stick around. They don't even realize that the rates are moving. There's a lot of lag and it's not quite as responsive as you would imagine it would be in a truly sort of efficient, optimal market.
00:10:41.750 - 00:10:44.950, Speaker B: So maybe some evidence to Turin's point.
00:10:45.100 - 00:10:51.402, Speaker A: Believe we just need more AIS involved in this process who are making all these decisions for us instead of human beings.
00:10:51.546 - 00:10:56.400, Speaker D: Well, I hear the AI Hype has taken a summer vacation a little bit.
00:10:56.770 - 00:10:57.920, Speaker A: Is that right?
00:10:58.290 - 00:11:02.140, Speaker D: At least that's what the API and Views numbers.
