00:00:00.810 - 00:00:53.760, Speaker A: I have a lot of theories you can argue some of them are conspiracy theories in some way. So there's two trains of thought here, right? Either BlackRock knows something and thinks there's an avenue here and they know and they found a little narrow way to get through and they think Gensler is going to waver a bit on what's going on, or they just think they have a narrow way and they're filing for the chance anyway. So we'll start with that second one first. Even if the ODS I've said this on multiple occasions, but even if the ODS of spot bitcoin ETF approval for ishares being first are like 10%, right? Even if they view the ODS as pretty low of them getting approval based on the fact that the SEC has a lot of experience denying spot bitcoin ETFs the chance that maybe we think we can get through and be the first is critical. I mean, it's significant money. We saw bito, the bitcoin futures, ETF. The first one, the launch, that thing took in a billion and a half dollars in two days.
00:00:53.760 - 00:00:58.890, Speaker A: You're charging fees on that. Obviously that's significant money even for somebody like Rock.
