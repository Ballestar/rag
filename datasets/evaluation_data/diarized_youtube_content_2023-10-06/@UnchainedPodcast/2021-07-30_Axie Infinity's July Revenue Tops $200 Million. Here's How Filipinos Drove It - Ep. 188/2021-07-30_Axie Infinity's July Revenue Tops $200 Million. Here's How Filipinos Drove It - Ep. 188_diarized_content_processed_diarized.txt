00:01:33.014 - 00:01:36.022, Speaker A: Play to Earn NFT Gaming in the Philippines.
00:01:36.166 - 00:01:37.450, Speaker C: Welcome, Leah.
00:01:37.950 - 00:01:38.646, Speaker B: Hi, Laura.
00:01:38.678 - 00:01:39.914, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:40.112 - 00:01:46.250, Speaker A: You made a documentary about Filipinos who are earning money playing Axio Infinity. What did you find in making the film?
00:01:46.410 - 00:02:41.886, Speaker C: Yeah, so we launched this documentary in May 2021, but it was actually filmed in January, and the story goes back before that time. It originated from a CoinDesk article that I wrote in August 2020 about a community in a place called Cabanatuan City. It's a very provincial place in the Philippines. It's known for its rice fields and thousands of trike drivers, which is kind of like the Filipino equivalent of a taxi driver, except they drive a motorbike. And I got wind of this story of about 100 people on a street in this rural area that was playing this incredibly complex blockchain game amid the COVID-19 lockdowns. And the money that they earned from it, they were using to put food on the table. I thought it kind of sounded too good to be true, so I had to investigate, and it turned out to be very true.
00:02:41.886 - 00:03:32.110, Speaker C: Wrote this story, published it on CoinDesk in August, and I've actually seen lots of really interesting trends about crypto adoption in the Philippines. I've written about libra and Remittances, all sorts of stuff, but this Axie Infinity story really took off. And I think it was people in emerging economies that kind of share similar sorts of demographics in terms of what was happening in the Philippines amid the lockdowns. They were stuck at home, they had no income, they were struggling to support their families, and yet they had a mobile phone and an Internet connection. So yeah wrote this story. It sort of started to take off. And it wasn't until December later that year that I got a call from Gabby DieSon at Yield Guild Games, and he know this story that you wrote, it's kind of really hit a nerve.
00:03:32.110 - 00:04:05.686, Speaker C: What if we turned it into a video? And look, I've never made a documentary before, but I was kind of thinking, ALPA, how hard could it be? Yeah, let's do that. So the whole point of the documentary was that we actually went out to Nueva ASEA, where these people live, tracked them down, visited them at their homes, learned their backstories, and we wanted to give them a platform to be able to share to the rest of the world this amazing experience that they'd had with an acute blockchain game with digital pets.
00:04:05.878 - 00:04:12.830, Speaker A: How did such a rural area stumble upon this game? And why was it that one street?
00:04:13.330 - 00:05:23.650, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think it's important to kind of understand the context of the in fasus consulting. We're really interested in Southeast Asia and how a lot of growth can come from here in terms of leapfrog innovation and new technologies. But in the Philippines, it's a really perfect environment for that sort of stuff because you've got a population that is English speaking, they're super tech savvy, they spend more time on social media than anyone else in the entire world, and they love games. So I don't think it's any surprise that this population kind of gravitated toward this idea of a cute, fun game that could make money. I guess it started to take off during the lockdown through word of mouth, really, and through community network effects, which I guess a lot of people talk about in crypto in terms of educating each other and bringing each other along the journey. But I'd never really seen it, in effect, like this. So, yeah, it was literally just friends and family helping each other learn how to play this game, learn how to earn these tokens, and eventually cash out and turn it into food on the table.
00:05:24.470 - 00:05:33.590, Speaker A: And so when you say that, what kind of money were they earning in terms of what they could earn through normal jobs?
00:05:34.410 - 00:06:21.590, Speaker C: That's a really important question to kind of be contextualized in terms of the growth of the game, I think. So SLP, which is small love potion, the token that can be earned within the game, the price of it is super volatile. So earlier this year it was at like one cent, and recently it was spiking well over think it even went over some point. So there's a huge spectrum there in terms of what people can earn. And early on in the days too, there were very few caps in terms of how much SLP you could earn in the game. So you literally had people who were taking it in shifts, playing around the clock, kind of looking like bots on the system. Just to earn as much SLP as possible because it was a better earning opportunity than what they had here in the Philippines on the ground.
00:06:21.590 - 00:06:52.906, Speaker C: But in effect so what I saw was that in the early days, this was like mid 2020, people were earning sort of around 10,000 pesos a week. If they were top players, that's sort of around 400 USD a month. Back then. I think a lot of people in western economies might sort of think, oh, that's not really that much like $400 a month. But over here it's well above minimum wage and often for a lot of people, a lot more than they were earning even before they went into the lockdown.
00:06:53.098 - 00:06:54.080, Speaker B: Oh wow.
00:06:55.030 - 00:07:12.440, Speaker A: Okay. So if they're earning more than they could with a regular job, that makes total sense. Why wouldn't you just play a video game instead? So they earn this small love potion, or I think now it's called smooth love potion. How did they then turn those game earnings into cash?
00:07:13.610 - 00:08:06.002, Speaker C: So back then it was quite difficult. You would need to swap your SLP for ethereum on a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap. And then in the Philippines, there's actually a really sophisticated on and off ramps network. So over here, if you want to buy Bitcoin for example, you could actually go to a local 711 or your supermarket and deposit cash to be able to get crypto out. So that kind of facilitated the ability to be able to swap your SLP for, say, ethereum and then send it to another exchange which would provide this off ramps ability. A lot of people in the early days were using coins PH, which is a very well known exchange. It's very popular with consumers and often a place that people go to first when they're new to crypto.
00:08:06.002 - 00:08:52.710, Speaker C: But it's actually moved on from there. So we're seeing so much demand now for trade volume in terms of this token in the Philippines that some exchanges are actually offering a direct SLP to Philippine pezo trading. Like it's insane. This in game token is so in demand that you've got central bank licensed exchanges in the Philippines that will do direct swap. Examples are so Bloom X, they do an OTC deal, they really know their customers, so they actually do it via Facebook messenger. Pretty much every Filipino is on Facebook, so that's a great option for them there. But just recently, finance P to P started doing a direct swap as well.
00:08:52.710 - 00:08:57.640, Speaker C: So I think that's kind of a reflection in terms of how much this is taking off here.
00:08:58.430 - 00:09:07.660, Speaker A: And so if in the beginning it was just that one street in that small rural town, how big would you say axie Infinity is in the Philippines now?
00:09:08.990 - 00:09:52.470, Speaker C: So I do actually know the stats for that. So I recently checked in with Jiho, who's the head of growth at Axie Infinity, to ask him exactly this because I wanted to know how much it had grown since I wrote that very first article in August last year. What I didn't know was that back then, axi had less than 500 daily active users, and today it's well over half a million. And we're not even one year later. Now, in terms of where they're coming from, they do have a global audience, but it's expected that at least sort of 50% to 60% of them are from the Philippines. So it certainly has a huge player base here. And I guess in terms of impact, this is kind of a segue.
00:09:52.470 - 00:10:21.780, Speaker C: But if you look at something like El Salvador, which has just taken on bitcoin in terms of legal tender that originated from a rural community in El Salvador, bitcoin beach, that was using bitcoin and demonstrating its use case. So I guess this is where I get really excited about the power of rural communities to really kind of control these conversations and have huge impact in terms of decisions and actions that are taken at a very high level.
00:10:22.470 - 00:10:31.190, Speaker A: But has it expanded out from the rural areas in the Philippines to cities as well, or is it still a rural phenomenon?
00:10:31.850 - 00:11:08.850, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's really popular in the rural areas just because it does give people access to income generation. That is very hard to come by in those areas. Most people who are in rural areas, they don't have a lot of options, particularly in the fallout of the pandemic, which the Philippines is still very much struggling with. Most people have lost their jobs overseas. Filipino workers have been repatriated, and they come home to a place that didn't really have enough jobs or high enough wages before they left. So people are looking for better ways to be able to earn money.
00:11:08.850 - 00:11:34.490, Speaker C: But that rhetoric, I think, is kind of exciting to anyone. I guess what I hear is that anyone who hears what a fun game that I can make money off, they're kind of interested to learn more. And I guess I've got friends in Australia who are playing it and getting excited that they made $50 off playing a game this week. So it definitely resonates well beyond just the Philippines in terms of provincial areas.
00:11:35.470 - 00:11:44.480, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to discuss a little bit more some of the recent developments around Axio infinity. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:11:45.490 - 00:12:32.330, Speaker B: Did you know nearly $338,000,000 worth of NFTs were sent last year? And in 2021, that number is growing faster than ever. If you're looking to make your first NFT, check out Near's. Fast, scalable, low cost, open source platform. Near is investing 80 million near tokens in communityled projects over the course of five years to power sustainable innovation through its ecosystem.

The Oasis Network is the first privacy enabled blockchain platform for open finance and a responsible data economy.
00:12:32.330 - 00:13:02.230, Speaker B: Combined with its high throughput and secure architecture, the Oasis Network is able to power private scalable DeFi, revolutionizing open finance and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market. Its unique privacy features can not only redefine DeFi, but also create a new type of digital asset called tokenized data that can enable users to take control of the data they generate and earn rewards for staking it with applications, creating the first ever responsible data economy.
00:13:03.050 - 00:13:26.750, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Leah callan butler. So we were talking about how Axie Infinity has grown in terms of its users. Can you give me a sense in the Philippines what the demographics are of the groups that are know? So obviously, as you said, it's pretty popular in the rural areas, but can you give me any other idea of who is playing?
00:13:27.570 - 00:14:30.962, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this is probably one of the most interesting things about the Play to Earn movement in general, that it appears to be attracting a completely different customer segment or user base than what people would expect of both crypto and gaming. So you would have seen in the Play to Earn mini documentary that there were two particular demographics that I think have really resonated with people. Firstly, Lola and Lolo, this adorable elderly couple who, because they're in the high risk category during the COVID-19 Lockdowns, they were isolated, bored, without an income. They used to run a Sari sari store, which is kind of like a convenience store in the Philippines, but they're everywhere and they were used to making a fair living from that store. But while everyone was locked down, of course they weren't making anything. They learned about the game through neighbors and they became completely addicted to it. What I heard from them was that they loved the idea that they could earn money from it and that was great.
00:14:30.962 - 00:15:03.322, Speaker C: They use it to supplement things like buying medicines. They said, we're old people, we have lots of medicines. But they also said that it was kind of this element of escapism. Like, think about it. You're a 75 year old man, you're stuck at home, you're missing your family, you can't go to church like you used to every weekend, and you don't know when this nightmare is going to end. They actually told me that the Lockdowns were worse than what they remembered going through in terms of the Marcos era in the Philippines. So it was really, really a tough time for them.
00:15:03.322 - 00:15:32.614, Speaker C: But they found this game and it gave them this joy and delight and I guess something to go to each day, which the interesting thing was, I said, oh, so what other mobile games do you play? And they were like, none. Almost like that was a ridiculous question to ask. What do you mean other games. So I think that's one, nobody expected to see an elderly couple playing a blockchain game. But then there's also other ones like Sabrina. She's a mother of two and she lost her job. She was working in a bar.
00:15:32.614 - 00:16:21.910, Speaker C: As her savings were dwindling, she was wondering what to do, and she decided to use her last money in all the world to invest in three NFTs. At the time, I believe they were sort of around $5 to get started with a team. And when that's your last money in the world, that's a massive risk. But she earned the money back within a month and then started actually making profits off that and was able to spend it on things like digital devices and an Internet connection so that her kids could do homeschooling. So I think the interesting thing about this movement is that people are playing these games not for the same reasons that they would go and pick up a traditional video game in a store. And perhaps they weren't even part of that market at all before. So it's definitely attracting a totally new persona.
00:16:22.410 - 00:16:44.220, Speaker A: And so at the same time, as you mentioned, axie Infinity has become quite popular. And so the cost of getting started in the game has increased. So since it is still popular amongst this rural population, how have Filipinos that are getting started in the game managed to buy in?
00:16:45.230 - 00:16:45.980, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:48.050 - 00:17:47.422, Speaker C: I kind of feel like because we're here and in the thick of it, we hear of it all the time and I think it's normal, but I think the rest of the world hasn't really heard about this innovation yet. But there's a particular thing in Axie Infinity that allows you to loan your Axie team to another person for a designated period of time. And the reason is because your crypto wallet is actually separate to the gaming account, whereas most NFT games are inextricably linked to the crypto wallet. So you're not going to give out your seed phrase to someone, but you would provide the Axie Infinity QR code to allow someone to log in and use your team for a short period of time. So what happened over here was that there were some sort of community OGS that just loved the game, and they were breeding in the same way that people would breed crypto kitties, they were breeding axes. And some people ended up with like hundreds, if not thousands of them just because they loved it. And that's a lot more NFTs than they could realistically play in the game.
00:17:47.422 - 00:19:02.342, Speaker C: So when they saw other people who were like, well, I want to try, but I don't really want to spend any money up front, they would say, well, why don't you just loan one of my teams, see how you like it, and if you enjoy it, then we'll go from there. That was actually a really popular thing that people started doing and I guess a lot of the people who were doing it, such as I'm sure you've heard of Gabby Dizon from Yield Guild Games. He was kind of doing it with his own personal collection. And what he found was that after loaning his NFTs to other people, they would very quickly earn enough from the reward tokens within the game to be able to buy their own teams. So it was almost kind of like graduating from borrowing someone else's to becoming an owner of your own NFTs where you were either unable or unwilling in the first place. And that has become more formalized as we've gone along, I guess, particularly with the demand within the market as people have found out about this game, everyone wants in and there's just not enough in game assets to go around. So the idea of a scholarship emerged where people would loan or rent their in game assets and they split the earnings.
00:19:02.342 - 00:19:29.970, Speaker C: So it's essentially, I guess, like an uncollateralized loan of an NFT asset that people can generate yield from and they go from there. And what we've seen is a lot of people can actually improve their economic status from being able to access that opportunity. But if the community hadn't kind of come up with this new solution that is scholarships, they never would have been able to get into the game in the first place due to the high cost of the NFTs.
00:19:30.470 - 00:19:31.806, Speaker A: And what is the split?
00:19:31.838 - 00:19:37.300, Speaker C: Typically the high cost of getting know.
00:19:37.930 - 00:19:46.520, Speaker A: The split between the Axe University or whoever is lending the NFTs out versus who's borrowing them.
00:19:47.950 - 00:20:37.414, Speaker C: It's a tricky question. There are different splits, so there's everything from quite formalized player guilds like Yield Guild Games. So their split is they provide 70% to the player, so they get the biggest cut. 20% goes to the community manager. And the community managers are people who they recruit players, and then they kind of invest in educating them and getting them up to speed so they can actually play the game because there's a lot to learn. And then 10% goes back to Yield Guild and that's to cover things like the cost of managing the assets, transaction fees, stuff like that. And full disclosure, I worked directly with YGG and they funded the mini documentary, but there are other scholarships as well and everyone kind of has a different approach to it.
00:20:37.414 - 00:21:17.078, Speaker C: And I guess this is what's interesting. It's a market that is still developing and the business model is still kind of being sounded out. There's some criticisms of some models that they don't give enough back to the player and honestly, in my opinion, that's a bit of a problem too because there's just such high demand for scholarships right now. A lot of people are willing to take a not so great deal in terms of the earnings they can make from their scholarship just because they're desperate to get into the game. So it'll be good to see that mature a little bit and see the community kind of weed out some of the less than ideal scholarships, I think. Yeah.
00:21:17.164 - 00:21:49.440, Speaker A: Well, an interesting development this week was that Yield Guild Games's original decks offering, initial Dex offering on SushiSwap's Miso platform sold out in less than a minute, and it was bought up by 32 wallets. So I think perhaps some of those actually were wallets that represented a number of players, although I'm not entirely sure about that. But what's your sense of what happened there and how that kind of situation? If it really is just whales who bought those tokens, how that might affect the game?
00:21:50.690 - 00:22:26.038, Speaker C: I think the best person to talk about that would be the founders of Yield Guild. I work directly with them, but I just manage. So I'm not the perfect person. But in my independent opinion, I think it's important to kind of put it into perspective. Yield Guild really wanted to work with Mizo, which is the sale platform by SushiSwap, and they didn't have a cap on how much purchases could take in the public auction. So it did sell out in 31 seconds to 32 wallets, but it was only 2.5% of their total token supply.
00:22:26.038 - 00:23:18.534, Speaker C: So it's quite a small amount, and I totally understand people's perspective on it, but in the coming weeks, I'd say watch it, because they've got actually 45% of their token allocation earmarked for community rewards. So that's their goal, to actually give back to the community. They'll be airdropping existing members of the guild to reward them for their participation already. And then also people who are joining now, they'll be providing sort of reward systems that they'll be able to earn tokens rather than buy them. So, look, I guess it's a bit of a different model than most people would go by. And I think the criticism at the moment is that they're not community focused, but I do think they have a North Star that they're headed toward. And this is definitely on track, but definitely watch out for the community AirDrop and rewards programs.
00:23:18.534 - 00:23:22.430, Speaker C: I think that's going to be much more interesting and is almost half of their token supply.
00:23:23.650 - 00:23:49.526, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been such a fascinating conversation. I'm so glad that we were able to learn more about the real world impact of crypto on a pretty unlikely demographic. I think that's something that's often talked know, helping people in developing countries or helping the underprivileged, and yet it rarely happens. So it was very fascinating learning about this case. Thank you so much.
00:23:49.708 - 00:23:51.974, Speaker C: Thanks for taking an interest in what's happening over here.

First Headline Uniswap Labs restricts certain tokens Last Friday, Uniswap Labs decided to restrict access for over 100 tokens through its user interface. Delisted were a range of synthetic assets, tokenized stocks, mirror stocks, options and derivatives.
00:24:58.022 - 00:25:45.334, Speaker B: The company cited the quote evolving regulatory landscape in its explanation of the cuts. Because Uniswap is a decentralized protocol, Uniswap Labs can only restrict tokens through its own interface. Users can still interact with the protocol through other portals. The distinction is significant uniswap the protocol is unaffected as it exists as a decentralized permissionless smart contract running on ethereum Uniswap. The app, however, is controlled by Uniswap Labs, which is separate from the protocol. Defining itself as a quote, software development studio that contributes to the Uniswap protocol, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams put it best on Twitter Just a reminder Uniswap protocol equals fully decentralized permissionless smart contracts on Ethereum. Uniswap interface equals open source GPL or general public licensed codebase app Uniswap.org
00:25:45.334 - 00:26:31.606, Speaker B: equals Uniswap Labs owned domain that points to an IPFS hosted instance of the Uniswap interface. Notably, Uniswap Labs'announcement comes soon after securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler hinted that digital assets backed by traditional securities could fall under US. Securities law. Next Headline A new infrastructure bill looks to raise $28 billion through crypto taxes in the latest version of the Bipartisan infrastructure plan in the US, policymakers have proposed to raise an additional $28 billion through crypto taxes. These funds would be funneled into a larger $550,000,000,000 investment into the country's transportation and infrastructure. As part of the bill, reporting rules would tighten, with US. Businesses being obligated to report any transaction over $10,000 to the IRS.
00:26:31.606 - 00:27:19.886, Speaker B: Kristen Smith, executive director of the blockchain association, told CoinDesk. Quote, we interpret this to mean software wallet developers, hardware wallet manufacturers, multisig service providers, liquidity providers, Dow, token holders, and potentially even miners. In other regulatory news, representative Don Byer introduced the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act on Thursday. The Bloc reports that the bill quote, seeks to delineate the treatment of crypto assets under five securities acts the Commodity Exchange Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, as well as Federal Reserve treatment of stablecoins and possible digital legal tender. Next headline. Finance cuts leverage and Nonkyc withdrawal limits. Finance is moving at light speed to address increasing regulatory scrutiny.
00:27:19.886 - 00:28:18.090, Speaker B: The exchange revealed over the weekend that it has begun lowering its futures trading leverage limit to 20 x. It previously had an infamous offering of 125 x.
