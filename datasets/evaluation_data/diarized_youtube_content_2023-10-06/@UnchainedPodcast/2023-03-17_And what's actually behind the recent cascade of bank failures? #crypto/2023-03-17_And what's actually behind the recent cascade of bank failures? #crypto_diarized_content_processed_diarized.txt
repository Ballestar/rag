00:00:00.330 - 00:00:28.002, Speaker A: I believe what tripped them up was the yield seekers weren't paying attention to rising yields through two, three, 4%. They thought that money was stable, wasn't going to go anywhere. At five, the floodgates opened and everybody started leaving. And like, wait a minute, wait a minute. Over here. The yield seekers are leaving now, and my tech guys are leaving, and my crypto guys are leaving, and they all want their money today at noon. I couldn't I couldn't meet those obligations.
00:00:28.002 - 00:00:50.170, Speaker A: And that's why I think that they were forced. What I'm describing is why all this led to, say, silicon Valley Bank, a week ago Wednesday, had to sell $40 billion worth of securities and realized a $1.8 billion loss. And then their stock fell 60%. And then there was a panic, and then everybody started to run for the It's.
