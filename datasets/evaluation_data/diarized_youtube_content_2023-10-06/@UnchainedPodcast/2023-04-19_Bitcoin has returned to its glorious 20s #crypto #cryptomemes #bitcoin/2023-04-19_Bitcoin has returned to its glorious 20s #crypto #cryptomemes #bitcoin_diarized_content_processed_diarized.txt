00:00:00.330 - 00:00:29.478, Speaker A: Following a massive selloff, bitcoin is back under 30, which means Hollywood could technically cast it to play a teenager after an increase in bitcoin's price last week. People are calling this a correction, which is a wonderfully subjective term. Babe, I'm not breaking up with you. I'm just correcting my life by ending this relationship. But crypto traders stayed optimistic because, of course, they did. Dips are gifts. Really? Tell that to my brother who said that the spinach and artichoke one was cheap for a wedding present.
00:00:29.478 - 00:00:56.506, Speaker A: I removed the price tag. I do feel like describing this particular chart as beautiful is offensive to actual artists. Honestly, the last week of bitcoin prices looks like you asked a two year old to draw a straight line. So why the drop? While people are citing a sell order from finance, they're also citing UK inflation numbers. But personally, I think it's the fact that 420 is right around the corner. All those bitcoin holders are selling off their bitcoin to get cash to buy weed. It's too bad you can't use cryptocurrencies for drugs.
00:00:56.506 - 00:00:57.180, Speaker A: Oh, wait.
