00:00:54.938 - 00:00:56.266, Speaker A: Welcome, Larry.
00:00:56.458 - 00:00:58.158, Speaker B: Hey, happy to be here.
00:00:58.324 - 00:01:07.870, Speaker A: This week, Coinbase dropped its first quarter earnings ahead of its direct listing next Wednesday, April 14. What were your big takeaways from the Q One results?
00:01:08.370 - 00:01:29.320, Speaker B: Sure. I mean, there are a few things. I think almost everyone expected that the revenue numbers would just be much better than they were in the previous quarter. But still, I think almost everyone was shocked by the $1.8 billion figure. Even I expected slightly less. I think I was projecting something like 1.45.
00:01:29.320 - 00:02:02.434, Speaker B: But I think mainly just people outside of crypto that don't really know how the revenues are tied to volumes and how crazy the Q One has been. I think those have been the ones that have been the most kind of shocked about this. And I think it opened a lot of eyes for a lot of people. And I think that was the intention from Coinbase to publish this right before they actually list, because they had the best quarter ever by far, and they outperformed the entire last year by like 0.5 billion. So that was really the biggest takeaway. But there were a few other ones.
00:02:02.434 - 00:02:36.830, Speaker B: And another crazy one is the amount of money that they actually custody on Coinbase. I think it's like 230,000,000,000. And if you look at the total market cap of everything in crypto, it's about 2 trillion right now. So you have like 10% of all the assets custody by one company. And I think that by itself, I mean, that's the figure that impressed me the most. I was just quite shocked by that, especially if you compare that to the growth from the previous quarter as well. I think back then it was at least half of that.
00:02:36.830 - 00:03:12.266, Speaker B: And so that number has grown significantly. And you can just see how large Coinbase is growing, just not from trading fees, but also the custody business. And I think that was quite impressive. And not only that, but then you look at the institutional split and you find that now it's $122,000,000,000 of institutional money custody on Coinbase and that grew from 45 billion. So almost three X there. So I think these were really the biggest takeaways for me. And overall, I just think, like a really solid growth, really great results, EBITDA was really healthy as well.
00:03:12.266 - 00:03:45.294, Speaker B: And also one last thing I'll add is that they also grew the number of users significantly. So it was 6.1 million monthly transacting users. So users that actually ended up making a transaction that month. And that's up from, I think, around 3 million in the previous quarter. Yeah, it's absolutely crazy how many people have joined. And I think that kind of goes to show that really in Q One, we've seen a massive change in the dynamic of the market, where Q Four, it was largely driven by institutions.
00:03:45.294 - 00:04:14.330, Speaker B: And we saw this from the S One and Coinbase filed as well. I think only like 30% or something of volume was coming from retail customers. That has definitely picked up, even though Coinbase didn't disclose that yet, that has definitely picked up significantly. You can just see that from the crazy increase in the number of transacting users. So I think that dynamic shift is interesting, where initially it was an institutionally driven market and now we have a lot of retail piling in as the price is reaching new highs.
00:04:14.490 - 00:04:52.230, Speaker A: Yeah, one other thing that jumped out at me is something that I had discussed with Jeff Roberts here on the show. He's the executive editor at Decrypt who wrote a book on Coinbase called Kings of Crypto. And he and I had last, when he was last on the show, discussed how Coinbase's revenue across its whole history has really relied on transaction revenue. But in these results, Coinbase meaningfully increased its non transaction revenue, which, compared to the S One that it released in February, showed, I think, for me, quite a shift. So to your mind, how do you think Coinbase made that shift?
00:04:52.810 - 00:05:45.018, Speaker B: It's just like we saw that with Tesla and with a lot of companies joining and a lot of that revenue is coming from institutions. So that's not necessarily just transaction volume, but it's also just custody fees and it's just charging these companies more money for other things as well. And they have multiple different business sites. But even though it decreased slightly, it's still incredibly reliant on the volume. I think it was still more than 80%, but it's definitely healthy to see Coinbase grow in this direction. I think the biggest worry, though, for Coinbase is that even though the revenue is getting a little bit more diversified, it still relies 100% on how the market obviously will perform. So I think one risk that maybe traditional investors are not realizing as much is that if bitcoin were to go down like 20 or 30%, it's absolutely clear that Coinbase is also going to go down quite a bit.
00:05:45.018 - 00:06:23.554, Speaker B: Because even if 80% is transactional and the rest is some other revenue that also relies heavily on the prices they charge fees from, the amount of assets they custody on the platform. If the number decreases, it just goes down as well. So I think that's one thing people should kind of pay attention to. After the announcement, I saw a lot of people on Twitter just go out and say coinbase is going to generate like $8 billion this year. It's one of the fastest growing companies. And I would be a little bit cautious with that because a lot of people are just assuming this is a growth period, everything is just going to keep going up. But as we know, these things are quite cyclical.
00:06:23.554 - 00:07:08.446, Speaker B: And even in March we've already seen a slight decline in volumes, which is reflecting in revenues as well. So if volumes go down, I mean, Coinbase is going to perform slightly less. But I mean, nevertheless, it's still impressive, the numbers that they disclosed, it's pretty good. And I think one last thing is it's impressive to see how much they charge per the volume that they have. You look at all the other exchanges like Binance, FTX, but even like Kraken and Bitstamp and Coinbase just gets away with charging so much more. And that's because a lot of the users in this quarter especially, have been just retail users that go on the app and they don't care if they pay a couple of bucks per $100. They think that the opportunity is larger, so they just oversee the fees.
00:07:08.446 - 00:07:14.578, Speaker B: But I think we're going to see some compression as well. So that would be one of the other risks that I would be watching closely.
00:07:14.754 - 00:07:34.880, Speaker A: Yeah. The block also published an analysis and noted, quote, total revenue to trading volume came in at the lowest quarterly clip in the past two years at zero point 54%, suggesting take rates, which is transaction revenue divided by total trading volume, also saw compression to quarterly lows. So why do you think that is happening?
00:07:35.250 - 00:08:17.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious. So whenever volumes go up significantly, like we've seen, like you look at Q Four and then Q One, we saw a massive growth like a three or four X. Whenever that happens, you need more market makers, which is basically just institutions, market making, and they are charged way lower fees. So if you increase the number of volume that you need to market make for and they pay way lower fees than the retail clients, it's quite logical that would decrease. I was actually in my model prior to them disclosing it. I was expecting it to be even lower. But I definitely underestimated the amount of retail customers that will be coming in.
00:08:17.180 - 00:08:36.958, Speaker B: I could not imagine that the number of active users would basically double on the platform. So it's quite logical because we just have more market makers, more larger volume clients. And those clients, they're charged way lower fees and Coinbase makes so much more from the retail clients than they make from the institutional clients.
00:08:37.054 - 00:08:45.650, Speaker A: And so why do you think that did happen? What you weren't expecting that retail did increase so much? What was the cause of that?
00:08:45.800 - 00:09:17.806, Speaker B: I just wasn't expecting it that much. I think it happened because of all the things that happened in q. One, we saw tesla make a massive investment, which I think drove a lot of people there's so many people that basically praise elon musk for everything that he does. And I think that was one of the things that just sparked this. And then we just are starting to see other institutions get interested in crypto. It's just becoming more acceptable for really notable macro investors and really notable people overall to be positive about bitcoin. And we've never seen that before.
00:09:17.806 - 00:10:10.014, Speaker B: And I think that kind of made the flip for a lot of people. I think before, so many people still had nightmares from what happened in 2017 when bitcoin went to lot of people bought at that time, and then it dropped to like three k in a couple of years. And I think when you start seeing people like elon musk, but even just like institutional investors that are now saying, this might be a good idea, this might be a good hedge, it just flips a switch. Basically, after bitcoin crash, all the news sites were saying bitcoin was a ponzi scheme. Like, how could you have been so dumb to do that? And now all of a sudden you're seeing bitcoin outperform and you're seeing all these investors allocate a significant amount of money on a long mandate. So they're not investing to flip it, they're investing with long term mindsets. And I think that just for people, it just clicks, right? You're like, okay, maybe I wasn't as stupid before, maybe I was just early.
00:10:10.014 - 00:10:35.094, Speaker B: And I think we're also getting closer to just like, complete mania. We're seeing 2017 coins pump as well, and some crazy stuff going on. We're seeing d five valuations, just absolutely crazy. Uniswap is trading at like one third of what coinbase will be trading at. So I think it's a combination of things, but it still surprised me how many people actually join, and I think probably not going to slow down anytime soon.
00:10:35.292 - 00:10:59.562, Speaker A: In a moment, we're going to discuss Coinbase's competition and what we expect to see when coinbase does get listed. But first, a quick word for the sponsors who make this show possible. With over 10 million users, crypto.com is the easiest place to buy and sell over 90 cryptocurrencies.

Download the crypto.com app now and get $25 by using the code laura the link is in the description. Back to my conversation with Larry Cermac. So as we know, Coinbase is now competing against a number of other companies that have entered this phase. How would you compare Coinbase's numbers to those of Square or PayPal or Robinhood or any other company that is also offering similar things to Coinbase?
00:11:39.950 - 00:12:23.094, Speaker B: You're totally right. I mean, we're seeing a massive pickup in just consumer apps supporting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We now have Robinhood, we have Square, we have PayPal and then revolut in Europe. What I'll say though, is that even though their numbers are pretty impressive, it's important to realize that a lot of the volume that they have, especially if it's for a lot of volume, it almost always ends up routing to these large liquidity hubs, which is basically Coinbase. And you know, when you look at liquidity analysis of all the exchanges, it's almost always Coinbase, Binance and Bitfinex. Those three almost always stand out. And so a lot of it ends up routing to Coinbase regardless.
00:12:23.094 - 00:13:03.670, Speaker B: So I don't think it's necessarily competing. However, I think, and I already mentioned this briefly before, I think that this will have effect on fees. Because when you have a lot more competitors, a lot more retail friendly apps, which ultimately coinbase is it's the Go? To app. For a lot of retail people, it's just going to cause a lot of fee compression because you're going to have just much lower fees across the board. So I think that's going to be the largest effect. But regardless, Coinbase is going to be fine for several years in the future, mainly because it just has established itself. And when you establish yourself as the liquidity hub and as the go to place for large volumes of trading, it is going to be very hard to get away from that.
00:13:03.670 - 00:13:38.414, Speaker B: And one thing I'll add to that is like perfect example is just institutional investors getting exposure to Bitcoin. We saw tesla use coinbase. We saw MicroStrategy use coinbase. And when you establish yourself as the company, the counterparty that can provide this much liquidity for these really large companies, it's very hard to go away from that. So in my mind, when there are going to be companies in the future that want to get similar exposure to Bitcoin like Tesla and MicroStrategy, why wouldn't you go through Coinbase? Maybe you go through NYDIG as well. But I think those two companies right now just have too much of an edge.
00:13:38.542 - 00:13:48.242, Speaker A: And what about competition from the other end such as DeFi or DEXs, like Uniswap? Do you see those posing any sort of threat to Coinbase, even if only in the long term?
00:13:48.386 - 00:14:25.750, Speaker B: I think in some sense they do, especially for the long tail assets. So you look at, we call them, well, basically altcoins. I don't want to say the word, but a lot of these will go to uniswap just because sometimes it's easier. But right now you look at Ethereum and a lot of the fees, especially when there's some sort of an event on Ethereum, you're paying like $50 to $60. And you look at people that are joining my friends, they're investing like thousand, 2000, sometimes $5,000. They're not going to want to spend 20, $30 for trade. And even Coinbase actually is cheap compared to something like Uniswap.
00:14:25.750 - 00:14:52.218, Speaker B: So I think Uniswap will continue to grow. It has found a really nice product market fit and it's going to take away some of it. But I think obviously Coinbase is really strong at regulatory compliance and fiat onramps and that's really hard to disrupt because they already have the relationships. It's literally just taking money from the bank and converting them into bitcoin and crypto and that's just Uniswap can't do that and decentralized exchanges can do that.
00:14:52.384 - 00:14:57.850, Speaker A: Many people have questioned why Coinbase had so little bitcoin on its balance sheet. What's your theory?
00:14:58.270 - 00:15:33.234, Speaker B: Honestly, that's really hard to tell. I think it's still a know, it's still tens of billions. It's a lot, but I think related to everything else. Yeah, it is slightly lower than I would expect, but I just wouldn't look too much into it. I mean, a lot of people are always trying to say Coinbase is unfriendly to Bitcoin. I think in some ways they probably have been in the past, but I wouldn't look too much into it. I think it's just like what the composition is right now and I think Coinbase has been taking steps to be more supportive of Bitcoin, supporting Bitcoin projects and bitcoin developers.
00:15:33.234 - 00:15:35.800, Speaker B: So I think I wouldn't look too much into it.
00:15:36.170 - 00:15:44.666, Speaker A: All right, so based on this earnings, this quarterly report, what would you still want to know? What did Coinbase not reveal that you'd be interested to see?
00:15:44.848 - 00:16:38.298, Speaker B: I would just love to know more about their customers, like the customer makeup of basically anyone who trades on Coinbase. I would like to know. It would just be nice to see who are the people actually behind? Is it younger people, is it older people? I think that would be interesting for me personally and then it would just be interesting how are they going to deal with fees compressing down the line? What's their strategy to mitigate against that? I think those are the two main things that would be wanting to focus on and I think there's going to be a lot more institutional interest coming in and a lot of institutional buyers. So obviously I'm also interested in that and I think Coinbase has already been facilitating some of these without them being announced. I think those are the main things. I think they have done a good job just telling us how their business functions, what their intentions are. One thing I didn't mention yet is that they are expecting that their expenses are going to pick up significantly this year.
00:16:38.298 - 00:17:09.826, Speaker B: So I would be interested in what exactly are they thinking about spending their money for? I think a lot of that will go for hiring marketing, but I would be interested in what companies will they target for acquisitions. I think after Coinbase lists, it's going to be very easy to imagine Coinbase just going aggressively after companies that they haven't acquired yet because it's just hard for them to build it internally and it's just much easier. They're going to have a massive amount of money all of a sudden. I think they're going to be aggressive with acquisitions. I'll be interested in what companies they'll.
00:17:09.858 - 00:17:17.190, Speaker A: Target and do you have any kind of areas in mind of products or services that you think would kind of round out their offering?
00:17:17.630 - 00:17:49.650, Speaker B: I think they will get more aggressive in DeFi and wanting to just be more interoperative of the applications that work in DeFi. So I'm expecting more aggressive plays into those areas and also just institutional suite. I think they still have long ways to go there, but generally I really don't know. I would be biased to say that they also need a good research arm. It's going to be a ton of things that they still are not providing and I think it's just going to be interesting. I really have no idea, but I think they'll be aggressive.
00:17:49.990 - 00:17:53.940, Speaker A: So what do you expect to happen at the time of the direct listing next week?
00:17:55.190 - 00:18:28.650, Speaker B: That's a good question. I think right now there's just so much interest and there's going to be a lot of hype. I know TV networks are already booked up with having the hosts and everything is going to be revolving around Coinbase going public. Bitcoin has been the story of this year in a lot of mainstream media and I think Coinbase is just going to solidify that. So I'm expecting a massive hype. I'm expecting that a lot of retail customers will invest in Coinbase and I think the valuations might get a little bit crazy. Honestly, I think it's going to be great for the ecosystem.
00:18:28.650 - 00:18:39.346, Speaker B: I think what's interesting I don't know, I think it's going to be above 100 and I think it can go way higher than that, but I have no idea.
00:18:39.448 - 00:18:44.020, Speaker A: You mean 100 billion dollar valuation or what are you saying?
00:18:45.510 - 00:19:31.074, Speaker B: Okay, I think it's going to list around that and then probably go a little bit higher. But honestly, I have no idea. What I'll say though, is that I think it's important to think about the people that are all of a sudden going to get a lot of liquidity out of their early investments and what they will do with their money. Right. And my intuition would be that a lot of that will be reinvested in crypto. Like, we've spoken to some people that have had shares since really early on and almost all of them are thinking about ways to put that back into the ecosystem, some of them in DeFi, but I would assume a lot of them in bitcoin ethereum and just support other projects. And I think that's going to be quite common where we see a lot of these really early investors or early employees just start investing and I think that's going to be great.
00:19:31.074 - 00:19:37.400, Speaker B: But also it's just probably going to result in some even crazy evaluations that we have seen so far, which is crazy to think about.
00:19:37.850 - 00:19:44.950, Speaker A: And out of curiosity, did any of them say that they plan to invest in NFTs or did they focus on DeFi and other cryptos?
00:19:46.490 - 00:20:34.866, Speaker B: Most of them, I've only spoken to a couple that told me this, so not a great sample size, but most of them just said early projects and then some. The more liquid cryptocurrencies, I'm actually seeing a lot less interest in NFTs recently, despite all the mainstream interest. I think some of it, even according to the data that we have in the dashboard, is dying off slightly. It might go back again, but I think people are realizing that it's maybe not the best idea to put a lot of money into illiquid assets because when the music stops playing, it's very hard to actually realize any of those profits we'll see. But I'm not expecting too much of investments there. I think what could be interesting is like some infrastructure place for NFTs like OpenSea or some other platforms, but I don't think NFTs are going to be that interesting, honestly.
00:20:34.978 - 00:20:51.770, Speaker A: Okay, and by the way, for those of the audience listening on audio, larry did air quotes around profits when he talked about NFTs. Okay, last question. How do you think the crypto markets will play out the rest of this year and how do you think that will affect Coinbase and its stock?
00:20:52.190 - 00:21:35.146, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. I normally try not to answer any predictions or anything like that, but I think overall what's different about this market is that it's being invested in by long term investors and a lot of the companies that are starting to get exposure and starting to invest on their balance sheet. And a lot of the institutional investors, they're investing with long mandates, usually at least three years. Most of the time it's more. And so I think the dynamic is very different. I'm not expecting to see like 90% drops like we've seen before. I think there are going to be some corrections, but overall I think the market is right now really healthy and I think we're going to keep seeing interest from institutional customers pop up and that has been really the fuel of this run.
00:21:35.146 - 00:21:58.820, Speaker B: If that dries up for some reason, that could be a problem, but I'm not expecting it to. And I know we've spoken to Coinbase before, that was like a month ago or something and they mentioned they have like four or five SMP 500 companies almost lined up to get some bitcoin on their balance sheet. So I think a lot of these announcements will happen over the next, like, two or three months, and I think overall, I'm not worried about the market yet.
00:21:59.190 - 00:22:04.142, Speaker A: Great. All right, well, this has been such a fun conversation. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:22:04.286 - 00:22:10.070, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a pleasure to be here and happy to come on again to talk about anything else. I love your podcast.
00:22:10.410 - 00:22:45.730, Speaker A: Great. Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in Crypto after this short break. Meet Interpop, a super team redefining the future of NFTs and fandom. From comics and trading card games to digital collectibles and everything in between, they are building the architecture of an entirely new landscape of fandom, using technology built on the Tazos blockchain to drive their vision.

00:22:45.730 - 00:24:15.022, Speaker A: Before we begin, a note on last week's news recap regarding Outlier ventures. I reported the Web Three accelerator had raised a funding round of $350,000,000 only to find out that recent podcast guest Jamie Burke was playing a well executed April Foles prank. All right, first headline crypto industry leaders Forge Alliance to champion Digital currencies the Crypto Council for Innovation, a group consisting of Fidelity, Coinbase Square and Paradigm, launched on Tuesday to lobby governments and institutions on crypto related policy. The CCI will provide extensive informational resources aiming to educate crypto participants, policymakers and governmental bodies on the benefits of using cryptocurrencies. Gus Koldebella, Chief Policy Officer at Paradigm and one of the CCI organizers, suggests the CCI's work, quote, will require sharing insights and analysis about crypto while correcting the misperceptions that inevitably accompany a transformative new technology. The CCI's inception comes in the same week that in a letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who infamously declared bitcoin a fraud in 2017, included the, quote regulatory status of cryptocurrencies as an emerging issue in the US that the US must deal with if it is to bounce back from the economic fallout from COVID-19. Regulations regarding crypto remain rather complicated at the moment.
00:24:15.022 - 00:25:24.542, Speaker A: For example, the SEC claims authority over most ethereum based tokens, while the CFTC oversees bitcoin adjacent assets like futures and options contracts. Next Headline grayscale States intention to launch an ETF Grayscale, the world's largest digital asset manager, is quote, 100% committed to converting GBTC into an ETF. According to a Medium post published by the company, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was the first publicly traded bitcoin fund launched in the United States and helped Grayscale become the first and only company to convert a bitcoin fund into an SEC reporting company. Grayscale first applied for a bitcoin ETF in 2016, but withdrew the filing due to an immature regulatory environment surrounding digital assets. The investment company has not submitted another ETF filing declaring only that the regulatory environment will drive the timing of its next application. Shareholders of GPTC will see their fees go down when the fund is converted to an ETF. Meanwhile, alternative asset manager NYDIG secured another $100 million in funding just one month after announcing a 200 million dollar round.
00:25:24.542 - 00:26:24.534, Speaker A: The additional capital comes from Star Insurance and Liberty Mutual. They joined the previous round of investors, including Stone Ridge Holdings, Morgan Stanley, New York Life, Mass Mutual and Soros Management Fund. Next Headline NFT market correction doesn't slow down the NFT Craze the NFT market seems to have corrected a bit. The average price of an NFT dropped from its February peak of start of April, with trade volume mimicking the mountainous rise and fall of average NFT prices, peaking at 80,000 weekly trades before settling at roughly 45,000 in early April. However, before you go out and sell all your NFTs, the current average price of one $500 represents a ten X increase in the average cost of an NFT from six months ago. And NFT weekly trade volume has more than doubled compared to Q four of 2020. As if, despite the bubble popping narrative, the NFT headlines were just as wacky as usual, if not more so.
00:26:24.534 - 00:27:13.270, Speaker A: A few of the more interesting stories include tom Brady and Peyton Manning are now fighting for NFT supremacy. Brady, the seventime Super Bowl champion, is launching an NFT platform called Autograph, seeking to extend the idea of an autograph into the digital world. Manning, along with his brother Eli, is set to launch the Manning Legacy Collection, made up of eight unique art pieces, through Maker's Place. On April 16, Forbes, my former employer, dropped an NFT of its recent Winklevy profile on Nifty Gateway. The COVID depicting Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss smiling behind the title, a New Billionaire Every Day. Sold for $333,333. The proceeds will go to the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women's Media Foundation.
00:27:13.270 - 00:28:15.846, Speaker A: Two Coinbase employees decided to get married on the blockchain the happy couple by the way, that's the Ethereum blockchain. The happy couple exchanged NFTs in addition to the traditional swap of rings, cementing their marriage on Ethereum for all time. As if Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, doesn't have enough going on right now, he is collaborating with DJ Davi to produce electronic music, a skill he picked up during COVID last year. The songs will be released as NFTs, and if you want a deeper understanding of how NFTs work or what they may become, I highly recommend this NFT Canon by a 16 Z, a carefully curated collection of articles and resources for the NFT. Curious. Next Headline ripple wins lawsuit for access to internal SEC communications on crypto In December, the SEC announced a lawsuit against Ripple Labs claiming that XRP was a security and that the company had raised more than $1.3 billion in unregistered offerings.
00:28:15.846 - 00:29:10.378, Speaker A: On Tuesday, Ripple Labs won a discovery ruling that will require the SEC to hand over internal communications on how it determines whether a cryptocurrency is a security. The SEC does not consider Bitcoin and Ether to be securities, but has not issued. Any formal guidance explaining how it arrived at those conclusions. Ripple likely hopes the SEC mentions XRP as a virtual currency similar to BTC and ETH, which would help its case to be treated as a nonsecurity. Barring a blatant mention of XRP in the same vein as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the ruling could still offer the general public its first indepth look at how the SEC regulates crypto. Ripple Labs's token XRP is up nearly 20% since the report broke. Next Headline VC backed stablecoin Protocol Faye is off to a shaky start Faye, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, recently concluded its Genesis event.
00:29:10.378 - 00:29:42.610, Speaker A: In total, the protocol minted 1.3 billion of its fay tokens as a stablecoin. Faye got off to a shaky start, trading between five cents and ten cents off the targeted $1 mark for the first few days before tanking to under $0.80 on Thursday. The situation emphasizes the difficulties in creating an algorithmic stablecoin. The protocol aimed to create a stablecoin that would purchase assets outright with its token rather than holding them as collateral. Like a tether, Faye is created with a trade instead of debt.
00:29:42.610 - 00:30:46.774, Speaker A: However, a vulnerability in its incentive mechanism made it prohibitively expensive for users to sell in the days following the Genesis event. To enforce its Peg, fay had established a uniswap burn penalty that penalizes traders for transacting with Faye under its $1 Peg and a Reway of Faye tokens on uniswap that burns under Pegged tokens, thereby increasing demand back to $1. However, eventually the penalty became so high that at times the burns would exceed 100% of a trade's value, effectively making the token worthless when attempting to sell it on uniswap. Additionally, the team was alerted to a bug via its bug bounty program, and so it had to suspend the minting rewards that come with buying Faye, leaving only the sell disincentives. Faye currently has a market cap of $1.6 billion. Next Headline Messaging App Signal to integrate Cryptocurrency payment Feature Signal, an encrypted messaging app, is rolling out payments using the cryptocurrency mobile coin.
00:30:46.774 - 00:31:53.694, Speaker A: Unlike WhatsApp and Imessage, which allow payments to be sent via bank accounts, Signal is looking to provide a way to send money that nobody outside the sender or recipient can track. While Zcash and Monero are the most popular cryptocurrencies with that sort of privacy capability, Signal chose Mobilecoins for its user experience, minimal storage requirements and quick transaction time. In a blog post announcing the news, Signal clarified that it would not have access to user balances, transaction history or funds. While many in the crypto community expressed excitement, there were also a few dissenting voices. Matt Corello, a developer at Square Crypto, tweeted There is no technical justification for Signal requiring its own blockchain in order to get the payment throughput they want. There is no reason at all for requiring the token issuance to go entirely to the small number of founders, except to maximize profits. There is zero reason even to require their own token at all when this could absolutely have been built using existing cryptocurrency systems pegged to traditional fiat currencies, which would offer significantly better UX and avoid the massive value fluctuation risk that signal is now hoisting onto its user base.
00:31:53.694 - 00:32:50.222, Speaker A: Next Headline China's digital currency Head Start The Wall Street Journal wrote an in depth analysis of China's digital yuan, calling it, quote, a first for a major economy. The digital yuan launched through a mobile app that has since been downloaded over 100,000 times. The government issued digital money can be used to track people spending in real time, speed relief to disaster victims, or flag criminal behavior. The article also notes, quote, the money itself is programmable. Beijing has tested expiration dates to encourage users to spend it quickly for times when the economy needs a jumpstart. However, the Wall Street Journal adds that the digital yuan may also be used to tighten president Xi Jinping's authoritarian rule as a tracking tool, making it possible to collect fines as soon as an infraction is committed. The article also points out that the digital yuan could undermine the supremacy of the dollar, saying, quote, it would provide options for people in poor countries to transfer money internationally.
00:32:50.222 - 00:33:39.550, Speaker A: Even limited international usage could soften the bite of US. Sanctions, which increasingly are used against Chinese companies or individuals. Josh Lipsky, a former International Monetary fund staffer now at the Atlanta council think tank, said, quote, Anything that threatens the dollar is a national security issue. This threatens a dollar over the long term. The Wall Street Journal notes that a Chinese marketing campaign depicts a man in an American flag shirt being knocked out by an animated digital yuan. Conversely, PayPal co founder Peter Thiel wondered if bitcoin should be considered a Chinese financial weapon against the United States. His comments, especially coming from someone who considers himself a bitcoiner, brought out vociferous opposition from crypto twitter as Nick Carter of island Castle ventures tweeted, So there's two nations.
00:33:39.550 - 00:34:12.320, Speaker A: One of them has a free floating currency and permits the free flow of capital. The other has a managed currency and maintains strict capital controls. Which nation is bitcoin more hostile to? All right, time for fun bits. Happy birthday, Satoshi. Happy 45th birthday to Satoshi. Maybe the pseudonymous bitcoin creator celebrated his or her birthday on April 5. On Twitter, Alex glazine, chief strategy officer at the human rights foundation, offered some insight on why satoshi may have chosen that particular date.
00:34:12.320 - 00:34:58.738, Speaker A: He says Satoshi listed their birthday as April 5, 1975. If you are wondering what animated them to create Bitcoin, April 5 equals the date that Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed order 6102, making it illegal for Americans to own gold. In 1975, americans could legally own gold again, it's all about financial freedom. All right, thanks for tuning in.
