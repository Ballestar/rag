00:00:00.170 - 00:00:00.926, Speaker UNK: Bitcoin, which is.
00:00:00.948 - 00:00:03.002, Speaker C: Flirting with its biggest weekly gain.
00:00:03.066 - 00:00:03.982, Speaker UNK: In almost two years.
00:00:04.036 - 00:00:07.680, Speaker C: We've been in the bear market for almost 18 months now.
00:00:08.370 - 00:00:19.902, Speaker A: Name a date. Don't name a price. Name a price. Don't name a date. Science of a bull market or bull trap. Bitcoin serving 34% since last Friday for its best week since January 2021. All right.
00:00:19.902 - 00:00:22.910, Speaker A: Where do you think the crypto markets will go for the rest of the year?
00:00:22.980 - 00:00:30.434, Speaker B: What I'm really hopeful in the crypto markets is that first of all, they're going to break the correlation with the TradFi markets.
00:00:30.482 - 00:00:45.474, Speaker A: The year started off with an upward trend in crypto prices. However, the collapses of Silvergate Bank, silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the last couple weeks, plus the continued concern about the banking system, have really supercharged the markets. Does all this mean the end of crypto winter?
00:00:45.522 - 00:00:57.500, Speaker C: I think if the macro markets do not go crazy, know something catastrophic doesn't happen, like Fed increasing rates again, which looks highly unlikely, I think it will be like.
