00:00:00.170 - 00:00:48.770, Speaker A: So if you think about bitcoin, in the, quote, old days when we did that first podcast seven years ago, it was kind of a store of value. And then during the speculative phases, it became a risk asset. But there was a big gap in between where there was not any real perceived utility for it other than storing or speculating. And that giant gap was filled by Ethereum and then many other chains that emerged. All of those there's many of them. But what Ordinals does is it creates this foundational layer that allows the data to represent whatever you want it to represent. And it introduces the capability for developers to fill that gap with the bitcoin blockchain, which is, as everybody knows, the most robust old guard chain.
