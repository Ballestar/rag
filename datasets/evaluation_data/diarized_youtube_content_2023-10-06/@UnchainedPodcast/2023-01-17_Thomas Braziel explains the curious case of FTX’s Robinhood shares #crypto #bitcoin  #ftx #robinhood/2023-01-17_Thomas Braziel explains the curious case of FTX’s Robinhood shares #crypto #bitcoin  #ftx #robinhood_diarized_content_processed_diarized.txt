00:00:00.170 - 00:00:37.506, Speaker A: The US government's probably going to want pound of flesh. I mean, they're talking about holding them as part of a civil or criminal forfeiture. And what that means is that those assets will be if he signs a plea agreement, first of all, as the criminal trial is going on, they're going to sit on those assets. So it could be literally, I don't know, a few years while he's going through his criminal trial and they're holding onto the assets. And only after that will he potentially sign a civil forfeiture, which only then will each estate have to make a claim on the civil forfeiture. So it could be years before those shares have gotten back. So it's kind of interesting to think about in terms of for Robin Hood.
00:00:37.506 - 00:00:56.010, Speaker A: I mean, it's kind of a big risk now because who knows, maybe Robinhood ends up going to zero in five years. Or who knows, maybe at four X's and instead of 400 million, it's 1000, 600 million. And then Sam has he wants the individual, they want their loan, and then the estate wants their property back. So it'll be interesting how the spoils are split.
