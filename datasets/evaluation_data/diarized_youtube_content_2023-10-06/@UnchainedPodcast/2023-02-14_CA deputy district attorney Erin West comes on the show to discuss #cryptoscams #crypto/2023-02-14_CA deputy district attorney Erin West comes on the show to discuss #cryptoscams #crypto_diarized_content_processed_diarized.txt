What we know is that there is a small backpack, used to be a backpacking beach town in Cambodia known as Sihanukville Pre COVID what's believed to be Chinese organized crime started moving into that city and building casino towers. COVID hit and they were unable to fill casino towers and they came up with a new strategy. And their strategy was, well, why don't we fill those towers with scam facilities? And to do that, they human trafficked in personnel to do that. Now, some of them are willing participants, but a great percentage of those who are being used to commit these scams have been human trafficked in. They are from surrounding Asian countries and they are led to believe that they are coming to work in.
