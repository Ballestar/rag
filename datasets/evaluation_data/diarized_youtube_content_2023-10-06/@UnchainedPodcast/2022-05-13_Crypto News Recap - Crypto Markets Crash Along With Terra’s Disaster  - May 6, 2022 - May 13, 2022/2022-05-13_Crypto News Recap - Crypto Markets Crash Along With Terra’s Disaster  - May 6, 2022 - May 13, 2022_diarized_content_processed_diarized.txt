00:00:06.730 - 00:01:05.050, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap bitcoin below 26K after inflation report in addition to the Luna chaos, crypto was also hit by an unexpectedly high inflation number, causing prices to stumble. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price price index was up 8.3% in the twelve months ending in April. In the days after the CPI numbers came out, bitcoin and ETH hit a low of 25, $200 and $1,748 respectively, though it is not certain that the inflation report caused the dip. In addition to Bitcoin and ETH struggling in the wake of high inflation and the Terra Bank run Tether, or USDT, the $150,000,000,000 stablecoin was briefly knocked off its peg on Thursday and fell to ETH. And USDT were certainly not the only crypto assets to be affected by the Terra and CPI numbers.
00:01:05.050 - 00:01:13.906, Speaker A: In total, over $440,000,000,000 in value was wiped out in terms of market capitalization from the crypto industry, data from Coin market cap shows.
00:01:14.088 - 00:01:17.186, Speaker B: Furthermore, nearly $4 billion in short and.
00:01:17.208 - 00:01:57.938, Speaker A: Long positions were liquidated this week, reports. Coinglass NFT prices went down heavily as well. The floor price of Board Apia Club has gone down 25% over this week, and Cryptopunk's floor price suffered a drawdown of 15%. Considering that these NFTs are priced in ETH and the ETH price plummeted in relation to USD, the loss is much higher than 25% and 15%. Ralph Powell, CEO of Global Macro Investor, says a recession is coming and that crypto is in full panic mode. However, he compared the fear people are feeling now with the sentiment of March 2020, which led to a major bull run. He pointed out that tough times like these are a time to buy.
00:01:57.938 - 00:02:45.374, Speaker A: On the other hand, Peter Schiff, the famously anti crypto economist, unsurprisingly recommends that people sell their bitcoin. Selling now is not panicking, it's smart to cut and run, he said on Twitter. Instagram introduces NFTs this week, Instagram launched its NFT pilot in which select US creators and collectors will be able to share NFTs that they have created or bought. Disclosure I write a bulletin newsletter for its parent company, Meta. According to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, enabling NFTs offers new ways for creators to earn money from their content. Through NFTs, artists, musicians and creators will be able to tokenize their work and verify ownership of it. I want to acknowledge upfront that NFTs and Blockchain Technologies are all about distributing trust and distributing power, Masseri said in his announcement.
00:02:45.374 - 00:03:25.302, Speaker A: But Instagram is fundamentally a centralized platform, so there's the tension there. Instagram NFTs will first support ethereum and polygon. Executives hinted that flow and solana will be coming soon. Ryan Watt, CEO of Polygon Studios, said on Twitter that Facebook chose Polygon due to Polygon's carbon neutral footprint, its scalability and the developer ecosystem. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented, meta plans to bring NFTs to apps in our family. Similar functionality is coming to Facebook soon, along with augmented reality's NFTs on Instagram stories via spark AR so you can place digital art into physical spaces. MicroStrategy's bitcoin backed loans won't be margin.
00:03:25.366 - 00:03:28.606, Speaker B: Called anytime soon Michael Saylor, founder and.
00:03:28.628 - 00:04:29.250, Speaker A: CEO of MicroStrategy, the publicly traded software firm known for its large amount of bitcoin holdings, shed light on the company's obligations concerning its bitcoin backed loans. He tweeted, MicroStrategy has a $205,000,000 term loan and needs to maintain $410,000,000 as collateral, meaning that the liquidation price of the company's bitcoin loans is $3,562. However, even if BTC reaches that price, Sailor assured the space that he is ready to put up other collateral, such as company stock or assets, so that he doesn't have to sell BTC. MicroStrategy holds 129 128 bitcoin, which at current prices is valued at more than $3 billion. The firm's average buy price for its bitcoin holdings is $30,700, even though it is clear that it doesn't plan to sell. Considering bitcoin's current price, the firm has an unrealized loss of roughly $330,000,000 on its investment. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen asked for new stablecoin legislation by the end of this year.
00:04:29.250 - 00:05:00.390, Speaker A: On the same day Terra USD or USDT started de pegging. She even referred to the UST stumble in her speech. I think that UST simply illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product and that there are risks to financial stability, Ms. Yellen said at a hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. She also added, we need a coherent federal framework. When asked by Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey if the goal was to get the legislation done during 2022, Ms. Yellen responded that she thinks it would be highly appropriate.
00:05:00.390 - 00:05:52.010, Speaker A: In addition, in her written testimony, Yellen said that she has been working on identifying the risks that digital assets impose on financial stability. However, after being questioned by Representative Jim Hines in a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, Yellen recognized that the stablecoin market has not yet reached a size big enough to impose a major risk on the financial system. El Salvador bought the dip on Monday. El Salvador's President Naim Bukele tweeted that his country just bought the dip. According to Bukele, the country purchased 500 coins at an average USD price of $30,744. Bloomberg reports the government has purchased 2301 bitcoins since September, with Monday's acquisition being the largest since it started buying. The cost of all these purchases combined is approximately $103,000,000.
00:05:52.010 - 00:06:48.730, Speaker A: At the current price, the bitcoin held by El Salvador is now worth $70 million, which translates to a 32% unrealized loss so far. Bukelli has earned himself a lot of attention since he decided to adopt bitcoin as legal tender in his country last September. Plenty of skeptics think his decision was not wise. For example, the International Monetary Fund has been abu Kelly's back to reverse his decision in January, an IMF report urged authorities to remove bitcoin status as legal money. IMF directors stressed that there are large risks associated with the use of bitcoin on financial stability. Financial integrity and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities.

00:07:02.408 - 00:07:48.802, Speaker A: Crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings, and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors, the exchange wrote.

Google is Going Web Three According to CNBC, Google is putting together a Web Three team to build services for developers running blockchain applications. It appears that Google intends to not fall behind on the Web Three curve and will try to capitalize on the surging popularity of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Last Friday, Google Cloud Vice President Ahmed Zaveri told employees in an email, While the world is still in its early embrace of Web Three, it is a market that is already demonstrating tremendous potential, with many customers asking us to increase our support for Web Three and crypto related technologies instead of building projects of their own. It seems that Google's strategy to enter the crypto space is to support developers by offering them tools to build their own applications and projects.
