00:00:00.090 - 00:00:58.380, Speaker A: I think we actually ended on a note saying that we're not sure that looking at developers is the right lens for NFTs and Gauging NFT health because so much of NFTs, if you think about it, are based on games or ecosystems, where the smart contract for creating the tokens is a fairly minimal amount of code. But the work comes in maintaining the community, encouraging activity in the community, having a very active membership. And so for NFTs specifically, we continue to think that perhaps looking at open source code in NFTs is not the right metric. It's shown a lot of growth. And so that trendline is really interesting. But we think NFTs, unlike many other stuff sectors, need other signals. And so one of the things we've been doing internally and we want to push more publicly, is what we call a community.
