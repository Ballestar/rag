Today's guest is Neha Narula, director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.
00:01:32.314 - 00:01:33.622, Speaker A: Welcome, Neha.
00:01:33.766 - 00:01:36.746, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, good to see you. This week.
00:01:36.768 - 00:01:49.840, Speaker A: On Wednesday, the Crypto Council for Innovation, in conjunction with Ark, Invest Square and Paradigm, held the B Word Virtual conference at which you were a moderator. What was your main takeaway from the event?
00:01:50.770 - 00:02:06.920, Speaker B: I think my main takeaway was that the bitcoin ecosystem is alive and thriving. There are a lot of people and companies and technologists who are very excited about it and are focused on it. So I think overall, it was a really successful event and I really enjoyed it.
00:02:07.690 - 00:02:57.198, Speaker A: So the main conference panel was one that featured Kathy wood of ark invest, elon musk of tesla, and Jack dorsey of square and also Twitter. And when asked about the Bitcoin block size, which is a debate that's sort of, like, over and yet not over, elon Musk said, the reality is the average person is not going to run a Bitcoin node. And then referring to the year in which the bitcoin software code was written, he said in 2008 there was still a nontrivial number of people on modems, and he said he felt the block size could be increased without affecting the decentralization of the network. Because technology has improved so much since 2008, I think this is antithetical to what some of the bitcoin community believes. What's your take on these comments?
00:02:57.294 - 00:03:27.886, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question, Laura. I remember hearing that. And I think one of the things he said as well was, I like to run things in reverse, so let's think about decreasing the block size. What would that be like? And actually, there are some people who want to do that. So it was really funny that he sort of posed it as a ludicrous idea. I think fundamentally you have to think from first principles. The fact of the matter is that copying all of this data to everyone's computer and verifying it on everyone's computer, you just can't do that with too much data.
00:03:27.886 - 00:04:15.840, Speaker B: So I think the really important thing to note here is that you have to look at trend lines and sort of how things work in the limit. And the fact of the matter is that we can't just keep increasing the block size as we go. It's entirely possible and that it could be increased today. I don't think that there are very many people who disagree with that technically. I think it's more about the governance model and sort of who gets to decide that and under what circumstances it's decided and what is the upgrade path for something like that to happen. If I think back to 20 15, 20 16, 20 17 when we were having this conversation the first time around, that was really the debate. I think that a lot of people didn't understand that it wasn't about the exact number, it was about the method by which that upgrade happens.
00:04:15.840 - 00:05:00.640, Speaker B: So I think it could be raised a little bit. But the fact of the matter is putting everything on the blockchain is a bad idea and we're going to have to figure out sooner or later how to do things off chain or it's just not going to scale. I mean, we saw Ethereum go through this, right? So I remember back when the plan was sharding, right? And now it's all about roll ups. And I think what you realize is you just can't put and verify everything that's on the chain. So when you come at it from that perspective, whether the limit a good block size is one megabytes or four or eight, it's just a number. And you have to realize that our hope is that the demand is going to outstrip whatever number we pick. So we better start preparing for that right now.
00:05:01.330 - 00:06:09.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I found how he posed, what would it be like to make the block size smaller? I found that interesting because yes, since some people do want it and he clearly thought that was a ridiculous idea, I thought that was kind of a funny moment. So elon in the beginning, kind of like danced a little bit around environmental issues I felt when it came to bitcoin. And basically if I kind of was reading his comments, it seems know he supports bitcoin and then as an afterthought in the beginning, he sort of was like, oh, I have to mention these environmental caveats due to Tesla's position. But then when he was asked directly about it, he basically said he would want to do more due diligence on bitcoin to confirm that the amount of renewable energy usage is at or above 50% before Tesla would adopt bitcoin transactions. Again, as we all know, Tesla has bought what at the time of purchase was $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, and it still is holding the bitcoin on its balance sheet. So what do you make of his comments? Do you think that this is a serious concern of his, or is it more like a PR play or something else?
00:06:09.590 - 00:06:59.458, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. I can't sort of presume to know what he's thinking, but I do think we suffer from a serious lack of data, and that's starting to change. The past few months, people have actually started measuring really well how much green energy is used to produce bitcoin, which is really important. I think that we have to do more measurement in this area and we have to really surface the data and understand what kind of energy is being used and what the climate impact of that is. And then people can make their own decisions. There are a lot of washing machines in the world, and I'm sure that they use a lot of energy in aggregate, but we don't tell people well because washing machines use so much energy, you just can't use them. We weigh the balance of how much value we think that thing brings to society and then decide whether it's worth the energy cost.
00:06:59.458 - 00:08:03.560, Speaker B: And the really interesting thing about bitcoin and other proof of work currencies is that that trade off is made really obvious. The amount of hash rate that will go into bitcoin is exactly the reward that comes out of mining bitcoin. And so what that means is that the higher the bitcoin price, the more hash rate that's going to go into it. That doesn't necessarily mean more climate impact. I want to be very careful about that. But it is kind of a way of showing that the energy use is proportional to how much people value it. Now, you might ask, do people really understand the climate impact and would they be as interested in bitcoin if they really understood it? And I think that's what's unfolding right now, which is a good thing, because it's forcing everyone to think about, well, what is the climate impact and are we really okay with it or not? I think another really important piece of information that's missing from this debate and where people like me can contribute is around exactly what the security guarantees are that we're getting from proof of work.
00:08:03.560 - 00:08:35.890, Speaker B: You've probably participated in proof of work versus proof of stake debates so many times, and I think that we still don't really have the right language and models to characterize the security guarantees of proof of work versus proof of stake. They're clearly different, but we don't really have the language to completely explain exactly how they're different and quantify the security trade off if there is one. So that's another place where I think we hope to find more data and to sort of have a more productive, informed debate.
00:08:36.470 - 00:09:00.646, Speaker A: Yeah. And about the data for the renewable energy aspect. I feel like it's going to take a while because there's this major shift happening in the network and where the miners are located and so we're kind of not going to really know where a lot of the hash rate is coming from anyway for like six to nine months. And then after that it's going to take a while to figure out what is the renewable energy mix now. And so yeah, maybe like in two years we might know.
00:09:00.748 - 00:09:09.706, Speaker B: Yeah, but I feel like this conversation is making the incentives go in the right direction so that's positive and hopefully in two years it shakes out and it turns out it's really high.
00:09:09.888 - 00:09:46.630, Speaker A: Yes, hopefully so. Elon also talked about how he holds dogecoin and he was talking about how it was a reverend and it has great memes and how he loves dogs and how he loves how dogecoin doesn't take itself too seriously. And then he gave a twist on Occam's Razor saying that the most ironic outcome or the most entertaining outcome are the most likely ones. And he thought it would be great if the crypto that started as a joke and was meant to make fun of crypto became the biggest one. So these were kind of unusual remarks for someone at a bitcoin conference. Do you think that dogecoin could become a serious cryptocurrency?
00:09:46.970 - 00:10:26.934, Speaker B: Laura I'm really bad at predicting this stuff. I'm not really so up on investing or predicting prices and things like that. I don't know how many nodes there are in the dogecoin network. I don't know how robust it is, but definitely security and thinking about the attack surface and vulnerabilities and bugs and things like that. And my understanding is that there weren't really a lot of people contributing to the dogecoin code base, applying patches, running nodes, monitoring the network, things like that. So I'm honestly kind of amazed that it stood up this long. And I wonder if it's just because there isn't anybody sort of bothering trying to attack it.
00:10:26.934 - 00:11:06.226, Speaker B: So that would be really interesting to see. But I think in the long term, the true value of this technology is that it operates in a really decentralized adversarial environment and that means it needs to be really secure and well written. And if there's no developers maintaining it, then I wouldn't have a lot of confidence that it is very secure. But I don't know, I'm not exactly sure what's going on. I don't track dogecoin very carefully. The technical development one of the panels that I was on at B Word was about security and I just think that's so critically important and we need to have more of a discussion about that as well.
00:11:06.408 - 00:11:18.182, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're going to have to see now that apparently Elon is working with them and with all the meme stock mania and Wall Street bets and everything pushing up dogecoin. I guess there's incentives there.
00:11:18.236 - 00:11:36.754, Speaker B: Well, but is it decentralized? Elon can't just hire a bunch of developers and have them build it, because if it does get really big, then there's a small group of developers who can someone can go to them and say, hey, this thing's happening on your network, I want you to shut it down. Right. That's the question, I guess. But that might take some time to shake.
00:11:36.882 - 00:11:41.774, Speaker A: Right, right. But I also meant, like, if the price goes up, that might incentivize people to start working on it.
00:11:41.812 - 00:11:43.662, Speaker B: Yeah, very true. Very true.
00:11:43.796 - 00:12:38.158, Speaker A: Who knows? All right, in a moment, we're going to discuss Square's plans for Bitcoin. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

So, Jack and this was before the B Word conference recently announced that Square would be building a Bitcoin hardware wallet and that the company would also be creating a new business to foster decentralized finance on Bitcoin by creating an open developer platform. A number of Ethereum people made fun of the announcement saying that this already existed in DeFi. What do you think? Is Jack just trying to build something that already exists?
00:13:40.950 - 00:14:35.042, Speaker B: No, I don't think he's trying to build something that already exists because it doesn't exist on Bitcoin. And they're very different coins with very different properties and communities and supporters. So I think one of the parts of that hardware announcement was building something for mainstream users. And I think that is so important and that this area really needs a lot more development and research and user research. And how can we everyone talks about how the great thing about this technology is it could help with financial inclusion that you don't need a bank account. It's open to anyone, but where's the data showing who's actually using it? And where's the data showing how to actually build tools that really make it open to everyone? Because everyone's not going to run a full node or understand how to store their private keys securely. And I think it's part of our job as technologists to help build tools that help them do that.
00:14:35.042 - 00:15:17.214, Speaker B: Because I'm really not excited about a solution where all the bitcoin in the world is held on ten exchanges and it's all custodial. That's really not the revolution that I signed up for. And so that means that we have to solve this challenge of educating people, but also building tools that work for them. And so it was really exciting to see that emphasis in the open hardware announcement. And we're hoping to do more work in this area as well. Invest in user research, especially for underprivileged populations, to find out where we can make the biggest difference with respect to DeFi on mean. I think Ethereum has shown that this is a really exciting area and it's much, much easier for developers to build applications on Ethereum.
00:15:17.214 - 00:15:30.120, Speaker B: It's pretty challenging to build secure applications on top of bitcoin and huge kudos to all the people who have been able to do that. But I think the idea of building, seeing what works from Ethereum and bringing it over to bitcoin is a great idea.
00:15:31.050 - 00:16:05.646, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Okay, yeah, we'll see because now we've got THORChain making it possible to transact in between chains without using wrapped coins. So who knows, although maybe that could be connective tissue. All right, so bitcoin mining is undergoing a big shift. As we alluded to earlier, it's been leaving China in a big way. And as those miners go offline, the bitcoin mining hash rate has also dropped quite a know by more than half, actually, over the course of a few months. Although recently there has been a little bit of a rebound.
00:16:05.646 - 00:16:09.780, Speaker A: So what do you think is the significance of this decrease in the bitcoin hash rate?
00:16:10.470 - 00:17:03.202, Speaker B: Yeah, I think short term it's not that big of an issue. The network can adjust, blocks might come out slower for a little while, but that's the beauty of the difficulty adjustment algorithm, sort of in the long term and more abstractly and theoretically, I think it's really interesting to think about. I love to think about how things can break, so I love to think about all the ways that things can go wrong. And half the hash rate going online is pretty juicy in terms of thinking about ways things could go wrong. Now, whether that will actually happen or not is a completely different story. It seems very unlikely, but certainly it's interesting to think about what that might mean and how that hash rate could be used if someone wanted to use it in an adversarial way. That said, it seems like it's pretty difficult to mount that kind of attack on bitcoin at this point in time.
00:17:03.202 - 00:17:52.100, Speaker B: So what we see with the hash rate is that I think drops, though they do reduce the underlying security of the blockchain. It's also the case that we're not really sure yet how much hash rate is enough, so to speak. We're still kind of trying to figure that out and understand exactly what kind of security guarantees we get for hash rate. There's been some really interesting work by economists, and we did some work as well, showing that maybe it's the case because you can think about sort of the game theory behind it. You can think about the threat of counterattacking, that incentives might be lined up to just kind of go with whatever the longest chain is, even if an attacker has 51% of the hash rate. So I don't think it really has much of an effect in the short term, but I think the long term questions and sort of theoretical questions are really interesting.
00:17:53.030 - 00:18:12.490, Speaker A: So bitcoin recently became legal tender in El Salvador, and that was a little bit controversial because President Naib Bukeles has links to corruption and he also has some authoritarian proclivities. How do you think this association with El Salvador will affect the perception of bitcoin?
00:18:13.470 - 00:18:47.080, Speaker B: Well, it certainly generated a lot of press and know, I'm just really curious about the details. Who's going to custody the Bitcoin? Will people be able to custody it themselves? Who's going to run wallets? Who's going to run bitcoin full nodes? I haven't seen a lot of details on this, and I think it's one thing to say that something's legal tender, and then it's another thing to actually do the work of making sure that people can access it fairly and safely. I think we'll have to see how that shakes out.
00:18:47.770 - 00:18:56.006, Speaker A: Yeah, I did see something like only 45% of El Salvadorans have access to the Internet, so that's also an issue.
00:18:56.188 - 00:19:04.060, Speaker B: Yeah, that doesn't seem like it's going to be a good environment to take off. So yeah, it seems a little bit more like PR.
00:19:05.230 - 00:19:25.330, Speaker A: So the digital currency initiative worked with the Fed of Boston on a paper or some kind of work to determine whether a central bank digital currency could be possible here in the US. And I realize you probably can't say exactly what it says, but just tell us what are your thoughts about a US. Digital currency?
00:19:25.670 - 00:20:11.406, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're working with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and we're studying the question of how you might design and build and test a hypothetical digital currency. So a couple things. First of all, it's technology research, so we're not engaging in the policy discussion, which I think is really important and deserves a lot of attention and research. But we're really looking at it from the perspective of how might you build one, how might you make it perform really well? What are some of the trade offs? How do you think about security and fault tolerance and redundancy. And in particular, we want to surface data for policymakers. There's too many people out there who are just kind of running these very unrealistic sort of three node DLT setups or something like that. And that's not how this is going to work.
00:20:11.406 - 00:21:02.814, Speaker B: If it ever happens. It's not clear to me that it's necessarily a good idea either. We're still gathering all of the data on that and we're trying to understand, but I have to say it's really exciting and I think it's a really exciting question to research. I also know, unfortunately, there's this false narrative out there that it's either CBDC or crypto. And people are often quite shocked when they find out that we work with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. And we also support several really important developers on bitcoin, and we spend a lot of time working on bitcoin and thinking about the security of decentralized networks. It really does make sense to us, though, because we're just really excited about the future of money and the future of cash and the future of value transfer and whether that innovation is happening in the cryptocurrency world or it can't just happen in the cryptocurrency world.
00:21:02.814 - 00:21:35.420, Speaker B: Fiat currencies are still such a big part of everyone's lives that I think we need to figure out how to bring that innovation to fiat currency as well. And I think that doing so will strengthen the cryptocurrency world. Can you imagine if something like the dollar actually did get launched as a digital currency that would put wallets in the hands of so many people and it would teach them so much about the technology. So, yeah, I don't really see these things in competition at all. I think that they will coexist and there's use cases for both.
00:21:36.190 - 00:21:49.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. It'll be a huge on ramp, essentially. So, last question. What are the main things you're working on at the digital currency initiative that the audience should look out for in the short term?
00:21:49.338 - 00:22:35.310, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the upcoming research with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on central bank digital currency, we're really excited about that, the technical research. In addition to that, we recently announced that we had raised some funding for a dedicated Bitcoin security initiative. So this is an effort where we are dedicating resources to thinking about the longevity of Bitcoin. So DCI has been a home for Bitcoin core developers for, gosh, six years now, so we have provided a stable home for, for example, the lead maintainer of Bitcoin. And I think that's really important. There's a lot of people out there who are giving grants, which is fantastic. But whether or not that's a long term solution for senior developers is another question.
00:22:35.310 - 00:23:39.346, Speaker B: And there are people who like to say that you basically have to get a PhD in Bitcoin in order to really get to the level where you are trusted to do code review and you can do code review on some of the thornier parts of the system. And so as I've been learning more about it this past few years and thinking about it, it just seemed to me like there needed to really be this dedicated effort towards the longevity of the system and the security. And it's also just a fascinating question. Bitcoin has been around for twelve years, and so a lot of people say, look, it hasn't been hacked, it's been twelve years, and there's certainly some truth to that. It's definitely security first, but I also don't know if it's really been tested. What happens if a nation state really comes after Bitcoin and drops a couple of zero days, and how will the network recover? And like I said, I really like to think about how things will break. So part of this effort is to figure out how we can secure it against something like that from a technical point of view, and what are the problems that arise and what do we need to put in place.
00:23:39.346 - 00:23:49.240, Speaker B: And to be clear, there's already a tremendous amount happening across the Bitcoin ecosystem in this area, and we hope to encourage that and plug into some of that.
00:23:50.010 - 00:23:57.218, Speaker A: All right, well, sounds like there's a lot of interesting stuff coming up for you. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.

Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline gensler speaks on synthetic assets as the Fed discusses stablecoins in a conversation with the American Bar Association, securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler hinted that digital assets backed by traditional securities could fall under US.
00:25:05.342 - 00:25:49.786, Speaker A: Securities law. Gensler said, quote, It doesn't matter whether it's a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities, or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities. These platforms, whether in the decentralized or centralized finance space, are implicated by the securities laws and must work within our securities regime. His speech occurred just days after Binance announced the suspension of its stock token program, which had allowed customers to purchase tokenized versions of Tesla, Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Microsoft and Apple. The SEC was not the only us. Regulator looking into digital assets this week, notably the President's Working Group for Financial Markets, a presidential advisory group met on Monday at the behest of U. S.
00:25:49.786 - 00:26:45.306, Speaker A: Treasury Secretary Jen Yellen to discuss, quote, the rapid growth of digital assets. According to a readout published after the meeting, the PWG expects to issue stablecoin related recommendations in the coming months, covering potential benefits, risks and how stablecoins could fit into the US. Regulatory framework. And speaking of stablecoins next headline circle reveals reserves and Paxos snaps back on Tuesday, Circle, the company behind USTC, the second largest stablecoin in circulation, released its latest reserve attestation revealing how USDC is backed based on data from mid July, 61% of USDC is backed by cash or cash equivalents. 13% is in the form of Yankee CDs. 12% sit in US. Treasuries commercial paperbacks 9% and 5% of the reserve's allocation is in corporate bonds.
00:26:45.306 - 00:27:57.170, Speaker A: If those numbers are confusing, don't worry. Even decrypt's Jeff Roberts needed clarification, asking on Twitter Finance people, Is it a big deal that Circle's USDC reserves are 14% non cash equivalents? Someone told me these aren't liquid enough to withstand a run on the stablecoin, but I really don't know. Paxos gave an answer in a downright frothy blog post on Wednesday, which started with a shot across the bow at Circle. Dan Bernstein, general counsel and chief compliance officer at Paxos, wrote, quote I have been reading, with a combination of disbelief and exasperation, the recent claims by Circle that, quote, USDC has become the world's most trusted and regulated dollar digital currency. Neither USDC nor Tether is a regulated digital asset for the simple reason that neither token has a regulator. These tokens are backed by illiquid and risky debt obligations, a critical weakness that no Prudential regulator would allow to exist, as this creates undue risk for their customers. Bernstein contrasted USDC's 61% cash or cash equivalent reserves and USDT's 49.6%
00:27:57.170 - 00:28:44.334, Speaker A: commercial PayPal reserves to that of PAX and BUSD, both of which are managed by Paxos in which he described as regulated stablecoins tied directly to the value of the US. Dollar. PAX and BUSD are backed by 96% cash and cash equivalents. Before signing off, he added, Regulatory oversight is important because it assures stablecoin users that the dollars underlying their stablecoins are secure and will be immediately available when they want them to round out a hectic week in stablecoins.
