00:01:09.006 - 00:01:10.740, Speaker D: Hi Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:01:11.110 - 00:01:17.554, Speaker A: Big news coming out of Reuters this week. Coinbase is exploring going public. Tell us more about this news, how.
00:01:17.592 - 00:01:19.606, Speaker B: Firm it is and how and when.
00:01:19.628 - 00:01:20.920, Speaker A: They might go public.
00:01:21.370 - 00:01:49.214, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know if this would count as big news because there's a kind of a genre in tech reporting where you say big startup is rumored to go public. Well, of course they are. They all are. That's the point. We all know Coinbase is going public. It's just like writing a thing saying Robin Hood is expected to go public maybe this year. I mean there's ten companies you could write that headline about and I don't want to be ungracious but I thought that story was kind of thin because I don't think there's anything to it.
00:01:49.214 - 00:01:57.860, Speaker D: I mean, Coinbase has been rumored to go public this year for a long time and it's either going to happen late this year or next year. So I'm not really sure what the news is here.
00:01:58.470 - 00:02:17.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess you did mention that when we talked about your book the last time you came on the mean just in terms of what Reuters reported, how firm was, what they were reporting, in terms of any SEC registrations or anything more formal like that.
00:02:18.730 - 00:02:58.514, Speaker D: Well, I talked to a couple of sources close to the company and initially Reuters was going to try to run with saying that Morgan Stanley was going to be the underwriter and that's clearly not true. And them saying there's a direct listing, I mean, I think that could be possible. But I think the most interesting thing is going to be what sort of IPO is know because I know when I talked to Fred Urson recently, one of the co founders of Coinbase, he hinted strongly there's going be to some sort of token issuance. So I think it could be America's first combo ICO and IPO which would be super cool. So that's what I'm waiting to hear about. In terms of whether they're going public. Yeah, of course they are.
00:02:58.514 - 00:03:02.518, Speaker D: But I think that part of the story is what's most interesting to me.
00:03:02.684 - 00:03:04.726, Speaker B: And so for that, do you have.
00:03:04.748 - 00:03:06.694, Speaker A: Any more details on what that might look like?
00:03:06.732 - 00:03:15.510, Speaker B: Would it be kind of for some reason I don't get the feeling it's going to be the kind of ICOs that we saw in 2017.
00:03:15.670 - 00:03:18.022, Speaker A: But there are these well known IEOs.
00:03:18.086 - 00:03:20.534, Speaker B: That have been happening, the initial exchange offerings.
00:03:20.662 - 00:03:23.306, Speaker A: Any details on what form they might take?
00:03:23.488 - 00:04:13.274, Speaker D: No, they're playing the cards close to the best on that. And I know, I think as Coinbase has gotten more corporate, I think there's sort of a push to let's just have an IPO like everyone does. But I think a lot of the people at the company, including the Coders, who work there, are real believers in crypto. And it would be sort of lame if they just did a garden variety IPO. But in terms of the regulatory point, that's hard. I mean, are they going to do sell tokens to accredited investors and then sell general shares to the public? Or can they get the SEC to bless some sort of token issuance? Which could happen because if you've been watching Coinbase, they've really been spending a lot of energy hiring Washington insiders. You saw they just hired Judge Paul Gruel, who's a fairly prominent former federal judge.
00:04:13.274 - 00:04:19.646, Speaker D: And then they have their former general counsel, Brian Brooks went to be the head of the what's it called the.
00:04:19.748 - 00:04:28.146, Speaker B: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Controller. It's still comptroller, but pronounced controller. I learned this we should know this.
00:04:28.168 - 00:05:06.270, Speaker D: By now, or I should know by now, but they oversee all the banks. So you can obviously see them trying to put the political lobbying push on to kind of get a blessing for this. And since they're the most mainstream crypto company, who knows, maybe they will get a blessing to do a token offering. But I'm pretty sure whatever's going on, they're going to hold it really tightly because leaking this stuff is just going to piss off the regulators and could imperil a token listing. So this is just me speculating. I mean, who knows, maybe they'll chicken out and just raise the cash the ordinary way. But I think a lot of us in the crypto community hope they do something more ambitious.
00:05:07.250 - 00:05:28.760, Speaker B: So just to go back to what you mentioned earlier about this former federal Judge Paul Gruel, he also held a significant post at Facebook, which is actually where they hired him from. Can you just give us a sense, a little bit more about his history and why this is significant and perhaps relevant here in this discussion of whether or not Coinbase will go public?
00:05:29.290 - 00:06:01.818, Speaker D: Well, I mean, that's an important position. I mean, I think they're calling him Chief Legal Officer, but he's their general counsel and Coinbase is also presiding like every crypto company and kind of a lot of legal messes. I mean they're getting class actions over the Bitcoin cash thing. There's various SEC investigations, the IRS, and he's got to make all that sort of settle down or even better go away. And I think just his cloud is a former federal judge and he's well known in the Valley. He ruled over like the Apple Samsung trials. He ruled over Google and Oracle.
00:06:01.818 - 00:06:18.520, Speaker D: So I think that kind of credibility is one going to be good for their legal strategy, but also he's just someone people know in the legal world, probably including in the SEC and in Washington. So I think his contacts will probably help grease whatever's going to happen next.
00:06:19.130 - 00:06:20.866, Speaker A: And in terms of having their former.
00:06:20.898 - 00:06:32.794, Speaker B: Chief legal officer Brian Brooks and the position of the Office of the Control of the Currency, what is the significance of that as well? What does that department oversee and how.
00:06:32.832 - 00:06:34.154, Speaker A: Could that be relevant here?
00:06:34.272 - 00:07:11.110, Speaker D: Well, they're the ones who issued federal bank charters and say who can be a bank and who obviously with things like the Bit license in New York very unpopular and sort of fractured regulation and hostility to crypto. I think having someone like Brooks at the head of that, he could maybe take measures to sweep away a lot of the kind of state impediments and put in a kind of clear federal licensing regime which I think could really boost the American crypto scene. I don't think it'll ever be at the level of Korea or Switzerland, but get it a bit closer and make it more crypto friendly.
00:07:11.850 - 00:07:34.566, Speaker B: And so earlier when you discussed Coinbase going public, you phrased it as them raising capital. But if Reuters is correct in the notion that perhaps they will just do a direct listing, then they wouldn't actually raise capital. Right. So what would the significance of doing it that way be and how would that affect their investors differently?
00:07:34.758 - 00:08:15.740, Speaker D: Well, I mean, I think obviously at this point there's a lot of early investors who want to cash, you know, a good way to cash out is selling shares to the public. So I think Spotify did a direct listing and there's also I think an increasing backlash against Know IPO underwriting thing where all the bankers and the lawyers feed off it and then put aside certain shares for their best friends and then sell it to the public. So I think just selling shares directly would let all the insiders kind of get rich and then the shares would be public. And I think that's an important symbolic step for them. But I'm still holding out for a token offering of some sort because if they don't do it, who is going to do.
00:08:18.110 - 00:08:26.046, Speaker B: Know? Even though, as you mentioned, there is always a lot of talk about different tech companies that will go public at any given point. In time.
00:08:26.148 - 00:08:27.662, Speaker A: I do think that there is something.
00:08:27.716 - 00:08:37.986, Speaker B: Significant about the idea of the first crypto exchange in the US. Going public. So in that sense, what do you think that would signify? Why would that be a big mean?
00:08:38.008 - 00:09:14.990, Speaker D: You know, I've said think, you know, a lot of people hate Coinbase and a lot of people think it's know not your keys, not your know, dislike it. But the reality is for most Americans who own crypto, that's their first point of call. And for the industry, it's almost coinbase is too big to fail. I would know if Coinbase fails, it would be, I think, a decade long setback to the rest of the crypto world. And conversely, if they IPO, I mean, that would really mainstream them in a lot of ways and a lot of people could ride their coattails, and I think it would really legitimize the crypto industry in mainstream finance.
00:09:15.570 - 00:09:16.846, Speaker A: So in a moment, we're going to.
00:09:16.868 - 00:09:21.806, Speaker B: Talk a little bit more about the timing of the IPO and kind of.
00:09:21.828 - 00:09:23.674, Speaker A: The overall market for cryptocurrency.
00:09:23.722 - 00:09:26.580, Speaker B: But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:10:21.510 - 00:10:24.130, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Jeff Roberts.
00:10:24.470 - 00:10:35.000, Speaker B: So Coinbase's recent valuation was at $8 billion in an IPO. Where would you guess that their market cap might go?
00:10:35.450 - 00:11:16.600, Speaker D: Believe it or not, I would take the over because Coinbase stands out not just because they're a crypto company, but unlike a lot of unicorns, they've been making a profit, like not every quarter, but by and mean, they've got a pretty solid business. And if you look at the likes of Uber and not Airbnb, but WeWork I mean, these places just bleeding money. They raise more and more money and their losses are staggering. Whereas Coinbase is a profitable company, which I think would allow them to perhaps overshoot their valuation. I mean, I don't know if that's happened recently. Most IPOs in the last year or two have been kind of flops, but I have more hope for Coinbase than some of the others.
00:11:17.210 - 00:11:18.902, Speaker A: And what do you think of that.
00:11:18.956 - 00:11:34.042, Speaker B: In terms of the overall market right now? Because the block recently ran a story talking about how metrics for bitcoin searches for social media, followings of crypto exchanges for Wikipedia, page views of bitcoin, and.
00:11:34.096 - 00:11:36.234, Speaker A: Also how trading volumes for bitcoin are.
00:11:36.272 - 00:11:42.926, Speaker B: All down from their peaks at the end of 2017, early 2018. So how much do you think the.
00:11:42.948 - 00:11:45.374, Speaker A: Frothiness of the overall cryptocurrency market will.
00:11:45.412 - 00:11:50.526, Speaker B: Matter to the Coinbase listing, or do you think that Coinbase listing all on.
00:11:50.548 - 00:11:52.190, Speaker A: Its own will create that frothiness?
00:11:52.530 - 00:12:38.334, Speaker D: That's a great question, especially your last part. Maybe that could inaugurate a new kind of bitcoin sort of bull market. But I think Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, and their investors Andreessen Horowitz, they're all playing kind of a long game and seeing it, I think as many as your listeners do as a cyclical thing. Since I covered bitcoin starting in 2013, I've seen maybe like three crypto winters, and I think we're used to this. There will be surges of excitement, then things settle down, then it goes up again. But I think you're very right. I mean, if they could time their IPO to coincide with the bitcoin bull run, like, oh boy, but maybe they just can't be bothered and this is just another kind of house cleaning task they want to do as they keep building stuff.
00:12:38.532 - 00:12:44.594, Speaker A: And do you have a sense how well Coinbase has been faring, despite the overall interest being down?
00:12:44.712 - 00:12:52.260, Speaker B: You talked about their profitability. Is that something that's kept up in this sort of, I guess, bear market or slow market?
00:12:52.870 - 00:13:40.738, Speaker D: I can't speak to the last quarter, but I think overall we've been quite profitable. And strangely, the pandemic crisis has benefited. I know Robinhood did really well. They're not a crypto company, obviously, but I think crypto, same thing. They had a huge trading volume and whenever there's volatility, which there was during the height of the COVID cris, companies like Coinbase benefit. My question for Coinbase, though, is where is another revenue stream going to come from? I mean, they've got trickles from custody and other tie ups here and there, but I still think they're very dependent on trading. And I think that's the challenge for most of the industry is to try to figure out other lines of business that aren't just kind of Hobies or distractions, but really can bring in the you know, that's what I'm waiting to see, too.
00:13:40.904 - 00:13:44.354, Speaker A: And do you have a sense of how increased competition in the US has.
00:13:44.392 - 00:14:05.210, Speaker B: Affected their trading volume? Because, for instance, I remember that when Binance US launched here in the US, they either cut their trading fees completely or at least slashed them, and meanwhile, at the same time, Coinbase raised theirs. So do you have a sense of whether people are seeking better prices elsewhere?
00:14:05.630 - 00:14:46.950, Speaker D: I haven't heard that. I mean, you probably know better than me, but my read on it is Binance, especially since they're not available in every state hasn't gotten that much traction in the US. And I guess it depends how sticky they are. How easily do people move from brokerage to brokerage? I think a lot of people are like, yeah, Coinbase charges me 299, but is that such a big deal? So I'd be curious. I'm sure places like the Block and Masari have some good research on that, but my limited understanding is I think a lot of crypto customers are quite sticky. The hardcore traders, of course, are probably jumping around, but I think a lot of your everyday retail investor is not going to jump ship to save like a bachelor commission.
00:14:47.930 - 00:15:00.566, Speaker B: All right. And so I guess to explore the Token area a little bit more, when you talked about how that's kind of what you're hoping for and looking to do you have any particular preferred method.
00:15:00.598 - 00:15:02.810, Speaker A: For how they do that listing?
00:15:03.310 - 00:15:17.758, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a bit above my pay grade, but yeah, I'd be curious what blockchain will they use? Will they develop their own? Will they use ethereum? And I mean, just talking to people who really know this stuff, including Bellaji and professor at Cornell, forgive me, I.
00:15:17.764 - 00:15:19.954, Speaker B: Can never say, emily Gunseer, yes.
00:15:20.072 - 00:15:55.600, Speaker D: He predicted down the road we're going to see every company will be tokenized like Nike and General Motors, and that eventually we could see Nicely and Nasdaq buying the likes of Coinbase and issuing all the stocks as tokens. Which makes perfect sense because for record keeping and tracking stocks and splitting stocks, blockchain is so much superior to what's being done right now. But that might be five or ten years off. So that's, I think, where we're going to go to. But in terms of what happens in the next year or two, that's a great question. What the mechanics will be, I don't know.
00:15:56.290 - 00:16:06.546, Speaker B: Okay. And I guess, yeah, we'll see what happens with that. But maybe Coinbase itself will pioneer some way and perhaps create a new business out of that.
00:16:06.728 - 00:16:21.320, Speaker D: Yeah, I sure hope so. I mean, there's pressure internally. I think a lot of the longtime Coinbase investors and employees, I think, would feel betrayed if they didn't do that. But we all know what financial realities are, so I'm very curious to see what happens.
00:16:21.770 - 00:16:30.982, Speaker B: And when you talked about some of these employees, I know in your book there was that period of a lot of tension at Coinbase, especially in 2018.
00:16:31.126 - 00:16:32.714, Speaker A: What's your sense of how things are.
00:16:32.752 - 00:16:40.314, Speaker B: Now and whether or not Brian Armstrong has been able to kind of right the ship and get everyone back going.
00:16:40.352 - 00:16:41.558, Speaker A: In the same direction?
00:16:41.734 - 00:17:12.230, Speaker D: I think aside one recent scandal, there's been a lot less drama out of Coinbase, both in terms of kind of negative headlines and employee turnover and fighting. So I think they are in a stable place. One thing I forgot to mention for the IPO, I can't wait to see what the S one looks like because that's when you find out who owns how many shares. I mean, I've heard on good authority that Brian Armstrong has got a supermajority. I've heard Fred, the co founder might have about 10%. I'd like to see how much Andreessen has. So that's going to be really interesting.
00:17:12.230 - 00:17:32.400, Speaker D: But in terms of the management, I think they've done a good job of stabilizing their operations. And there's just a lot less drama out of Coinbase than there used to be, which is a good thing when you want to go public, because you might recall what happened to WeWork. You got this founder who's like, smoking weed and on airplanes and running a cult, and look what happened to them.
00:17:33.730 - 00:17:36.190, Speaker B: Right. And do you have a sense of.
00:17:36.260 - 00:17:39.040, Speaker A: Why it is now that things have been calmer there?
00:17:40.130 - 00:17:58.390, Speaker D: I think it's just the adult supervision. You've got, like, their COO, Emily Choi, who's kind of you got basically veteran executives in a startup and a younger company. You've got a bunch of people in their 20s who've never managed something really big before. So I think having veteran executives makes a company more boring, but it makes it more stable.
00:17:59.530 - 00:18:02.920, Speaker B: All right, well, anything else you want to add about the Coinbase news?
00:18:03.770 - 00:18:13.180, Speaker D: No, I'd like to hear more details. I mean, if Reuters has them, I'd like to see what they've really heard. But for now, my take is let's wait and see.
00:18:13.550 - 00:18:24.602, Speaker B: Okay? Yeah, I agree that there's still a lot more to be uncovered. Well, anyway, thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:18:24.746 - 00:18:26.378, Speaker D: Thanks, Laura. Always a pleasure.

00:19:07.310 - 00:19:57.930, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline center Blacklists, an ethereum address holding USDC. The center consortium, jointly run by Circle and Coinbase, has Blacklisted, an address that holds $100,000 worth of the stablecoin USDC. In response to a request from law enforcement, circle said in a statement, quote, while we cannot comment on the specifics of law enforcement requests, center complies with binding court orders that have appropriate jurisdiction over the organization. The Blacklisted address can no longer receive USDC, nor can any of the USDC in the address be transferred on chain. The Block reports that USDC balances in Blacklisted addresses may be, quote, wholly and permanently unrecoverable.
00:19:57.930 - 00:21:13.060, Speaker A: Next headline dozens of crypto companies get $30 million plus from PPP bailout loans. More than 75 crypto and blockchain companies received over $30 million in payroll loans due to the Coronavirus Polychain Capital Consensus and CyberTrace, the latter two of which disclosure are previous sponsors of my shows, as well as Tron and Zcash's Electric Coin Company all obtained funds. For instance, Consensus received between $5 million and $10 million from Signature Bank. Bitrex got between $1 million and $2 million from Celtic Bank Circle and Shapeshift. Each was granted between 1 million and $2 million from Silicon Valley Bank and Cybersecurity and Blockchain solutions firm Cryptoblocks appears to have obtained between $1 million and $5 million. Several others, including IOHK USA CipherTrace, Polychain Electric Coin Company and Blockfolio each received between $350,000 and $1 million. In a report, the Block said development firms accounted for 29% of the firms who got loans, while financial services companies received 25%.
00:21:13.060 - 00:22:16.534, Speaker A: Trading platforms came in next at 12% and eleven of the recipients had executed initial coin offerings that had raked in $341,000,000. Next headline Ave brings under collateralized lending to DFI and NAB's $4.5 million in seed investment DFI Lending Protocol Ave launched a new service for credit delegation in which a user can deposit funds, earn a higher interest rate and lend those funds out to a designated person who has not put down any collateral. In the absence of collateral, the borrower and lender use a legally binding contract which specifies interest rates and repayment deadlines created by blockchain based Open Law. The Block reports that if the borrower does not repay the loan, the lender, quote, can take him or her to court as long as they are in the same jurisdiction. Ave had some other news this week. ParaFi invested $4.5
00:22:16.534 - 00:23:06.840, Speaker A: million into what is currently the third largest DFI lending protocol. Next Headline the next year in Ethereum tyler Smith, a validator for Ethereum 20 testnets, wrote up a tweetstorm on Ethereum 20 saying it will be, quote, the most pivotal event in all of Crypto since the launch of ETH 10. People talk about Bitcoin having events and he said they are minor league compared to this. He said a lot of institutional money was waiting to see if Ethereum would deliver. However, he did also bring up a number of major concerns, such as how taxes should be handled for what he called ETH 20 Ether versus ETH 1.0 ether asking the Ethereum Foundation to make an official statement saying that they were the same.
