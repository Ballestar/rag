Attorney in the National Security section at the United States Attorney's Office.
00:00:52.526 - 00:00:54.430, Speaker A: Welcome, Zia and Jesse.
00:00:54.770 - 00:00:55.326, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:55.428 - 00:00:57.600, Speaker C: Thank you. Thanks for having us.
00:00:57.970 - 00:01:25.510, Speaker A: You've prosecuted a number of federal criminal and civil forfeiture cases, including cryptocurrency involving cryptocurrency, including some of the most well known ones, such as the welcome to Video case, which led to the takedown of one of the Web's largest child pornography sites, and a case involving the North Korea affiliated Lazarus group, plus another one involving Hamas and the Al Qatan brigades. How did you two come to prosecute so many cases involving cryptocurrency?
00:01:26.730 - 00:02:22.890, Speaker C: I can go first, and then I'll let Zia sort of explain because I think our roots are actually very different. I started and cut my teeth in the Superior Court Division at our office, prosecuting mainly domestic violence and sex offense cases. During my time prosecuting sex offense cases, I learned an expertise in the revenge porn world, which is where individuals sort of use cyber techniques to put out explicit photos of people that either broke up with them or upset them in some way. And I got really interested in the cyber world. And then when I moved to the National Security Section, I was lucky enough to team up with Zia, who had already developed this amazing expertise in this field. And from there, it sort of took off Zia and his team that he had developed, and then I got to jump in and help develop as well, had created this amazing world that's leading the forefront of DOJ in these kinds of cases.
00:02:23.950 - 00:03:06.818, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. Thanks so much. So as you said, I'm now a judge, so I'm no longer a prosecutor, so I can speak not in my role as a judge, but talking about as a prosecutor. Starting in 2008 until September 11, 2020, was prosecuting cases. Kind of what led me to the path of cryptocurrency was my focus was on money laundering and asset recovery for victims. And it seemed very clear early on there was, like, people who started laundering money in Second Life, or there was this initial sort of trend of like, is virtual currency something that criminals would get into? And one of the most fun things about being a prosecutor is seeing the ingenuity of criminals.
00:03:06.818 - 00:03:59.906, Speaker B: They're finding new and fascinating ways. And you always think like, oh, man, if they'd only channel these powers for good, think of all the things they could do. But it's like a game of chess between prosecutor investigators and people who are violating the law and that you're always just trying to catch up and keep up with them. And so several years ago, about like five or six years ago, another couple prosecutors over from Maine justice, particularly one Alden Pelker, and then Jesse and I then also worked with another colleague, Chris Brown, who has done a lot of big cryptocurrency cases, including currently cases that are charged in the district court, like mixing cases and things like that. We all just sat down. Like, we need to have a more coordinated way of coming at this problem and different agencies of different expertise. IRS is at the forefront, and they're super smart about getting in, working the blockchain.
00:03:59.906 - 00:04:35.220, Speaker B: And HSI is really good with undercover, and FBI is this national security portfolio. And so we kind of formed our own informal strike force, which we called because we thought it sounded cool, and we wanted to make T shirts that said that Strike Force. And so I think, like anything in federal service, it's like there's a lot of elbow room to kind of grow and try out new things, and you just want to find people who are mission oriented and excited about trying those new things. And so we were able to kind of organically find a group of people who are interested in cryptocurrency and kind of each had our own different strengths that we could play on each other on.
00:04:35.910 - 00:05:11.406, Speaker A: I like the strike force thing. It doesn't sound exactly how government would normally work. You imagine it would typically be very bureaucratic, but I like that idea that you just called it that because it sounded cool. Thank you. So let's dive, or before we dive into the details on these cases, let's actually just establish some facts for the listeners, because I think even before researching this, I didn't really know some of the stuff, but most, if not all of these cases are civil forfeiture cases. What is civil forfeiture and what happens in a case like that, sure, I.
00:05:11.428 - 00:05:34.310, Speaker B: Can take that one. So civil forfeiture is interesting because it's so different than your normal criminal case. Like, in a criminal case, it might be the United States versus the faruki right. Like, that's against a person. But civil forfeiture is against the thing. It's United States versus 220 cryptocurrency accounts or United States versus one Ford truck. It's a way to go after things.
00:05:34.310 - 00:06:09.154, Speaker B: It's a less punitive way of enforcing the law. You don't have to actually arrest a person and try to take their property. You can just go directly against the thing and then people the burden of proof is still on the government, but that people then can come forward and say like, hey, actually this thing belongs to me. And there's a process by which then the court then says, has the government met its burden of proof to show this was involved in the crime or proceeds of the crime? And if it is, then the person soles a defense to say like, look, I had no idea someone was using my car to commit this crime or I had no idea someone was using my bank account to do this. And then they get the property returned to them if they can prove that.
00:06:09.352 - 00:06:37.690, Speaker C: And if I could just add, there's a whole spectrum of civil forfeiture. I mean, it can start as small as someone forfeiting your property and after they seize it at a stop of some sort to the kinds of cases that we deal with, which is seizing a domain that might be proffering terrorist finance or child pornography. So there's a whole range and they can differ in many ways, but at the end of the day, it's a civil forfeiture kind of action.
00:06:40.210 - 00:07:01.090, Speaker A: And maybe this is sort of just part and parcel of what we were just discussing. But if you know that a certain person is affiliated with one of these properties, then why wouldn't you just make that person a defendant? Is that just a different type of case or how does it work when you have that connection?
00:07:01.670 - 00:07:41.678, Speaker C: Sure, well, I can start and Zia, if you want to go from there and add to it, there's a lot of reasons for it. First of all, there's a different level of proof for civil forfeiture and criminal charges. And most importantly probably goes to what Zia just said, which is that the civil action is against the property, not a person, and the criminal action is going to be against a person. And with a criminal action, you have to prove a mens rea. You have to prove which is an intent that goes with each statute. And there's a lot of different steps that go with that that lead to our high burden of proof that the government takes on proudly. But with civil forfeiture, it's all about the property.
00:07:41.678 - 00:07:58.280, Speaker C: Like what is about this property that was involved in wrongdoing in some way. So there are a lot of considerations that sort of differentiate the two. And there are a lot of nuances that help prosecutors decide whether they want to go the civil route, the criminal route, or you can dual track it as well.
00:07:58.890 - 00:09:01.050, Speaker B: The one thing I add is that there's a lot of people who have commented about Department of justice actions that they do what's called name and shame indictments, where there may be someone in North Korea or there may be someone in Syria that they can't actually get their hands on the actual person. It's like, what have you accomplished by doing that? And so civil forfeiture is important because it's an actual way to have concrete disruption in national security cases where in the kind of name and know that that person's life is not necessarily impacted. In a civil case, you might know someone in North Korea has stolen these funds and things like that, but if they never leave North Korea, what is the point of criminally charging them necessarily? But the civil, you actually go and seize the funds. You're actually able to get the money. So there may be instances, many instances, where you take the less punitive route of civil forfeiture, because what is the point of adding those additional resources to criminally charge someone that you would never get a chance to actually prosecute? You can't criminally prosecute someone absentia they have to actually be present in the United States, in the United States District courtroom.
00:09:01.870 - 00:09:26.580, Speaker A: All right, so now let's turn to some of these cases. There's one pretty interesting one in which the government, maybe at least from your work, you were able to run a terrorist website for the first time, and that was involving a Hamas group called Al Qasam Brigades. Why don't you just start by describing who they are?
00:09:27.270 - 00:10:05.786, Speaker C: Sure. The Al Qasam Brigades is the military wing of Hamas, and they're a designated terrorist organization by the US. Government, which lends itself to certain types of restrictions, which include sanctions. And if you give any material support to them, then material support charges. So that designation is important. And in that case, it was sort of part of a larger campaign that Z and I led against taking down and dismantling three separate cyber oriented terrorist campaigns, two that directly involved cryptocurrency and one that tertiary involvement.
00:10:05.978 - 00:10:09.070, Speaker A: And what were they doing with cryptocurrency?
00:10:09.490 - 00:11:07.886, Speaker C: Sure. So each of the three terror groups was acting distinctly, but to speak specifically to the Al Qasam Brigade, since that's what you raised in that case. And it all sort of started on Twitter, but the Alcassem Brigades put out an announcement on their Twitter publicly asking for Bitcoin donations from their supporters. And what it started out with was a static address for the supporters to send to. And then from there, we and the DOJ and our investigatory partners at IRS and HSI were able to watch as the Al Qasam Brigades developed and learned more about cryptocurrency. So eventually, they shifted their finance campaign from Twitter to their websites, which were Alcassam Net, alcassam PS, and Qasam PS. And on those websites, they started to say, hey, supporters, send us your bitcoin by clicking on and again on those websites.
00:11:07.886 - 00:12:09.922, Speaker C: It was just a static address, but purportedly to avoid any government and law enforcement detection. They then changed their techniques and started doing dynamic addresses. So each individual who wanted to donate would click on the website, and an address would be generated for that supporter to donate to. And so throughout that process, the terrorist group was able to raise a lot of money from supporters all over the world. Through a lot of work from our amazing law enforcement, they were able to track both the addresses that the Al Qasam Brigades was generating on this website as well as all the addresses that were sending to it. And then through our work there, including multiple different legal techniques, we were able to determine how the website itself was run, and from there, through judicial authorization, was able to run the website for 30 days. And how that exactly worked was that as part of our seizure action, which is related to the civil forfeiture, we seized the domain.
00:12:09.922 - 00:12:59.078, Speaker C: And sometimes when you seize a domain, the domain name just is transferred to a splash page run by the government. So, essentially, a splash page that says this website was supportive of terrorists or supportive of child pornography, and so it's now owned by the government. But in this case, what we did instead was redirect the website to a government run website that was an exact mirror image of the prior terrorist website. And through this, our law enforcement and the government was able to run the website for 30 days. And during that time, people continued to visit the website and donate money to the Alcasam Brigades throughout this until after that 30 day period when we filed our civil forfeiture complaint and the splash page was put up and just to.
00:12:59.084 - 00:13:09.442, Speaker A: Go back to spell it out for the audience. So why was it that they switched from just one particular address to these dynamically generated addresses?
00:13:09.586 - 00:13:12.114, Speaker B: Because of Jesse Brooks. Because of Jesse Brooks.
00:13:12.162 - 00:13:13.258, Speaker A: That's why she's coming?
00:13:13.344 - 00:13:17.910, Speaker B: Yeah. No, because she went and got their money. Right. It's the cat and mouse. Sorry. Go ahead, Jesse.
00:13:18.070 - 00:13:50.710, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, at the end of the like, terrorists are trying to avoid law enforcement detection, too, and they're learning while we're learning. And they can tell that we're investigating their cases, we're freezing their assets. We're starting to figure out what's going on here. And so we began to work with virtual exchanges to freeze assets. And from there, they decided that they needed to change their techniques. And Terrace used to rely on financial institutions. They still do, but they're developing and now are learning more about cryptocurrency.
00:13:50.710 - 00:14:05.820, Speaker C: We're watching them develop more and more and learn more and more about cryptocurrency, which is in this specific case, they move from static to dynamic, which is much more difficult to track. But because we sort of already knew what was going on, we had a head start on.
00:14:06.510 - 00:14:17.550, Speaker A: So how were you able to find all the addresses that the generator was creating plus all the addresses that sent to them? Well, I guess maybe that part isn't as hard once you have the address.
00:14:17.620 - 00:14:50.014, Speaker B: But, Laura, a magician never reveals their secrets. They have to tune into the sequel podcast when we give the peek behind the curtain, but, yeah, I think it's as Jesse said it's the tremendous work of the IRS agents. Chris giancheski, the HSI agent, bill capra. I mean, these guys were working a ton with the FBI partners to go through and really figure out what was going on. And they use sophisticated tools. I mean, you saw in a press release there was a reference as well. Chain analysis has done a couple presentations that they participated.
00:14:50.014 - 00:15:13.520, Speaker B: Exigent was another contractor. So I think it was just look, I mean, the agents spent a lot of time working. It's not like there's no one trick. It's work, right? Like they were working with using the legal tools like jesse was saying, search and seizure warrants to get email content or get financial records from subpoenas, leveraging relationships with overseas partners, and then undercover work. It's a little bit of everything.
00:15:13.890 - 00:15:43.500, Speaker C: And I think something that was really special about this action and the follow up ones is that it was an interagency effort all run by people that actually really care and are interested in cryptocurrency and who sort of believe in what cryptocurrency is trying to do. So we were all just trying to figure out who are the bad actors using cryptocurrency and how can we attack them, because the DOJ and these other agencies are just trying to understand these virtual assets and make sure that they're not used for bad.
00:15:44.190 - 00:15:53.390, Speaker A: And earlier when I asked about alcasan brigades, you said there were also other groups. So what happened with those? How were they using bitcoin or cryptocurrency?
00:15:53.730 - 00:17:05.566, Speaker C: Sure, so I can speak to that. So there were two other campaigns that were rolled out as part of this large dismantling that z and I led along with our law enforcement. So the second one was al qaeda, and they were using telegram. So what was another interesting thing other than cryptocurrency is that in all three of these actions, the terrorist groups were not only relying on cryptocurrency, but also relying on social media and new techniques, just sort of showing how they were becoming smarter when it comes to using cyber tools. So al qaeda through telegram was raising money for really violent causes, I mean, not being shy about what they were asking for money for pictures of weapons, pictures of military gear, and seeking donations of different cryptocurrency to help support that. And what was sort of upsetting and disturbing about the whole thing was that a lot of the telegram channels were hiding behind charity names. And so they made it sound like it was charity for individuals that were refugees or people that needed help in syria, but when in fact, they were really just raising money through cryptocurrency know, violent causes.
00:17:05.566 - 00:18:02.534, Speaker C: And so through a lot of the same agents and the same sort of interagency effort that was similarly completed, all these telegram channels were tracked, including all the different addresses that received cryptocurrency on behalf of these violent causes. So those were seized and sought for forfeiture as well in a separate civil forfeiture complaint. So that's the second one. And then the third one was an ISIS COVID related case. And so this was less centered around cryptocurrency, although there's some cryptocurrency involved with it. But this case was similarly devastating in that it was ISIS taking advantage of the COVID outbreak all over the world, but particularly targeting the United States, creating a website and multiple Facebook accounts that linked you directly to this website that was selling fake PPE. And this website was created pretty soon after COVID started spreading pretty wildly in the United States.
00:18:02.534 - 00:18:26.894, Speaker C: And there was very little shame in that. They were selling to customers in the United States that had purported to serve hospitals, nursing homes, such such things like that. And so through our action, same sort of interagency effort and just following the social media campaigns, we were able to seize that website as well as the Facebook accounts as well, and actually just.
00:18:26.932 - 00:18:53.590, Speaker A: To go back and know. And this may be the case for all of them, but I especially noticed it with the Alcasm Brigades. You were naming unhosted Bitcoin addresses in your complaint, meaning ones in which the Alcasan Brigades were the people who had the control of the private keys. So how do you seize funds from an address like that in which the owner is really just the person who controls the private keys?
00:18:54.650 - 00:19:55.286, Speaker B: I think there's a couple of different ways we go after unhosted wallets, right? One is that we might be able to use legal tools like through warrants or through cooperators, or someone who could get us recovery seeds or who can get us a private keys. We may be able to collect that information ourselves and get that in other instances, it's more treating it like the stolen art model. And so that we basically you think about what happens when a famous piece art is taken out of museum, is that by publicizing that that is something that is illicit, it collapses the resale value of that. And then it also allows you so the person who then maybe stole the Mona Lisa, it's worth $100 million. It's now worth maybe $10 million or $50 million, something much less. But then not only have you collapsed the resale value, anyone that's legitimate that then does business with that, they should be on notice and says like, well, the museum then goes and rebuys it, or something like that. If they fail to do their due diligence and knowing that there is this in the art world, there's a stolen art crime index.
00:19:55.286 - 00:20:25.074, Speaker B: Like, people check that first before they purchase it. They could be subject to potential money laundering or other criminal charges. So the same thing here with cryptocurrency addresses, even for the unhosted wallets, for the ones where the government can't go and recover it through legal tools, you've not only now reduced the value of it because now people know that's the beauty of the blockchain, right? It's all public. You don't have to have this highly sophisticated stolen art crime index. It's out there for everyone to see. Oh my gosh. Yeah.
00:20:25.074 - 00:21:01.582, Speaker B: This one address is allegedly part of a criminal terrorist scheme. If someone on local Bitcoin sits me up and says like, hey, I want to send you and do a currency exchange, and I see what address is coming from, you don't need to be some big bank with a sophisticated AML program. This is something anyone can do from the ease of their smartphone. But moreover, cryptocurrency exchanges absolutely are looking at those addresses and that they're looking, know, Chainalysis, elliptic TRM, all these other big entities that are doing this sort of analytical work, they're highlighting those addresses and pushing that out to exchanges. So the exchanges know, like, this is functioning like an OFAC sanctions list.
00:21:01.716 - 00:21:13.410, Speaker A: And what happens if they do something like send the money to a mixer? Or is that something where then the mixer would reject the funds? Or how does that work?
00:21:13.560 - 00:21:34.918, Speaker B: I think it depends on the mixer. Right. Like no different than a cryptocurrency exchange. There are cryptocurrency exchanges that conduct no KYC and in fact are avowed and that they want people to come and bring their illicit proceeds there. The Department of justice has charged a lot of those cases. As I said, we have one here in DC. That Chris Brown and the team from IRS.
00:21:34.918 - 00:22:01.726, Speaker B: Matt price's charge involving the Graham's Helix case. And so one of the allegations in those charges relates to alleged money laundering. Know when funds come in, not questioning the source of it. So absolutely, I mean, I think in the sanctions context or at other ones, it's the financial institutions that are the gatekeepers. And so DOJ has gone after them. Right. You can't necessarily get to the individuals because of the volume, but what you can go is to go to the gatekeepers and say, look, financial institutions.
00:22:01.726 - 00:22:16.840, Speaker B: And that at bottom is what a mixer is. That's what this recent decision from the DC district Court has said in that case. But as well as from all our other cases. And Finson has said as well, when you're exchanging you're a financial institution, you have to do AML work. And if you don't, you could get.
00:22:18.010 - 00:22:39.520, Speaker A: So now, just to go back to the Al Qaeda case, I wanted to ask a little bit more about that telegram group where you said that they were disguised as charity groups. When people would go into the groups, would they realize kind of what the purpose was of the donations or was that also masked once you were in the group?
00:22:40.370 - 00:23:15.674, Speaker C: So a lot of this is spelled out in the civil forfeiture complaint, which is public, but we can't possibly try and get into the head of everyone that went and visited or even the ones that maybe donated. But at the end of the day, it was pretty clear from the postings. If it's called a charity XYZ, the posting would have a picture of a weapon, and so raise money for purchasing this or raise money for this cause. So we don't purport to know what every single person was thinking. But at the end of the day, it was pretty clear from these Telegram channels what the purpose was.
00:23:15.872 - 00:23:47.714, Speaker B: I think dovetailing on that just really quickly. As a Muslim American, one of the things that there's always this fear of is like, oh, if you're donating to a charity, is this charity one that's actually doing what it says to you? And frankly, that's true of everyone. Right. Like, when you donate to any charity. But in particular, there have been charged criminal cases of charities in the past that were financing terrorism, and donors sometimes are like, well, oh, my God, I had no idea that's doing it. So I think part of the work that the team did here was so important because there were these charities nominally that were doing that, where people may not have known that.
00:23:47.752 - 00:23:48.050, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:48.120 - 00:24:12.790, Speaker B: And I think, again, to the credit of Jesse and the team, there weren't donors that were charged. Right. It was just going after the institution that was collecting the money. But part of, again, like that stolen art model, now people are on notice. Like, if you Google that charity, do any basic sort of foundational research on it, you're going to see, like, oh, my God. Not only when I go in the Telegram channel and look three or four layers down do I see pictures of machine guns. I'll see that they were named in a government complaint.
00:24:12.790 - 00:24:25.780, Speaker B: So I know that this is not like, a safe space to donate funds to, and they were highlighting the anonymity and things like that. And so I think that it was apparent, but now it is very apparent that what they were doing.
00:24:26.310 - 00:24:47.560, Speaker A: Yeah. That's something that fascinated me a little bit about when you took over the Alcasan Brigades website. Alcassem Brigades could have very easily just told people, hey, we're not in control of that website anymore. And I believe they tried to. So what happened then? Why did people still go there and use the site?
00:24:48.090 - 00:25:23.842, Speaker C: Yeah, that's so interesting. And I remember we sort of worked through that before it all happened. Like, what if this happens? Is it really worth it? Should we just put up a splash page? But at the end of the day, people want to believe what they want to believe on the Internet. And we had a website that looked exactly like the old website. And if people wanted to think it was the same thing, great. What actually happened was that the Alcasam Brigades tweeted out, using the methods of their original campaign financing, that their website had been taken over. But at the end of the day, no one really knew if it was the Twitter account.
00:25:23.842 - 00:26:22.550, Speaker C: That was hacked or the website that had been hacked and people continued to donate. And part of it was maybe some people believed that and some people stopped visiting the website. But we also wanted to sort of show that the DOJ sort of knows what's going on here. And when people go visit a terrorist website, we want them to be uncertain whether they're visiting a terrorist website or the DOJ, and maybe hesitate before they donate money. Because one thing that's very important to us is that in these terrorist financing cases, when we seize money, we try and direct it towards this victims funds that's for victims of terror, and that's run by the DOJ. And there's a few rules about how the money gets in there. But our hope is that at least a big chunk of the money that we forfeited here, including from people that were donating to terrorists, both when the DOJ ran the website and when it was actually a terrorist website, is going to be redirected to victims that have suffered unimaginable crimes from terrorists.
00:26:23.530 - 00:26:50.606, Speaker A: I know we already just touched on this very briefly about the FaceMaskCenter.com, and as you mentioned, the role of cryptocurrency here was fairly tangential, but I still wanted to ask, so exactly how were they using cryptocurrency? And I just find it fascinating that they used this crisis with COVID to try to perpetrate this scam again, that.
00:26:50.628 - 00:27:46.898, Speaker B: Goes right to the ingenuity. They're always coming up with new ways. And as Jesse said, the website sprung up just days after the COVID crisis started. And so the connection to cryptocurrency is that Zubea Shanaz was charged in New York about, I think like a year and a half ago and pled guilty. And so she was sending money to the person who is identified in the forfeiture complaint. And so what she was doing was that she was getting through ISIS, was getting stolen PII. People that are stealing their personal identifying information and credit cards in particular, using those credit cards to buy crypto, to launder it, immediately turning around and selling that crypto at exchanges and then that way having laundered it so they can say, oh, if someone asked them, where'd you get this money from? Like, oh, well, I sold a bunch of and then, you know, law enforcement or banks or virtual currency exchanges aren't looking one behind that to see, well, where did you buy that from? Oh, it's from this stolen credit card.
00:27:46.898 - 00:28:30.986, Speaker B: And then that money was going to ISIS. And so after Shanaz gets arrested and pleads guilty about sending money over to the ISIS financier, this immediately springs up, right? It's almost like a relay race. They had this one path of using crypto to get stolen PII and buy crypto and then laundered into fiat currency and sent to ISIS. That gets shuts down, they start this website and you would anticipate again on the website they were taking money any which. Way it could come in. So one would anticipate, I think, that there were some allegations potentially that they would accept cryptocurrency for the fake PPE, but more importantly, it's the same scheme. They just want someone to send them their credit card information, send them their PII.
00:28:30.986 - 00:29:04.054, Speaker B: They think that they're going to be buying a thousand masks, but instead all they've done is given all that identifying information to ISIS and that they would do the same thing again, use that to buy more crypto, laundered again into Fiat. And so the goal is not to just make the $50 or $50,000 sale of the PPE that's never going to come. It's to get that information and use that to buy a bunch of crypto, which they see clearly as a way to launder money quickly and efficiently and then just get a good exchange, even if it's not like a great rate. But then they've laundered it, they think effectively.
00:29:04.182 - 00:29:15.950, Speaker A: Okay, but you're saying that that's their assumption that law enforcement won't go beyond that one step of looking at where the bitcoin came from. Right, but obviously that's not the case.
00:29:16.020 - 00:30:02.170, Speaker B: Because right, exactly, yeah, we caught her. But yes, that is the assumption. Often that criminal mean that's what money laundering at bottom is. You're just trying to put a bunch of logical steps in between the illegality at the beginning and where you are at the end and to try to hide how the money got there. But if someone, the determined law enforcement team of the HSI, IRS and FBI team, they continue to peek behind what's, behind door 12345, they finally get there. And at the end of the day, that's how they're able to they see like, okay, there's an illicit source, but they're trying to go scattershot and just put up one layer of concealment because that might be enough to get past a KYC check or AML check at a bank or a cryptocurrency exchange.
00:30:02.990 - 00:30:21.394, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we're going to talk about some cases involving North Korea. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

So you also prosecuted a case involving the North Korea affiliated group Lazarus and that involved $250,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency.
00:30:50.150 - 00:30:53.130, Speaker A: How were they able to amass such a large haul?
00:30:53.870 - 00:31:09.522, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fascinating to look in the complaint and again, it really details out so we can't show it here, but I encourage people to go check out the press release as a copy of the very detailed charts that the IRS Special Agent Chris Gianceski drew up, but.
00:31:09.576 - 00:31:11.810, Speaker A: It shows I was impressed by the charts.
00:31:12.310 - 00:31:38.726, Speaker B: Well, I can't tell you how happy he is now that he heard you say that, because nothing makes him happier than that. He recently told his wife that he was really excited. Someone had talked about how great his charts were, and she was extremely unimpressed, and she just doesn't understand him or get him. But you do, so it's great. And we do as yes. You know, so that hack it was a hack, right? And it was really interesting. It happened after a previous hack that's allegedly attributed to North Korea is that they went to a cryptocurrency exchange.
00:31:38.726 - 00:32:23.606, Speaker B: And, you know, we have a bunch of whale clients. They have a ton of money. They want to come invest it with your exchange. We're just worried about these hackers out there. And so we have an attached questionnaire to this email that's going to review your OpSec and things like that and make sure that you are, in fact, secure and compliant. And so in many ways, they failed the test, right? One, because they clicked on the attachment, and two, because then when the attachment was there, it had a bunch of malware. And so the complaint details how the language and the script language that's used is consistent with how North Korean hackers have operated and that there were other things within the complaint where their VPNs were able to be penetrated by law enforcement and things like that, where they were able to attribute it to North Korea.
00:32:23.606 - 00:33:33.922, Speaker B: But it's just, again, that sloppiness. It just takes one bad mistake by someone in the security team or the client kind of relation team at a cryptocurrency exchange that they were able to do a complete takeover and get to not only the hot walls but also get to some of the cold storage funds, which normally you think shouldn't be able to happen, but they just totally took over the system. And so from one exchange, right, one bank heist, my favorite New Yorker cartoon that we use in all of our presentations is a guy goes in to rob a bank, and the guy's giving the money over goes, you know, you can do this all online now, right? And so instead of one bank robbery where there's the risk of violence and there's security there, this is from the safety of the North Koreans house or whatever they're sitting in. They're able to steal $280,000,000 in one fell swoop. And then you see in other hacks, and it's described in the complaint, and then the second related complaint is that they are out there just spear phishing all day, every day, looking for people who are well known in the crypto world either to assume their identities or to go after those people to take over their identities. Again, with the goal of hacking exchanges or getting access to exchanges where they can get that kind of money.
00:33:34.056 - 00:34:11.290, Speaker A: Yeah, in general, their techniques just seemed so basic isn't the word because it sounds unsophisticated on their part. But what I mean is it's not something where you need to know coding or have any kind of fancy computer programming knowledge. It's literally just trading on people's. Gullibility earlier, though, you said something about how it was in line with other North Korean. I didn't understand that. What was it about previous North Korean hacking behavior that lined up?
00:34:11.440 - 00:35:00.694, Speaker B: So we looked at the actual malware. We got a copy of that from the victim, and when examining that malware, the way that the scripts were written in it that allowed them to take over was consistent with other hacks that have been documented with North Korea. So we used a couple of different things. Like we use, as I said, the penetration of the VPN and the language and the scripts and all these things they don't say at the end of the day, it's US. North Korea, but the language that was used and the scripts. Additionally, there was a couple of things where we looked at some of the other information that they were researching, and some of the things were researching things about the North Korean military. So it's possible, right? It could be someone in Kansas who just happens to use the same script language and uses a VPN that traces back to a North Korean cell tower and also researches a lot of information about the North Korean government military.
00:35:00.694 - 00:35:06.442, Speaker B: But more likely, right, that's reflective of the fact that it is, in fact, North Korean actors.
00:35:06.586 - 00:35:19.540, Speaker A: All right? And one other thing was that some of the money was these strange coins like proton token and olive and betherium. I've literally never even heard of these. So why would they do?
00:35:20.710 - 00:36:13.662, Speaker B: I mean, in the most recent complaint, there was algo tokens, there was all sorts of different coins. And one of the things that Chris talked about in the complaint is the chain hopping that occurs and that they're trying to move from one chain to another. It's, I think, no different than when someone steals money from a bank. They might try to exchange it into euros and then from euros into yen and then renimbi and back to dollars, because they think, again, they're obfuscating the trail. And to some extent they are right, like we can subpoena well, DOJ can subpoena the US banks and things like that to get that information, but it's much more challenging to get it from foreign banks or things like that. And so I think what Chris talks about in that most recent complaint is that part of what chain hopping has done is to try to break the public blockchain ledgers and try to divorce things out so you can't see where things are moving from one currency to another. And so they might use a really rare currency.
00:36:13.662 - 00:36:55.162, Speaker B: And remember, they're willing to take pennies on the dollar. Like the reason that you, I and Jesse won't deal in these coins is because they may not have the availability or people may not be interested in them, or you might get a lot less bang for your buck, but when you have $280,000,000, you're happy to get 50% yield rate. That is a bank heist that is unprecedented. Right? If you get 10%, it's huge. And so not only does it obfuscate what you're doing, it may be an easier your way to find some people who are willing to sell it. But what's interesting is that Chris draws back in that complaint is that they always come back to bitcoin, right? Because no one has heard of these coins. And at the end of the day, they do need to get to so, like, they may go through all this chain hopping and then they circle back to Bitcoin.
00:36:55.162 - 00:37:14.674, Speaker B: And that's where Chris and the IRS team and Bill and the HSI team and Kyle and FBI team, they're able to really leverage all of their expertise in the known bitcoin to then figure out, like, wait a minute, we know. Going back to that example of let's go back three, four more to see where did this coin I've never heard from. Well, how did that coin get funded?
00:37:14.802 - 00:37:28.486, Speaker A: So talk about that a little bit more. Like why it is that they always come back to Bitcoin. Like, you started to say it, but just flesh it out for people, because it's also the blockchain that has often led prosecutors like you to the criminals.
00:37:28.518 - 00:37:30.826, Speaker C: So why would they do know?
00:37:30.928 - 00:38:35.370, Speaker B: This is a question whenever anyone jesse and I talked when I was a prosecutor about our practice in the fiat side of terrorism financing, north Korean sanctions violations, all we would say is, because north Korea was allegedly buying this thing in US dollars, they're subject to these punitive criminal penalties. We've seized all their money. And they always say know, someone raises their hand, like, why didn't they just use like, Chinese yen or euros? And the answer always like, yeah, they should have. And if they did, we wouldn't have had a case. And there's always people like, oh my God, well, they'll just stop using the US dollar, because if you keep prosecuting this, it'll drive them to other currencies that people feel like that they can get away with ever they want to, but that just never happened. And the same thing with bitcoin is that you can buy a Tesla with bitcoin, you can buy subway with bitcoin, you can't buy them with those other coins that no one has heard of. And so as they still chain hop to obfuscate, at the end of the day, they need to get this into fiat currency that is still the choke point where law enforcement will come in and where cryptocurrency exchanges really can be very robust in their KYC.
00:38:35.370 - 00:39:08.970, Speaker B: And the same thing is true for law enforcement, is that they are waiting, and they see when they come back to bitcoin, because they want to buy things or because they want to get a better return rate, or because people are too sketched out. They're like, well, I've never heard of this coin, and you have no trading history on one of these exchanges. And so no way, I'm not going to deal with this. It's too suspicious. But if someone who has no trading history has never done anything but is on bitcoin, which is well known and trusted, they're like, well, I'm willing to do that because everything's public, and so I feel safer. And so I think for all those reasons, they always come back to bitcoin.
00:39:09.310 - 00:39:31.220, Speaker C: And I think just to hop off that something that Zia and I have talked about a lot is that criminals don't want to lose their money either, right? And they want to rely on institutions or coins that are a little bit more stable. And so, at the end of the day, even though criminals might work in these other coins we might not have heard of, they want to get back to bitcoin so they can feel solid in whatever they have there.
00:39:31.910 - 00:39:55.370, Speaker A: Once they do have the bitcoin. As we mentioned, law enforcement is often notifying exchanges of coins or addresses that are associated with criminal activity, but how are they attempting to cash out? How easy is it for them to do so when they have these stolen funds?
00:39:55.870 - 00:40:38.242, Speaker C: There's a lot of different ways and a lot of different techniques that they use. Something that the DOJ frequently looks at is unlicensed money service businesses. So those are people that are buying and selling funds, whether they be cryptocurrency or otherwise, without correct licensing from the US. Government, from FinCEN. And so how that works in the Crypto world is that there are these people that sort of take advantage of what Zio was talking about is that criminals frequently just want to get pennies on the dollar. And so they do these transactions where each person that's running this business is taking a little bit and a little bit more. And so they're hopping through these exchanges or hopping through these coins with the help of these unlicensed money service businesses.
00:40:38.242 - 00:40:48.534, Speaker C: And that's one way that we're able to track it, is that there are some people or organizations or businesses that are run by a few people that are doing a lot of this business for criminals.
00:40:48.662 - 00:41:35.142, Speaker B: I think one thing that's also interesting to your question of I think that's how difficult is it? It seems like it is, right? And the goal of work like what Jesse is doing is to make it more difficult. Right? You're never going to make it impossible, but you just want to make it more difficult. And I think that north Korea complaint, the one that you talked about highlights that. So there after the complaint drops on, like, a Tuesday, within 48 hours, there's an amended complaint. So why did that happen? And if you look at the document, it goes into it. What happened is that there were unhosted addresses that had sat for over 14 months with no activity. The complaint drops, and immediately they start going frantically trying to cash those out, and which caused then the government to go immediately within 48 hours and amend their complaint, say, like, hey, here are all these other addresses.
00:41:35.142 - 00:42:01.182, Speaker B: Here's where they move to. And that's no different than Jesse's experience or mine from street level drug crime, right? When they hear the cops knocking on the door, everyone's flushing everything down the toilet, throwing things out the window, or just trying to get rid of it, right? Everything's got to go. Fire sale. And that's exactly what they were doing in this case. It's a North Korean sea right after the complaint comes out, oh, my God, this stuff is really hot. We've got to get rid of it. And they're just trying to push as much out as quickly as they can before the exchange or someone catches up or the government.
00:42:01.182 - 00:42:44.174, Speaker B: And there within a matter of 48 hours, all those addresses are then identified, send back to the one or two exchanges. I mean, it was largely two exchanges that are referenced there. And the government tells them, like, hey, these are still those same people. I think chain analysis at the same time did a report where they talked about some of the new addresses that were coming out and warning people like, hey, here's where they're moving to. Now, that's what's incredible about the blockchain, right? If someone stole $150,000,000 from a traditional bank and they took that money in there, there is nothing the public writ large could do. But after a bunch of these hacks, you had people who are watching the blockchain, and they say, like, hey, we're watching this happen right now live, right? Like, it is happening right now. And they're publicly broadcasting that information.
00:42:44.174 - 00:43:04.786, Speaker B: So it is why cryptocurrency, in many ways is a much worse vehicle for laundering money, because it's not just reliant on Jesse and her team. You can have people who are sitting at home and watching this stuff and giving Jesse's able to outsource. Instead of her just having her four agents, now she has thousands of agents. It's all the people listening to this podcast were like, yeah, this seems weird. I saw this the weird thing on the blockchain.
00:43:04.818 - 00:43:26.400, Speaker A: And then they tweet about, yeah, yeah. I have definitely seen online forums where people are watching stuff on the blockchain and commenting on movements in real time. One other thing that I found fascinating about this case was that the North Korean hackers were also using stolen identities to try to cash out. How were they trying to do that, and where did they get those?
00:43:28.210 - 00:43:57.526, Speaker B: You know, again, to Jesse's point, right. She described how Al Qasam evolved from a kind of basic to getting more and more sophisticated. And the same thing with the North Koreans. Right. On the first complaint that there are pictures in it of people, some exchanges want you to hold up KYC with a picture right next to your face and that the agents were able to show, like if you looked at the T shirt and the body, it was the same body with just a different face. Superimposed. And they were able to identify who those were.
00:43:57.526 - 00:44:43.462, Speaker B: And so that's pretty basic, right? And that you see in the most recent forfeiture complaint that Jesse and while I was at DOJ that we did with our partners over Alden and Jessica Peck at DOJ, that they started stealing people's PII, right? Because that's way more valuable because that's an actual that will pass some of the KYC filters that were picked up on like, oh, this isn't an edited PDF, like it's the same T shirt. Forget about it. That is genuine. And so where they get it from? I mean, the complaints just reference generally know, the United Nations has referenced that in their panel of expert reports is that North Korea is known to hack exchanges. There's no reason to think when they're hacking exchange, they're just stealing the money. Right? There's also something of great value there. Just like with that ISIS campaign, the PII is just as valuable sometimes as much of the money.
00:44:43.462 - 00:45:16.622, Speaker B: And so they are going and stealing data in addition to stealing money. And those complaints highlight that they're using those for nefarious things. And I think it also highlights to cryptocurrency exchanges that you can't just do the basic KYC and say, this is a real license. You need to say, do some follow up questions or talk to the person. People do like Skype and Zoom chats now where they're talking to the person. And it's not just like a photo selfie so they can see because that is much harder to fake and get past AML control. So I think industry will have to continue to catch up.
00:45:16.622 - 00:45:23.810, Speaker B: And as law enforcement notes, like your previous AML threshold, your basement, that's not enough now it needs to get raised.
00:45:24.470 - 00:46:06.850, Speaker A: Yeah. And I just realized we've been saying PII and I don't remember if we told people what that stands for. Stands for it's personal Identifying information. So one other thing that I wanted to ask about was and you've mentioned it multiple times during the episode, but you're coordinating a bunch of different government agencies and often working with teams actually in other countries as well. So how do you make that happen? How do you figure out what are all the different agencies that need to be involved or which other foreign partners you need and how do you get in touch? And also how do you just make so many people across different governmental agencies as well as jurisdictions come together to prosecute these cases.
00:46:07.190 - 00:46:51.198, Speaker C: I'll just start with that. I mean, it's all about finding the right people. And as a prosecutor, your job is not necessarily to know every single detail of cryptocurrency or to know all the technical side of virtual currency exchanges. But your job is to make sure that you are working with the right people and that you're using different agencies for what they're best at and understanding that people have strengths in some ways and other agencies have strengths in other ways. And at the end of the day, and how I look at it and I know how Zia looks at it is like, we're all on the same team. We just want to ensure that terrorists don't get money. We want to make sure that the cryptocurrency and virtual currency exchanges are not abused so that terrorists and other bad actors can get money.
00:46:51.198 - 00:47:35.550, Speaker C: And so if you go into every meeting and every email with that mindset, everyone's going to want to work with you and everyone's going to want to accomplish that goal, because that's why we're civil servants and that's why we're going to work every day. And so at the end of the day, zia and Chris put together an amazing team, a strike force that I was lucky enough to be a part. You know, I will brag about Zia and Chris all day and tell you how lucky I am to work with them. But from there, we've been able to find people at a bunch of different agencies, including HSI, Bill Capper, Ryan Landers, NfBI Kyle Armstrong, and also just people at the DOJ that really have the same goal that we do and try to avoid bureaucracy as much as we can in order to accomplish this goal.
00:47:35.890 - 00:48:42.654, Speaker B: Yeah, one of the things that's sad about leaving is that I really enjoyed getting to have the opportunity to meet with people. So we went to South Korea on the Darknet child pornography case, and it's just really exciting to meet people from totally different backgrounds who have similarly motivated to how can you try to make the world a better place, right? Like, it is cheesy, but it's true. Like public servants, I think in those roles, it crosses all boundaries and backgrounds, and so it may be something that you figure out late night over karaoke while talking to a prosecutor or a police officer. In Korea, we had partners from Germany and from the UK. And even here in the know, in the most recent action, it highlighted that there was partnership with United States Cybercom and the Department of Defense. And so I think what's so different and unique about the job that Jesse has that I used to work on is that you are the kind of center of that. You're just trying to find all the right players, put on the right pieces on the chessboard to advance the mission, and that it's really fun to find those people, because once you do, it is organic.
00:48:42.654 - 00:48:57.160, Speaker B: You can't just say, like, it's one formula, but once it happens, you go back to those people and they're just always willing to make sacrifices in their personal life and their work life. They just want to get things across the finish line, and they are so motivated that it inspires you to work harder as well.
00:48:57.610 - 00:49:17.260, Speaker A: Yeah, and actually, we didn't really discuss it very much. I just mentioned it briefly about the welcome to Video, which was, I think, one of your first cases, if not the first, involving cryptocurrency. But actually, why don't you just talk a little bit more about how you guys were able to prosecute that, given that the person running that site wasn't a foreign country?
00:49:17.870 - 00:50:07.454, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. And that's a good example of one where we leveraged both criminal and civil tools because we wanted to criminally prosecute, because we did think there was a person that we could get into the United States. And do you know, again, that's the team at IRS and then the Homeland Security agents out in Colorado Springs were working together? To Jesse's points, it was about relationships. We had a great relationship with the Korean National Police from a lot of the North Korea work that we did. And so we told them know, the IRS team, after they did this great work in taking down Alpha Bay with some of their other law enforcement partners, they're kind of like, what's? So, you know very flippantly. I remember having a conversation between one of the kind of people in our office who worked on all these cases, arie Redbord and myself. We're know, what about child pornography? And Aries has a ton of experience in this.
00:50:07.454 - 00:50:35.366, Speaker B: And so the IRS team came back, Chris Janceski, like, two weeks later and was like, I haven't left my house in two weeks. I found the largest darknet child pornography site, and we should take it down. And I remember I was just like, Wait, what are you talking about? And he's like, you told me to find a child pornography site, because he said that's, like, the next big thing we should do. And I was like, yeah, I mean, I wasn't serious this, but okay, I guess that's know, be careful what you ask. So, you know, we quickly assembled a team. Again, the same thing Jesse's talking about. Like, you just got to get good people and find them.
00:50:35.366 - 00:51:05.386, Speaker B: And so Lindsay Suttenberg was an expert in office on child sex offense crime. Yuli Lee was an expert on know, we had the investigators Kim Reese out in Colorado and Tom Tamsey and as well as Chris. And then we just got on a plane and we went to Korea, and we had law enforcement partners there at HSI who had built relationships with the Korean police. And they said, here's what this darknet investigation is. And they had never really done a big darknet investigation. But like everyone else, they're like, oh, my God. Don't want to get into details.
00:51:05.386 - 00:51:29.366, Speaker B: It's very disturbing. But this is mostly infant and toddlers who are being victimized. And so when people hear that everyone right, almost everyone's, just like, how can I help? What do I need to do? Tell me what I need to do. I want to do. So, you know, we had partners from the UK and Germany as well who came along, in particular the UK that they were tracking on this. And so kind of briefed them on the case. Came back a couple pretty shortly thereafter and did a takedown where there was a full know.
00:51:29.366 - 00:52:10.594, Speaker B: Korean police went, they did a search warrant, kicked down the door, found the alleged administrative site on the site, logged on, which is always the know, they'd done a lot of things to try to protect his safety because there actually been some customers that had committed suicide previously after they had been discovered. And so they were very careful of that. And the US law enforcement was watching via remote to see what was happening while they're in Korea. And then immediately getting a forensic copy of the server. We did a search warrant, which you can do if the property is at a US. Embassy. And so we're in the space there and then just reconstituting the server there while we're there in Korea and starting to build up lead packages for the hundreds of customers who are on this site.
00:52:10.594 - 00:53:00.266, Speaker B: And from that, this is why this is important, is we found a new site. And then we did prosecute the administrator of that called Dark Scandals, which was a site that showed not only child pornography, but also videos of adults being raped, all women being raped on it, and being videotaped and getting paid in ethereum and bitcoin. So again, because we found one customer's site, we then saw, where else is he sending money to these people? Typically, this is not a limited habit, and from that we found this other site, and it led to spin off investigations. There were 25 children that were rescued from actively being abused because the IRS agent followed the money, right? Like, because of the blockchain, he could follow the money. The HSI agents could go and exploit all of that data with their partners from Exigent, a private company that they worked with, and Chainalysis. From that. There are 25 kids today that are not being victimized.
00:53:00.266 - 00:53:13.500, Speaker B: And there's no better feeling in the world than that than saying what is a concrete thing that you can show that your work did. Well here's what HSI and IRS's work did is that they saved these kids, and there are 300 potential pedophiles who are not on the street because of them.
00:53:14.350 - 00:53:30.846, Speaker A: That's great. That's amazing work. I also did an interview about that with Jonathan Levin of Chainalysis, right when the news came out, and I. Will link to that in the show notes. So how are you seeing the use of cryptocurrencies by criminals evolve over mean?
00:53:30.868 - 00:54:14.318, Speaker B: I think I'll hand it off to jezebel one thing and again, not a prosecutor speaking just in my former role, we never really looked as much to policy and things like that. We're more like, here's the case in front of us. We talk about what we see there, but I think that we can give examples of what we saw. Right. So I'll let Jesse talk about the terror finance campaigns, but I can talk very briefly in North Korea. So we saw that they I mean, you don't want to say it's basic because obviously the yield is so large, but it's a bit basic. I mean, if I saw North Korea, I would tell them they're basic and that it is slowly getting to maybe it's not an advanced yet, but every day there's steps forward because of Jesse and her team and their work that they're doing.
00:54:14.318 - 00:54:27.998, Speaker B: And so you saw the evolution from no, you know, very badly edited KYC that was fake to stolen pi to who knows what's next. And so I think that's just one example of evolution. I'm sure Jesse from the terror campaigns maybe have some other examples.
00:54:28.094 - 00:55:20.130, Speaker C: Sure. And I mentioned this briefly before, but the fact that the Alcasam Brigades jump from a static to a dynamic address generator, which is not easy technology to create on a website, particularly that big of a technological jump, shows that they learned something or they got some more information and then you can just sort of watch. I can't talk about really open cases, but you can see how criminals are starting to maybe just not direct deposit into the next address that they want to use, but using mixers, using tumblers, but also just jumping through. A bunch of intermediary addresses and learning how to explain that process to the court is something that we are developing as well on our side. Because as the terrorists learn, DOJ learns and virtual exchanges learn, we're all sort of learning together and we have to figure out ways to teach the court as well that these new technologies are developing and that they're being used in improper ways.
00:55:20.280 - 00:55:23.570, Speaker A: And are you also finding that they're turning more to privacy coins?
00:55:25.270 - 00:55:45.834, Speaker B: There's always the fear there, right? Yeah, I think that's hard to say. Right. That's in part why the privacy coins have their appeal. But I think kind of like we talked about earlier, even when they go to that, they still end up coming back to Bitcoin because they need to cash out. They're not trying to just build up like a revenue I'm sorry, they're not trying to build up like a Federal Reserve. They need to spend money to buy things. Right.
00:55:45.834 - 00:56:30.758, Speaker B: And so to the extent that privacy coins become more widely used, then I think sure they're going to continue to turn to that. But as long as bitcoin and ethereum dominate and people are just using that, I think, again, they still have to find someone right to engage in transactions, either to exchange with them or to buy the thing they want. And people are nervous. I mean, there's obviously some of the software platforms, some of the big exchanges, they won't bank privacy coins. And so I think that's no different than some big traditional banks will say, okay, I'll take in yen, renimbi, US dollar and euro, but I'm not taking in x, y, and z currency from another country, because I just think it's not reliable, it's not safe, it's outside of my risk appetite. And so there's still a lot of.
00:56:30.764 - 00:57:21.850, Speaker C: That, I think, and just to jump off that, I mean, at the end of the day, what we're seeing criminals do is as cryptocurrency sort of expands and people know what it is, more, they're able to target more people as victims or as supporters. So maybe ten years ago, if Alcasam brigade said, hey, supporters, send me bitcoin, there wouldn't have been that many people who knew how to do that or really understood what bitcoin was. Now they can say, hey, supporters all over the world send me bitcoin. Or if you think about the Twitter hack like, hey, let me just hack all these things and hack all these accounts and ask people to send us bitcoin, ten years ago, that wouldn't have been possible. So they're developing in that the rest of the world is catching up and understanding what cryptocurrency is. And also that can be a bigger way to hack into people's accounts and make sure that people are unbeknownst when they donate to these groups.
00:57:22.750 - 00:57:45.780, Speaker A: One thing I also wanted to ask about is this new trend with DeFi, which is obviously really taking off, and some people are saying that decentralized exchanges could serve as mixers and make it easier for criminals and hackers to cash out. What is your take on that? And whether or not how do you think it is that the rise of DeFi could affect your ability to do this work?
00:57:46.790 - 00:58:23.726, Speaker B: I think, yeah, just going back to the kind of previous know, we are limited in talking about the cases we have seen and what we've prosecuted and so kind of predicting what will happen in the future. That's more like the people at treasury and policy kind of folks. I think they can really speak to that. Obviously there's a ton of stuff right now in DeFi, and it's just so popular. So when anything like this happens, right, eventually criminals try to find a way to leverage that. And so I'm sure your next podcast episode with Jesse will be about a DeFi money launderer and whether or not they act as a mixing service, but I don't think probably have anything of value to add. I don't know if Jesse's anything other than that.
00:58:23.908 - 00:58:44.260, Speaker C: Yeah, I just think that sort of what Zia is saying. The regulations and the laws need to catch up to this as like, as new services and technologies are created, we need to figure out how they fit within the current regulations and whether new ones need to be made. And that's definitely a separate side of the government than us, but we're here to sort of watch and enforce as needed.
00:58:45.430 - 00:59:41.960, Speaker A: And I also just wanted to ask, there was a couple of points in the discussion where one of you was saying that turning to cryptocurrency is a bad idea for a criminal because it makes it easier for people like you to do your jobs. But in general, as we're seeing the rise of crimes using cryptocurrency, obviously there's this whole trend, the ransomware, but then we've got these big state actors like north Korea turning to cryptocurrency. What in general would you say is the relationship between cryptocurrency and crime? I feel like one other thing I want to mention is that early on in cryptocurrency, the narrative around it was that it was criminal money. And clearly now that's not really the narrative. I would say we have all these big institutions that are getting in on it. But I just wondered, I really do think we're obviously still seeing that criminals do enjoy it. So I wondered what your take was on that relationship.
00:59:42.490 - 01:00:25.806, Speaker C: I guess my sense is that there's still a false sense of security there. Not everyone fully understands cryptocurrency or realizes that they can't hide behind a coin at the end of the day. And I think that that information has just not spread as widely as people in the world like we are understand it. And so although we've definitely moved past this whole, like, criminals are the only ones using cryptocurrency, I think that's definitely true. I think that a lot of people are turning to it in order to be able to hide behind their current coins. But at the end of the day, criminals are still using fiat currency too. They're just finding and shifting and moving and taking turns in order to be able to try different ways and see what sticks.
01:00:25.998 - 01:01:13.726, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing it's fascinating, jesse and I, there used to be this thing where you would get in this machine and go to another country. It was called, like, international travel. It's really hard to remember now, but we've given presentations on cryptocurrency, and it's amazing, particularly when you're meeting people very sophisticated, still understand cryptocurrency. When they see the jesse with her DOJ insignia, they're like, why don't you? I mean, literally, I had people say, why doesn't the US. Government just turn off? Isn't this all criminals? People don't understand that a, that's not something that's possible, but b, my answer to them is always like, you know, people have been committing crime with traditional fiat money for a long time, and no one says to ban that. So there's this huge psychic disconnect that I just don't get of like, okay, great, someone uses money to do something bad. No one's talking about banning unhosted wallets in Fiat.
01:01:13.726 - 01:01:44.714, Speaker B: That's called cash, right? That's what cash in between someone's bed is. It's an unhosted wallet, right. And criminals do that all the time. Jesse and I could tell you stories from when we had narcotics cases where you find $200,000 and someone's hidden in the floorboards of their floor. I had a case with that once where it happened, right, and so no one's like, well, we should ban cash. And so it's a false narrative, and it's a question. I think that I hope that if not years, if not months and days from now, people will just stop asking, how much of crypto is criminals? That's not the point.
01:01:44.714 - 01:01:56.266, Speaker B: Right. Crypto is here. People just need to learn to accept that. And it sounds like, as you point out, big banks are starting to get that, too, right. It's just not exchanges anymore. And that the problem isn't crypto. It's a problem is criminals.
01:01:56.266 - 01:02:36.080, Speaker B: And so criminals will commit crime with or without crypto. The question is, how can we as a society say, like, oh, is this something that should or shouldn't be regulated? I think that goes to Jesse's point. It's like DOJ is trying to find ways to follow up, and I think their defense lawyers are doing a fabulous job at trying to say, like, wait a minute, DOJ, you're going too far. This is not within that. You're using a regulatory framework for Western Union sending money, and that doesn't apply necessarily to someone just exchanging from one currency to another. And so there is this big open area right now for the law to get fleshed out, but that does not speak to the goodness or badness of cryptocurrency. It's here to stay, and people just need to learn to live with it.
01:02:36.930 - 01:02:56.420, Speaker A: I think especially my more libertarian minded listeners might like your answer to that question, but in general, probably my whole audience will because it's pretty level heaven and makes a lot of sense. All right, well, it's been so great having you both on the show. Where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
01:02:57.190 - 01:03:11.114, Speaker B: Well, I think can you can reach out to us on LinkedIn. I think that's one thing. We keep both, I guess, somewhat low profiles in general, but Jesse's got a bunch of big cases you can see, I think, DOJ press releases. I don't know what else jesse yeah.
01:03:11.152 - 01:03:42.450, Speaker C: I think press releases are probably the main way or LinkedIn. I mean, at the end of the day, as government workers, we're part of a big team, so every success or prosecution or forfeiture that we have is the result of lots of people both named and unnamed. So there's not any other way, I guess, to sort of track our activity other than that. But we want to thank you for having us here and also thank everyone that helped us accomplish this and we hope to continue down this path.
01:03:43.350 - 01:03:56.326, Speaker A: Yeah, great. I mean, one other comment I'll make is that you guys did name a bunch of your other collaborators throughout the show, so hopefully they will appreciate that. All right, well, thanks again and it was so great having you.
01:03:56.428 - 01:03:57.414, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
01:03:57.532 - 01:03:58.198, Speaker B: Thank you.
