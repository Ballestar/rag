Today's guest is Willie wu onchain bitcoin analyst and writer of the bitcoin forecast, a market intelligence newsletter. Welcome, Willie.
00:00:56.450 - 00:00:58.480, Speaker B: Hey, Laura. Great to be back.
00:00:59.090 - 00:01:21.720, Speaker A: This was quite the week for bitcoin and crypto in general, with PayPal announcing that it will allow its 346,000,000 customers to hold bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies, as well as use them to pay at PayPal's 26 million merchants. At the news, the price of bitcoin shot up, briefly flirting with $13,000. What do you make of PayPal's news?
00:01:22.970 - 00:01:52.618, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it's very much significant. If you were to look at on chain, exactly how many people are actually holding bitcoins in their wallet. Currently, there's only 23.4 million holders on chain. And if you count the exchanges, there's 101,000,000 active unique accounts. So if you look at PayPal, it's almost five times that. It's 487,000,000.
00:01:52.618 - 00:02:04.580, Speaker B: So there's this absolute unlock to the mainstream market here to access bitcoin way in excess of what we currently have in numbers.
00:02:05.670 - 00:02:41.710, Speaker A: Before that news broke, you had been tweeting a bit about how bitcoin's price behaviors have been changing. One of your tweets showed a chart of coin dormancy against the bitcoin price. And you tweeted dormancy is a measure of old hands selling out. It's interesting to see old hands reliably sold tops. Until this present cycle, they sold the bitcoin bottom at $3000 to $4,000. They are selling right now. So when you say this, this present cycle, what time period are you talking about? And why do you think the behavior of old chance is changing?
00:02:42.290 - 00:03:44.238, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the current cycle. Bitcoin cycles every four years because of the Harvarding, that's kind of an impulse of supply reduction. And so we get into these four year macro cycles. And this particular cycle is interesting in that we had the first derivatives of exchanges with the likes of bitnex introduced in the tail end of 2017. And with the crazy leverages these guys can do on these exchanges, they have dominated the volume against the organic spot markets where people would normally come in and buy their coins and move them off into their wallets. So when you've got this outlier volume on derivative markets where traders come in and trade against each other, they play a whole lot of strategic games, defensive lines. I liken it to playing a game of gridiron where you're going for yards and you're trying to push the other side over and then they backtrace.
00:03:44.238 - 00:04:46.070, Speaker B: And so we're in this era of derivative dominance where it's trader games. So you'll see that if you look at the chart of Bitcoin, we had this very nice organic movements in price that was very reflective of fundamentals of investors coming in. And since 2017, the tally end of 2017, really coming into 2018 and into now, we've had a crazy whipsaw in the price action. It's like you can see at the 6000 sort of band that we had in 2018, and then it plummeted down to 3000. That was all trader gains on derivative exchanges. And so what I think is happening is that the old hand whales, the OGS that bought into Bitcoin way back when and are obviously highly capitalized and they've always been able to sell tops. They're not currently equipped to play these very sophisticated trader games that are happening on derivative exchanges.
00:04:46.070 - 00:04:49.306, Speaker B: And so they're not selling the tops, they're selling the bottoms. Right.
00:04:49.328 - 00:05:11.760, Speaker A: Now, I don't fully understand when you talk about this kind of game, what is it just from a hodler perspective, it should be something straightforward. You buy low, you sell when it's high. So what is going on exactly that's keeping them from being able to do that?
00:05:12.610 - 00:06:01.070, Speaker B: Obviously, as a hoddler, you're going to organically buy and hold for a long term sort of hold. But if you're on these derivative exchanges, all you're doing is making bets long or short, the prices go one way or the other. And if I'm correct, I make a lot of money. And so what actually happens is that if you see, for example, the general market, the general traders, which are the unsophisticated traders, they may be going long. So if you're the winner, you're the whale on the exchanges. And the winners tend to be 1% of the market. According to Bitnex, 99% lose.
00:06:01.070 - 00:06:54.242, Speaker B: You are the guy with tens of millions of dollars of what we call ammo to be able to push the market one way. So for example, if everyone's going long and I'm that 1%, well, I'm going to short it and I'm going to sell, and I'm going to sell, and I'm going to sell. I may even sell on spot exchanges to push the price down. And I'm trying to push the price down below the defensive line of people going long, because if you're going long, you're betting on it going up. But you do have this line in the sand where if you're wrong, you're either liquidated or you have a stop loss where you're going to sell out. Both cases, you're going to sell out. So what the whales do is they counter trade you.
00:06:54.242 - 00:07:26.410, Speaker B: They push the price below your defensive line, and at that point you have to sell in and then suddenly the price plummets and then they'll scoop up at the bottom and they win. And so that happens whether you're long or short, the 99% will lose. And this is a derivative casino game with very smart, sophisticated players that have now entered bitcoin, and it is completely wreaking havoc with the organic price of bitcoin.
00:07:29.230 - 00:07:51.140, Speaker A: When did you start seeing this happen? Because from your tweet it seemed that you were saying that before this cycle, old hands would reliably sell the top. So when did this period begin? And is it simply the fact that there was not a way for these whales to use this leverage in this way before?
00:07:51.830 - 00:08:23.690, Speaker B: Okay, so BitMEX started tail end of 2017. I think it gained a significant volume by the tail end of the early start of 2018. And so that created the vehicle. And I'm not saying these whales on derivative exchanges are our OG whales that bought when bitcoin was one dollars or $10. These guys are very sophisticated players. They probably come from wall street. They know how to trade on margin, which is everything that's happening in traditional wall street finance.
00:08:23.690 - 00:09:13.914, Speaker B: So it's a different game. It's a different game. And we've been in this era since 2018. It's been two years. The interesting thing now is with the likes of MicroStrategy and the cohort of CEOs and board of directors, offices of companies that are now currently scooping up coins and putting them into their own wallets corporate wallets, personal wallets. That we're starting to get a swing back into the organicness where spot volumes, the organic buying and holding volumes are now starting to come back against this derivative game. And also we've got the CFTC starting to regulate the unregulated derivative exchanges like BitMEX.
00:09:13.914 - 00:09:28.210, Speaker B: So we'll see pressures there. I think this is a very short era of two to three years, and we'll come back to an organic price discovery of bitcoin.
00:09:29.110 - 00:09:50.614, Speaker A: In a moment, we'll discuss how this should impact the way the price in bitcoin changes. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn and spend crypto all in one place. Earn up to 8.5% per year on your BTC. Download the crypto.com
00:09:50.614 - 00:10:25.670, Speaker A: app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on BTC and more than 20 other coins. Once in the app, you can apply for the crypto.com metal card, which pays you up to 8% cash back instantly. Reserve years now in the crypto.com app. Back to my conversation with Willy woo. So, as you were discussing, you feel like I don't know how to describe it, whether it's like the power or the balance of, I guess where the market is determining the price, you feel like that's swinging back to the spot market.
00:10:25.670 - 00:10:29.590, Speaker A: So what effect do you think that will have on price moves in bitcoin?
00:10:30.410 - 00:11:36.038, Speaker B: So we'll see less exaggerated price moves and essentially it'll be less exaggerated. I think a lot of people are losing money because they're getting freaked out by these very large whipsaw prices. And so ultimately, what happens is that we'll start to lower volatility. I did a study a long time ago, maybe 2017, showing that bitcoin was on track to match the volatility of the most volatile fiat currencies, like the New Zealand dollar, US dollar pair. And that was completely wrong because these derivative exchanges came in at whipshought the price and volatility went to the moon. And so volatility will reduce and that will encourage more of the organic investors to come in. Obviously, as volatility reduces, the risk starts to reduce.
00:11:36.038 - 00:12:00.210, Speaker B: And obviously Bitcoin is an outside sort of outlier gainer. It's like a startup that's accumulating on its adoption S curve. And so what scares people is the crazy whipsaw of volatility. And that was exaggerated by these sort of derivative games. And so the risk starts to drop for investors.
00:12:01.190 - 00:12:14.120, Speaker A: And you mentioned that you feel like you've been seeing the purchase of bitcoin by these big corporate treasuries like MicroStrategy and Square. How are you discerning that?
00:12:15.050 - 00:13:10.790, Speaker B: Okay, so it's very hard to track. And the best I have right now is that if you look back in the history of all prior bull runs, you'll see this sort of dip in the bitcoin stocks, the speculative stock that's sitting on spot exchanges. And so that is a sign of new Hoddlers coming in and buying those bitcoins and moving it off to colt storage and Hoddling. And so that's a very consistent pattern. We saw it in 2016, before the Moon run of 2017. We saw it in the 3000 to 4000 bottom of 2019. And currently we are seeing the mother of all scoop ups off these spot exchanges and moving into cold storage.
00:13:10.790 - 00:13:42.478, Speaker B: It's never been this long, it's never been this amount. It's currently nine months and it's still being scooped up. And I just see a little dip right now, meaning post PayPal. There's a whole lot of people buying and moving it off to Hoddling. So put that in perspective. That's quarter of a million bitcoins moved out, probably they paid around $2 billion for it. So $2 billion of money has come in buying those coins.
00:13:42.478 - 00:13:52.310, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's what I'm seeing. That's what's driving this current bullish activity, and it's only just begun.
00:13:52.650 - 00:13:58.250, Speaker A: And how are these different shifts in the market affecting the business of various infrastructure players?
00:13:58.990 - 00:14:47.510, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an interesting question. I'm an investor in a few infrastructure players and obviously I get information of their traction. And what's been very interesting for me is that months and months and months ago, we're already at all time high of user activity, new users coming on board, higher than the 2017 December top. And so the activity that's going on underlying this industry is at already all time highs when Bitcoin was valued at $20,000. So obviously that's a crazy fundamental bullish signal.
00:14:48.090 - 00:14:59.740, Speaker A: So recently you've been tweeting about how much the bitcoin price moves for every dollar invested. And I wondered, how do you calculate that? And then based on that, what would you project for the price of bitcoin over the next year?
00:15:00.270 - 00:15:54.330, Speaker B: Okay, so coin metrics was very well known for doing this metric called realized price, and it's realized cap. You can map it back to price. Essentially what it is is looking into the blockchain and seeing when hoddlers bought their coins, figuring out what they paid for it, and then you can figure out what the market paid for their coins. And I think that's roughly in the $67,000 zone right now. And so you can track what people have actually put into bitcoin through that metric, and then you can also track the actual valuation of bitcoin's market cap. So between the two capitalizations. And you can see the change in capital coming in versus the change in market cap growth through these two metrics.
00:15:54.330 - 00:16:19.282, Speaker B: And obviously, the ratio of dollar go up per dollar invested. And that's sitting currently very roughly estimated. There's errors in it, but it's 3.5 to one. And the interesting thing about it is that it is ramping upwards. All prior bull markets was very static. This time, the dollar in for dollar increase is climbing.
00:16:19.282 - 00:16:57.330, Speaker B: And what that means is the reflexivity is increasing. And that's just a big fancy term for as price goes up, the hoddlers hold on tighter. They don't want to sell it's. The first time we've seen that. And in terms of what that means is that if bitcoin needs to be a $1 trillion market cap, macro asset bucket, all macro asset buckets are valued in the trillions of dollars. We need roughly $200 billion of influx of capital to push us there, and that's roughly $50,000 for bitcoin.
00:16:58.470 - 00:17:02.500, Speaker A: Okay. Like by what, a year from now?
00:17:03.190 - 00:17:10.440, Speaker B: It doesn't make any predictions on a price target. It just says, this is how much money that needs to come in.
00:17:11.690 - 00:17:17.270, Speaker A: Okay, right. It's just based on when we see that amount of money come in.
00:17:17.420 - 00:17:56.294, Speaker B: That's right. And we've already seen, at a very minimum, $2 billion scooped up off the exchanges. We have $5 trillion in corporate treasuries that are sitting in cash, needing to hedge from inflation and money printing. We have 8.5 trillion to $9 trillion in sovereign wealth funds that are needing access to bitcoin just to have an optimal portfolio. And I believe this is the cycle that the very first sovereign wealth fund will come into bitcoin. They've been researching this for well over a year.
00:17:56.412 - 00:18:02.600, Speaker A: And what makes you say that? And when you say this cycle, you mean over the next three years.
00:18:03.770 - 00:18:26.526, Speaker B: Yeah. So this cycle started the bitcoin top happened in December 2017, and the cycles are four year cycles. So that means that 2017 plus four years is 2021 2022 within that time band, we can expect this to happen.
00:18:26.628 - 00:18:32.278, Speaker A: And what makes you say that you believe that sovereign wealth funds will start getting into bitcoin in this time period?
00:18:32.474 - 00:18:34.690, Speaker B: Just conversations within the industry.
00:18:35.350 - 00:19:15.360, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll see how this plays out. Before we go, I wanted to also ask about bitcoin's NVT ratio, which is the network value to transaction ratio, because you're pretty well known for frequently analyzing that. And I wondered if you could, first of all, explain a little bit more about what that is and then talk a little bit about a recent tweet you made that bitcoin's price was at an NVT ratio equivalent to the white swan price bottom from black Thursday during the initial part of the pandemic. And I just wondered with PayPal's news this week if that has changed or if you also feel like now it's still a good time to buy.
00:19:15.810 - 00:19:49.194, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. So obviously it's extremely great time to buy. So MVT was the first on chain signal where you could say, buy here, sell there. And so, essentially, the easy way to understand it is it's the equivalent of the price earnings ratio for bitcoin in a company. You have stock price, you have earnings in bitcoin, it's a store of value asset like gold. You do not have earnings. But we do have is underlying investor activity like new investors coming out.
00:19:49.194 - 00:20:38.522, Speaker B: And there's a constant churn. And the higher you see that churn, the higher the velocity of this bitcoins moving to new investors, the more fundamental activity in the network. So it's a ratio of the valuation, the market cap to that activity, and that creates this price earnings ratio for bitcoin. And what you want to see, obviously, is you want this PE ratio, MVT, to drop low. If it drops low, it means there's incredible amounts of investor activity that is not yet reflected in the price. And so MVT ratio, it plummeted into a buy zone in the COVID white swan crash. I think most of that was derivative traders getting wrecked, and it pushed the price down.
00:20:38.522 - 00:21:30.010, Speaker B: There was not much activity on chain between hoddlers selling out, and it was the perfect time to buy if you wanted more exposure to bitcoin. And currently, the amount of activity going on in the blockchain of new investors coming in is through the roof. And it's pushed that ratio back down into that zone where it was grossly undervalued for only a few days during the crash. And now we're in the same zone. But it's driven by incredible amounts of organic buying investor activity that's not yet reflected in the price. And we're only seeing more activity now with the PayPal announcement and a lot new more people coming in. I'm actually seeing this on the metrics right now that there's a lot of new participants coming in.
00:21:30.010 - 00:21:42.170, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's perfectly a great time to buy if you're in it for the year or multi year period.
00:21:43.150 - 00:22:05.250, Speaker A: One last question. You mostly cover bitcoin and have said that you don't cover Ether because you don't consider it as investable. But I wanted to ask what you thought of what Ether would become, whether it would become more investable with staking coming on with Ethereum 2.0 and also the potential adoption of Ethereum improvement proposal 1559, which would entail the burning of transaction fees.
00:22:06.330 - 00:23:02.354, Speaker B: Okay, so I'm not saying it's not investable, I'm just saying that it's got a very short backtrace of its performance. And in risk adjusted returns, Ethereum is more risky, but it's higher returns. In risk adjusted returns it slightly underperforms Bitcoin. Therefore I think it's fine if you want to do like a macro hold in bull cycles, you swing into Ethereum, you get the outsized returns and then you're going to expect some outsized losses in the beer market. So I think it's perfectly fine for that. Even if you want to hold multicycles, that's fine as well because it performs roughly like Bitcoin, but it's very untested. The back trace is ridiculously small compared to the length of Bitcoin.
00:23:02.354 - 00:23:47.494, Speaker B: That's been over twelve years, I think. Is it twelve years now? Yeah, almost twelve years for Bitcoin. Ethereum is very new and we barely have one full cycle, four year cycle. Analyzing that in terms of Ethereum Two, the problem with Theorem Two is that it's sharded. And so each one of those shards has not got an idea of what's happening on the other shard. And in terms of plain English, what that means is Ethereum One, this entire D Five space that is exploding based on financial apps and decentralized exchanges, they're all interoperable. I can go to one site and trade one ERC 20 for another.
00:23:47.494 - 00:24:30.846, Speaker B: I can get tokens from that from a liquidity pool. I can go to another app and I can lock that in. So there's a very interesting experimentation going on and it's like a network effect that's building between different apps. Ethereum too suffers from this because the shard spaces you get scalability, but you can't have these apps interoperable between each other. So I feel that's a significant problem. And we've got other networks that are coming up, like Solana, we've got particularly Radix I'm excited about, and that it's scalable also. But you can build the interoperability between these apps.
00:24:30.846 - 00:25:26.470, Speaker B: So I think there's going to be stronger competition for Ethereum Two. I think Ethereum One will continue to do well because it's got that store of value narrative that's building. It's not hard money as much as Bitcoin, but that is building. Ethereum Two is a little bit less tested. You do have the staking coming on, talking to a friend, founder of Stakehound, which provides liquidity for people who are staking he's estimating. Maybe you'll get a 10% return by putting that into Ethereum and locking it up, which is not to be underrated, but I think there may be 10%. It might be outperformed by other networks.
00:25:26.470 - 00:25:30.040, Speaker B: What was the final question around the.
00:25:30.890 - 00:25:40.810, Speaker A: Just about the ethereum improvement proposal 1559, in which some of the transaction fees would be burned, potentially making it deflationary.
00:25:41.310 - 00:26:08.900, Speaker B: Yeah, that's taking a book from the latest learning. So, yeah, that helps a lot for sure. That's proven. That's what we've learned from other tokens where you burn and reduce supply. So in that regard, it's bullish in terms of its utility and people needing to be on it. I think it has some problems and it's yet to be seen, so let's see what happens.
00:26:09.510 - 00:26:14.398, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, I've really enjoyed talking with you. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.
00:26:14.574 - 00:26:18.278, Speaker B: That's awesome. Been fun. Reconnecting laura yes.
00:26:18.444 - 00:27:14.200, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline crypto to come to PayPal bitcoin bounces PayPal announced Wednesday that it would add support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the first half of 2021. The company plans to let its 346,000,000 customers purchase and store the virtual currencies in its online wallet and use bitcoin, ether litecoin and bitcoin cash for purchases at its 26 million merchants. PayPal also plans to expand support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to venmo in the first half of 2021. For the time being, PayPal will not give users access to private keys or the ability to transfer their crypto to other accounts on or off the platform. This decision was met with expected criticism from the crypto community.
00:27:14.200 - 00:28:34.334, Speaker A: However, sinimhane ventures partner Adam Cochrane speculates that PayPal chose to do this because, quote, right now they want to profit on spread and need to get robust AML in place for transfers. My personal guess is that they also need to get the proper fraud protections in place so they don't get eaten alive by fraudsters stealing bitcoins from their platform. The block's Ryan todd notes that PayPal operates in many jurisdictions that are not crypto friendly, and so this move could force tax regulators to consider de minimis tax exemptions for paying with crypto, reading between the lines of the investor relations release in which the company mentions working with central banks and exploring other use cases. Tod also speculates that this is the first step of a larger plan to expand into central bank digital currencies and stablecoins after the PayPal. News the price of bitcoin saw a substantial rebound to $13,000 as of press time on CNBC Thursday morning. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul teeter jones, who made news earlier this year when he invested in bitcoin, compared investing in BTC to putting early money behind tech companies like apple or google. He said, quote, bitcoin has this enormous contingent of really, really smart and sophisticated people who really believe in it.
00:28:34.334 - 00:29:17.966, Speaker A: I've never had an inflation hedge where you have a kicker, but you also have great intellectual capital behind it. When you short the bond market, that's your inflation hedge. You're really betting on the fallacy of mankind rather than its ingenuity and entrepreneurialism. So I like bitcoin even more now than I did back then, Jones said. Next headline are Filecoin miners on strike. Several major filecoin miners have halted or reduced their mining power since the network's mainnet launch last week. The blame for the slowdown is Filecoin's current economic incentive model, which many miners feel is not in their favor because it does not give block rewards to miners immediately, but instead vests over 180 days.
00:29:17.966 - 00:30:14.746, Speaker A: Most of the top ten minor IDs have significantly reduced the amount of storage power they've contributed during the testnet. A major filecoin miner, Lee Bai, rejected the idea that the reduced mining power was an organized collective strike, saying quote It's not a strike, it's just a better strategy. Given the current economics with more potential sell pressure. When there's no adequate circulating fil at a steady price range, it's not lucrative to pledge a spot fil for a future fil whose price could be lower. In a Twitter thread Monday, protocol Labs founder and CEO Juan Benet called the miner strike nonsense. He said, quote in the last two weeks, we the devs recommended to many miners to slow down growth rate to match their token flow or pause until they can afford to grow steadily. He continued There are many people hoping to get rich quick with Filecoin without contributing value to the network.
00:30:14.746 - 00:30:53.950, Speaker A: That's just not how this works. This isn't what the Protocol rewards. We already have huge capacity and don't need much more yet the network must now focus on making that capacity useful by storing valuable data for users. Next headline fed Chair Powell Continues to Ponder a Digital Dollar. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during a panel discussion hosted by the International Monetary Fund on Monday that the US Continues to evaluate central bank digital currencies. Powell said a CBDC might improve the broader payment system in the US. And reiterated that the Fed has made no decision on a central bank digital currency at this time.
00:30:53.950 - 00:31:55.300, Speaker A: He said, quote I think it's more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first. Next Headline Regulatory roundup A proposed judgment between Kick and the securities and Exchange Commission would see Kick paying a $5 million fine over its 2017 token sale, as well as giving the SEC 45 days notice on any kin token transactions over the next three years. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network fined Helix and Coin Ninja founder Larry Dean Harmon $60 million for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act due to his operation of what they call virtual currency mixers.
