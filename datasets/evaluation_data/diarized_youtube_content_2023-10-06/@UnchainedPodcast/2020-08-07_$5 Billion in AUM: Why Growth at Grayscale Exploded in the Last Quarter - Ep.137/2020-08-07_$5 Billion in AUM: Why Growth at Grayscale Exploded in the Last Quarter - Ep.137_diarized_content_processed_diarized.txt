00:00:56.450 - 00:01:02.110, Speaker A: Today's guest is Michael Sonnenshine, managing director of Grayscale Investments. Welcome, Michael.
00:01:02.550 - 00:01:04.420, Speaker D: Hi, Laura. Great to be here.
00:01:05.110 - 00:01:11.010, Speaker A: In its recently quarterly report, grayscale announced record inflows. Tell us about that.
00:01:11.160 - 00:02:04.734, Speaker D: So on a quarterly basis, our team puts out a report that looks back at investment activity across the Grayscale family of products over that most recent quarter. And we try and break down for the investment community which products have inflows, which products are more popular than others, what the breakdown is of different types of investors, any other trends that we're seeing amongst our investor base. And the regularity of these reports have really allowed them to become almost the de facto sentiment indicator for investment in the space. And in Q Two of this year, we raised over $900 million in just that second quarter. And that was on the back of raising over half a billion dollars in Q One this year. So we're really seeing inflows into the Grayscale products at a record pace, and that's almost double.
00:02:04.782 - 00:02:06.078, Speaker B: What do you think accounts for the.
00:02:06.104 - 00:02:07.640, Speaker A: Massive increase in interest?
00:02:08.570 - 00:03:00.200, Speaker D: I think that the macro environment is causing a lot of investors to focus on crypto in a way that they perhaps hadn't before. I think one of the most topical things that investors are talking to us about is unlimited quantitative easing. And as they look at how much the Fed and other governmental bodies are printing, they're really starting to drill into the verifiable scarcity of assets like bitcoin. And when you think about that very important attribute that bitcoin has, and then you combine it with bitcoin's uncorrelated nature, and it's not just bitcoin, right, it's other digital currencies as well. Investors are really starting to appreciate that there is a new and uncorrelated return stream that they can maybe get from having exposure to digital currencies. And now is really the time we're seeing a lot of investors dig in on the space.
00:03:00.890 - 00:03:02.486, Speaker A: And so when you talked about the.
00:03:02.508 - 00:03:23.214, Speaker B: Quantitative easing, that does, of course, immediately bring to mind bitcoin because of the cap on its supply. And when you started your answer, you were talking primarily in Bitcoin or about Bitcoin, but I wondered how the interest in the other currencies was spread out. Is it 80% in Bitcoin or what are you seeing in terms of the.
00:03:23.252 - 00:03:25.818, Speaker A: Interest across the various crypto assets?
00:03:25.994 - 00:04:11.334, Speaker D: So Grayscale now has ten different investment products and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is our flagship product. It's been around the longest. It's our largest fund, no question about it. We have seen a market uptick in interest across the other products. So in particular, I'd highlight in Q Two, we saw a lot of interest in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and really seeing more investment really coming in across the board. And I believe now of our returning institutional investors, we now see over 80% of them having now invested in more than one Grayscale product, meaning they now each have exposure to more than one digital currency. And it's interesting to think about that audience because for many of them, bitcoin is their first foray.
00:04:11.334 - 00:04:29.810, Speaker D: It's the place that they're most comfortable with. They've done the most research on typically it's what gets them comfortable and gets them to dip their toe in the space. And we're now really seeing a growing trend of investors not just wanting Bitcoin exposure, but they actually see diversification benefits of having more than one cryptocurrency exposure in their portfolio.
00:04:30.390 - 00:04:35.538, Speaker B: And when you said that Ethereum was another one of the assets that was.
00:04:35.624 - 00:04:38.150, Speaker A: Gaining a lot of interest, what's driving that?
00:04:38.220 - 00:04:48.466, Speaker B: Because Ethereum does not have a cap on its supply. So I was curious to know why they were focusing on that out of all the other non Bitcoin assets.
00:04:48.658 - 00:05:17.380, Speaker D: Well, I think for a lot of investors, ethereum, like Bitcoin, has a lot of staying power. It too like bitcoin has overcome a lot of adversity. And I think investors are really starting to drill into some of the use cases around Ethereum powering DeFi and a lot of other new applications for which Ethereum is really targeted towards where I think for more investors thinking about Bitcoin, they're really thinking about it more along the lines of a digital gold or a digital store of value.
00:05:17.990 - 00:05:22.062, Speaker A: And who is coming to you now? Are you seeing interest from new groups.
00:05:22.126 - 00:05:26.070, Speaker B: And what types of investors are coming to Grayscale?
00:05:26.490 - 00:06:41.686, Speaker D: Well, so Grayscale raises assets primarily from institutional investors, so we deal primarily with accredited investors. So it does include a lot of high net worth individuals and family offices, financial advisors. But really the vast majority of the actual dollars that we're getting are coming from hedge funds and then other types of institutions, endowments and pensions. And I think one of the most interesting things, and we actually broke this out in some of our reports this year, is that the allocations aren't coming from any one kind of investor. I think for a lot of folks, bitcoin and digital currency investing, it's for momentum traders or it's for funds that really only are experienced in investing in technology or inventor capital, things that are really on the riskiest end of the spectrum. And for us, when we look at the actual mandates of our investors, it's everyone from global macro funds to value funds to risk arbitrage funds. I mean, every single kind of investor mandate is represented in the grayscale investor base, which I think the takeaway is digital currency investing is certainly not for everyone.
00:06:41.686 - 00:07:01.570, Speaker D: It's risky, it's early days. A lot of investors need to have a patient and kind of medium term horizon for their investment. But it does then mean that it's something that everyone should at least be considering. And we're already seeing empirical data that it's making its way into the portfolios of investors of all different kinds of mandates.
00:07:02.070 - 00:07:15.362, Speaker B: There was also huge validation from Paul Tudor Jones around this time. Amongst that institutional set, he announced that he had gotten exposure to bitcoin in his portfolio.
00:07:15.506 - 00:07:19.530, Speaker A: And I was wondering, are you seeing any impact from that on investors?
00:07:20.190 - 00:08:04.194, Speaker D: Well, I think investors are certainly always going to be looking at the price of digital currencies as a metric to look at when considering when to or when not to put exposure on. And that's not something we'll ever be able to draw investors away from. Right. They're always thinking about when to put on risk and when to take it off. I certainly think that the environment around the asset class has created a lot of there have been a lot of recent tailwinds around that. So you can definitely point to Paul Tudor Jones, you can definitely point to Renaissance Technologies. A lot of these more storied investors who are coming out publicly in support of the asset class is a huge point of validation for investors.
00:08:04.194 - 00:08:51.480, Speaker D: And when you combine that with the types of on ramps and the infrastructure being developed around the asset class, when you think about the development of the derivatives market, how much there is in the way of lending and borrowing and really seeing all of the onramps provide investors with that know your customer AML really all those protections they're used to seeing, It really forces more people to no longer really have any roadblocks that would prevent them from participating in the asset class, which I think for a lot of folks long has been the reason they've been on the sidelines. They wanted more regularity, more regulatory clarity or they wanted to see more infrastructure built up. And at this point, those excuses don't really hold up.
00:08:52.090 - 00:08:56.470, Speaker B: And so what percentage of your investor base was new this quarter?
00:08:57.290 - 00:09:28.766, Speaker D: So we expanded the investor base by about 24, 25% this past quarter. And so what I think that means is, number one, we're certainly seeing a lot of returning investors and as I shared, a lot of them are now utilizing more than one grayscale product. But we're also moving into new audiences and new areas and I think that a lot of investors continue to be attracted to Grayscale for its long standing track record and the breadth and depth of its offerings.
00:09:28.958 - 00:09:30.910, Speaker A: And how would you say the growth.
00:09:30.990 - 00:09:51.900, Speaker B: In the space compares this year from last year? And when I say that, I don't mean just because of the macro forces due to the pandemic, but I wondered if there was anything more inherent to the development of the crypto space as well that has changed that narrative for people.
00:09:52.510 - 00:11:03.520, Speaker D: Well, I think certainly one thing is that it's just generally been orders of magnitude easier for folks to get the right resources they need around crypto. Whether you're reading CoinDesk.com or listening to this podcast as frequently as it comes out, reading books, reading articles, reading papers that the Grayscale team is authoring, I think today there is probably the most robust library of resources available to investors. And I think that that's been a huge benefit because for our team, we actually conduct a survey almost every year or middle of doing one now where we actually go out and try and determine using a third party provider, what are some of those holdbacks, what are some of those sentiment indicators in the investment community. And we're not just talking about sophisticated hedge funds, we're talking about just average investors as well. And the last time we did this in 2019, for most investors, the biggest thing holding them back was a lack of education. So our team has really started to engage the financial advisor community.
00:11:03.520 - 00:11:24.680, Speaker D: We just launched an entire digital currency toolkit for financial advisors. They need to be armed with the information to have those conversations with their clients and be armed and ready and not kind of caught flat footed. So I really think not just Grayscale, but the industry as a whole is doing a really good job of getting those resources out there.
00:11:25.370 - 00:11:27.366, Speaker A: In a moment, we'll discuss some news.
00:11:27.468 - 00:11:32.620, Speaker B: Regarding the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:12:35.970 - 00:12:38.910, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Michael son and Shine.
00:12:39.330 - 00:12:41.726, Speaker A: Grayscale filed a form ten with the.
00:12:41.748 - 00:12:46.466, Speaker B: SEC for the Grayscale ethereum trust. What is a Form Ten and what.
00:12:46.488 - 00:12:48.450, Speaker A: Is the significance of that filing?
00:12:49.110 - 00:13:45.990, Speaker D: So I think a lot of your listeners and viewers may never have heard of a Form Ten before. So let me unpack that. Typically when a company goes public, company XYZ IPOs on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq, they're already subject to being an SEC reporting company. That means they file their financial statements as ten K's and ten Q's and make periodic updates through eight K's. So you don't hear about Form Ten often. In our case, Grayscale actually voluntarily filed Form Ten, which actually allows, if it becomes effective, for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust to become an SEC reporting company. So Grayscale Ethereum Trust is already alive and well and is an active product that now has over $500 million of assets in it.
00:13:45.990 - 00:14:31.460, Speaker D: It's the world's largest ethereum vehicle, world's largest Ethereum investment vehicle. And by filing Form Ten, we are voluntarily asking the SEC to have this vehicle become a reporting company so that its financials become ten K's and ten Q's and we file eight K's. And really the motivation there is to really provide investors with that additional disclosure and that additional reporting obligation that, again, we're voluntarily doing. This is what investors want, this is what investors deserve and this is what investors candidly already have when they're looking at lots of other investment instruments across other asset classes. And we really think this is a really big milestone for the product.
00:14:31.910 - 00:14:37.400, Speaker B: And why did you decide to do that for this investment vehicle at this point in time?
00:14:37.930 - 00:15:21.540, Speaker D: Well, this is on the heels of our successfully having the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust become an SEC reporting company in January of this year. And so this is the vehicle that Next seemed to be the most likely candidate to become effective as an SEC reporting company. And I think with the added attention this product has gotten, with the added investment it's received, we've seen already such a positive reception around Trust. You know, we want to expand this into not only Grayscale Ethereum Trust, but over time we hope we can bring the same level of reporting to other products within the Grayscale family. So time will tell.
00:15:22.070 - 00:15:36.950, Speaker B: And does the interest in Ethereum have to do with the upcoming transition to a proof of stake network, which will perhaps also have an impact on the value of Ether as a digital asset?
00:15:37.450 - 00:16:27.510, Speaker D: I don't think necessarily. I think my takeaway around the potential transition from ETH to ETH 2.0 and some of you listening and watching may have no idea what Laura and I are talking about, but it's a pretty material change to the Ethereum protocol if it goes through. And I think what I'm most interested in sharing with you is that we have been amazingly, amazingly impressed by our investors who are coming to the table and asking questions about this, that they're smart enough on this asset class and smart enough on Ethereum to be doing their homework. And again, those resources are now available that we're now having those kinds of conversations with investors about ETH and ETH 2.0. So certainly something that's coming up in conversation, but not necessarily something that I would say is driving investment.
00:16:28.730 - 00:16:39.466, Speaker B: Your parent company, Digital Currency Group, and grayscale, I believe, were initially proponents of Ethereum Classic. And it seems, however, by filing the Form Ten for the Ethereum Trust that.
00:16:39.488 - 00:16:42.160, Speaker A: The priority has switched. Why is that?
00:16:42.610 - 00:17:29.660, Speaker D: I wouldn't say our priority has switched. I think that at the grayscale level we try to identify protocols that investors are a telling us that they want to be able to gain exposure to and trying to identify opportunities where we may see certain value and want to bring that to investors as well. And obviously that includes both ethereum and ethereum classic. Because we offer products around both digital assets, I would say we again would want to file more products to become SEC reporting over time and there's no real prioritization so much as the products that we're able to work on with the SEC.
00:17:30.590 - 00:17:36.986, Speaker B: And so, as you mentioned, you do have a suite of products for other digital assets.
00:17:37.098 - 00:17:38.574, Speaker A: What metrics would you want to see.
00:17:38.612 - 00:17:47.300, Speaker B: For any of those, whether it's Bitcoin Cash or Horizon or Litecoin to determine whether or not you would also file Form Tens for those?
00:17:47.830 - 00:18:48.166, Speaker D: Well, so I think some of the most meaningful updates around some of the other grayscale products are, one, the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust as well as the Grayscale Litecoin Trust. Both of those products have now satisfied the obligations to become publicly traded. And so both of those products were recently assigned ticker symbols and are now just awaiting their DTC eligibility before they'll begin trading. And I'm also happy to share that grayscale is not going to stop at the ten products we have today. We're working on and always maintaining a list of other products that we'd like to bring to market. And I think for us, again, it's toeing that line between where we see opportunities and where investors are telling us they want to deploy capital. But there are some pretty fundamental things that we're always looking at that can help us screen in or screen out products or rather digital currencies as to whether or not we could create products for them.
00:18:48.166 - 00:19:18.698, Speaker D: And so we're thinking of things like is there a transparent market that we can access around the digital asset? Is it possible for us to create a reliable reference rate for the product? Is there a sound custodial solution for the product? Those types of real implications are very meaningful to us continuing to utilize the best service providers we can and really structure these products in a way that works for investors.
00:19:18.874 - 00:19:26.306, Speaker B: And when you said earlier that the bitcoin cash and litecoin investment vehicles will be publicly tradable, is that on the.
00:19:26.328 - 00:19:28.930, Speaker A: Over the counter market, like GPTC?
00:19:29.270 - 00:19:46.966, Speaker D: It is, yeah, it'll be on the over the counter market. So now with the additions of the bitcoin, cash and litecoin products, now six out of the ten grayscale products will be on the public market, which is really exciting and something I know the team is very proud of.
00:19:47.148 - 00:20:03.294, Speaker B: And so we've really only talked about your single digital asset products, but what about your diversified kind of index type products? What is the interest in that? And where do you think when investors express interest in that, where does that come from?
00:20:03.332 - 00:20:04.846, Speaker A: Like, why are they interested in that.
00:20:04.868 - 00:20:06.666, Speaker B: As opposed to a single asset?
00:20:06.858 - 00:21:03.450, Speaker D: So we have one diversified offering, and it's called the grayscale digital large cap fund. This fund was created a few years ago, and it was really meant to meet the demand of investors telling us we'd like to invest in digital currency, maybe we miss bitcoin and we should invest in ethereum or I don't know how to pick winners and avoid losers. And if there was a product that I could make a singular investment in and it would give me broad based exposure, well, then that would be something really attractive. And so grayscale digital large cap was created to satisfy that. And it has as its holdings the assets which constitute the upper 70% of the crypto market, and it holds them on a market cap weighted basis. So today that's five assets. That includes bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin, and XRP, and the constituents inside the product get reevaluated every quarter.
00:21:03.450 - 00:21:54.338, Speaker D: So we'll be able to screen in or screen out certain assets from being included in that basket. The digital large cap fund began its public quotation late last year under symbol GDLC grayscale digital large cap. And the pickup has been tremendous. There are a lot of investors now who, yes, still may be interested in bitcoin or maybe interested in ethereum, some of those better known digital currency networks. But we're now facing more end investors that we would construe more as allocators those types of investors that want to make a more broad based investment in the space versus picking individual currencies around which to have exposure. And so we're really excited about the digital large cap fund and really happy with the investor reception around it.
00:21:54.504 - 00:22:09.138, Speaker B: You've been with grayscale from the beginning when interest in cryptocurrency was much smaller. I think you joined in January 2014, and now here you are. Grayscale has more than $5 billion in assets under management.
00:22:09.234 - 00:22:11.400, Speaker A: How does it feel to have come this far?
00:22:12.170 - 00:23:07.730, Speaker D: Well, I will say that it is a team effort. When I joined, we just had about $60 million of assets under management in just the grayscale bitcoin trust. And so to be a part of building out the team and building the business as a group. We have really come together as a group of smart, forward thinking, hardworking individuals. And now, speaking to you tonight, we have five and a half billion dollars of assets across a family of ten products. And so I think I could have never imagined the growth would be at the pace that it's been, where that digital currency would move as fast as it has. But you've been in the space a long time, too, and I'm sure you'll agree that a week in the digital currency world is like three months in the real world.
00:23:07.730 - 00:23:15.100, Speaker D: So I'm a little tired, but I can happily say that the team at Grayscale is just getting started.
00:23:15.950 - 00:23:16.362, Speaker A: Great.
00:23:16.416 - 00:23:22.890, Speaker B: Well, congratulations on your record quarter, and thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:23:23.050 - 00:23:24.574, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:23:24.772 - 00:24:30.382, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline twitter hack mastermind with 17 year olds graham Ivan Clark, a 17 year old Tampa resident, was arrested last Friday for allegedly being the brains behind last month's Twitter hack in which the accounts of Barack Obama, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden and other prominent people were taken over. As the New York Times put it, quote, his arrest raised questions about how someone so young could penetrate the defenses of what was supposedly one of Silicon Valley's most sophisticated technology companies. Clark had a troubled family life and spent much of his time online, where he developed a reputation for, quote, scamming people out of money, photos and information, according to people who, for instance, played video games such as Minecraft with him and got swindled for 50 or $100. He later got involved in cryptocurrencies and joined an online forum called OG Users, where he described himself as, quote, a full time crypto trader dropout.
00:24:30.382 - 00:25:16.946, Speaker A: But he was later banned by the community. After failing to pay bitcoin to a user from OG users, he entered a hacker community that focused on SIM, swapping people's phone numbers so as to get access to steal their cryptocurrency. That group targeted a Seattle tech investor and drained his accounts of 164 bitcoins, then worth $856,000 and now worth $1.9 million. The extortion note was signed by Scrim, which is allegedly one of Clark's online aliases. In April, the Secret Service seized 100 bitcoins from Clark, and the Seattle Tech investor received a letter from the Secret Service saying that the agency had recovered 100 of his bitcoins. Additionally, the blog reports that Clark currently has 300 BTC worth $3.5
00:25:16.946 - 00:26:17.778, Speaker A: million. A friend of Clark's said that the run in with the Secret Service frightened him. But within two weeks, according to the government affidavit, he convinced a Twitter employee that he worked in the social media company's It department, and from there, the hack began. Next headline square's cash app bitcoin sales more than double to $875,000,000 in the second quarter of 2020. The Square cash app saw revenue of $875,000,000, which, because it's based on the purchase price, also reflects the runup in BTC. However, even the cash app's gross profit has also more than doubled from $7 million in Q One to $17 million in Q Two. Revenue is up 600% year over year, and the bitcoin gross profit is up 711% year over year and according to this chart by the block, as a proportion of the company's total gross profit, that shot up from 1.24%
00:26:17.778 - 00:27:03.010, Speaker A: in Q One to 2.84% in Q Two. On a related note, after the bitcoin and ether prices both rose dramatically in the last few weeks, they also both saw a brief crash within six minutes on Sunday, with bitcoin dropping by 12% and ether by 20% as more than $1 billion in futures was liquidated. However, the prices have mostly recovered since, and meanwhile, according to coin metrics, bitcoin addresses with at least $10 or more of cryptocurrency have hit a new all time high of 16.6 million, up 14.5% from the previous peak of 14.5 million from January 2018.
00:27:03.010 - 00:28:32.794, Speaker A: Next Headline Ethereum 20 Testnet goes Live The final testnet ahead of the launch of Ethereum 20 went live on Tuesday with 20,000 validators Staking 650,000 ETH. The testnet also features five clients teku, Prism, Nimbus, Lodestar and Lighthouse. If you're looking for a good overview of the state of ethereum today, Delphi Digital released the first of its monthly reports on ethereum, going over pretty much every major issue on the network, including everything from whether Ethereum's proof of stake system can compete with yield in DFI to the details of Ethereum improvement proposal 1559. The report shows how DFI is leading ethereum's momentum, gives an analysis of demand for grayskill's ethereum investment trust, and breaks down the various attractions of DFI in areas such as decentralized exchanges, yield, farming as a token distribution mechanism, and what the growth of bitcoin on ethereum means for the security of the bitcoin blockchain. One of the more interesting charts shows that 58% of ether has not moved in over a year. Another shows that DFI protocols that introduce liquidity mining saw fast growth amongst users, although Uniswap, which currently does not have a token, still has the most users overall. Next Headline Ethereum Spot and Future Volumes are Growing Faster than bitcoin's the blog reports that bitcoin's market cap is roughly five times that of Ethereum.
00:28:32.794 - 00:29:26.226, Speaker A: However, trading volumes for ether in the spot and futures market is rising faster since September 2019. On the spot markets, the ETH BTC price ratio has more than doubled, and the trading volume of Ether is about half of that of BTC, whereas in September it was at 19%. The ratio of ETH futures trading volume to BTC futures trading volume has increased from 8% in September to 29% today. Next Headline 251 percent Attacks on Ethereum Classic the first nets the attacker $5.6 million after several days. What was initially thought to be an innocent mistake on Ethereum Classic turned out to be a 51% attack by a malicious miner. In the end, the attacker double spent 807,260 etc, which is worth $5.6
00:29:26.226 - 00:30:31.154, Speaker A: million, while spending just 17.5 BTC, worth slightly less than $200,000 to execute it. The way this person carried it out was by sending etc from an exchange to his or her own wallets, then back to the exchange on the etc blockchain. But then the attacker used what amounted to more than 51% of the etc hash power to mine thousands of blocks in which he or she sent etc from those wallets to other wallets that he or she controlled. Instead of back to the exchange, the attacker then broadcasts those blocks, which reorganize the chain, replacing the blocks containing the transactions to the exchange with the transactions to the other wallets. It seems that Okx may have been the exchange that was targeted. And if that isn't crazy enough, on Thursday, Ethereum Classic experienced a second 51% attack with a reorganization of more than 4000 blocks.
00:30:31.154 - 00:31:40.346, Speaker A: CoinDesk reported that the majority of Ethereum Classic miners are continuing to mine the shorter version of the chain, though the reorganized blockchain is currently longer. Next Headline Four House Members ask IRS to not tax proof of stake block rewards Four members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus wrote a letter to the Internal Revenue Service requesting that stakers not get taxed for receiving block rewards, but only on their gains when they sell. Representatives David Schweicher of Arizona, Bill Foster of Illinois, Tom Emmer of Minnesota, and Darren Soto of Florida wrote It is possible that the taxation of staking rewards as income may overstate taxpayers'actual gains from participating in this new technology. It could also result in a reporting and compliance nightmare for taxpayers and the service alike. One of the concerns is that staking protocols could release new tokens every few minutes, which would create hundreds of taxable events every year. Another is that gains do not always reflect income, because an individual Staker's tokens may increase by 6%. But that may be because the supply of tokens on the network has increased 5%.
00:31:40.346 - 00:32:38.282, Speaker A: Coin center advocates that block rewards not be taxed as income, but quote, like crops, minerals, livestock, artwork, and assembly widgets. They should be taxed when they are sold, not when they are created. The advocacy group says validating on a proof of stake blockchain isn't like being paid revenue, but instead like creating a valuable item through labor, the way one might, quote, grow valuable crops on one's own land or extract minerals from one's own mines. Next Headline this is a roundup of DFI hacks, scams and blunders. Some users of DFI options issuance platform Open lost 371,000 USDC due to an exploit on its ETH put contracts. The attacker was able to steal the collateral of some puts by double exercising O tokens. Similarly, the creator of asuka token, which is a fork of YFI, allegedly exit scammed.
00:32:38.282 - 00:33:39.010, Speaker A: Korean crypto news outlets reported that Zhang Chan Jiang. Shut down the Token's website and social media accounts. The Asuka Token plummeted from one next yVaults a new product put out by yearn was a bit luckier when trail of vitz caught a bug before any exploit occurred that could have allowed an attacker to drain most, if not all, of the pool's yusdc assets. Meanwhile, the Block reports that the SEC is looking to buy a blockchain forensics tool to help it monitor smart contracts. To detect the purpose of a smart contract, the Token sale specifications, permissions management and security and vulnerability management, among other things. Finally, fun bits for those who remember the days of the Dow Dan Robinson of crypto VC firm Paradigm Tweeted. Upon hearing the news that the Ethereum Classic chain had been 51% attacked, I was told that this was the Immutable chain.
