00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.450, Speaker B: Whole thing is very OD.
00:00:01.530 - 00:00:02.286, Speaker A: And I have to.
00:00:02.308 - 00:00:14.906, Speaker B: Imagine also, a lot of these attackers are probably basically the equivalent of script kitties who are, like, living in Russia or something, and they're, like, 14 years old, and they just live on ether scan and they found some vulnerability.
00:00:15.098 - 00:00:18.526, Speaker A: And then once you do the hack, you can follow all the steps. Like, okay, first fund.
00:00:18.548 - 00:00:19.306, Speaker B: It from Tornado.
00:00:19.338 - 00:00:20.238, Speaker A: And then make sure you use a.
00:00:20.244 - 00:00:21.482, Speaker B: VPN and blah, blah, blah.
00:00:21.546 - 00:00:25.266, Speaker A: Then you have the money. And now once you have the money, there's no guide.
00:00:25.298 - 00:00:26.038, Speaker B: For how to get the.
00:00:26.044 - 00:00:29.746, Speaker A: Money out. There's no guide for how to deal with, like, wow, everyone on the Internet.
00:00:29.778 - 00:00:31.158, Speaker B: Is trying to get in contact with me.
00:00:31.244 - 00:00:32.118, Speaker A: What should I say to them?
00:00:32.124 - 00:00:33.222, Speaker B: What should I not say to them?
00:00:33.276 - 00:00:37.266, Speaker A: How do I avoid getting unmasked? And I have to imagine that that's.
00:00:37.298 - 00:00:38.614, Speaker B: Where a lot of these hackers fall.
00:00:38.652 - 00:00:45.206, Speaker A: Apart is not before the hack, but after the hack. Like, after the hack is done, more money, more problems. Now you have to.
00:00:45.228 - 00:00:45.846, Speaker B: Suddenly deal with.
00:00:45.868 - 00:00:48.086, Speaker A: The fact that you have $170,000,000 on.
00:00:48.108 - 00:00:49.734, Speaker B: Your hands and the entire world coming after.
