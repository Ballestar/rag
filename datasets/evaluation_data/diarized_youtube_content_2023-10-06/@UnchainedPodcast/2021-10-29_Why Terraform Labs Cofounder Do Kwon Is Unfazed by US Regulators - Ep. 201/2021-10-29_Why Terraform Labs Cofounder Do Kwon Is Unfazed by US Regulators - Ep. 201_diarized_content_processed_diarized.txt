00:01:11.590 - 00:01:15.390, Speaker B: Today's guest is Doe Kwan, co founder of TerraForm labs.
00:01:15.470 - 00:01:16.414, Speaker A: Welcome, Doe.
00:01:16.542 - 00:01:18.260, Speaker C: Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:01:18.630 - 00:01:37.046, Speaker B: You and your company made a pretty bold move last week filing a lawsuit against the SEC. But before we get into the details on that, let's just make sure our listeners are up to speed on everything that you do in the crypto space. Can you tell us what TerraForm labs is and explain some of your crypto projects such as terra and mirror protocol?
00:01:37.238 - 00:02:19.290, Speaker C: So, TerraForm labs, which is a company that I founded, is a core developer of terra, which is many things. It's a layer one blockchain, but it builds a set of products centered around the decentralized stablecoin, mainly terra USD. So the differentiator of terra USD versus some of the better known stablecoins in the industry, such as tether and USDC, is that it's decentralized and algorithmic. So while for something like tether, there is a dollar in bank deposits, supposedly for every unit of stablecoin that's issued, terra uses a set of on chain incentives to make sure that the coin can maintain price parity with the dollar.
00:02:19.710 - 00:02:22.730, Speaker B: And do you also want to describe mirror protocol?
00:02:23.870 - 00:03:20.460, Speaker C: Sure. So, in the early days of terra USD, we built a series of applications to enhance the utility of terra stablecoins. So the idea was that we tried to break down money as a product and then thought about what are some of the key features of money that we can improve with a decentralized version of the dollar. So it turned out that with money, you can either spend it or hold it. So we decided to build a stablecoin and a set of products around it that would make terra USD the easiest to spend and the most attractive to hold. So on the spending component, we built a number of payment apps, primarily in Asia. So we built Chai and einport and in Korea and then Mimipay in Know, and these things are doing billions of dollars in transaction volume with retail buying anything from general purpose ecommerce to online food deliveries to movie theater tickets and things like that.
00:03:20.460 - 00:04:03.260, Speaker C: And then we also built Mirror Protocol, which is a synthetics protocol that creates assets that follow the price of various different assets, like, for example, equities or commodities or ETFs, such that people across the world that don't have ready or easy access to some of the most attractive markets in the world can now sort of improve their financial outcomes by now gaining access to those markets. We also built Anchor Protocol, which is a way for you to get high attractive yield on your stable coins to the tune of, let's say, 19.5% per annum. And these are powered by staking yields that are coming in from multiple blockchains such as Terra Salana and Ethereum 2.0.
00:04:03.630 - 00:04:40.920, Speaker B: So the SEC has been conducting an investigation into Mirror Protocol, and for the listeners who've been following things closely in the crypto space, they're probably aware that this type of product that Mirror Protocol features is something that has caught the SEC's attention before. For those of you who remember settlements or enforcement actions with companies like Abra so for, you know, this kind of is what resulted in you suing the SEC. So tell us how that came about.
00:04:41.930 - 00:05:45.258, Speaker C: First off, I think it's natural for regulators to want to look into things that are so new that breaks incumbent frameworks for how markets were regulated and people were doing financial transactions. So if you look at things like Mirror or Anchor, they are pretty interesting in the sense that if there was wide market acceptance of, let's say, the Anchor Protocol, nobody would ever use Wells Fargo, while at the same time it's not regulated in the way that a bank is regulated. And there's a lot of things that don't fit in nicely even compared to existing DeFi protocols or for Mirror Protocol, there are a lot of valid concerns for having unregulated price exposure to stock markets. So I think it's natural that they're looking into things like that. And it's not just the SEC. I think it's something that many regulators across the world are going to pay attention to. And I am genuinely sincere when I say that I am happy to enter into a dialogue and educate regulators across the world.
00:05:45.258 - 00:06:04.578, Speaker C: This is not sort of our first dog and pony show. I do run large regulated payments company in Korea, so happy to do those things. But I think it's also important that when crypto companies are working with regulators, that they do it from a position of strength and do it from a.
00:06:04.584 - 00:07:03.346, Speaker B: Position of so just so listeners have the full background. What happened was the SEC served you with subpoenas just before you were supposed to go on stage at this made the rounds on Twitter at that time. But it wasn't clear exactly who had been served with those subpoenas. And this was after your lawyers had kind of established with the SEC that the SEC did not have jurisdiction over you. So Stephen Palley, who is a lawyer in the crypto space, tweeted that your lawsuit against the SEC was the, quote, rare case of a preemptive lawsuit against a regulator making sense. And his comment was, quote, if I were negotiating with someone and they decided to serve my client publicly the same day that they were on the phone with me about the same case, I would be pretty ticked. A really, really shitty way to treat people.
00:07:03.346 - 00:07:26.060, Speaker B: That was all Stephen's comment. So this incident basically fits into this kind of wider regulatory picture we have here in the US. Around, you know, I would say people in the crypto industry are particularly apprehensive about the SEC. What's your take on the SEC's approach to regulating the crypto space here in the US?
00:07:26.670 - 00:07:57.860, Speaker C: Well, I think the easy way to look at it is while I am happy to cooperate and work with the SEC, it doesn't really hit me the same way that somebody that's American and really understands and has been living with some of that reach most of their lives would feel about it. Right? Yeah, I mean, it's kind of interesting and there are parts of this that are educational and fun and largely it doesn't really impact me all that much.
00:07:59.050 - 00:08:18.700, Speaker B: Okay, but I mean, just as a builder, do you find that there are modifications or adjustments or just anything that you kind of have to think of when you're building these projects and that there's certain risks you have to take into account because of the atmosphere here in the US.
00:08:19.230 - 00:09:19.150, Speaker C: So the way that I think about it is that, yes, there is some hostile overreach of regulators in the beginning, and that's because the industry is just fundamentally transformative. Right. But another way of thinking about it is that people that run regulated fintech services or banking services get hit with subpoenas and get investigated and have to work with regulators on a daily basis. I think the problem is, even though some of these crypto companies operate from a financial perspective, at the scale of Fortune 500 companies, they're really from a human resources perspective, they're at the size of a seed or series a stage startup. So when regulators approach them as if they would be talking to, let's say, the Robin Hoods of the world, then I think it has like a huge psychological impact. But the reality of it is it's just like one of those things that you have to deal with if you're trying to start a financial revolution. So one of the interesting things that I thought about, like in crypto, the DeFi meme is that we're here to change the future of France.
00:09:19.150 - 00:09:59.818, Speaker C: And the interesting thing is, the last time that they tried to change the future of France, they pulled out the Guillotine and then they started executing people. And they're not doing that today. I don't think regulators are doing anything that's super crazy. All they're doing is asking questions. And yeah, there's going to be some hostility about it. Usually people are hostile to things that they don't understand, but it's through this process that we educate regulators, find a common ground and find compromise. Right? So if we're really in this and if this is an actual revolution, then I think some of the costs that we have to pay are actually not that high.
00:09:59.818 - 00:10:02.480, Speaker C: It's just the price we have to play the game.
00:10:04.210 - 00:10:04.718, Speaker A: Okay.
00:10:04.804 - 00:10:16.500, Speaker B: All right, so you seem to have a pretty almost nonchalant attitude about this, but we'll discuss a little bit more about this regulatory issue in a moment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.
00:10:17.830 - 00:10:39.610, Speaker A: There's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by downloading the Nodal Cash app. It's free, easy to use, and there's no hardware to buy. The Nodal Cash app allows you to earn crypto whether you're on the go, stuck in traffic, or even while you're sleeping. Nodal Cash is the crypto you earn 24/7. Go to Nodal IO unconfirmed to get started today.
00:10:39.760 - 00:10:40.214, Speaker C: That's?
00:10:40.262 - 00:11:16.020, Speaker A: No D-L-E IO unconfirmed. Did you know that exchanges take up to a 25% cut on your staking rewards? But you don't need an exchange to stake. You can run a validator at home, join thousands of solo stakers, get an Avato device, plug it in, deposit your stake and earn the full reward. Avato created the best hardware and specific software to stake and keeps your validator on the latest version through auto updates. One time investment, 100% profit. Go to Avato. That's ava do.
00:11:18.230 - 00:11:22.166, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Doe. So do you have an opinion on.
00:11:22.188 - 00:11:23.794, Speaker A: What you think would be the optimal.
00:11:23.842 - 00:11:26.440, Speaker B: Way of regulating crypto here in the US.
00:11:26.890 - 00:12:33.770, Speaker C: So I think right now there seems to be a pretty heavy emphasis on some of the landmark protocols in crypto. So let's say the leading lending protocols, the leading DEXes, some leading chains. But I think the initial focus needs to be on, let's say, weeding out the frauds and scams in the industry. And I feel like in order to because it brings more publicity and it's more interesting, I think there's a bit more focus on what I consider to be fairly legitimate institutions in cryptocurrency, in the crypto industry that are trying to do really amazing things and it really slows them down and it hurts the industry overall. And I think if there was equal weight, I really think it should be the majority of the attention. But I think if there's equal weight paid to some of the scams and frosters and rug pulls in the industry, I think that would actually lead to a net positive result for everyone. But when there's a hack that happens and $100 million gets stolen, that doesn't seem to get as much attention as somebody launching a novel dex algorithm.
00:12:35.090 - 00:12:50.510, Speaker B: Okay, well, we can talk about that in a moment because of some of this week's news. But I did want to ask for this question about how US. Regulators should apply regulations here in the US. Do you think that the existing regulations.
00:12:50.850 - 00:12:52.558, Speaker A: Should be applied here or do you.
00:12:52.564 - 00:12:54.400, Speaker B: Think that there needs to be something new?
00:12:55.370 - 00:13:48.998, Speaker C: I think the problem is that the regulations are too vague. Right. So I've thought about this for a while, but I think it's better if you have an actual legal framework that is decided by the legislative French instead of something that regulates by enforcement and precedent. It is true that a lot of the security laws are quite outdated, and they're based in a world where there were wild cowboys and private banks that were issuing their own notes that were supposed to replace currency. I don't think that framework applies really well in a global context where all the value moves through the Internet. There's a lot of innovation that's happening, so I don't think that fits really well. So if there was sort of like an actual law that passes Congress that says, hey, look, this is a standard for a minimal viable threshold of decentralization that you need to get to.
00:13:48.998 - 00:14:32.980, Speaker C: And that could include things like having no pre mine of the asset. So fairly distributing the asset at launch, it could be one of it. Or number two, I guess you could even do things like not having an explicit privacy layer on the coins so that you can track where the assets are going, and then you can do tax reporting and things like that. Not that that's necessarily a good idea, but I feel like it's possible to come up with a minimal viable set of really clear rules to decide what qualifies as a credibly decentralized asset and what constitutes a security. And without that clarity, I think it's just very difficult for builders and regulators to get on the same page.
00:14:34.070 - 00:15:03.610, Speaker B: Yeah, the privacy comment you made is pretty interesting, but we will instead actually talk a little bit about stablecoins, because Terra USD has undergone a ten x increase in supply this year. It's now the fifth largest stablecoin. It has a nearly $3 billion market cap. And as I'm sure you're well aware, stablecoins have come up here in the US. As another target for regulators. And it does look like the SEC will likely soon have authority to regulate stablecoins.
00:15:03.770 - 00:15:05.294, Speaker A: If that were to happen, how would.
00:15:05.332 - 00:15:07.150, Speaker B: That affect Terra USD?
00:15:07.730 - 00:15:55.038, Speaker C: Nothing. There's no underlying deposit that can be seized. There's no policy of TerraForm labs that impacts and you know, I would never do anything, not that I could, that are adversarial to the interests of the Terra network. So I actually think this is something that's going to be a huge growth driver for terra USD, because not only are the centralized stablecoins censorable by regulators, but a lot of the so called decentralized stablecoins are really just wrapped variants of decentralized stablecoins. So most of Dai is actually issued using USDC as collateral. There's a lot of fractional reserve stablecoins that use some of these other stablecoins as collateral itself. So it becomes very easier by proxy to regulate most of our competitors in the space.
00:15:55.038 - 00:16:08.398, Speaker C: And I think if some of these centralized stablecoins turn into essentially fintech services, I think a lot of that capital will rotate into the largest decentralized stablecoin. And today that just happens to be Terra USD.
00:16:08.574 - 00:16:42.510, Speaker B: And so for you, it's sort of like if you can come up with a project that is somewhat similar to Ethereum's level of decentralization that it had obtained by 2018, which was the first time we heard an SEC. Regulator say that Ethereum was sufficiently decentralized, then you feel that that's kind of a way of I don't want to say, like getting around regulation because it sounds like it's sort of intentional, but more just that it would be outside the purview of a regulator. Is that what you think is the way to go for a DeFi developer?
00:16:43.570 - 00:17:24.890, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, so I think the Holy Grail in crypto is the decentralized. And like, we need to get there because all the applications that we built on top of cryptocurrency, like even NFT exchanges and DeFi protocols and futures contracts, all of those things use some sort of stablecoin as the, quote, currency. Most of the liquidity pools in DeFi are denominated in stablecoin. Some of it is in ETH, but most of it in stablecoin. So if we have sort of a structural issue with some of the stablecoins that are denominating all of these different apps, then DeFi dies. So in order to have decentralized finance, you need a decentralized money.
00:17:24.890 - 00:17:40.720, Speaker C: Right? And I think the first project to be able to crack this puzzle in the sense that it's tether, but everything is auditable on chain, nobody controls it there's on chain monetary policy that is credible and easy to understand, then I think that's just going to make things better for almost everyone.
00:17:41.490 - 00:18:04.710, Speaker B: And so you hinted earlier at what you think are some of the characteristics of a decentralized protocol. Do you want to maybe continue filling out what those characteristics are? Because I'm very curious, and I was also curious why you felt that privacy could not be a feature of a decentralized protocol. But maybe I'm just curious to hear what you think are all the characteristics necessary?
00:18:05.530 - 00:18:46.178, Speaker C: Sure. So largely when it comes to financial regulation, regulators care about two things. It's, number one, that investors don't get harmed, right? So they care about things like transparency. They care about things like people not losing their money without a full understanding of the associated risks. And number two, they're worried about money laundering and tax evasion. And I feel like if there's no pre mind to the asset in the sense that the developer doesn't have an unfair advantage when the asset is issued, then in that case it cannot be a security. Like if you are doing all the work in the beginning and later you build a community of other people to build alongside you.
00:18:46.178 - 00:19:35.630, Speaker C: You had no unfair information access to gain your hands on the asset, then in that case it seems like a pretty good reason why you shouldn't have any responsibility if you didn't have any unfair financial gains. Of course this is an independent discussion of whether it's appropriate for the developer to make money off of his ingenuity or labor. But I think at least if there's no pre mine, then I think it's very tough to call that a security. I think number two, why I think a privacy layer is a little bit challenging is because then it becomes very difficult to do things like tax collection, right? And then you can give privileges access to some government agencies and things like that. But then I feel like that would sort of defeat the purpose of privacy coins in the first place. Yeah, I don't think you should engage in tax evasion. I don't think you should engage in money laundering.
00:19:35.630 - 00:19:44.040, Speaker C: So some sort of a middle ground where you sacrifice some of those properties in order to have regulatory clarity seems like a pretty good idea to me.
00:19:44.730 - 00:20:30.518, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, well, obviously there are a bunch of privacy coins that have their selective viewing keys. So it wouldn't be that you would only reveal it to a regulator, but it could just be to any other entity that you'd like to reveal that information to. So going back to your earlier remarks, let's touch on another news story this week, a big one. Cream Finance was hacked with a flash loan transaction for more than $130,000,000 on Wednesday. And that brings the total amount of funds in DFI that have been stolen this year to over half a billion dollars. And Cream Finance itself has actually been hacked multiple times. So I was curious if you feel that the regulators maybe aren't concentrating there.
00:20:30.518 - 00:20:34.920, Speaker B: What do you feel the industry can or should do about these security issues?
00:20:36.090 - 00:21:55.938, Speaker C: Yeah, so what's the saying? Fool me once, fool me twice? No, but in all seriousness, I think there should be a more structured way for people to be able to gauge security risk across various different DeFi apps. And I think an important way to do that is for some of the main sort of distribution channels in crypto to offer more friendly tooling so that people can understand what the security risks are. So for example, if Etherscan, for instance, had a static analyzer of the code which identifies what types of risks are possible, or let's say MetaMask, when you're about to execute a transaction, shows you a set of warnings of the things that can happen if you trust this contract, I think that could be something that's really helpful. So one of the delightful experiences that I found when using the Phantom wallet in Solana is that right before you're about to execute a transaction, it tells you what are some of the things that can happen. It tells you that you are sending your tokens to another address, you're giving you a special set of permissions from your wallet and things like that. So that similar to how you give app permissions, like sharing location services on your iPhone. You now have a sense of what things are possible when interacting with the Solana program.
00:21:55.938 - 00:22:35.950, Speaker C: So I think if similar experiences move on to, let's say, the dominant wallet, the dominant Block Explorer, and a lot of discovery tools like DeFi Pulse, for instance, then I think it becomes very easy for users to gauge different types of risk. So it's not possible for the average user to read through smart contracts and decide which project is more secure than the other, nor is it appropriate for them to read like a random auto report, which could be significantly outdated, and decide that this contract is safe. Right. So I think the only way to do this is to have better analytics and tooling that's built around some of the leading landmark players in the industry.
00:22:36.610 - 00:23:25.578, Speaker B: Yeah, this reminds me of a Tweet thread that Taylor Monahan wrote, and it was kind of funny because she, you know, someone I can't remember which wallet it was, but I think it actually was one on Solana, and they thought it was such an amazing experience because things were automated. And then she did a bunch of little funny gifs and emojis, and eventually she's like wide eyes and alarm bells going off, and she's like, no, it's not good, because then just any random fisher or hacker can just take all your money out if there aren't these checks on. So, anyway all right, well, this has been a super fun discussion. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:23:25.754 - 00:23:27.354, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you so much, Laura.

00:24:17.390 - 00:25:32.066, Speaker A: The Financial Action Task Force Unveils finalized crypto guidance On Thursday, the Financial Action Task Force, or FADF, a global anti money laundering watchdog, published its finalized guidance for regulating the crypto industry. The draft of this guidance, published last spring, veered in the direction of expanding rules that traditionally apply to transactions involving financial intermediaries, to peer to peer transactions, and even to wallets managed by individuals or so called self hosted wallets. Several crypto lawyers and advocate groups, such as Coinscenter and Jake Shravinsky, found that the finalized guidance appears to be better in some respects than the draft, but otherwise is too vague. What effect this will have in practice remains to be seen, since Thursday's publication is merely guidance, not law. Member countries decide whether or not they choose to implement the FATF recommended guidelines. As a reminder, the FADF is the organization that advocates applying the travel rule to virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, such as crypto exchanges and money transmitters, to collect and report information on parties participating in transactions. Last spring's draft guidance could have required such reporting from those facilitating or governing transfers, such as miners and validators.
00:25:32.066 - 00:26:30.246, Speaker A: Now the requirement applies to persons with quote control of VAS or virtual assets. It also does not put such obligations on crypto protocol developers. Most importantly, it no longer applies the travel rule to transactions that occur between a business and a self hosted wallet. For decentralized applications, VAS reporting requirements are unclear, especially for developers or anyone with quote control or sufficient influence in the DeFi arrangements. The FATF appears to believe that many heads of decentralized protocols would fall under the VASP definition. Quote It seems quite common for DeFi arrangements to call themselves decentralized when they actually include a person with control or sufficient influence, and jurisdictions should apply the VASP definition without respect to self description, said the guidance on Twitter. Miller Whitehouse Levine policy director at DeFi Education Fund, wrote, quote TLDR it's not great.
00:26:30.246 - 00:27:13.350, Speaker A: My initial read is that the FATF sees a world in which permissionless and decentralized systems are at best suppressed from the guidance. It seems that the Fatiff is having trouble coping with the fact that DeFi eliminates those intermediaries. Mark Boyron, dYdX's general counsel, tweeted that the Fat of recommendations are, quote, so bad that it makes the infrastructure bill look reasonable. Only permission to DeFi is allowed. An intermediary must be inserted to serve as a VASP. The global impact of these recommendations is an attempted kill shot at DeFi. Mastercard is building out Crypto Payment Rails Mastercard is partnering with BACT, a crypto payments firm, to enable cryptocurrency services for its partners across the US.
00:27:13.350 - 00:28:10.250, Speaker A: Through Mastercard's crypto as a service platform, any Mastercard partner, be it a merchant, bank or fintech, will soon have the ability to let consumers buy, sell and hold digital assets through custodial. Wallets, powered by backed Mastercard, is also integrating crypto into its loyalty program. Mastercard adding support for Web three payment rails could lead to a significant expansion of users interacting with cryptocurrency. According to CNBC, Mastercard has relationships with over 20,000 financial institutions and supports 2.8 billion credit cards. Shares of the recently listed backed, which announced a similar partnership with Fiserv this week, jumped 234% on Monday, coinciding with the Mastercard press release. Speaking of crypto adoption, according to Bloomberg, the Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund invested $25 million in a bitcoin and Ether, becoming one of, if not the first public pension plan that has done so in the US.
00:28:10.250 - 00:28:52.386, Speaker A: The fund holds over $4 billion in assets. On Wednesday, bitcoin dropped below $60,000. El Salvador President Nayubu Kelly announced that country quote, bought the dip to the tune of 420. BTC two banks signed up to become the first US. Institutions to offer bitcoin trading through a platform designed by Q Two Holdings and New York Digital Investment Group, or Nidig, allowing customers to purchase, hold and sell bitcoin in their banking apps. And finally, according to an SEC filing, Tesla might start accepting bitcoin as payment again and even hinted that it could accept other cryptos as well. The SEC is not ready for a leveraged bitcoin ETF.
