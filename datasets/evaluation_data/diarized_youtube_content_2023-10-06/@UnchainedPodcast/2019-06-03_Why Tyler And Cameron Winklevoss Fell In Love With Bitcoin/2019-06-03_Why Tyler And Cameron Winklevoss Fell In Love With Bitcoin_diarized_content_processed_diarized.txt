00:00:38.514 - 00:01:30.470, Speaker A: I'm speaking with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss who serve as Chief Executive Officer and president respectively, of Cryptocurrency Exchange. Gemini. They also run the private investment fund Winklevoss Capital, which has made a few cryptocurrency and blockchain investments such as in Bitcoin Vault, ZAPO and Bitcoin hardware and software firm 21. Back in 2013, they were the first to file with the securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin Exchange traded fund, or ETF, which they proposed calling the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, to be traded under the ticker symbol Coin. Unfortunately for listeners eager to hear more about the Bitcoin ETF, while Coin awaits SEC approval, tyler and Cameron are not able to speak about it publicly, so we won't be able to address it in this podcast. However, for those interested, the most recent filings were made at the end of June and it's entered a public comment period. Welcome to the show, Tyler and Cameron.
00:01:30.830 - 00:01:32.700, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks for having us.
00:01:33.310 - 00:01:58.990, Speaker A: So Tyler, why don't you tell us a little bit about what you guys have been doing since the 2008 Olympics. I think most people may be aware of the trajectory of your careers before then. As chronicled in the movie The Social Network, you were both tied up in the early development of Facebook and you've also enjoyed careers as rowers on the US Olympic team. For listeners who last knew that you competed in the 2008 Olympics, what happened after that and how did you end up in bitcoin?
00:01:59.150 - 00:02:55.074, Speaker B: So after 2008, we decided to continue to train, but at the end of the day, we decided we actually wanted to get back into entrepreneurship. So we hung up our oars in about 2011. During that period, we actually went to Oxford University and rode in the Oxford Cambridge boat race and also achieved our MBAs. And then we decided we had been rowing for about 15 years at that point and we could have kept going, but I think we always sort of saw rowing. It was a little bit of a detour. It was like one day when we're 15 walked into a boathouse, said, let's give the sport a try, and next thing we know we were on the, you know, made the junior national team and then we said, hey, maybe we can do this in college, and became refreshment at Harvard. And then all of a sudden, four years later, we were national champions, said hey, maybe we should just keep doing this a little bit more.
00:02:55.074 - 00:03:27.022, Speaker B: So rowing was one of those things. It wasn't like we walked into a boathouse the first day and we're like, hey, we're going to be Olympians. It was each day, each year, let's try, let's go a little harder. I think we can go a little bit faster. And next thing we know we're pretty much almost 30 and we'd been doing this for 15 years and had an incredible journey, as you said. We went to 2008 Olympics, were NCA champions, undefeated in college, rode in the Oxford Cambridge boat race. And we decided we'd climbed this mountain enough and we could have kept going.
00:03:27.022 - 00:03:56.934, Speaker B: But we decided know, now is the time to climb another mountain. So we wanted to get back in entrepreneurship. Our dad's a serial entrepreneur. We had always grown up looking up to guys like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates. We didn't really grow up in a jock family in the traditional sense. And that we didn't talk about the Yankees at dinner time conversations was really talking about business and ideas and my dad was always bringing home the newest computer and we were thinking about those kind of thoughts. So wanted to get back into that.
00:03:56.934 - 00:04:39.160, Speaker B: And the most natural way to do that was as investors. So we set up Winklebas Capital, a private investment firm, in 2012. Figured it's a great way to network with fellow investors, meet a lot of entrepreneurs, look at a lot of cool ideas and just get back into it during that year. Actually, when we set that up, we went on vacation in 2012 in the summer in Spain and Ibiza. And on vacation we learned about Bitcoin. And so that's how that all started. And so we started how did that happen? So a mutual friend came up to us, introduced himself to us.
00:04:39.160 - 00:05:25.186, Speaker B: We realized we had mutual friends in common. He was from New York and then said, hey, have you thought about digital currency? Or Bitcoin said, no, we just pretty much retired from elite athletics and starting an investment firm and we're actually on vacation, not really looking for the next big thing. But obviously that's always how it works in life. It's very serendipitous. You don't predict when you're going to fall in love or you can't force that kind of thing. You set yourself up in the right position, you're aware, but oftentimes you stumble into it. Just like rowing was one of many sports we tried, and in a way you sort of fall into it.
00:05:25.186 - 00:05:59.440, Speaker B: You don't know you're going to be good at it. You don't know you're going to like it, you don't know you're going to want to do it for that long. And bitcoin like rowing and like a lot of things we've done happen serendipitously like that. And then I think love is probably a great analog to finding your passion. You can't sort of will it or force it. So we started learning about Bitcoin in the summer of 2012 and buying it, and then next thing we know, it just sort of, like, sucked us in. Not even that slowly, but pretty quickly.
00:05:59.440 - 00:06:47.840, Speaker B: This was a pretty heady romance. But next thing you know, we're looking to be entrepreneurs in the space. And I think we always wanted to go back and to be entrepreneurs at heart. But being investors was a good way to sort of test the waters and figure out what that idea would be. And then over time, we identified the problem of a licensed, regulated exchange in America and decided this was the problem. We were going to put our efforts into solving and return and put our entrepreneurs cap on and start building something great. So that started about two and a half years ago, and we've been operational for about a year.
00:06:47.840 - 00:07:09.238, Speaker B: So right now we both invest, but at the same time, most of our time is building Gemini. So sorry if that was a very long winded introduction, but that takes us from basically 2012 to today.
00:07:09.404 - 00:07:26.966, Speaker A: Okay, so, Cameron, as Tyler was mentioning, you guys really fell in love with Bitcoin and have found that it's your passion. And I have noticed that through Winklebath Capital you've made a number of different investments. But what was it about this technology that captured your imagination?
00:07:27.158 - 00:08:03.846, Speaker C: It's a great question. I mean, there's so many different aspects to Bitcoin. I guess there's sort of the technological protocol aspect. There's the economic aspect of fixed supply, borderless money. I mean, we were both economics majors at Harvard, and I don't think we had truly thought about currencies beyond the fiat world until we came into Bitcoin. And it was a big eye opener that all of a sudden there's this huge alternative. It's almost like finding a new color and thinking about all the different aspects of it.
00:08:03.846 - 00:08:57.834, Speaker C: And we figured this is either probably a pretty binary outcome, it's either a zero or an enormous new opportunity. And the interesting thing about Bitcoin is that it's both disruptive from a technology standpoint, but there's a tremendous power of social good behind it. So you can both build a cool business or have a great investment return, and there's the promise of potentially improving the remittance industry or banking the unbanked. We're not there yet with Bitcoin, but it's certainly a possibility. Whereas the existing sort of legacy banking system, it's not a possibility because if it was, it would have happened already. These are technologies like ACH, fed, wire, swift, debit cards. All those things have been around for many decades and they have not solved the problem.
00:08:57.834 - 00:09:39.126, Speaker C: And if you step back, there's upwards of hundreds of millions, if not billions of people that have no financial inclusion, and there's no path to that with the current technology. So where Bitcoin is right now, I think, is that it's most being looked at and it's most being talked at in areas where it's potentially least impactful. But that's generally, probably the story of most technologies, is that you build all telecom and all these things and then you basically export it to places that can leapfrog all of the pain points that we went through to get there. And it's really transformative when you sort.
00:09:39.148 - 00:10:26.654, Speaker B: Of think about the way everything else works in the digital age and then the way money does, money really falls short. And so as it happens, we learned about bitcoin overseas, and actually we had to transfer additional funds for accommodation after we'd gotten there. Apparently not enough. We didn't pay the right amount, didn't get there upfront. And so when you're sort of sitting there and you're trying to get money into Europe from America, you recognize that you have a better chance of overnighting a box of checkbooks or travelers checks or cash. So from here to London, you can do that overnight. If it's Friday and the bank holiday on Monday, it's not going to get there till Wednesday.
00:10:26.654 - 00:10:46.410, Speaker B: So it might take five or six days, I mean, more than the majority of a week for money to get over there. And that's just not the way your email works. Your email doesn't. Imagine if your email worked on bank hours and was open from nine to five Monday through Friday and then on holidays not open.
00:10:46.480 - 00:10:48.554, Speaker C: Some people might actually like that, right?
00:10:48.752 - 00:11:43.070, Speaker B: We sort of joke that that might be a good thing, but for all of our sanity. But money is acting like pre internet. And many of the forms of money and payments were, as Cameron mentioned, were built by bankers before the internet existed. So they never contemplated the internet or how to work on that. So when you sort of step back and you stop accepting like, oh, this is how money works, this is what I learned in economics book. At some point it's a little bit embarrassing because you just accepted so much of what was around and because it was familiar, you thought that that's the way things are done. Money has always been this green piece of paper with a president's head on it, and that's the way it is when you start peeling back the onion, looking back into it, money can be anything.
00:11:43.070 - 00:12:30.874, Speaker B: It can be ones and zeros as long as the system has a certain scarcity built in. And ones and zeros are great because they're built for the internet. It's internet money that can work the same way as email, as efficiently, as frictionless, and potentially as cheaply, and obviously 24/7 borderless. And then you start to think, oh wait, this is how it should always have been, or this is how it would have always been, except for this guy. Satoshi Nakamoto or guy gal group hadn't figured out this breakthrough until 2009. So it really felt like this is the future and we love the future. We love spotting it we love being a part of it and trying to help build it.
00:12:30.874 - 00:12:35.360, Speaker B: So I think that's why we got sucked in so quickly to it.
00:12:35.970 - 00:13:02.470, Speaker A: So I like how you describe kind of the long road about how it's most active now in kind of more developed countries, but that you see how down the road it could help the unbanked, it could help in remittances. And you talked about how you identified this problem of a regulated exchange. So why do you feel like that's the first step and what differentiates Gemini from its competitors?
00:13:02.810 - 00:13:51.286, Speaker C: It's a great question. So I think know the US. Has some of the strongest financial regulation and consumer protections in the world, and for very good reason. And I think because of that framework, we also have some of the most liquid, amazing markets in the world. Try and imagine the world without the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq or the Bass Exchange, the equity markets wouldn't exist. And the ability to fund public companies which build these great products and then have capital to reinvest in themselves and the economy and all that stuff. The starting point or the block of that is both, in our opinion, regulated venues where people can actually buy and sell securities and then also regulation to.
00:13:51.308 - 00:14:09.478, Speaker B: Build that confidence that exists in US. Equities markets. There's no market in the world like that. I don't care what country you're talking about. Every investor around the world wants to invest in US. Markets because they're regulated and they're licensed, they're trustworthy, they have confidence.
00:14:09.574 - 00:14:11.786, Speaker C: If you take that away, the global.
00:14:11.818 - 00:15:06.958, Speaker B: Economy will take a hit like nothing else. So we want to recreate that for bitcoin. And what we saw for many years was trying to create something away, running away from that sort of a race to the bottom, anti regulation, offshore. And while I think that's important, and early adopters will have no problem and more risk appetite investors or technologists will have no problem interacting in that ecosystem. The majority of the world and the majority of the biggest pockets and the people who can make the biggest change will. And so in order to get them in the game, which they're not even there today, you've got to build something, a gateway, a road, a bridge that's licensed, that speaks their language, that their chief risk officer, that their chief regulatory officer can get on board with. It's still going to be a hard sell.
00:15:06.958 - 00:15:11.166, Speaker B: But when you start to do that, then all of a sudden you take.
00:15:11.188 - 00:15:13.266, Speaker C: This really cool idea that's isolated out.
00:15:13.288 - 00:15:15.282, Speaker B: Here on an island and you connect.
00:15:15.336 - 00:15:17.394, Speaker C: It to the US.
00:15:17.512 - 00:15:29.814, Speaker B: Or the global mainstream main island or mainland rather. And then you have a huge situation where one hand washes the other.
00:15:29.852 - 00:16:00.510, Speaker C: I mean, imagine gold is often bitcoin is generally a lot of times referred to as like the digital gold. Well, gold has been a store of value for a very long time. But imagine if you had trouble vaulting your gold, or if people didn't know that they were going to potentially lose their gold wherever they placed it, or how to buy it in a safe manner. Gold would not look like a very attractive store of value and people would probably look for something else.
00:16:00.660 - 00:16:08.002, Speaker B: Your gold in Venezuela, in a vault in Venezuela is much different than your gold in a vault in the US. New York City.
00:16:08.136 - 00:16:45.230, Speaker C: Or London, for that matter. And so in order for one of the most obvious use cases of bitcoin, which is a store of value and borderless money to work, we need to have safe, secure, regulated places to store these stores of value. Without that, we can't even get the first building blocks. And so it's really exciting and fun to talk about the future of all the great other use cases that bitcoin can do. But if we can't even secure it properly and people don't feel safe buying it or selling it and transacting and using it, then we can't get anywhere.
00:16:45.570 - 00:17:29.110, Speaker A: So, speaking of security, there's been a lot of news recently about a major hack of a bitcoin exchange called bitfinex. And I'm sure you've seen on the reddit boards, everyone's saying, oh, this is decentralized money, why are we creating these centralized exchanges? It was a massive amount of money that was lost, about, I think, 70 million at the time of the hack. So when you look at kind of that debate between a centralized exchange versus the power of this decentralized money, how do you make the case that really this is not only important, but then also that you can actually make it secure?
00:17:29.270 - 00:17:29.738, Speaker B: Sure.
00:17:29.824 - 00:18:18.854, Speaker C: Well, I'll start first by saying we don't know all the facts of that particular incident, though I think we've got the general brushstrokes, broad brushstrokes there. And I think what's clear from that particular incident is that the majority, if not all the funds were stored in hot wallets, which are internet connected and thereby accessible by potential outside attackers through the internet. I think the easy mitigation for that hack is storing a majority of your funds in cold storage, which is not internet connected. That's something that our vault design has had since the beginning, we currently employ and a number of other bitcoin exchanges. That idea of cold storage is actually not particularly new. There's certainly going to be better implementations of it, but basic fact, it's older.
00:18:18.902 - 00:18:28.238, Speaker B: Than, as far as I know, it's older than multi SIG technology, which became popular after it. So it's actually one of the oldest, best practices. Yeah.
00:18:28.244 - 00:19:03.260, Speaker C: And one of the biggest probably issues confronting, I think bitcoin in some ways, at least in the security sector, is that people use terms in very loose manner when people sometimes say multisig and then you sort of kick the tires or look under the hood, it's not really multisig. Or there's a single point of failure where it effectively nullified the multisig aspect of it. And unfortunately, a lot of people will throw out these terms like multisig insurance, this or that, and there's no real substance beneath it.
00:19:04.270 - 00:19:15.054, Speaker B: If you have a car right, and you have airbags but no seatbelt, I'd rather have my seatbelt than just an airbag. And that's just not preventing you from if you get into a head on.
00:19:15.092 - 00:20:08.206, Speaker C: Or you say you have seatbelts, but you forget the fine print, but they only work up to 30 miles an hour and at 60, that seatbelt is as good as not being there. And so the way you solve for these problems is you have actually regulated companies where the regulators have gone in and made sure that you're doing what you say you're doing. And so if you're unregulated and you're offshore or you're in an environment where there's no requirements to that, you can basically say what you want. And the consumers know wiser or worse off, they don't know until it happens. And that's really, I think, one of the key points here is that what we say and what we're doing, we're saying not only to the consumer, but we're also saying it and having to uphold that to our regulator and getting checked and held accountable for that.
00:20:08.228 - 00:20:27.634, Speaker A: Well, I have a question about the hot wallet versus cold issue at Bitfinex. I think it was like a very active exchange. As you know. I think it has the highest volume or some of the highest volume. So in that situation where people actively want to be trading it, then what's the solution in terms of hot versus cold?
00:20:27.682 - 00:20:53.450, Speaker C: Sure, the hot versus cold is basically as an exchange. If you're a fully funded exchange, you take customer deposits before allowing them to trade. But once you've taken custody of those deposits, it's up to the exchange or the custodian to determine how they want to actually hold their customer funds.
00:20:56.430 - 00:21:46.398, Speaker B: To the question more specifically is funds don't have to be in hot wallet in order for them to be traded because all of these trades are happening off blockchain. These aren't on blockchain trades. So it's a mistake to think that to have high volume you would need a lot of funds in hot wallet because at the end of the day, all of these trades on Bitfinex, on Gemini, back to your question. A few questions back is that they're happening off blockchain and we'd love to create a decentralized exchange, but we don't know how to do it. People don't know how to do it yet at the scale and the speed that's required for the players in the legacy financial world. So when you think about the speeds that are happening at Nasdaq or Nice, they're microseconds that's really fast. I don't know how many times you.
00:21:46.404 - 00:21:56.450, Speaker C: Can probably 100 times faster, if not more, oh, maybe 1000 times faster than the existing trading speed of Bitcoin. So bitcoin.
00:21:57.750 - 00:22:35.946, Speaker B: It's like orders of magnitude and a microsecond, I don't know how many times it would require you to blink your eye in a second, but it's a lot. It's like more than possible for a human being to do so. These are trades that are happening at, let's call it the speed of light, and they happen in matching engines all over the world. And that's what the financial world speeds. That's what they're used to, that's the speed times. That's just the standard. And so to achieve that in trading Bitcoin, the only way you can do that is off blockchain.
00:22:35.946 - 00:23:35.380, Speaker B: And to do it in a centralized exchange, there's just no way we see the block size debate and the arguments about that. Bitcoin transactions take ten minutes approximately, and Best Practices is waiting for six confirmations. So you can't wait 60 minutes when you're talking about dealing with microseconds over here. And so 99.9% of all Bitcoin transactions actually don't happen on the blockchain. They're happening at exchanges, they're happening OTC, they're happening somewhere else. So the reality is it's just not feasible as we know it to build a decentralized exchange that's performant to the standard that it needs to be in order for market makers and financial players in FX markets, securities markets, treasury markets, whatever, to actually interact with.
00:23:35.380 - 00:24:23.300, Speaker B: So we're stuck with centralized exchanges. And back to what Karen was saying is the implementation of multisig in cold storage is super important and they can be night and day. You can do it really well or really badly. And when we think about not all cold storage systems are created equal, and often comparing them to each other is like apples and oranges. And I think what we learned, or what the Bitcoin ecosystem learned, is that multisig alone is not necessarily enough. And multisig with cold storage is. Now you're starting to talk.
00:24:23.300 - 00:24:35.594, Speaker B: And I think we saw sort of implementations maybe that weren't quite ideal and people resting on things that maybe they shouldn't.
00:24:35.662 - 00:25:33.478, Speaker C: I also think that decentralized, if you hypothetically could build a decentralized exchange that was fast enough and technologically there, it solves for maybe one problem, but not for other problems, in the sense that that may appeal to certain people who are okay taking custody of their own funds, but at least the existing financial system. Most people want a custodian to hold their funds. They do not want to store or have the issue of storing their gold bars or cash under their mattress. But there's certainly people who want to do that. And there's people in Bitcoin today that would like to do that and solve for a certain attack vector that costs them money. But that probably creates another issue, I think centralized custodians that are regulated, that have good best practices, controls and procedures in place, that's what every other market in the world looks like. I'm pretty sure Bitcoin is going to.
00:25:33.484 - 00:25:34.486, Speaker B: Look like that too.
00:25:34.588 - 00:26:07.570, Speaker C: It doesn't mean that bitcoin itself will not be decentralized. Just like gold is still borderless money, but when you're not moving it around, you need a safe, secure custodian to hold it. Nobody would argue with that. And so I think bitcoin will look more and more in some ways like that, but it's never going to lose its true core superhero power of being a decentralized borderless digital asset.
00:26:08.150 - 00:26:31.420, Speaker A: Okay, so one other thing that I was interested in is, especially in 2015, a lot of people in financial services were saying that what is truly revolutionary is not necessarily bitcoin, but blockchain. And yet you guys have stayed more focused on the currency or asset aspect of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Why?
00:26:35.150 - 00:27:25.210, Speaker C: Right, so there's been a lot of buzz around the blockchain, or it's not about bitcoin, it's about the blockchain. We feel by definition, a true blockchain is like immutable, irreversible, decentralized and open source and that the world can build upon in a permissionless fashion, similar to how the three of us can go and we can go build a website on the internet. We don't have to ask anybody for permission to go do that, and we can do that, and it's truly open source. We think that's the beauty and the strongest thing about actual bitcoin and the blockchain. The blockchain is just one piece of bitcoin. It's the open public ledger, but bitcoin the open source, decentralized nature of that, that is the strongest pillar of it. So taking one piece of it, sure.
00:27:25.210 - 00:28:20.746, Speaker C: But I think a lot of technologists would argue that the same sort of things that can be achieved through private blockchains, which is what most of the discussion has been around, can be achieved with a distributed database. And that technology has been around for decades. So we've just been sort of focused on bitcoin because we think that it's something different, it's innovative. When you separate the blockchain from bitcoin, I think you're talking more about distributed database problems. And while certainly interesting, and without a doubt, there's certainly financial institutions in other areas where they can improve that technology, but they can probably improve it with existing technology. They probably could have improved it a long time ago. It's just that they needed a bit of a kick in the pants from things like bitcoin to say, oh wait, we've got to get our tech game a little bit more on point here.
00:28:20.746 - 00:29:19.790, Speaker C: It should be maybe a little bit less back office and maybe a little more front office. Maybe we're not so much a bank anymore, but we're a bank and we're growing into a technology company. Or we want to be cutting edge because we have to talk to consumers that are millennials and the people coming up that are doing bank through mobile apps and things like that. If I think of the town where we grew up in all of the major the stores, like the toy stores and things like that, they're banks, and they're banks and they're branches because they're catering to a population that still comes in and likes to do banking. And I think banks were fixated on this aging population for a long time, completely sort of trying to figure out how to reach the millennials, the younger kids and things like that. So I think, look, if Bitcoin has made their story and how they offer banking services better, that's great. But I think that is a different we don't view that as competitive.
00:29:20.770 - 00:30:05.518, Speaker B: We make the comparison. Okay? AOL and CompuServe, they are a closed Internet system. We're focused on the Internet, and it's sort of a head scratcher when people are talking about, oh, the blockchain's, the innovation, because on its own, we don't feel like it's anything new, and we feel like these solutions have been there for a quarter century. When you start tokenizing a protocol and you talk about an open blockchain, now, that's something completely new. That is a new color. That is something that a lot of people thought was impossible to do. And so, as Cameron mentioned, I think it's great.
00:30:05.518 - 00:30:22.190, Speaker B: Banks need to improve their technology. We can tell you this firsthand, dealing with a lot of them, t plus three, unless it's I mean, there's no reason it can't be T zero. Your stock can settle immediately. You should be able to go to the ATM.
00:30:22.350 - 00:30:36.818, Speaker C: Sorry to interrupt, but when you're actually doing a stock trade, let's say on your e trade account, the trade, you know, you just bought your share of Apple. You think it shows you in real time. It's actually taking three days on the back end for that share to truly.
00:30:36.994 - 00:30:38.534, Speaker B: Transfer, to clear, and for the money.
00:30:38.572 - 00:30:50.522, Speaker C: To hit your brokerage of a lot of these things. They appear real time, and in reality, they're anything but. I think that gap will be closed and continue to be closed, and probably.
00:30:50.576 - 00:31:29.610, Speaker B: Could have been for a long time. It could have been closed 30 years ago. And whether or not it closes because traders like delayed settlement or whatnot, it should be a choice. It shouldn't be, oh, that's the best we can do. And so I think Bitcoin opened a lot of people's eyes up to the fact that something can settle immediately. But we're really focused. Cameron is mentioning on the open blockchains whether it's Ethereum, whether it's Bitcoin open blockchains, open protocols similar to the Internet.
00:31:29.610 - 00:32:25.786, Speaker B: We can all go away and build a company and harness TCP IP and Internet protocols and things without anyone's permission, without the permission of a company we're not going to go down to. It's much harder to go to Morgan Merrill Lynch and say, hey, I want to build a startup on top of your bank chain and what you guys are doing, and if it goes really well, in a year or two, promise you won't pull the rug out from underneath me and shut the API off. You don't need to worry about that when you're building on open blockchains. And so we're much more focused on that internet side of things and the tokens, and that's what Gemini facilitates. We see ourselves as an infrastructure company, sort of like a picks and shovels type company. We're a platform. We don't take a position on a notional position on Bitcoin or Ether, what directions it's going to go.
00:32:25.786 - 00:32:48.340, Speaker B: We just want to help facilitate people to trade it, buy and sell it in a licensed and safe manner. And I think that the idea of the blockchain tech stuff and the post trade settlement and the bank chains, that's great, but it couldn't be more different. And you might as well not even have them in the same conversation because.
00:32:49.430 - 00:33:16.966, Speaker A: They'Re just so unrelated and so connect those dots for me between kind of like what you're doing with the exchange and then the value that you see in open blockchains. If you want to give people a place to trade this money or form of money, how is that going to facilitate these other things happening on these open blockchains?
00:33:17.158 - 00:34:12.126, Speaker C: Sure. So sort of going back to maybe one of my earlier points is that in order for if people can't buy and sell tokens of, let's say, Bitcoin or ether or some other new digital asset and protocol, that they want to build on top of and use. If you can't find a safe and secure place to buy and sell and store that, then it's really hard to build application layers on top of infrastructure that is falling over or getting hacked or untrustworthy. And so basically we think that that infrastructure layer is sort of the core building block and that will hopefully facilitate developers to do all sorts of things and build all kinds of use cases and applications that we can't even contemplate today that will be around in the future.
00:34:12.228 - 00:34:20.942, Speaker A: And on your exchange, are you seeing kind of more like traditional Wall Street traders and investors coming and wanting to trade there?
00:34:20.996 - 00:35:28.002, Speaker C: Yeah, so we see a combination of a lot of different participants. There's everything from an individual user that is interested in bitcoin, wants to learn more, and wants to buy their first bitcoin, and then you have more sort of long term investors or people who might have been in bitcoin. Early or people who want to take big positions today in bitcoin that haven't been in it but want to sort of start getting into it. And then we see market makers that are bitcoin centric, people who maybe came out of traditional finance and have been focused on making markets in bitcoin generally smaller two to five person shops. And then we do have a number of existing financial institutions that are sort of tiptoeing into bitcoin and saying, what is this all about? How do we figure out and we'd like to trade and take on positions and things like that. So the spectrum is quite diverse, and we have, I'd say, like a wide range of participants.
00:35:28.146 - 00:36:13.250, Speaker B: We definitely do see the blue chip Wall Street types starting to come in, and they're not easy to get involved. They ask a lot of questions. They do the due diligence, and it's hard. But we've built a great product that they can get comfortable with. And I think that's in the long run going to be our differentiator is that we can get through that difficult conversation. We have great answers to the questions on our security story, our licensing, our regulatory posture. And so that's happening, and our goal is to make that continue to happen.
00:36:13.250 - 00:36:40.842, Speaker B: But these companies are not looking to do business offshore. They're not going to wire their money overseas, and they may not even be able know that's we're building for that customer base. But like Cameron said, we can point to examples of just about any type of customer on our exchange, from young to old to financially savvy to, hey, I'm just getting involved. So we cater to pretty much everyone.
00:36:40.896 - 00:37:44.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we specifically say that, you know, we're building an exchange for individuals and institutions. We care about both types of participants, and we're building tools that the institutional trader who makes markets or trades in equities or currencies around the world feels that has the power that they're used to. But we spent a lot of time building out our interface and the product side of Gemini for people who I'll say for lack of a better, like, my mom can sign up and buy her first Bitcoin. It's super clean, intuitive, and easy. That was the whole goal, I think far too much with technology fintech companies, or at least traditional fintech. If you look at like a Bloomberg Terminal or some of the brokerage platforms or softwares, they're very terminal esque and wonky looking, and they sort of make your head spin and that might appeal to a certain type of kind of.
00:37:44.404 - 00:37:48.786, Speaker B: Look like the surfing the Internet in 1995 we sort of joke about.
00:37:48.888 - 00:37:50.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's right.
00:37:51.270 - 00:38:04.034, Speaker A: So do you feel like the trends that we've been seeing with Bitcoin will generally apply to other cryptocurrencies? I feel like I've seen quotes in other interviews where you talk about how you feel like there's going to be a future of multiple digital assets.
00:38:04.162 - 00:39:08.582, Speaker C: We do think so. We've spent a lot of time obviously talking about Bitcoin right now, but we do believe we built our custody system. Our vaulting system is built so that anything that uses like an elliptic curve algorithm, we can store. So when we added ether in, I believe early May and started supporting that trading, it was a pretty minor change in our custody system, which involves our custody system. We have what's called hardware security modules, HSM computers that store the private keys, and they're tamper proof and tamper resistant. They basically are built so that you can't extract the private key and we use those geodeistributed and located all around the country in a multi SIG configuration to store our Bitcoin. And when we looked at Ether and it started to develop and look really interesting and viable to support, it was actually a pretty straightforward upgrade to just our existing.
00:39:08.582 - 00:40:09.854, Speaker C: It'd almost be like putting a new application on your MacBook or something, as opposed to building an entirely new MacBook. Two computers know like this is a desktop, we just put another application on it and we've been building our custody system for two plus years. And I fully anticipate there being sort of more digital assets that will come in the future. We ourselves are invested in one particular company called Filecoin, which is building basically. It obviously hasn't been released yet, but basically miners are rewarded for contributing storage to the network and so it becomes a cloud sort of storage, almost like a distributed AWS decentralized. You know, you can totally see the utility there. It's not something Bitcoin can do or will do.
00:40:09.854 - 00:40:19.042, Speaker C: And so that would be awesome. If there's a distributed dropbox out there, if there's a token for that, we would love to store it, support it and allow people to trade it.
00:40:19.176 - 00:41:09.486, Speaker B: We're also seeing this with companies themselves. I haven't spent a lot of time looking at steemit, but an example of a company that's actually issuing their own token, and that may or may not be a security, which is an interesting legal question, but it's not. Just people building protocols for certain utilities. But people are taking a protocol approach to their companies and basically issuing tokens just like a stock share. And so I think zooming out without getting too in the weeds. Cryptographic tokens seem to me like the future. It seems to me like all sorts of assets will trade via cryptographic tokens.
00:41:09.486 - 00:41:52.270, Speaker B: Whether that's me sending you a token that represents the keys to my car after you've paid me in Bitcoin for it, or a TV, or you sent the Internet of things and your devices are interacting with each other by a cryptographic token transactions to provide or buy or sell services. That to me seems like the future. Assets will live on blockchains and be transferred from person to person, machine to machine or machine to person via cryptographic tokens. And that is the future that we're building towards with Gemini. And I think it's going to be a pretty exciting one.
00:41:52.340 - 00:42:36.830, Speaker A: Well, so this is actually a big topic of discussion amongst a lot of people in this space. And I happened to be at this meetup last night and there was a debate about whether these are securities, whether they will be regulated, whether the SEC will put a stop to them. And then some people were you know, it doesn't make sense for most companies. It's just a way for people to try to make a lot of money. And then there were others that were, you know, you really need one of these tokens depending on the way that the network is set up. You could really need that in order to make this file coin or whatever function the way that you want it to function. So I feel like there's a wide variety of opinions right now on this.
00:42:36.830 - 00:42:52.980, Speaker A: Do you feel like this is I mean it sounds like you don't think it's a fad but then in that case when does it make sense, when does it not? And in what instances can we see this flourish where it's not going to be shut down by the SEC?
00:42:53.430 - 00:44:25.730, Speaker B: Well, I think that it's a great question. If something is more than a fad and it becomes just the way the world's moving, at some point regulators have to accept that and adapt to that. Obviously the SEC is some of the brightest regulators we have so I'm confident that they will evolve and understand their mandate which is to protect the consumer. And certainly these tokens are a super exciting idea, the cryptographic tokens that represent ownership of a company but they can also be really misused poorly and a lot of people could lose money with them. So just like we have regulated financial markets to protect the average Joe investor from getting swindled by boiler room know charlatans, we're going to need the same type of guardrails whether or not this is considered a security or not. And so I think that time will sort of play out and I think the demand of how the world, the paradigm shift if it happens then it should be interesting. But at the same time the internet wasn't always open, right? Wasn't it a project that was basically military or quasi military or government controlled and developed and then slowly released out and then it's regulated in some areas but it's constantly evolving.
00:44:25.730 - 00:45:56.894, Speaker B: I think that these tokens very much may be the future but I'm an optimist at the end of the day with regards to regulation catching up and sort of technology finding the right path that makes things more efficient. But it is a really fascinating idea when you look at your phone and this idea that you could have all these tokens on it that represent your share of Apple, your bitcoin which we think will be your future version of gold is your future version of gold but will disrupt gold. And I'm looking the listeners can't see that. But I have my iPhone and my leather wallet on the table right now and I think that the leather wallet doesn't exist with plastic credit cards in it. I'm looking at it right now, I don't have any cash in it. So cash is getting starting to go the way of the dodo in my life and I think it's just a matter of time before credit cards and this nice leather wallet is gone too. And I'm just carrying my personal computing device smartphone with all my assets on it, whether it's the keys to my car and I just walk up to my car and it opens because it handshakes with my phone and knows that the cryptographic handshake that's happening is me.
00:45:56.894 - 00:46:25.126, Speaker B: I walk to my house, the same thing happens. I want to sell you a share of my stock. I can send it to you like an email and we can make some sort of exchange. So that's sort of the way I see the future in the long run. I'm sure there will be a lot of interesting ups and downs and learning tales along the way, but that's kind of the way I see it inevitably going.
00:46:25.308 - 00:47:17.058, Speaker C: Yeah. And just to be clear, I think Bitcoin, the CFTC in September of 2015 declared it basically an exempt commodity similar to like, gold. And so I don't think that there's much of a question at this point as to the characterization of things like Bitcoin. But when we're talking about tokens that are centrally issued and things like that, they tend to fall a little bit more into the securities side of the field. And there's a Howie test and there's like, I think, three or four points that you can go through and see if something fits more into a security. And in those cases it's going to be a very interesting question of how do we characterize these things? Are they securities or does the regulation evolve somehow?
00:47:17.154 - 00:47:44.830, Speaker B: Is there some sort of safe haven area or market cap that you can experiment in that's sort of cordoned off? Is there kind of like the Jobs Act for small companies or startups? Is there some certain amount of money or filing you can do that's not super onerous, like filing an S one statement to make an IPO? How does that evolve?
00:47:44.910 - 00:48:38.660, Speaker C: But certainly that's yeah, I was flipping through the channels in between the Olympics on Think Saturday or Sunday and did catch a bit of the wolf of Wall Street. And I was sort of cringing and saying, thank goodness for financial tough. It is a tough balance. And I think that, as Tyler mentioned, we have tremendous forward thinking regulators in the US at the SEC, at the New York Department of Financial Services. And that's a big part of why we built Gemini in New York, because the regulation was clear and under Superintendent Loski, they really blazed the trail there. And so to build a company and to get a banking relationship, no bank was really going to bank something that was uncertain. And so having the ability to be regulated licenses was a huge deal.
00:48:38.660 - 00:48:43.266, Speaker C: But yeah, I think it'll be an exciting future to see where all this goes.
00:48:43.448 - 00:48:49.480, Speaker A: Well, this has been a great discussion. Thank you so much. Where can our listeners find more of your work or contact you in the.
00:48:50.970 - 00:49:09.034, Speaker B: So Winklevosscapital.com is the website for private investment firm. Our portfolio is listed there. We blog on that website. We also are on Twitter. So I'm at Tyler Winkleboss. Just the spelling of my full name.
00:49:09.034 - 00:49:46.514, Speaker B: Cameron is at Winkleboss. The reason he's not at Cameron Winkleboss, people think he want to bet, but the truth is his actually full name won't fit on Twitter, handles it's too long. I think it's 17 characters, and Twitter has a limit of 15. So you can find us on Twitter at Tyler Boss at Winklevoss, on Instagram, at Tyler Boss at Winklevoss, and then we're on Angelist Winklevosscapital.com. We blog, it's our investment company website. And of course, last but not least, gemini.com is our digital asset exchange.
00:49:46.514 - 00:50:32.870, Speaker B: You can buy and sell Ether and bitcoin, and there's also email on both Winkwalkscapital.com and gemini.com, there are email addresses for inquiries that you can find. So it's pretty easy to find some sort of channel into us. It's more about what do you have to say and what's the content, depending on whether we have the time to get back. But also, just lastly, getting in the ecosystem, getting into the bitcoin ecosystem or getting into the startup ecosystem is step number one. Just cold calling someone seems like you haven't done your work beforehand.
00:50:32.870 - 00:51:24.840, Speaker B: You should be able to get to us. You should know an entrepreneur. We've invested in 50 portfolio companies in Silicon Valley, New York and La. And each one of those companies has a lot of employees, and those employees have friends. And so when you start bringing out the social network rings, it's not too many hops to get to us if you're actually in the startup world. And so, generally speaking, going through a friend who can vouch for you that we know or we respect somehow in our interaction is always the best way to get to anyone, whether it's startups or hey, I want to become an actor, I want to become an athlete. Well, get into the system, get around athletes and start going to regatta, start hanging out.
00:51:26.570 - 00:52:00.820, Speaker C: Or meetups. You mentioned you were at a meetup last night, right? We were at YC demo day yesterday and a number of entrepreneurs who were presenting came up, said, hello, business card, hey, what are you working on? Things like that. So we're around that's. The cool thing about bitcoin and technology in general is that people are very giving of their time and want to be inclusive. And everybody remembers when they first sort of got in, so when they see people that want to learn and want to get in, they generally return the favor.
00:52:02.230 - 00:52:05.218, Speaker A: Great, well, thanks so much for coming on the show.
00:52:05.384 - 00:52:06.482, Speaker C: Thank you for having us.
