00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:42.310, Speaker B: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello everybody, welcome to a special episode of The Chopping Block. Every couple weeks we get together and give the industry insider perspective on the crypto topics of the day. Today is a very special day. It's a little bit of a harrowing day and so we wanted to get together given all the drama that's been going on in the crypto industry and share our perspective on what's happening. So let me first start with intros. First here we have Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes.
00:00:42.310 - 00:01:08.434, Speaker B: Then we've got Laura who's the CEO of the show. Joining us today is special guests. We've got Nick Carter, the illustrious reformed bitcoin maxi. And then there's myself, I'm a Sieve, the head Hype man at Dragonfly. So most of us, well, not all of us, but most of us here are early stage investors in crypto. I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Okay, so why are we here? Today has been a pretty crazy day actually.
00:01:08.434 - 00:01:50.174, Speaker B: The last few days have been very harrowing day for the entire industry. And it all started between two of the central characters in the crypto drama who are CZ, the founder of Binance, and Sam bankman Fried, the founder of FTX. So Sam and CZ have a very complicated relationship and so I'm going to start from the very, very beginning and kind of give the exposition for what happened. So Sam and CZ, they have been competitors for a long time. Sam of course got his start as a trader and originally he was the founder of a trading firm called Alameda Research. Then they went on to build FTX, which is now one of the largest exchanges in the world, or was until very recently. Now Alameda Research and FTX have always had somewhat of a confusing relationship.
00:01:50.174 - 00:02:27.770, Speaker B: It was known for a long time that Alameda Research traded a great deal on FTX. In the early days, as the exchange became more institutional, their relationship became a little bit more opaque. People didn't really know exactly what the relationship was between Alameda and FTX, but the claim from FTX was always that Alameda, the trading firm, is not directly associated with FTX. We're totally distinct. We might have common ownership, but we don't really work together in a direct way. That was a story. It's generally considered to be a bit suspect to have a trading firm and an exchange to have a close relationship, because of course that means that the trading firm has some kind of unfair advantage when trading on the exchange.
00:02:27.770 - 00:02:58.622, Speaker B: Now what does have to do with CZ and Binance? Binance of course is the largest exchange in the world. Binance was an early investor into FTX, so they had an early partnership. They invested at a very early stage. And eventually FTX bought out Binance from their initial stake for a total of $2 billion. And part of that 2 billion was in cash, and part of it was in FTT, which is the native token of FTX. Now? What is FTT? It's another central part of the story. So FTT is an exchange token, kind of like BNB, kind of like OKB.
00:02:58.622 - 00:03:20.810, Speaker B: The way that FTT works, and Tom, please correct me if I'm wrong here. So the way FTT works is that FTX burns a portion of their revenue to buy back some of the FTT and then destroy it every week or something like that. I think it's weekly. And in addition to that, if you own a lot of FTT and you stake it, you get trading discounts if you're trading at FTX. Do I have that right, Tom?
00:03:20.960 - 00:03:22.218, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right.
00:03:22.384 - 00:04:08.870, Speaker B: Okay, so this is FTT. So what triggered all of this was that, if you recall, over the last week, actually, in the last episode, we talked about an episode where Sam Bankman Fried was weighing in on his thoughts on regulation and Dccpa, which is a new proposed bill that was going to end up regulating quite a bit of crypto as well as DeFi. And many people became very upset with Sam after that. And they believed that Sam was selling out a lot of the rest of the crypto industries, particularly around DeFi, but also other exchanges. And there was a big debate between him and Eric Voorhees that we covered on our last show. Now, Sam public sentiment against Sam really turned after that. And it seems like CZ similar to many of the other people who were upset with Sam, CZ was one of the central people who believed that, hey, I think Sam is behaving as a bad actor.
00:04:08.870 - 00:04:41.800, Speaker B: And so CZ published a tweet a few days ago where he said that he was going to be liquidating his FTT ownership. So remember, huge portion of their buyout was in FTT. So Binance was a huge pile of FTT. And they decide finally that they're going to sell it. And the reasoning they provide for why they're going to sell it is one risk management. So the leaked financials about Alameda research scared a lot of people because of course, Alameda held a huge amount of illiquid assets on their balance sheet. Of the roughly $6 billion of equity that was on their balance sheet, that was of, I believe, end of last year.
00:04:41.800 - 00:05:09.550, Speaker B: A huge portion of that was extremely illiquid and a huge portion of it was FTT itself. And so Binance announced, as part of their exit plan, they are going to be selling their FTT on the open market. And there's this line that he posted, which I think is a very telling line. He says liquidating our FTT. Said CZ is just post exit risk management, learning from Luna. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone, but we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs.
00:05:09.550 - 00:05:42.626, Speaker B: So this was a direct dagger at the heart of FTX. Now, Alameda Research, which again unclear the relationship between FTX other than the common ownership. Alameda Research owns a huge portion of all the FTT in existence, and Alameda has a very, very large outstanding loan book. So there are a lot of loans that Alameda is holding and presumably a lot of that FTT is collateral. So Alameda then announces on Twitter that we will buy all of your FTT at $22. So FTT. Immediately after CZ announces, FTT starts to decline.
00:05:42.626 - 00:06:11.954, Speaker B: Alameda announces they're going to buy all this FTT at $22. Finance refuses. Binance says, look, I'd rather do this on the open market. Why not do all this out in the open? Finance then proceeds to move all of their FTT to Finance and starts to sell. This starts to crash the FTT market. FTT starts dumping and dumping and dumping. And by last night, which last night was Monday night, FTT goes below $22, $22 it was holding there very strong under this belief that FTX Alameda was going to backstop the market.
00:06:11.954 - 00:06:48.458, Speaker B: After that, the floor fell out and all of a sudden, massive, massive, massive outflows from FTX. All of a sudden everyone starts getting scared that FTX is going to be insolvent, that Alameda is insolvent, that there's going to be another Three Arrows like liquidation spiral as a result of lenders no longer being able to liquidate the FTT collateral that Alameda has. Alameda, to be clear, is one of the largest market making firms in Crypto. They are a massive, massive player. They have huge amounts of loans from other parties. And if we see another a repeat of what happened with Three Arrows, everyone knows that it's going to be carnage in the markets. So sam egman.
00:06:48.458 - 00:07:31.290, Speaker B: Fried goes onto Twitter, he announces FTX is fine, there's no reason to withdraw, everything is okay, at the same time that he's doing that yesterday. Meaning Monday, Sam goes to Wall Street and he starts trying to get an emergency liquidity injection into FTX. Now, to be clear, up till now this has all been about Alameda. This has all been about Alameda and FTT. FTT is supposed to be a discount token, but all of a sudden everyone learns that FTX is trying to raise money and we see that withdrawals start getting slown down and suddenly withdrawals eventually, as of this morning, stop completely from FTX. Now I also want to specify, this is FTX International, this is not FTX US, which is the US regulated entity. FTX us is fine.
00:07:31.290 - 00:08:02.774, Speaker B: And there's no real reason to believe that FTX US is not fine. So all of a sudden people are wait this market making firm, which is supposed to be disconnected, is losing money. And as a result, FTX needs to raise money. That doesn't make sense. FTX was trying to raise a billion dollars around midday yesterday, and by the end of the evening, FTX is trying to now raise five to $6 billion years. And there are no bids, nobody wants to invest. What we've heard is that there was maybe about half a billion dollars of interest that they were able to round up.
00:08:02.774 - 00:08:37.054, Speaker B: But as the number kept going up, by the end of the day, originally they were trying to raise at a $10 billion valuation. By last night, it completely falls apart. Pretty soon there is mass fear that Alameda is insolvent and that somehow FTX is also insolvent and that the connection between Alameda and FTX was not as originally explained. Sam claimed on Twitter that FTX customer funds are not being lent out, they're not being played around with. Everything is there at the exchange. But on chain Sleuthing reveals that this is not the case. There's too much money going around, there's too much handwriting.
00:08:37.054 - 00:09:05.862, Speaker B: It looks like something is wrong at FTX and fairly soon there is a mass exodus. FTT starts to absolutely collapse. Until this morning, CZ announces that Binance is going to be acquiring FTX. Now. They are not acquiring the US entity, they are not acquiring Elementor Research. And also this is a non binding loi, meaning a letter of intent. So that means that they still haven't done due diligence and this deal might still fall apart.
00:09:05.862 - 00:09:36.466, Speaker B: The market rebounds a little bit and then continues to fall. And now we are basically in the mode of mass contagion. Everybody is afraid that if Alameda defaults, are we going to see another three arrows? Is FTX completely dead. Are people going to lose their money? Is this going to lead to a wave of pain for the industry and for the future of how crypto is going to be seen by regulators and by lawmakers? So that's the high level of where we are at today. I think I covered as much as I could. Let me stop there and just get first high level responses. How you guys are feeling about what happened today.
00:09:36.466 - 00:09:37.570, Speaker B: Nick, why don't you start?
00:09:37.640 - 00:10:21.502, Speaker A: Well, I think the most dramatic day maybe since this summer, but maybe even since sort of March 2020. This feels a little bit like the layman to this summer's. Bear Stearns I think this is actually possibly worse, dare I say. I mean FTX and the FTX alameda FTX us empire. If that really is dissolving, that just leaves a lot of holes and a lot of balance sheets throughout the industry and the lenders that are already seriously impaired in distress. It might be kind of the last hammer to fall, taking them down. I think then you question what becomes of Genesis, what becomes of DCG, what becomes a lot of the firms that are very sort of Sam affiliated.
00:10:21.502 - 00:10:54.960, Speaker A: I mean, FTT going to almost zero in the space of 24 hours is truly remarkable and even more shocking almost than Luna going to zero just because it seemed to be backed by real corporate revenues and actual earnings, and not to mention the enormous consolidation here, which is a crazy, crazy event to happen. Now, binance will be a total behemoth, assuming the deal goes through. From my see, this is, as you said, one of the most harrowing experiences I've ever seen in the crypto space.
00:10:56.050 - 00:12:11.542, Speaker D: Yeah, I would agree about just kind of almost like from an optics perspective, a lot of people were calling out Terra Luna before. And it is true that in recent weeks, I mean, my DMs were filling up with people talking about FTX and Alameda. And I did ask SPF in my last interview with him about that relationship, but at that time, there was nowhere near as many connections as have been made in recent weeks. But the thing is that up until recent weeks, sam really was like the face of kind of regulated crypto in DC. He was the one who was advocating, as we saw in the debate, with, you know, a way of operating with regulators that is very friendly to them and something know they could probably get in line with. And I think what's fascinating is that at least based on what we're seeing on chain, it kind of looks like FTX and Alameda were operating in a way that is definitely beyond what any regulator would sanction. And so it's just so funny that he advocates for that type of regulation, but he himself doesn't practice those practices and that's what took him down.
00:12:11.542 - 00:12:45.150, Speaker D: So there's some crazy irony there. And especially that CZ, of all people, who is the poster child for regulatory arbitrage, is the one who called his bluff on that and took down FTS. For me, as a storyteller, I'm like, I don't even have to do anything here when I go to write this. It's just like all written for me. To my experience, I actually think this is the number one biggest news day in crypto ever in the history of crypto.
00:12:45.490 - 00:13:22.038, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. I think people comp it to like, Terra Luna or Three Arrows. But again, I think a lot of people refuse to get into Terra just because the mechanics weren't sound. A lot of lenders refused to lend to Three Arrows because they didn't pass diligence. But Sam was like supposed to be sort of the golden child networking in DC, this MIT wonderkind, and then this is sort of falling apart. I do find it also funny that this Coindeth article really seemed to actually be the thing that kicked off this sort of cris of confidence that came out about a week ago. That's what started to cause the stablecoin withdrawals from FTX.
00:13:22.038 - 00:13:45.214, Speaker C: That's what started to cause this entire sort of cascade. But even that was not a very well sort of diligenced article. It was from June and it was kind of unclear what the liabilities were supposed to be. And so when I read that article, I didn't think immediately, oh, FTX is insolvent. It was, okay, this doesn't look like a super healthy balance sheet. I don't really know who's lending, but it wasn't as if like, oh, this thing is toast. It's a zero immediately.
00:13:45.214 - 00:13:53.400, Speaker C: But it's almost sort of a self fulfilling prophecy of as more and more people lose crisis or lose confidence, more people lose confidence and you end up with the current situation.
00:13:54.810 - 00:14:28.850, Speaker B: I think that's right. The question is like, okay, what did we learn today? The first thing we learned is you never cross CZ. So that's the first lesson. I think that's one thing that you want to take with you for a long time now because you cross CZ and you're not going to live to tell the tale. The second thing is that I think we now understand a lot of how FTX worked, which is that first, I want to say that a lot of what we're talking about in this show, especially that's not already out in public, is going to be speculation. Right now, we don't know a lot. It's a very live situation and a lot of news is flying by and a lot of things are not confirmed yet.
00:14:28.850 - 00:15:26.722, Speaker B: So very few people know the truth of what is actually going on here. But what I've heard, and again, this is totally speculation, so I don't know whether this is true. What I've heard is that yesterday when there was this emergency financing going on for FTX, basically people realized as Sam was asking for more and more money, that the diligence materials he was sharing were bullshit. It's very likely that when the FTX round happened last year, there is absolutely no way that if the investors knew that customer funds were basically all being lent out to Alameda, that this would have been invested in by all of these institutional investors. So the speculation that I'm hearing is that what happened is likely going to be criminal because they misrepresented a huge amount of things both to customers and to investors. There's really no plausible way that FTX, not Alameda, but FTX, would not be able to process withdrawals because the value of FTT went down. It doesn't make sense.
00:15:26.776 - 00:16:03.018, Speaker A: Well, right. There shouldn't be a I mean, exactly. And this I was so shocked about the whole thing because I thought, okay, maybe Alameda's in trouble, but that shouldn't actually reflect there shouldn't be a contagion over to FTX. The only explanation I have is that CZ somehow got wind of the fact that maybe customer deposits were being lent out and decided to launch this attack. I would love to know what they knew such that they could feel empowered to launch that attack. They must have done some on chain sleuthing or something to determine that FTX was not just holding those balances in full reserve.
00:16:03.194 - 00:16:52.826, Speaker D: Yeah, and my point about how the exact behaviors that regulators will not sanction is what took Sam down. When I mentioned on chain evidence, what I meant was, I saw multiple tweets about this. A bunch of people had been trying to look for FTX's cold storage, and that is a major red flag if you cannot find anything that looks like that. And then when people were also saying there's so much money that Alameda is sending to like, if they're truly as separate as they're supposed to be, then that should not be needed in this kind of scenario. You're right. If it's full reserves, then just as people are withdrawing, they just get the coins they have. So obviously, nothing is like 100% at this moment, but it's a major red flag that people haven't been able to identify those wallets.
00:16:53.018 - 00:17:19.946, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. The chain doesn't lie, as we've seen time and time again. And it's a big red flag to be going on Twitter in public and saying, we're completely solvent. And then on chain, we see that you're pulling a few million dollars from random yield farms. You don't go scrounging through your couch for change if you're totally good for it. And so I agree. I think if you can't produce reserves, if you can't produce those cold wall addresses, it doesn't really breed a lot.
00:17:19.968 - 00:17:32.006, Speaker B: Of confidence, which to me is also crazy. That how did this last round get done without doing basic enough diligence to understand where are the assets?
00:17:32.198 - 00:17:37.440, Speaker A: And I mean, these are some of the largest and most sophisticated investors in the world.
00:17:37.890 - 00:18:07.746, Speaker B: It was like a billion dollars that they raised. It was a billion dollars. Nobody verified where the funds were, which is absolutely insane. But the other element of this, which is I think, also worrying, of course, is the Alameda side. So FTX, okay, FTX is in trouble. Alameda, I've heard they didn't make margin calls and people can't get in touch with them, which probably means that Alameda is going under. We don't know for certain, but it's a good prediction at this point to make, especially given that FTT has gotten rocked.
00:18:07.746 - 00:18:52.674, Speaker B: It's down over 75% just in the last 24 hours. Now, originally you might think, like, okay, why did CZ do this? If you think that CZ Was the one who shot the gun, why did he do this? There may have been, in his mind an expectation that, okay, if I hurt FTX, it's a chance to take out a competitor and I can consolidate. I don't think he realized how bad it would be if something like this were happen. Like, the reality is that the entire crypto industry is down more than 12% today. Bitcoin, ether, everything is down massively. And there's a lot of fear about if. Could things get worse if we see real contagion kick off and if we see an impairment in the lenders as much as what happened with three arrows.
00:18:52.674 - 00:19:21.706, Speaker B: And so I don't think CZ fully understood the consequences of what would happen if he were to try to take down FTX. It's always been a bit of an open secret among exchange owners that FTX was never very profitable. And it was kind of weird that they were so big and they were spending so much on marketing and they were so aggressive and they were so loud. But of all the big exchanges, FTX was probably the least profitable. Except besides Coinbase. Coinbase maybe the only exception, which is somehow losing money. Almost every other exchange made money, especially that did derivatives.
00:19:21.706 - 00:19:54.778, Speaker B: Right? Derivatives are incredibly profitable. But FTX was the least profitable of all the big exchanges, and it was always very confusing to other exchange founders. What is going on at FTX? Like, why are they raising so much money? Why are they becoming so successful when we can tell they're not making that much money? And I think we now have a clear idea of what the answer is, is that FTX was a way or, sorry, potentially the suspicion is that FTX was ultimately a way to fund elementor research where they made the real money. And now is when we saw the.
00:19:54.784 - 00:20:26.626, Speaker A: Whole thing unwind, that kind of maps. I'm still in shock about that, and I almost don't believe it, because they position themselves as the pro regulatory exchange, and they were trying to come into the light in the US. From offshore. So it beggars belief that they would do that. I would never have expected that. I was completely taken by surprise. But that does track in terms of the path dependence, this whole thing, because Alameda was know Alameda came first and then FTX was created.
00:20:26.626 - 00:20:43.766, Speaker A: And so if you see it as a vehicle to get more deposits and allow Alameda to obtain more leverage, it kind of makes sense. But it's still shocking that they wouldn't adhere to this basic, basic principle of running a crypto exchange, which is maintain a full reserve.
00:20:43.878 - 00:20:57.070, Speaker B: So, speaking of which, soon after this whole debacle was playing out, CZ announced that Binance was going to start doing proof of reserves. And Nick, this is something you've been very vocal about. Can you explain very briefly what proof of reserves is and why it matters here?
00:20:57.140 - 00:21:18.866, Speaker A: Yeah, and there's also misconceptions about this. People think proof of reserve is just one side of the balance sheet. That's not true. Okay. Proof of reserve actually does refer to both the liabilities and the assets. Okay? So when people talk about proof of reserve, they are talking about a procedure in which you call it a proof of solvency, even. Although, of course, maybe that might be overreaching because that's always hard to assess.
00:21:18.866 - 00:22:14.450, Speaker A: But proof of reserve is like a term of art, which refers to a procedure whereby you compare the assets that you have to user liabilities on a platform and it has been done since 2014 in the wake of Gox. Actually, there's an interesting story there with CZ, I think did one at OKCoin back in the day when he was CTO at OKCoin and now is announcing it at Finance. But so basically what you do is you do a trivial proof of assets held on chain, that's the easy part. Then you sum up all the liabilities and you kind of attest to the user liabilities on the platform optionally. Then you give depositors the ability to verify that they're included in that liability set, typically done through merkel type proof. And it's not that complicated, there's code out there to do it. BitMEX did it recently, Kraken did it recently.
00:22:14.450 - 00:22:55.314, Speaker A: So it is technically doable, although challenging if you include margin and other types of accounts. And obviously as you add blockchains, it becomes more difficult to do, but basically it's a way to prove that your assets and liabilities match. And now we're seeing renewed enthusiasm around it. Binance, of course, the most important firm in the industry has announced they'll do it. Frankly, I think that's going to be extremely challenging for them because they have such a tangle of assets. Actually, it's going to take, I joke that it's going to take all five of the big four accounting firms to figure it out for them because it's just very hard. But yeah, I'm very encouraged that it's happening.
00:22:55.314 - 00:22:58.210, Speaker A: I just wish it was happening under more auspicious circumstances.
00:22:58.630 - 00:23:50.134, Speaker B: It's part of the ethos of crypto, really, which is don't trust verify and crypto. The whole point of crypto is that it should make this stuff easy. Now, okay, look, there's complexities, you're doing derivatives, you have different blockchains, you've got all these kind of weird esoteric assets that you're trading. But at the end of the day, I completely agree with you that this should be in principle, doable. And I think one of the big lessons from this is that nobody in this industry is unassailable, right? We thought we learned that a little bit with three arrows, but clearly we didn't, we didn't learn that. And I wanted Mia Culpa because on the last show we were saying that we thought this whole thing was overblown and that there wasn't enough, not that it was overblown, but that there wasn't enough there in that Coindest report to actually know what the balance sheet of Alameda looked like. I had no idea that this was coming, and till yesterday I wasn't tweeting about this, but I thought Alameda and FTX would be fine.
00:23:50.134 - 00:24:25.906, Speaker B: And talking to the lenders, the lenders who had loans out to Alameda as of yesterday, they thought that Alameda would be fine. It was very quick and sudden that people realized that this thing was over. And I think it was really the fact of what was happening at FTX that made all of this very quickly come to a close. If there was actually a line between FTX and Elementa, I actually think that things would have been okay. But it turns out that there was this whole underground tunnel that nobody else knew about, and that was never disclosed by FTX. Now, again, this is all speculation. We don't know until we know what happens in the end.
00:24:25.906 - 00:25:03.710, Speaker B: But one of the core questions now is one, is CZ actually going to buy FTX? So, he announced that this morning, and I think this morning, the moment that he announced it, markets jumped up and it seemed like there was going to be a broad recovery. And then soon, in the hours after the market dumped again and went even lower than what it was before the announcement. What do you guys think about the likelihood? It's very clear when CZ tweeted this, that it's like, look, we are not committed to buying FTX. We are in due diligence. We've given them an Loi, but we reserve the right to walk away from the deal. What do you guys think happens from here with respect to CZ buying FTX?
00:25:04.690 - 00:25:45.450, Speaker A: I would say 60% probability the deal closes. Totally arbitrary number, but I think they're going to find skeletons in the closet. They may have been aware of them already, which is why they launched the attack and felt empowered to do that. But the prize is enormous. I mean, FTX is maybe not by user count, but still by breadth of product and just the quantity of things they've built over there, and the innovation and Dynamism rivals only Binance, I would say, in terms of the offshore exchanges. So ultimately, it's a massive opportunity for them to just consolidate and grow their reach and control of the industry and get access to this additional user base. So I think it's in their interest to do it.
00:25:45.450 - 00:25:50.810, Speaker A: It may be at a complete Fire sale price. I'm also very curious to see where that gets consummated.
00:25:51.650 - 00:26:02.830, Speaker D: Yeah. I also wonder if SBF is using this tentative deal as a way to find other funding to remain independent in the background.
00:26:04.210 - 00:26:15.486, Speaker B: I don't think anybody else is. Morning. Yeah, I think it was possible this morning, but after this afternoon, I think FTX has got only one potential acquirer.
00:26:15.598 - 00:26:16.114, Speaker D: Okay.
00:26:16.232 - 00:26:23.186, Speaker B: The fact that they were trying to raise five to 6 billion tells you that there is nobody in this industry who can pay up other than Binance.
00:26:23.298 - 00:26:24.694, Speaker D: Wow. Right.
00:26:24.892 - 00:26:29.400, Speaker A: Does Binance even have the could they buy for cash or would it have to be for.
00:26:31.370 - 00:26:42.958, Speaker B: I mean, to be clear, I'm talking about the hole in the balance sheet. I'm not talking about the enterprise value. I think the enterprise value for FTX is negative. I don't think anybody will pay for this.
00:26:43.124 - 00:26:46.560, Speaker A: It's insane how closely this mirrors the BlockFi situation.
00:26:47.410 - 00:26:48.362, Speaker B: This is BlockFi.
00:26:48.426 - 00:26:50.254, Speaker A: I just can't believe that it's the same thing.
00:26:50.292 - 00:26:55.280, Speaker D: But now it's happened to them, and for a. Bigger, more reputable company.
00:26:55.810 - 00:27:38.458, Speaker B: What I've heard, and again, I don't know if this is correct, but what I've heard is that the shape of the deal is that basically they take over the liabilities, no payment for enterprise value and a kind of handshake that they'll take care of the team afterwards. Meaning that basically it's a fire sale. They are taking over the liabilities and they're going to make customers whole. Now, why would you do this if you're Sam? The answer is that nobody else wants to buy this from you. And it's going to be much worse for you if FTX goes down in flames than if there is a smooth exit. And to be clear, I think a lot of what finance buys is not even the customer list or whatever. FTX at this point has a terrible, terrible name given everything that's happened over the last 48 hours and what's going to come out inevitably over the upcoming months, I think it's more that he's buying lots of goodwill.
00:27:38.458 - 00:27:54.782, Speaker B: He's buying lots of goodwill with US regulators. People will remember this if he steps in and saves retail investors and saves face for everybody who trusted Sam, I think it's going to buy him a lot of goodwill in the industry. The same reason why Sam bought BlockFi.
00:27:54.926 - 00:28:07.320, Speaker D: I'm just saying his effective altruism philosophy comes out even in moments like this. Because I do think you're right, he's trying to benefit the greatest number of people at this point basically in a bad situation.
00:28:08.250 - 00:28:52.120, Speaker C: Yeah, just that they don't happen to be crypto depositors. I agree. This kind of feels like BlockFi redux where it's not about it's almost like this sort of macro story around smoothing out the industry, creating sort of this quieting effect, making people whole. I mean, honestly, what is a few billion to Binance to CZ? Like this thing prints money. And so I think for them to basically acquire this I think the downside here is just the concentration in the industry. Binance becomes massive compared to all the other players, especially players that have shut down in the past year or just really fallen off. And what does it mean when 80% of crypto volume goes through one single entity, which is not that inconceivable in the future?
00:28:52.810 - 00:29:10.860, Speaker D: I was just going to ask how obviously finance's regulatory situation is not clear, but I did wonder at this point, I don't know, us regulators might get in in some way. Just mean I don't know it's offshore, but I'm sure they have plenty of.
00:29:11.230 - 00:29:18.862, Speaker B: No, no, because FTX has a US arm, right? FTX has a us arm. FTX us is unimpaired. FTX us is still processing with no.
00:29:18.916 - 00:29:34.306, Speaker D: I'm not talking about FTX us or Binance us. I'm just saying. Well, my question is just when you have even if it's offshore such concentration in the industry, would they find some way to get involved? I don't know. You might know better than me.
00:29:34.328 - 00:29:40.802, Speaker B: I mean, US regulators have no jurisdiction over what's happening to non US customers, right? Both FTX and Binance.
00:29:40.866 - 00:29:43.110, Speaker D: Wasn't that what people thought about BitMEX?
00:29:43.690 - 00:30:08.094, Speaker B: Yeah, but BitMEX got in trouble for serving US customers, right? Like, they had like a very weak IP block. They were knowingly taking on US customers and that was the jurisdiction. That was how they established jurisdiction over BitMax for Binance. I mean, there have been other claims like that for Binance, but not since Binance US has existed, as far as I know. My suspicion. What happens is that so Binance did not claim that they're acquiring FTX US. My guess, they want nothing to do with FTX US.
00:30:08.094 - 00:30:23.170, Speaker B: Right? They don't even want to touch it because that would trigger sifius, which is like basically, if you have foreign investors investing in a two US company, there's all sorts of regulatory reviews. They don't want to touch any of that. And FTX US, there's no way FTX US was doing any of the funny business that FTX International was doing.
00:30:23.240 - 00:30:56.640, Speaker A: Right, but I see Laura's point a little bit is that if these were US firms, the FTC would be looking at it for, and obviously that's probably not the case here, but if this were a US transaction, there would certainly be eyebrows raised about the concentration in the industry. And maybe there's no entity that actually has that actual regulatory ages, but I think it should cause concerns actually, that basically the two largest, effectively offshore exchanges are now one.
00:30:57.810 - 00:31:02.702, Speaker B: To be clear, FTX was not the second largest offshore exchange. FTX was probably number four.
00:31:02.836 - 00:31:03.182, Speaker C: Okay.
00:31:03.236 - 00:31:14.580, Speaker A: But still very material and in terms of influence, maybe over some of these networks where they had a close relationship with them, that's only going to be increased now.
00:31:15.670 - 00:31:52.602, Speaker B: That's definitely true. That being said, I think in these situations, if there were, I mean, there is no global regulator who does that, like what the FTC might do for the US. But this is one of those situations where I think everyone is going to look the other way because the consequences of holding this back are so disastrous for everyone that it's like, look, we'll figure it out later. For now, yes, please, let's minimize the damage to markets. The thing about FTX as well, that's important to understand is that although FTX did a lot of volume, most of FTX's volume was institutional. It was not retail. FTX had a reputation that most of the trading volume on FTX was institutional.
00:31:52.602 - 00:32:31.382, Speaker B: Which is why where most people really wanted to trade, if you're a market maker or a trader, you want to trade on Binance. Binance is much more retail than FTX does. Coinbase is much more retail than FTX does. And so because so many users of FTX were institutions, I think that also makes FTX going down extra bad, or bad in a different kind of way, I should say. It's not worse than having retail lose money retail losing money is very, very bad. Having institutions lose money hurts you in a very different kind of way, which is that I think it's much more likely that if FTX goes down that there's going to be a lot more regulatory heat on crypto. There's going to be a lot of institutions that pull back from crypto and think that crypto is not fundable.
00:32:31.382 - 00:32:41.230, Speaker B: I mean, what do you guys think are the knock on effects of such a massive and such a well publicized exchange going down like this, especially if they're not saved by binance?
00:32:41.890 - 00:33:02.630, Speaker C: I think there's a bigger question around crypto venture. If you can have sequoia and paradigm and tomasec and tiger and all the big names piling money into this thing, which is supposed to be sort of this a stamped, approved investment, and have it be a massive write down, how do LP sort of think about crypto venture as a whole and that component of the industry?
00:33:04.010 - 00:33:43.342, Speaker D: Yeah, and I actually want to echo nick's points at the beginning about contagion, because if FTX and alameda really are just like the same two headed creature basically, then it's going to be very similar to what we saw before. And yeah, there could be knock on effects to other players like genesis and DCG, which they're just like those kinds of names that have a certain level of quality associated with them, certain level of trust. And if those have repercussions from this, then it's bad for the industry.
00:33:43.486 - 00:34:10.860, Speaker A: Yeah, the crypto lending space, this might be the last shoe to drop. I mean, genesis was already deeply, deeply in trouble and god only knows how they'll react to this. I believe they did still have loans outstanding. They're not the only lender. Alameda, after the dust had cleared, was still one of the big borrowers. And so if they go down, it's another credit crisis that's upon us. And it's not like.
00:34:12.750 - 00:34:31.970, Speaker B: For the uncollateralized loans in DeFi, a huge portion of all of them were out to eleven. So I think that was true on TrueFi. I think it was true on maple, if I'm not mistaken. And I think all of these lending pools are likely to be in trouble if eleometa is genuinely insolvent.
00:34:32.550 - 00:35:17.090, Speaker A: The other thing we haven't talked about is just the political wins in the US. I mean, sam was really meant to be the white knight in terms of professing open regulatory stance, being the emissary from the crypto industry and preaching moderation, preaching engagement with washington, you have to imagine the bill they were working on. The DCPA is probably dead in committee at this point. I think there's a huge loss of reputation. I don't see why washington would engage after this. It's also the midterms today and sam, you know, obviously was a heavy democratic donor. It doesn't seem to be the way things are going in the election.
00:35:17.090 - 00:35:42.140, Speaker A: I do wonder what the consequences will be. I think a lot of the Democrats that were engaging happily with FTX and with Sam now just take a step back from the industry and think to themselves, yeah, this crypto thing was a wildcat sort of crazy industry and let's not engage. Why? Why bother if this is the way that things actually are?
00:35:42.670 - 00:36:30.794, Speaker B: I was looking yeah, there's a lot going on today. US midterms Tom shared a tweet earlier that today is a very bad day for Sam because not only did he lose FTX, but also it's like there's going to be a red wave. There's a market on Polymarket, a very illiquid market, that asks, will FTX become insolvent by end of year? Right now it's trading at 40%. Yes, which is basically a prediction of whether finance will buy them out. I hope that they will, and I think Nick, it seems like the market agrees with you that there's a 60% chance that this deal goes through. But the scale of losses on FTX's balance sheet must have increased dramatically today. And so what might have been five to 6 billion last night could be much more than that today.
00:36:30.794 - 00:37:04.286, Speaker B: And I don't think Finance would buy FTX for 20 billion. I think they might pay five, maybe they would pay ten, but they would not pay 20. So it really depends on what the damage looks like after today, and we just don't know. But if finance is a buy it, then I think FTX is probably toast. The other question. So one thing that we've seen across the board, especially yesterday, was everything that Alameda owns or FTX owns has been dumping aggressively. And at the center of that empire, of course, was Solana.
00:37:04.286 - 00:38:07.720, Speaker B: So Sam and Alameda and FTX were known as being very large holders of Solana, as well as very large advocates for Solana. And with basically Alameda having to sell almost everything they have in order to meet margin calls, there's been mass selling of all Solana tokens and everything in the kind of Solana ecosystem. And so it kind of poses a real question. Just very recently we had breakpoint in, lisbon posed a real question of one how viable is Solana as a layer, one without the support of Sam and of the FTX empire? Do we think that this is going to be a long term impairment of Solana? Or has Solana already achieved that escape velocity such that okay, it started with Sam and their associates as being the initial launch pad for this blockchain, but does it have a life of its own? Just yesterday we saw Polygon flip Salana for the first time, pushing Salana out of the top ten tokens by market cap. What are your guys views on Salana and what happens from here?
00:38:08.570 - 00:38:45.880, Speaker A: I actually think Salana has exit velocity here. I think I see enough traction, that ecosystem, enough organic enthusiasm, enough developer activity, startups infrastructure, et cetera. I would say subjectively from my view. I consider them maybe second most active smart contract ecosystem. So I actually do think they can survive this. Obviously a big loss of confidence in the sort of primary sort of underwriter and patron of that ecosystem is out down for the count. But yeah, from our perspective, I think they actually will stick around.
00:38:45.880 - 00:39:05.260, Speaker A: The core Solana bet remains unchanged. It's kind of a bet on the sort of monolithic blockchain the composability, the benefits to a DeFi setup that you get with sort of like the larger throughput and the higher frequency and things like that. So yeah, from my stance, I actually see them.
00:39:07.070 - 00:39:40.520, Speaker C: Don'T like I didn't get the sense FTX or LMEA were like a big part of Breakpoint, if anything like Jump was a bigger part with Fire Dancer, which is like their FPGA client that's supposed to be way faster, so it's not like it really hinges on them anymore. I also want to circle back to the lending bit. So I was actually just looking through Maple and TruFi and again, a testament to the ability of to be able to being able to do things on chain. Maple actually doesn't have any loans outstanding to Alameda at this moment. I think True Phi has like twelve mil, so not actually that bad.
00:39:41.050 - 00:39:42.360, Speaker B: That's good to hear.
00:39:43.050 - 00:39:53.542, Speaker A: Yeah. That's a beautiful demonstration of why the DFI hybrid approach to lending is better. When would you have been able to do that for the centralized lenders?
00:39:53.686 - 00:40:19.186, Speaker B: That's fair. If you had some money into one of these centralized lenders right now, you'd have no idea what your exposure was to, whereas using these on chain ones, you can see the entire loan book. And so it does speak to the transparency, the value of transparency. And if anything that seems like that was at the core of what went wrong here, was that nobody knew what was happening behind the scenes at FTX except the people who were in charge. Yeah.
00:40:19.208 - 00:41:02.814, Speaker A: And the good news is we have these crises, they're not fatal. And then we have reform. So I'm not saying the crypto lending market is fully reformed, but we're seeing green shoots, we're seeing much more enthusiasm for the hybrid undercloudalized lenders, not just those two names, there's a whole bunch. And then hopefully in the centralized exchange space, I think this will finally be the catalyst. I actually had other exchanges reach out to me as I'm like the proof of reserve guy for some reason, and tell me, yeah, hey, we're doing proof of reserve. How do we get on your website? Because I have a tracker, I'm like, well you just tell me and I'll put you on the website. I don't charge a fee as if there's some sort of admittance fee or something, but so I'm actually seeing many more exchanges now.
00:41:02.814 - 00:41:28.710, Speaker A: Take proof of reserve seriously. I think it'll be written into legislation, actually. I think a smart policymaker writes that into law, says, yeah, you guys have the tools to do this, do it, you have to do it. You haven't done a good job of doing it on your own. And that converges CFI and DeFi a little bit, right? If you think about what DeFi lending is, it's all proof of reserved, know, fully proof of, you know, let's converge the two.
00:41:28.860 - 00:42:06.420, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what I was thinking earlier when we were talking about how CZ promised that he was going to do proof of reserves for Binance, because I was like, oh, how ironic it would be if CZ of all people, is the one who's kind of showing regulators the benefits of blockchains. And this kind of like open source, transparent blockchain, basically, I just was like because normally the regulators, they want to just have all these intermediaries who are checking everything, blah, blah, blah, the whole bit. So it would just be hugely ironic if this person, out of all people, is the one who kind of shows them how to do it.
00:42:07.430 - 00:42:12.870, Speaker B: Some real Art of War stuff, right now. This has been an absolute masterclass over the last 24 hours.
00:42:12.940 - 00:42:13.800, Speaker D: So true.
00:42:15.290 - 00:42:37.920, Speaker A: It is an irony though, that we get these crises because of the lack of transparency. The confidence crisis with FTX Almeda was because nobody knew it was a black box, right? And we weren't getting a lot of communication. In theory, all this stuff can be rendered transparent. We're using blockchains. That's the main critique of blockchains, frankly, is that they're too transparent. Let's take advantage of that.
00:42:38.690 - 00:43:24.110, Speaker B: I remember when Sam was on OD Lots and he was talking about the magic of putting money in a box. It turns out that that was what he was doing all along, was allegedly, allegedly that we were putting money in the box and he was taking money out of the box and trading it on chain. So the idea know, if you know, when we were talking about Celsius, we talked about know, we called Celsius a lender, sort of as a euphemism, right? Celsius was really a hedge fund because you were putting money into Celsius and you were basically giving debt to a hedge fund. You're not even the equity tranche, right? You're giving debt to a hedge fund. Hedge fund goes and does crazy stuff on chain. If it doesn't work out, you take the loss. If it does work out, you get a coupon.
00:43:24.110 - 00:44:17.658, Speaker B: It turns out that's what FTX was too. Now, again, I say it turns out allegedly, we don't know, but it seems like that was ultimately the exact same thing, is that you had your money in a hedge fund, you had your money in Alameda, and you were getting nothing actually for it. You weren't even getting a coupon, you were getting nothing, which is a much worse deal than even the people in Celsius, at least some people in Celsius got their coupon and could get out. I guess where I want to end this is I feel like there's two audiences that we should speak to. The first is people in crypto who maybe are new to the space and are just like, what the hell is going on? I come here, you guys tell me this big story about how great crypto is, how transparent everything is. You guys are reinventing the financial system and then all I get is three arrows, I get terra and now I get this. Explain yourselves.
00:44:17.658 - 00:44:21.566, Speaker B: Otherwise I'm out. What would you say to somebody who.
00:44:21.588 - 00:45:10.080, Speaker C: Tells you that I was actually thinking about this today? Behind all the craziness there are people building normal functioning businesses that are boring, that they're normal exchanges like Coinbase. There are normal investment funds that operate completely solvently and normally, but they're just boring. And so I don't know what it is that causes these sort of incidents to continue recurring. If it's like the type of people or the technology or the market, but there's no inherent reason why people have to play these games. There's tons of businesses out there that don't do these things and are totally fine, but maybe it just becomes too attractive to chase after these opportunities to sort of behave less than ethically. But it's not inherent in the technology in my mind. It's maybe something else.
00:45:10.530 - 00:45:58.142, Speaker A: I'm reminded of a line for all his flaws, still a great writer and assumed tilleb's fooled by randomness and his first book when he was still sort of hungry and good. And he says in any market regime, the best performing kind of traders or entities are the ones that are sort of most overfitted. They've most carefully fit their strategy to that particular market regime. When it turns, they're the most exposed. So the best performing entities in a given market circumstance, if things change, they're kind of the most exposed. So you can't expect that it's with some exceptions, of course, you have funds that do extremely well for decades at a time. You can't expect that the guys that did the best recently are necessarily going to do the best when things change.
00:45:58.142 - 00:46:42.240, Speaker A: And I think Sam was sort of like the Sam empire was the preeminent success story of the market over the last couple of years. And I think that is the problem is they became somehow accustomed to that market regime and took on additional risk and they became enamored with their own success and felt that they were invulnerable. And I often think about that maybe it's a form of cope, but I do think about the fact that if someone appears to be sort of like the killer success story of crypto, then you should really consider what happens if market conditions change dramatically, which they did.
00:46:43.730 - 00:46:45.280, Speaker B: Laura, what would you say?
00:46:45.730 - 00:47:43.726, Speaker D: So I don't view my role as trying to convince people that crypto is good or know I agree with Tom that obviously the crypto industry is vast. There's kind of good players and then shady and unsavory characters like in most things in life. Not going to lie, I still find some of the idealistic parts of crypto very appealing. And I actually feel that some of those areas have shined in different ways throughout this whole period starting since back in the spring. So maybe pointing out some of those things. But overall I think most people probably would agree that everything that happened here will be a net benefit for crypto in the long term. And that kind of the earlier we get certain people that are kind of not acting above board out of the space, the better it's going to be for everyone.
00:47:43.726 - 00:48:29.680, Speaker D: Obviously there's going to be a lot of pain during this period of turmoil right now, but ultimately it will be for the good. And so maybe you could just say to somebody sort of like stick around while we weed out all the shenanigans, something like that. But one other thing that I was going to say was just about I had a funny thought about a very ironic thing. Coinbase was so upset about the Wells notice that the SEC threatened based on it wanting to do its lend product. I'm like, oh, like maybe they're like, oh, maybe it's a good thing we didn't do that. So that's just like an ironic kind of little coda to this whole thing.
00:48:30.130 - 00:49:21.898, Speaker A: Yeah, one thing I'll say quickly is know, a lot of people got upset with Sam because he was advocating for sort of like a CFI first approach to crypto regulation, right. With DeFi. I don't want to misrepresent what he said, but DeFi apparently sort of more of an afterthought the tools to move on from this kind of crisis, whether it's the credit crisis in the summer, maybe another credit crisis now the centralized exchange crisis. Those tools are simply just reacquainting ourselves with the sort of underlying core values of crypto. Right? Focusing more on DeFi, more on transparency, more on the actual transparency that we get from using crypto assets, on trustlessness, on not trusting large centralized providers. So we have the toolkit laid out in front of us. So if anything, I think this should be a reminder.
00:49:21.898 - 00:49:30.820, Speaker A: Yeah, these big centralized institutions are not inviable. There is an alternative way and that's just the crypto way.
00:49:31.670 - 00:50:08.538, Speaker B: I will absolutely echo that in the Bitcoin white paper. Satoshi says, I have laid out a way to transact without trusted intermediaries. That was what Bitcoin was originally all about. And time and time again we learn what happens when we decentralize power into trusted intermediaries or institutions and we build cults of personalities around people instead of understanding the incentives, the mechanisms and ultimately the code. That's what crypto is about. It's what it's been about from the very beginning. And so to me what all of these, this is the oldest story in crypto.
00:50:08.538 - 00:51:02.126, Speaker B: It happened with Mount Gox, it happened with three arrows. It keeps happening, right? This idea that you need to stop trusting people and you need to start trusting the system. The system that we are trying to build here. Again and again, the story of all this stuff is that it's not bitcoin that breaks, it's not ethereum that breaks, it's not DeFi that breaks, it's not compound or uniswap or any of these things that break. It's the institutions that we build around people and individuals who have incentives that drive them in a wayward direction from the incentives of their users or their customers. And at the end of the day, to me it's a reaffirmation that we should be finding ways to use this technology. As you pointed out Nick Carter with as you pointed out, Nick with proof of reserves and being able to lean further into the power that this technology gives us that isn't available in the regular financial world.
00:51:02.126 - 00:51:39.974, Speaker B: Right? To me that's so much of what the take home is of this whole debacle. Crypto was built to give us the tools so that this kind of thing doesn't need to happen. And my hope is that we learn from this and we do learn a little bit every single time. We do push the vanguard forward every single time in terms of the transparency, the analysts who are looking on chain and figuring out where is this capital going, where is that capital going? There's so much more clarity on how this story happened in real time. Remember how long it took for Mount Gox for people to realize the money wasn't there compared to today. All this stuff happened in a single day. And so we are making progress.
00:51:39.974 - 00:52:08.694, Speaker B: But I think there's still clearly further to go in understanding what the promise of this technology actually is and how to harvest that in a world where obviously we do need to have some connective tissue with the traditional financial world. That's a lot of what FTX's story was about was that we are going to be the gateway from the old financial world to the new financial world. We do need that, but we need to leverage the power of crypto and the transparency that it brings to do that in a way that ultimately works in the long.
00:52:08.892 - 00:53:25.822, Speaker D: Right, but so I agree with you that that is one possible and very valid conclusion. However, I do see a risk for regulators to have a different conclusion which so obviously the whole issue around why people were upset with Sam over the Dccpa thing had to do with, you know, this doesn't involve DeFi. However, in general, what know sort of debate was about was like getting regulators involved in an area where crypto people felt like hands off, this is not an area where we need regulators, we have on chain, transparency, blah blah blah. Right? And also I think people are very protective of developers and actually the tornado cash thing today sort of shows that the government is amenable to that idea of kind of exempting developers from some of this stuff. But I do see how some of what happened in the last 24 hours could actually lead regulators to this other conclusion of like, oh, we need to be more involved, we need to make sure that these crypto institutions, if they're exchanges, whatever, act more like banks. I don't know. I'm not saying that what you're saying is wrong.
00:53:25.822 - 00:53:45.090, Speaker D: I actually feel like that's a perfectly reasonable lesson to take away from this. But I could see someone with a very different background reaching a completely different conclusion. So I wouldn't say necessarily that the end of the story is like, don't trust in intermediaries. Because a lot of regulators, their solution for things is to use intermediaries.
00:53:47.030 - 00:54:30.590, Speaker B: That's totally fair. And I want to make clear, and this is maybe an extension of the point that you're making. If you look at all the US exchanges are very highly regulated, right? FTX International was based in the Bahamas, and apparently Bahaman regulators, somehow this just, I don't know, stuck by them or whatever it is that FTX was doing. We still don't know the details was okay in the Bahamas, or maybe they hid it from the Bahaman regulators, we don't know. But the US cannot regulate everything in the world, right? Like, ultimately, no matter how restrictive you make US regulations, coinbase is not doing this stuff. FTX US is not doing the stuff. It's the businesses that end up getting pushed overseas that find themselves in these weird pockets of potential alleged malfeasance.
00:54:30.590 - 00:54:45.942, Speaker B: And so I think you can't rely on regulators, because if you rely on regulators, the companies are going to pick up their headquarters and leave. They're going to go from Malta to here to there to Dubai to whatever, blah, blah, blah. That's what they do. The moment that a regulator gets tough, people pick up and they go somewhere else.
00:54:45.996 - 00:54:55.340, Speaker D: Yeah, but then the weird twist is everybody's always criticizing US regulators, but then it's like, oh, well, because they're so strict, like, this kind of shit doesn't happen here.
00:54:57.550 - 00:55:25.826, Speaker B: To be clear, I think US regulations would made something like this impossible. It was clearly they did, because FTX US didn't do any of this stuff, right? And so it's not just about protecting. I don't think this is something you can look to regulators for. It's something that we have to look to the industry for. We have to look for people ourselves in the industry demanding different things of the services and products that we use. Right? If people say that exchanges need to do proof of reserves or I won't deposit my money there, they will do it, period. Doesn't matter where they are.
00:55:25.826 - 00:55:32.582, Speaker B: It doesn't matter if they're in Dubai or if they're in Timbuktu. It doesn't make a difference. They'll do it if that's what the industry demands. That's the point that I'm making.
00:55:32.636 - 00:55:35.480, Speaker D: That's a great point. Yeah, I agree with.
00:55:37.690 - 00:55:54.134, Speaker B: The but the point you made, Laura, is a very good one. Once again, regulators are watching. Regulators are like and lawmakers are like, what the hell is this circus? You guys told me that this guy was so great and this boy genius.
00:55:54.262 - 00:55:58.778, Speaker D: Gives away all his which adds he's.
00:55:58.794 - 00:56:11.790, Speaker B: Got the funny shoelaces, he's got the crazy hair, he sleeps in a beanbag. You guys are telling me this guy's a second coming and now look where I am. Last thing and then we can wrap. What would you say here to lawmakers or regulators?
00:56:11.950 - 00:57:01.010, Speaker A: That there are still decent operators in the industry that are actually interested in safeguarding client assets and running real businesses and you don't have to look far to find them, but don't be dazzled by the Sam, Baker and Frieds of the world coming in with a huge budget, slinging money around Washington. Like there's other people to engage with in the space and there's other firms that actually do want to play by the rules and protect their clients and things like that. I think some of the blame is small, very small portion of the blame is due to the folks that got sucked into the mystique of Sam and the cult of personality they built, as is the case a lot of these other collapses. We've know it's. The crypto regulatory story is clearly not going to be written by him. It's going to be written by the people that are left after the rebels settled.
00:57:01.750 - 00:57:50.980, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the flip side of good regulation is strangulation and a chilling effect and not letting entrepreneurs start and build businesses. And I think in my mind we had technology to sort of get the best of both worlds of a transparent, investor, consumer friendly business, but that also allows people to experiment and try new things and serve their niche. And I think of it a little bit almost sort of like ended encrypted messages where we don't need a central authority to go through and make sure that people's messages aren't being read. We just have the technology to sort of enable that by default. And I'd like to see the industry move more towards that of allowing us to sort of be compliant with what we want from these products by default and not sort of relying on a government or a central authority to enforce those.
00:57:51.430 - 00:58:38.734, Speaker D: I don't know if I want to give a message to regulators necessarily, I don't want to speak for the industry. But what I will say is that I sort of now see this kind of little vacuum where the industry had certain players that it relied on to put a good face forward and Sam definitely was preeminent among them. And when you look at some of the other exchange owners, brian Armstrong is just who Brian Armstrong is. I don't think he's going to step up to the plate. Unfortunately. It's just not in his like from, from literally its first days, tried to be, know, good actor work with regulators, and yet Brian is just not the person who can be a face. They have this huge compliance department.
00:58:38.734 - 00:59:20.462, Speaker D: They have a lot of people that go to Washington and interact with regulators, but they don't necessarily have a good face. And because of their frustrations with regulators, now, they're often in this antagonistic role. The Winklevoss twins, a similar situation. Obviously, they try to put forward a good face and then now after the CFTC action against I think some of the twins were kind of trash talking. I remember they wrote some tweets where it was just such a different tenor from their previously kind of more obsequious tone. I don't know Jesse Powell, he's more know, I'll support Coin Center to do the advocacy work. I don't see him, know, doing that.
00:59:20.462 - 01:00:07.920, Speaker D: And I could keep going through the list, but I think you get the point. And so it just makes me wonder, like, okay, so now what's going to happen? You've got kind of like the Katie Hahn paradigm ish people behind the like, is that what's going to I just don't know. But it's just something that I've been wondering because a lot of the narrative around getting Dccpa done or any kind of crypto legislation done, actually, a lot of what I kept hearing was, you know, we can all credit for, you know, putting a lot of FaceTime in DC to try to get legislation done. That obviously went down the shitter in the last 24 hours. So that's why I'm wondering, like, okay, so now what's next? It'll be interesting to watch.
01:00:08.690 - 01:00:19.330, Speaker B: I've heard that the two most influential people on the Hill within the crypto industry were Sam and then Katie Hahn. So I think probably Katie is going to have to carry a lot of this on her shoulders now.
01:00:19.480 - 01:01:04.866, Speaker D: Yeah. And in a way, I think she's a better person to do it than Sam because she spent how long in government? I don't remember like, what, 15 years or I don't even know. So in that regard, because Sam is like, what, like 20 something? I don't know how old he is, but he's 29. Yeah, he's kind of fresh out of college. Katie and I are sort of the same age. So we, I think, understand when you have relationships for a long time or you just have a certain level of knowledge and depth of knowledge of working in an industry for a very long time, it's very helpful. So, Katie, Hallen, if, you're know, we think that the crypto industry relies on you at this point.
01:01:04.968 - 01:01:07.218, Speaker B: Yeah. Godspeed, please save us.
01:01:07.384 - 01:01:15.506, Speaker A: I'd say Circle and Jeremy Lear also have a big they'll have an opportunity to kind of reframe reset the narrative here.
01:01:15.608 - 01:02:06.958, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. So what I'd say and then we can wrap up, is that I remember one line that Robert said on the show after the Three Arrows collapse was that one of the lessons of that episode was that the problems in crypto keep arising when we do things Wall Street style instead of crypto style. And I think that was kind of the central theme of all the big failures that we saw this year, was that when you see more centralization, when you see more trust in individuals, that's when you get these really unfortunate failures that surprise everybody. Sometimes things fail, but when things fail, it shouldn't be a surprise. That's kind of the rule of how orderly markets function. At the end of the day, I would say what Sam was advocating for was for less regulation on exchanges and more regulation in DeFi.
01:02:06.958 - 01:02:44.142, Speaker B: And it actually seems like the lesson should be the opposite, that there probably should be more regulation on exchanges and less regulation on DeFi, in large part because DeFi was totally fine. Nothing in know rugged anybody. Nothing in DeFi stole people's money. Nothing in DeFi tricked anyone into doing something they didn't intend to do. Now, of course, there are scams and there's all sorts of problems with hacks and things like that. And those are things that the industry gets better at and it's figuring out its way to get past because users demand it. But the story of centralized exchanges kind of it's the same story since the beginning of time.
01:02:44.142 - 01:03:17.258, Speaker B: And I think if there's one takeaway from this, it's that there definitely needs to be regulation in crypto. But I think the shape of that regulation depends a lot on how you see why this happened and how it should affect how users interact with this industry going forward and the promise that this industry actually holds for a better version of a financial system. With all that being said, we've gone a bit long. It's been a long day. I'm very exhausted. I assume that you guys are too. I haven't gotten a lot of sleep lately, but we'll be back next week.
01:03:17.258 - 01:03:23.622, Speaker B: Hopefully things will be a little bit more calm by then. Thanks so much, Nick, for jumping on on short notice.
01:03:23.686 - 01:03:25.102, Speaker A: Yeah, my pleasure. This is great.
01:03:25.156 - 01:03:30.942, Speaker B: Yeah. And anybody wants to do proof of know, you know who to hit up, he will list you for free if you do.
