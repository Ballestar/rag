00:01:18.174 - 00:01:23.010, Speaker A: My guest today is Emily Parker, co founder of LongHash. Welcome, Emily.
00:01:23.170 - 00:01:25.830, Speaker C: Thank you so much, Laura. I'm really excited to be here.
00:01:25.980 - 00:01:36.266, Speaker A: You're the co founder of LongHash, which people may be familiar with for its data journalism, but there are actually two parts to the company. So can you describe what LongHash does?
00:01:36.448 - 00:02:07.750, Speaker C: Sure. So the most general purpose of LongHash is to serve as a gateway to Asia, and both parts of the company try to achieve that goal. So, on the incubator side, we help blockchain projects reach Asian markets, and we also try to help Asian projects go global. So we have offices all over the Asian region, and then we also have a data media platform, as you mentioned, in which we use data to help investors understand blockchain and cryptocurrency, with an emphasis on Asian markets.
00:02:08.090 - 00:02:21.506, Speaker A: And what's your background? Like, how did you come to the blockchain space and then end up founding LongHash, which obviously you sound American, which I believe you are, has a focus on Asia.
00:02:21.698 - 00:02:46.586, Speaker C: Okay, very reasonable question to ask. So I have been interested in China for a very long time. I started studying Chinese in high school, and basically I've done a lot of different things in my career. I started out in journalism. I worked at The Wall Street Journal and also at The New York Times. But I also served in the US government as a policy advisor at the US State Department. And then this is my second startup.
00:02:46.586 - 00:03:39.042, Speaker C: So I've done a lot of different things, but I think the one consistent trend in my career has been Asia and technology. So when I was at The Wall Street Journal in Hong Kong, I actually wrote a column looking at how the impact of the Internet in China specifically. And then I went on to write a book looking at how the internet was changing lives in China, Cuba, and Russia. And I've just been going back and forth to Asia for many, many years, and I've also spent a lot of time in Japan as well. And so cryptocurrency kind of got on my radar when I saw how big it was in China and how it was blowing up in China. And this kind of caught my interest because it reminded me a lot of the internet, because it was like this decentralized technology that was clearly making the Chinese government nervous. And one thing I had learned from looking at the internet in China for many years is that it's very hard to shut it down.
00:03:39.042 - 00:04:14.938, Speaker C: You can censor it, you can restrict it, but there's always going to be information that gets through. And so my instinct was that cryptocurrency would be similar, and you could even argue that the stakes were even higher. Know, the internet is the spread of information, and cryptocurrency is the spread of money, sometimes huge volumes of money. So I got very interested in cryptocurrency in China when I saw a, how big it was becoming there, and b, when I saw that the Chinese government was trying to rein it in. And I kind of wanted to see what would happen. And that was sort of my entry into the crypto world, was looking at it from the Chinese perspective.
00:04:15.114 - 00:04:16.766, Speaker A: And what year was that?
00:04:16.948 - 00:04:28.370, Speaker C: That was like 2017. So it was right around the time when China was signaling that they were going to be cracking down on cryptocurrency.
00:04:28.790 - 00:04:38.630, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. And then how did you have the idea to kind of build the business, this know, half incubator and half journalist or media outlet?
00:04:39.130 - 00:05:33.814, Speaker C: So I went to China and I met a lot of the people in the crypto world there I met the people that would become my co founders, my partners. And initially, the idea behind LongHash was more of a straight data media platform. This idea that there's so much data in blockchain, everyone always talks about that, right? Like that how the data is transparent, and you can see all this data, but it's not very easy to make sense of it, and it's not very easy to know which data you should be paying attention to. So our initial idea was, okay, let's do not just a media platform sort of hybrid like a data media platform, because we're not a media platform like CoinDesk, for example. Most of our stories use data analysis, but we're not a pure data platform either. So basically what we're trying to do is take data and tell stories around it and help people understand that data. So that was kind of the initial idea.
00:05:33.814 - 00:05:59.150, Speaker C: And the other thing we really wanted to do was have a really global platform. My partners were in Asia. Asia, which I'm sure we'll get to later, is a huge part of the crypto world. Some people would say it's the heart of the crypto world, and we wanted to kind of increase coverage of those. In LongHash, our data media platform, publishes in English, Chinese and Japanese, and we also really try to cover those markets.
00:05:59.810 - 00:06:07.090, Speaker A: And for the data side, what types of data do you typically utilize for your stories?
00:06:07.510 - 00:06:36.780, Speaker C: So we use quite a wide variety, but we use a lot of on chain data. We use price data. Sometimes we'll do more creative things where we'll look at the number of meetups in a certain country to gauge interest there. We'll look at social media data. It's a pretty wide variety. But our main focus, whatever data we use, is to really try to tell a story around it and not just put that data out there and have people have to make sense of it for themselves.
00:06:37.790 - 00:07:23.386, Speaker A: Yeah, I was kind of poking around and I thought some of these were very interesting. Like, there was a story that showed the bitcoin price against the different time zones, eastern Time in the US. Pacific time, and then actually, I forget the last one, but it was an Asian, like maybe Beijing time or something like that. And the conclusion when you looked at kind of the different graphs was that basically, at least for the last few months, the US. Crypto market has been more enthusiastic than the Chinese one. And then some others were know, what is the price premium on Coinbase versus OKCoin or tracking the bitcoin price against Baidu searches for? Yeah, these are really interesting.
00:07:23.568 - 00:07:49.570, Speaker C: Thank you. I'm glad. You know, we really try to do a wide variety of know. We do things like we have a stablecoin health index where we try to rate the health of stablecoins using various you know, we try to look at the level of social media interest in China, in cryptocurrency, for example. So, yeah, it's pretty broad. But our main point is to just try to make these stories understandable.
00:07:50.150 - 00:08:00.118, Speaker A: And are there any types of data about the blockchain and crypto space that you find are actually still difficult to get despite everybody kind of touting how transparent it all is?
00:08:00.284 - 00:08:18.506, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, so many. Well, first of all, the first point is that everyone says how transparent it is, but how many people actually know how to make sense of blockchain data? Right? I mean, everyone's like, oh, you can see everything on the blockchain, but it's not like the average person can just go and see everything on the blockchain and take a story away from that.
00:08:18.528 - 00:08:18.714, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:18.752 - 00:08:58.118, Speaker C: A, but B, yeah, there are a lot of missing pieces to the data particularly. I mean, I think China is a case in point because when China cracked down on crypto exchanges after that, in late 2017, China became a real black box. And I think for those of us who spend a lot of time in Asia, we know that there's a lot happening in China. We know that china has active trade, but it's really hard to find those numbers. It's really hard to prove that. And so I think China is a really good example of there's just not a lot of specific data about what exactly is going on there. I mean, in general, I think geographical data can be very difficult.
00:08:58.118 - 00:09:17.520, Speaker C: I mean, a lot of people point to data from local bitcoins, for example, but that's obviously not conclusive. And part of the problem is a lot of these exchanges, it's unclear where they're actually based and unclear who the majority of their users are. So it can be very difficult. I'm personally very interested in geographical data and it can be difficult to find.
00:09:17.890 - 00:09:39.510, Speaker A: Yeah, well, probably part of that is because since you do have this geographical focus and then within Asia itself, there's so much variety, I could imagine you trying to sort of parse the signals country by country. So just to kind of set the terms here, how do you define Asia, at least for your site? Or what areas of Asia are you focused on?
00:09:39.660 - 00:10:08.222, Speaker C: Yes, a very important distinction because, yes, you say Asian, obviously, Asia is different countries have different rules. And not only that, the rules are changing constantly. It's a very dynamic space. So I would say that the countries that we are really kind of the most heavily focused on would probably be China and Japan and also Singapore. We do have a presence in Hong Kong as well, but I'd say China, Japan and Singapore at least. And those are the three places that I personally, I think, know the and.
00:10:08.276 - 00:10:13.440, Speaker A: Is that why you decided to focus on those areas? Simply because that was your knowledge base?
00:10:14.550 - 00:10:42.826, Speaker C: Not exactly. I think, you know, those three markets make a lot of mean. China, you know, is a very important market. I think it will continue to be regardless of the regulatory obstacles. Japan just on kind of like the retail trading side, on the retail investing side is still huge. And Singapore, I mean, you're just hearing more and more about how Singapore is kind of this paradise of crypto and that they have friendly regulations. I think Singapore is a place that I just hear talked about a lot.
00:10:42.826 - 00:10:57.760, Speaker C: So I think those three places, they do make a lot of sense strategically. Obviously, another important country is Korea. We don't really have a presence there yet. I think hopefully eventually we will. But that's kind of the missing piece of that.
00:10:58.530 - 00:11:13.090, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I was going to say because I even noticed, I think one of the articles on your site showed the various trading pairs, and that was the third largest. It was USD. Then the Japanese Yen and then Yuan.
00:11:13.430 - 00:11:15.960, Speaker C: Yes. Korea is no doubt important.
00:11:17.130 - 00:11:26.070, Speaker A: So very broadly, how would you characterize the differences between the crypto markets in the west or maybe even in particular in the US versus Asia?
00:11:26.890 - 00:11:43.066, Speaker C: Yes, so it's a really tough question. So I think recently. So I just interviewed SEC Commissioner Hester Purse. Who? I know you interviewed her as well. It was a great interview. And she was visiting Asia for various reasons. She had various things that she was doing there.
00:11:43.066 - 00:12:26.074, Speaker C: But one of the things she was doing in Singapore at least was trying know, see the lay of the land and meet blockchain projects and learn about the crypto space there. And so I was talking to her specifically about this know, how she sees kind of the US. Crypto landscape as compared to the Asian crypto landscape. And she was pretty direct in saying that a lot of projects I'm talking to are avoiding the US. And Singapore, for example, seems to have a more open approach to. So, you know, that's something that I feel like you kind of hear a lot these know, in the Asian crypto world that the US. Is seen know, either very strict or I think more important, very of.
00:12:26.074 - 00:13:27.054, Speaker C: And that's what the commissioner was saying is that it's not so much a matter of strictness, it's that the US. Is just like and cryptocurrency is confusing, right? Like it's already confusing and then you add kind of a layer know, I mean with the US. For know, you have different regulatory know that are involved in crypto a, then you have different states that have different rules on money transmission. So we did one of the visualizations we did at LongHash some time ago was we did a map of the United States looking at different approaches towards money transmission and kind of separating them by color. And it was like this rainbow map, right? It didn't make any sense. You have the different regulatory bodies and then you have this kind of rainbow map and then you also have what is the security, what is the utility? You have the Howey test that there's just a lot about the US. Environment that I think seems like you kind of need to be a securities lawyer to understand.
00:13:27.054 - 00:13:55.430, Speaker C: And the commissioner at the SEC was basically acknowledging this and saying that we just don't have enough clarity. And I feel like if someone at the SEC is saying is how is this a blockchain project going to figure it out? And I think there's this fear. I mean the US. Is obviously a very important market and I think a lot of people want to be in the US. But there's this fear that you could break a rule without even knowing that you're breaking it and who's going to want to take that risk?
00:13:57.850 - 00:14:16.910, Speaker A: Well, so for that reason, are you seeing that there's then a lot of movement the other way? Because the way you've been phrasing this, it's a little bit like, oh, Asian projects maybe are scared to go there, but then are you seeing projects know, maybe the teams are from the US. But then they go to Asia.
00:14:17.250 - 00:15:24.820, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, again, anecdotally this isn't something I don't know how big this phenomenon yeah, I mean, I think you definitely hear about companies that are registering in singapore ICOs. We ran a story about how ICOs are leaving the United states. There is some data on this, right. So Elementus that does really good work in data. They released a report where last year, in august, for the first time, august of 2018, singapore ICOs. The number of singapore ICOs surpassed those of the united states, which is kind of remarkable, given that you're comparing the size of singapore and the know, there's a bunch of data points, like, know, where you're just kind of seeing this move and new exchanges that are kind of opening up in asia and yeah. And projects that they just see places like Singapore as more welcoming and more I don't just to say I don't think it has to be this, like, I don't think it will necessarily always be this way, but that is kind of the know right now.
00:15:25.450 - 00:15:42.010, Speaker A: And out of curiosity, do you think that some of that might be know? Obviously ICOs have been banned in china, so is some of that demand in singapore chinese people who somehow are able to participate in singapore? Do you see what I'm asking?
00:15:42.160 - 00:16:21.794, Speaker C: Yeah, of course. Sure. So that's like kind of the really fascinating thing about Asia is that it's so dynamic. And even in the two years or so where I've been watching Asia very closely, there's been so many changes, and it's almost like where some country clamps down and then all the activity goes somewhere else. And I feel like I've been watching this kind of spread throughout the region, like when china cracked down on ICOs or when china sort of cracked down on crypto. A lot of activity went to japan and korea, but then japan and Korea have sent mixed signals. Japan, for example, in early 2018 became a lot more strict on cryptocurrency.
00:16:21.794 - 00:16:38.970, Speaker C: And then I think at that point, singapore started looking more friendly. It has been moving around the region for sure. And I think a lot of people who are kind of leaving jurisdictions that are not friendly to go to places like Singapore that are seen as more friendly.
00:16:39.870 - 00:17:18.360, Speaker A: Oh, that's really interesting. Yeah, I guess it would be like don't I don't think Europe has a super unified policy, but if the different european countries had different policies, then you might see movement. One other thing I wanted to ask was that in a previous episode, eric Meltzer and Duvey wan of primitive ventures were saying that they thought the decentralized networks tended to have more kind of like western founders, I guess, and that there were more really good projects around infrastructure, like around trading and exchanges and stuff that were coming out of Asia. What do you think of that take?
00:17:18.810 - 00:18:01.510, Speaker C: Well, there definitely are projects know, have kind of like a background in mean yeah, I think it's true. Again, I don't know how to quantify that, to say what percentage of these projects are, because it is very decentralized and sometimes a project will have Asian founders, but then they'll be incorporated somewhere else. But you look at, for example, you look at Binance, you look at Neo. These are some really kind of important players. You look at Tron. I don't know if people have different opinions about Tron, but these are kind of interesting projects or exchanges that have come from Asia.
00:18:02.010 - 00:18:17.290, Speaker A: Right, okay, well, so let's kind of dive into the different markets within Asia. And I know that China is a particular market that you have special knowledge in. So broadly, how would you describe the industry and the markets.
00:18:20.030 - 00:19:05.820, Speaker C: Think it's I would describe it as full of contradictions and very different from how it appears. Would probably be the easiest way to describe basically, you know, what happened in China. Just short history of Chinese crypto markets is that trade was booming. Bitcoin trade in China was huge and then ICOs were also exploding. And then the Chinese authorities got very nervous and they kind of clamped down on Chinese crypto exchanges, specifically looking at trading Chinese currency directly for cryptocurrency and then they also banned. So ever since that point and then at that time, I think the price reacted very strongly. The Bitcoin price reacted, but since came back.
00:19:05.820 - 00:19:40.914, Speaker C: And I think China is still a vibrant place for cryptocurrency. It's just a little bit harder to see. So China, for example, still has a pretty active know. So you can still trade Chinese currency for cryptocurrency. You just have to do it via an OTC platform. There are still definitely like projects coming out of China, so there are definitely startups in China. And also the other kind of I don't know if it's a contradiction, but distinction is that the Chinese government may be very wary of cryptocurrency, but they like blockchain.
00:19:40.914 - 00:20:23.838, Speaker C: They like blockchain technology. So there's kind of these two things going on where you kind of have the authorities sending positive signals about blockchain, but negative signals about cryptocurrency. But I think the other important thing to say here is that cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, is not illegal in China per se. It's China cracked down on some very specific aspects of the industry. And I think for know ICOs. And at the time when China cracked down on ICOs, frankly, almost everybody I spoke to in the Chinese crypto world supported that crackdown because they felt that ICOs in China were kind of getting out of control. There were a lot of frauds and there were a lot of scams and that it was bad for the industry.
00:20:23.838 - 00:20:32.710, Speaker C: And so I think that know, I've heard a lot of Chinese crypto enthusiasts say that that wasn't actually the wrong decision.
00:20:33.850 - 00:21:38.842, Speaker A: Yeah, all the way back when the ban happened, I did an episode with two founders. It was DA Hong FEI and Patrick just blanking on his last name. Anyway, they were from Neo and Quantum, and they were giving some examples of some of the really kind of eyebrow raising ICOs. And one of them was like a business around moon cakes, I remember being. So yeah, it obviously was getting super frothy over there. But then when you were saying that people can still trade OTC and stuff, what does that look like here? OTC, I feel like, generally means people who are spending more money where they know, moving larger amounts of money, where they might be worried about moving the price on an exchange or something. And then obviously you have maybe, I guess, kind of a local Bitcoins model.
00:21:38.842 - 00:21:41.580, Speaker A: But what does OTC look like there?
00:21:41.950 - 00:22:39.550, Speaker C: So OTC looks like basically an online platform that sort of matches buyers and so and that's where you can trade Chinese currency directly for cryptocurrency. And then what some people in China do is then they will get USDT tether and then they will use that to trade on exchanges like binance or Huobi or something like that. So the first step is know, kind of using your Chinese currency there and then getting into maybe a stablecoin like USDT and then using the USDT to trade on one of the larger cryptocurrency exchanges. So even if you're not able to trade directly from Chinese currency into Bitcoin, you can trade from USDT into Bitcoin. And that's why USDT is actually quite a big phenomenon in China. It has a little bit of a different connotation.
00:22:40.450 - 00:23:02.326, Speaker A: Okay, okay, this is really interesting. So basically it sounds like it is really like a local Bitcoins where it's kind of like a Craigslist style, hey, I'm selling for this amount, or I want to purchase at this amount, and then people can match with each other. And then once people get their Bitcoin, then they exchange it for USDT. I don't know how that works.
00:23:02.428 - 00:23:05.682, Speaker C: It's more like once they get their USDT, then they trade it for Bitcoin.
00:23:05.746 - 00:23:09.320, Speaker A: Yeah, where do they get that?
00:23:10.570 - 00:23:26.880, Speaker C: So basically you can look at some of the OTC platforms as kind of like the on ramp from fiat currency into cryptocurrency. And then once you have USDT, you can trade directly on some of these larger exchanges, binance or whatever, if that makes.
00:23:29.170 - 00:23:31.294, Speaker A: Initial the OTC transaction is actually.
00:23:31.332 - 00:23:49.590, Speaker C: For USDT in some can, yes, you can use it for other things as well. But at least the that's the use case that I've heard from some people in China is that they will try to get USDT first and then use the USDT on the more mainstream exchanges.
00:23:50.490 - 00:24:07.770, Speaker A: Interesting. So then for these Chinese exchanges that basically still exist, I guess maybe they're not Domiciled anymore in China like Huobi and OKCoin and binance. Do you think it's affected their volumes or it maybe sounds like it really hasn't.
00:24:09.150 - 00:24:54.940, Speaker C: It's so hard to another it's kind of another funny thing. So binance for example was in China. And according to CZ, they left China before the crackdown because they kind of saw the writing on the Know from from then on binance kind of it's not I don't know if it's necessarily like due to China in spite of China, but these exchanges have done really well post China crackdown. I mean, maybe part of it is because they were sort of forced to go look at Mean. You did a great podcast with I mean, look at their explosive growth. I mean, a lot of that happened after the crackdown, right. So it definitely didn't hurt them.
00:24:55.310 - 00:25:42.538, Speaker A: Well, one thing I remember CZ saying is know, with the ICO ban, the different projects were told that they had to refund investors who wanted to be refunded, but because the BNB tokens had risen, nobody wanted to give back their BNB tokens. And then on top of that, the exchange had actually done a few token sales on the platform itself. And so then they offered to refund any investors for those tokens. And I can't remember I think I'll have to check this, but it was in the single digit millions that they spent on it. And if I remember correctly, I think it was 6 million that they spent and they only raised 15 million on their ICO. So it was kind of a big step they were taking. But they felt like they should do that for their customers.
00:25:42.538 - 00:26:33.790, Speaker A: And he said that he felt like afterward, then he just won the loyalty of all these know, it sounds like because I guess the thing that I was curious about is I feel like in the US. If there were some kind of ban like this, then I don't know if you would still see a ton of entrepreneurial activity. Like it might kind of attract people who were more of the outlaw type or whereas I'm curious to know in China, are these entrepreneurs more of that type? Like the kind who aren't afraid to have a brush with the law? Or are they entrepreneurs who are just kind of normal operating above board type of people who don't feel like they're going to get in trouble? How does it affect?
00:26:33.890 - 00:27:04.180, Speaker C: I think it's a really good observation, and I think you're probably right about the Mean in terms of like, if something like this happened in the US. I think the reaction would be think, you know, part of it is are China didn't ban cryptocurrency. Totally. Right. And I think people can kind of see that distinction. If you're a blockchain startup, you're not necessarily doing something is is worried about some very specific things like using ICOs for public fundraising. Right.
00:27:04.180 - 00:28:13.660, Speaker C: It's kind of clear what they're concerned about. But yeah, I mean, you could say that they are sending a signal that this industry is not particularly liked, but again, it's a conflicted signal because sometimes they don't seem to be sending I think the larger message here is that entrepreneurs in China, I think, are just kind of used to restrictions. China bans a lot of at. If you look at, like, look at the Internet, for example, right? I mean, there are so many restrictions on the Internet in China. This is like a yet, you know, what's happening in the Internet in China is kind of amazing, right? I mean, it's still an amazing and in some ways, if you look at WeChat and just how incredible a product that is and that was born in a very restricted environment. I'm not praising Chinese restrictions, but I'm saying that I think entrepreneurs there, they know how to work around them and find kind of like the glimmers of opportunity in a very restricted environment. And I think cryptocurrency is very much the same way.
00:28:14.270 - 00:28:19.610, Speaker A: I want to learn more about that in a moment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:28:19.760 - 00:29:13.002, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy.

Back to my conversation with Emily Parker of LongHash. So you mentioned right before the commercial break that you see some parallels to the book that you wrote, which I'll just read out the title for People Now I Know Who My Comrades Are voices from the Internet Underground. And as you mentioned, it talks about how the Internet is changing life in China, Cuba and Russia.
00:30:58.490 - 00:31:04.160, Speaker A: So what parallels are you seeing to the development of crypto and the Internet in.
00:31:05.890 - 00:31:46.222, Speaker C: I mean, that very question is exactly what got me interested in cryptocurrency. It was kind of like, are there parallels here? And I think there are a lot of parallels in the way that the Internet and cryptocurrency are developing in mean I think the biggest parallel on the most macro level is that these are two examples of a decentralized technology that is very difficult for governments to control. This is true of the Internet, and this is true of know. And I think with the know, there are a lot of opinions about the Internet in China. I think right now a lot of people in the know see it in a very negative light. Oh, it's so censored, it's so restricted. Nothing is happening there.
00:31:46.222 - 00:32:35.886, Speaker C: I don't really agree with that. I mean, I think, yes, there is a lot of censorship, but I also think that there is also a lot of innovation and there's a lot happening on the Chinese Internet and there's a lot more happening there than ever would have happened in the period before the Internet. And I think the Internet in China has had a huge impact on just like a lot of people's individual lives. So the other thing about the Internet and I've sort of been saying this for years and I continue to say this despite censorship, despite restrictions, it is just not possible for any government really to completely control the flow of information on the Internet. It's a decentralized phenomenon, and it's just not possible to completely shut it down. And I think that's very true of cryptocurrency as well. And I don't think the Chinese government attempted to completely shut down cryptocurrency, but even if they had, I think it would be incredibly difficult.
00:32:35.886 - 00:33:13.494, Speaker C: So I think in some ways you can also compare kind of the way that authorities look at the Internet and look at crypto. I think in both cases, for example, Facebook, Twitter, these are all blocked in China, but with a little bit of effort, you can get to them. It's not like so hard. I mean, you get a virtual private network or whatever. But I think what the goal was was to kind of raise the barrier to entry, right? It wasn't to completely snuff all these things out. It was to say like, okay, we're just going to make it a little bit harder for you to do this. And the same holds true for cryptocurrency.
00:33:13.494 - 00:34:00.066, Speaker C: It's not like China was saying, we want to get rid of bitcoin entirely. They were raising the threshold. They were saying, like, okay, you need to kind of know a little more. You need to make a little bit more of an effort, because it was kind of at the point where just anybody was kind of getting involved in this market. So I think in both cases in china, if you want to go see Twitter, if you want to go trade bitcoin, you can, but it's just a little bit harder. You kind of have to try a little bit harder. But I think it's a very interesting phenomenon, because I think when china cracked down on cryptocurrency or on exchanges and ICOs specifically, there was kind of this feeling like, okay, is this the end? Like, bitcoin in theory, right, is supposed to be able to survive any kind of government repression.
00:34:00.066 - 00:34:28.740, Speaker C: But China was so important. I mean, china was such an important market. And I think there were questions at the time, like, can bitcoin survive Know? And not only did bitcoin survive, I mean, it thrived, right? I mean, that was kind of like we kind of entered a bull. So I think that was just sort of like a really strong example of like, no government can kill bitcoin. No one government can kill bitcoin. And I think that's true of the internet. As.
00:34:31.190 - 00:34:53.754, Speaker A: Know, I like, actually yeah, let me not ask the question that way. I was going to ascribe some kind of intention to the Chinese government, but let me just ask in know, obviously, the PBOC, the people's bank of China, is going to be releasing its own digital currency. So what impact do you think that will have on interest in crypto in Know?
00:34:53.792 - 00:35:41.062, Speaker C: It could go either way. I think it's a very similar conversation as to the one we're having about libra, right? So, I mean, I think there are people who would, you know, this is bad for bitcoin. It's going to kind of, like, replace it. But then there's the other side saying, well, not necessarily, because it might actually increase interest in cryptocurrency, increase awareness of digital currency. And also and this is my personal opinion, I think this is going to be such a different animal that I don't think someone who's inclined to use bitcoin is not going to be easily persuaded to use this instead. And you could even argue that it will make the case stronger for a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, because bitcoin is not controlled by a government. It is decentralized.
00:35:41.062 - 00:35:46.570, Speaker C: It has more privacy. So I think it's just like a completely different beast.
00:35:47.630 - 00:35:53.630, Speaker A: I wonder if it's going to drive interest in tether in China even, you know, that's interesting.
00:35:53.700 - 00:36:25.318, Speaker C: So we had a writer for LongHash wrote about this, and he know, kind of mentioned it, and he actually had a different interpretation. He said, well, maybe it will be good, because maybe it will be used instead of tether, maybe that will be the on ramp. I mean, who knows? But he seemed to think that maybe it would become an alternative. But who knows, right? There's still so much we don't know about this, and I really think it's very similar to libra, right? Like how will play out is really anyone's guess.
00:36:25.484 - 00:36:52.638, Speaker A: But I don't understand. I mean, if they're currently banned from trading Remnb into Bitcoin, then why would I just feel like then the government's incentive to allow people to turn Remnb into tether, which people know, which the government would have to know is being used to buy Bitcoin, that I just feel like the likelihood that they're going to allow people to do that is low. But I know nothing about the chinese government. You know way more than I do.
00:36:52.724 - 00:37:10.680, Speaker C: Well, anybody who would have expected any of this, I just really feel like it's anyone's guess. I think how that's going to play out is just impossible to predict. I think it's going to have a lot of interesting uses, but it's really hard to know.
00:37:11.290 - 00:37:30.380, Speaker A: All right, well, let's turn to japan since obviously that's also a market. You know really well in Japan, they suffered the largest crypto hack or crypto exchange hack of $500 million at coin check back in early 2018. And then obviously before that there was mount gox. So what is the atmosphere there like now?
00:37:30.910 - 00:38:12.294, Speaker C: Yeah, even in again, like two years, I think japan has undergone several different you know, when china initially kind of started cracking know, a lot of that energy went to Japan for sure. I mean, we kind of saw that there were reports about that. I mean, japan, it was like, this is japan's chance, right? This is japan is going to become the new crypto paradise. And japan was already heading in. That mean a you know, there is a really strong I spend a lot of time in tokyo. There's a very strong kind of crypto community know, there's mount gox. They have a long you know, satoshi nakamoto has a know, whether he or she is japanese or not is a whole other question.
00:38:12.294 - 00:38:58.226, Speaker C: But yeah, japan has kind of a relatively long affiliation with cryptocurrency. And I think know, at least the impression I had in 2017 was that the japanese policymakers kind of saw cryptocurrency as an opportunity. They saw it as an opportunity because FX trading is very strong in japan. I think a lot of those people are interested in crypto. I think there were even some people who thought like, okay, maybe this will be good for the economy. Japan had been battling deflation and economic stagnancy for a very long time, and I think there were some people who were like, maybe what do we have to lose? Let's try this. Let's see if this will stimulate consumption.
00:38:58.226 - 00:39:42.610, Speaker C: This will be kind of like a break for us. I think there was a little bit of that attitude. I think also Japan was thinking, like, okay, this is maybe our chance to become a fintech capital to attract startups here. So that was the mood that I was picking up kind of in 2017 of like, oh, this is kind of exciting, just the visuals you would go to. I think it was in Shibuya, and there was this huge Bitcoin ad, and you'd see them on the subways. I mean, it just it felt like and especially compared to China, right, it was like, okay, this is totally different, right? China is sending a signal of, like, we don't like this, and Japan is like, putting up billboards, and I mean, private companies are putting up billboards anyway, so that was the mood. And then, as you just said, early 2018 coin check is hacked.
00:39:42.610 - 00:40:15.754, Speaker C: Largest crypto exchange hack in history, over $500 million. And then basically things kind of ground to a halt. And I think this is one of those things that I don't know if that translated so clearly here in the United States. I don't know if people really knew that, because I felt like even after that happened, people were still kind of describing Japan as like a crypto. But, like, after that, it definitely was not. I think policymakers were super freaked out, and all of a sudden exchanges had to undergo a much more rigorous process. There were a lot of inspections.
00:40:15.754 - 00:41:09.090, Speaker C: It became very difficult to get a new coin listed in Japan. I think it was like, from that hack, it was like, at least 18 months for a new coin to be listed. So the mood in Japan after that hack was pretty dark. I think the media, which had been kind of positive about cryptocurrency, kind of became a lot more muted. And I think yeah, I think just average, ordinary Japanese people were more likely to see crypto as something that's shady and associated with criminal activity or hacks. So that's been the mood in Japan, and I think recently we're starting to see a little bit of a think, you know, I'm sensing a little bit more of optimism that the regulators will kind of loosen up and that there will be more activity in Japan. But yeah, there was a very big changes in Japan over the past two years.
00:41:09.090 - 00:41:59.490, Speaker C: But for example, Coincheck, when they were hacked, they were operating under a provisional license, and then they finally got, like, an actual license. So there has been some progress, and now they're one of the biggest exchanges in Japan. In Japan, if you look at, at least according to some data, if you look at which national currency is most traded against Bitcoin, number one is the US. Dollar, and number two is the so, you know, this it's still a pretty big important market there. So I don't mean I think, again, this could go either way. I mean, Japan definitely had a tightening, but they were also very ahead of the curve on the regulatory front, like early on. And so the question is, is this tightening just going to lead them to a better place where exchanges are more secure, or are they going to kind of go overboard? And I think I'd say the mood in Tokyo now is cautiously optimistic.
00:41:59.490 - 00:42:05.700, Speaker C: So we'll see. But it hasn't been very friendly for the past year or two.
00:42:06.230 - 00:42:22.214, Speaker A: And what about the entrepreneurs? In know, what you were discussing is kind of around the trading and the acceptance of Bitcoin as a national currency. But are you seeing that entrepreneurs there are kind of interested in getting into the space and building stuff?
00:42:22.412 - 00:42:55.566, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they definitely are. I mean, and this is something like our incubator. That's kind of what one of the things we do is try to help people get into the Japanese crypto space. But I think, again, it's a little bit slow. I mean, I think Japan still has a little bit of like a big company culture. I think that's changing for you know, I think that that's not necessarily as much of a crypto phenomenon as like a startup mean. I think just in Japan, in mean, I've been going back and forth to Japan for so many years, and I think the crypto environment there is vibrant.
00:42:55.566 - 00:43:22.140, Speaker C: I mean, there's definitely a lot of meetups you meet a lot of startups. But I do think that there were people who were freaked out or alarmed by the regulatory crackdown and just the difficulty, for example, of listing a coin on a Japanese exchange. So I think over the short term, some people probably have shied away from the Japanese market, but they could come think, you know, again, cautious optimism about the Japanese market.
00:43:22.910 - 00:43:49.654, Speaker A: And we kind of briefly touched on Singapore earlier when you were contrasting it with the regulatory climate here in the US. But I was curious to know, as we mentioned, Singapore is kind of a small country, somewhat small market. So what kind of activity are you seeing there? Is it literally just people being like, hey, this is a place where we can experiment? So is it just like a lot of entrepreneurs or who's going there and what are they doing?
00:43:49.852 - 00:44:24.400, Speaker C: Well, so as we saw, there were definitely a lot of ICOs. There definitely companies registering there. I mean, it's not uncommon where you see some company where they're in some whatever country, and then you see that they're actually registered in Singapore. You see that a lot. That's been going on for a while, I think just yeah, people who are kind of like building companies moving, there all sorts of activity happening. I mean, it just feels like even just on the conference level, it feels like there's blockchain conferences everywhere every second. But in Singapore, it feels like there's constantly something happening there.
00:44:24.400 - 00:44:55.260, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, Singapore just when you go there, you really feel that there's a lot of momentum. And I think in general, Singapore is kind of seen as kind of welcoming to innovation. I think the regulators in Singapore, you hear them talked about as being kind of like relatively welcoming, relatively open. You can kind of talk to them. And also, compared to the United States, the regulations you described as relatively clear. At least I've heard them described that way by the SEC and others.
00:44:55.950 - 00:45:03.854, Speaker A: So basically it sounds like we might continue to see sort of the ICO trend just live on in a place like Singapore or something like that.
00:45:04.052 - 00:45:06.320, Speaker C: Or the trend. Yeah.
00:45:08.610 - 00:45:26.514, Speaker A: Change change the you know, you did say earlier that Korea isn't know, one of your main areas of focus, but since you are in Asia a lot, I just wondered kind of what do you hear about what's going on in Korea and what that part of the crypto scene looks like?
00:45:26.712 - 00:46:14.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I guess my main impression of Korea, and I'm hesitant to riff on Korea only because I know sometimes these countries are so much more complicated than they look. So my impressions are fairly superficial, but my impression of Korea is just that. Yeah, it's a classic case of a real boom. It's a huge market. There was a huge boom there. A lot of people lost money, and I think the authorities got very nervous about there's. There's there's definitely that tension in Korea where the government is understandably concerned about speculation getting out of yeah, it's again, I don't want to kind of speculate too much about Korea because people know much more about it than I do.
00:46:14.710 - 00:46:34.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I could imagine so many people lost money there because not only was it that so many people in Korea were buying during the latter half of 2017 when the fever was at its pitch, but then on top of that, there was the Kimchi premium, so they were already paying higher than normal prices.
00:46:35.550 - 00:47:00.260, Speaker C: The one thing I do remember noticing about Korea was that again, in kind of like after the sort of the Chinese crackdown, korea was definitely sending mixed signals about what their attitude towards cryptocurrency could be. And there was a lot of confusion there about if these exchanges would be allowed to thrive or not. So I think there was definitely a lack of clarity, at least coming from them initially. I don't know if that's still the case.
00:47:01.190 - 00:47:09.778, Speaker A: And then you did mention that one of your other offices is in Hong Kong. What are your observations about the crypto scene there?
00:47:09.944 - 00:47:56.166, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny. I was asking a friend the other day about it. We had a piece on Long hash about Hong Kong, which was basically the basic argument know, Hong Kong is doing nothing on crypto regulation. And it's know, basically saying Hong Kong was pretty much hands off, and that's been great for crypto. You know, what's happening in Hong Kong now is kind of overshadowed by just all these other things that are happening in so it's kind of hard to talk about anything. I don't really know the status of anything in Hong Kong right now. But yeah, that was at know something that was kind of how we covered it is being pretty hands off and how that was a good thing.
00:47:56.166 - 00:48:01.030, Speaker C: I mean, obviously compared to mainland China, that's very different approach.
00:48:02.410 - 00:48:25.310, Speaker A: Yeah, which is basically why I think people in that country are having trouble and it's totally understandable why maybe the status of the crypto industry there is on hold right now because I think they're busy doing other things have much more important priorities.
00:48:25.890 - 00:48:36.420, Speaker C: Yes, that's exactly right. I actually asked a friend in Hong Kong just recently kind know oh, so what's the status of cryptocurrency there? And his attitude was kind of like really like we have so many other concerns right?
00:48:38.470 - 00:49:44.486, Speaker A: Yeah, actually well, it's sad. I really sympathize with them a lot. But speaking of which, one of the drivers of interest in crypto here, at least in the US, and I think some of the other places in the west, is this principle of decentralization, which obviously brings with it the inability for others to censor or surveil your transactions. Or maybe not the inability always, but at least on the surveillance side. But it makes it difficult. I don't know a ton about it, but obviously I do know that the stereotype at least or the common observation is that the villain that has a poor track record on these issues is the Chinese government. So I was just curious to know are concerns like that around decentralization or censorship or whatever or surveillance? Do those drive the Chinese at all? Are they kind of unhappy about having their transactions surveilled on Alipay and know.
00:49:44.508 - 00:50:57.630, Speaker C: It'S always so hard to speak generally about what's motivating anyone in China just a because there's so many people and know there's not a lot. Of public opinion polling on this kind of know, so I can only really talk about people know, spoken to or kind of my very anecdotal know. Look, I think there are plenty of people in China who are trading bitcoin because they like bitcoin and they like cryptocurrency, and I don't think they're thinking about more than that. Right. I mean, I think they're just trading it the way anybody else would trade it but of course to make money, you know, to make money or for whatever reason but not necessarily out of some larger mission. I think that's true all over the world, right? But yeah, I do think whether or not people are thinking of bitcoin specifically as okay, this is like an indirect opposition to some kind of regime. I don't know if they're thinking about it that way, but I do think bitcoin by its very nature, it's a currency that's not tied to that's not controlled by a bank, that's not controlled by the government it is a way of asserting your independence from the system to a certain degree.
00:50:57.630 - 00:51:31.000, Speaker C: I think some people probably think about that a lot. Maybe people think, like, okay, my money is safer here because my bank account can't be frozen and they can't just take it away. I mean, I think there's maybe some people that think that way. Again, I don't know how directly people make this connection, but I do think there is this idea that, yes, bitcoin, it's a form of independence. And in that sense, yeah, it's a form of asserting your autonomy from the system. I think people are very aware of that, for sure.
00:51:31.610 - 00:52:05.666, Speaker A: Right. I guess my question is just a little bit more like here. I feel like one of the kind of main populations, I guess, is the word, or amongst the different groups that are really interested in Bitcoin. One of the ones maybe that I would call out is like this libertarian type crowd, which is a little bit against government involvement. But I just wondered, was that like, a noticeable segment of the bitcoin enthusiasts in China?
00:52:05.858 - 00:52:34.940, Speaker C: They definitely exist? For sure. There are definitely crypto thought leaders in China who think this way, that, yes, this technology, I mean, again, grants them a kind of independence from the system, and they're thinking about that in a political way. How widespread that way of thinking is, I'm not sure, but I've definitely seen it and I've heard it. It's just hard to know the scale of it. And if most people are thinking that way, I don't know.
00:52:35.390 - 00:52:51.570, Speaker A: Okay. Oh, interesting. So then here we have libra potentially also being released. If that goes through, what impact do you think that will have on the crypto scene in Asia? And do you think it'll be competitive with the PBOC digital currency?
00:52:52.230 - 00:53:37.230, Speaker C: Well, I mean, it seems like China is super aware of libra, and it seems like that's part of their motivation for this digital currency. Right. I think they're more concerned about libra accelerating dollarization, and I think that's part so who knows, right? I mean, I think libra again, it's this really open question of whether libra will kind of serve as some sort of replacement to cryptocurrency, which I don't really think it will, or if it will actually stimulate and accelerate interest in cryptocurrency like bitcoin, which I think actually sometimes I think that's more likely. But how will play out in mean? China's made it very clear that they have concerns about know for mean, and I think that's what's in part what's driving.
00:53:38.210 - 00:54:12.160, Speaker A: And throughout this conversation, we've been talking about bitcoin a lot, but obviously we have kind of all of these smart contract platforms that are well, there's obviously Ethereum, which is dominant currently, and then there's a whole bunch of others that are trying to launch and maybe compete with Ethereum. And I wondered what your observations are about interest in smart contract platforms in China or elsewhere in Asia and kind of like what perceptions you have about which one of these is sort of like gaining more.
00:54:14.210 - 00:55:31.574, Speaker C: I mean just in mean I think that's a good question about Bitcoin versus just like all the other coins out. It definitely there's definitely different projects that are seen differently across the do you do still hear about I mean this is kind of a different example but like Gavin Wood, who's co founder of Ethereum and now is working on Polkadot and Polkadot, has done some work with LongHash and Polkadot. Gavin has been doing a lot of outreach in Asia. And one of the things he know, I saw him when he was in Shanghai, and I was kind of asking him his impressions of Shanghai, and he was saying that the Chinese sort of grassroots environment was really vibrant, and he seemed very impressed by kind of like, the crypto culture that he was seeing. Know, so it's like, I don't know, just in terms of other there's it depends a know, region to region. You hear a lot about XRP, for example, in Tokyo. I know it's a little different from the question you're asking, but yeah, I mean in terms of the pretty that's also very dynamic I think in terms of what coins people are looking at.
00:55:31.574 - 00:55:48.714, Speaker C: I know that Ethereum specifically was quite hot in Korea for a while. I think partly that at least was in part due to the fact that I think Vitalik himself had done some outreach there. But yeah, it's a constantly shifting yeah, yeah.
00:55:48.752 - 00:56:11.860, Speaker A: I think Vitalik spends a lot of time in Asia, although maybe a little bit less than anyone's did. So then my last question for you is just about actually the other half of the business, which you didn't really talk about a lot, but I was just curious to know more generally about the kinds of companies or projects that LongHash invests in and how separate that is from your media property.
00:56:12.310 - 00:56:58.690, Speaker C: Yeah, so philosophically it's united in the sense that we see both as like a gateway to Asia and our mission is united. But technically speaking they are separate in the sense that we don't use the media platform to promote the projects. I mean, we try to keep them separate just so that the media platform has kind of like independence because otherwise it would be seen as like PR and we really try to avoid doing that. So they're separate in that our and also our offices. It's a decentralized organization. So for example, like Singapore and Tokyo, singapore and Japan have slightly different approaches in Singapore. Singapore invests in and incubates early stage blockchain companies, kind of like highly technical blockchain companies, pretty wide range.
00:56:58.690 - 00:57:52.340, Speaker C: They put money in exchange for equity and our tokens. And then Singapore also has a twelve week program for mentorship and strategy and fundraising and most important, kind of like helping them break into the Asia market. Japan is a little bit different. Japan also helps kind of startups with BD in Asia or BD in Japan specifically, but also works with larger Japanese companies and kind of helping who are interested in blockchain and connecting them with startups who are developing blockchain applications. So the two offices are a little bit different. But again, the general approach is all like, because Asia, as you can see from this conversation, it's a confusing market. Different countries have different regulations, they have different approaches, and it can be kind of hard to go in there if you don't know what you're doing and if you don't know kind of like, who to deal with.
00:57:53.270 - 00:57:55.778, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. They sound really different.
00:57:55.944 - 00:58:08.998, Speaker C: Yeah, they sound really different. And again, constantly changing. And I think there's also a trust question right. Which is true in crypto everywhere. Right. It's like you just don't want to get involved with people who aren't trustworthy. Right.
00:58:08.998 - 00:58:15.450, Speaker C: Anywhere. This is true anywhere. But I think when you're going into a new market, you just want to make sure you have the right partners.
00:58:15.950 - 00:58:34.850, Speaker A: Yeah. I actually thought of one more question. It's a fun one. You guys recently came out with that deck of cards that had different crypto people. I know. And disclosure, you did give me a deck, which I was so grateful for. It's super fun to flip through.
00:58:34.850 - 00:58:39.730, Speaker A: So how did you guys come up with that idea? And why are you not selling those packs?
00:58:40.790 - 00:59:06.154, Speaker C: Yeah, this might not sound true, but it really was just for fun. It was just kind of like a fun thing we wanted to do. It's not supposed to be that serious. It's not supposed to be like, okay, these are the best people in blockchain. Of course it's not. It's just kind of like these are sort of it's very subjective. Just kind of like it was really just for fun.
00:59:06.154 - 00:59:26.686, Speaker C: It's like, let's just make a deck of cards. We put a wide range of people on there. Some of those people are not very like that's. Okay. It was more like, here are some people that are making noise in the blockchain industry, and here's a deck of cards with their faces on it. And we just put a lot of time into kind of making them sort of I think they look cool. And it's a deck of cards.
00:59:26.686 - 00:59:39.240, Speaker C: It's kind of like a collector's item. There wasn't any very high purpose to doing it. I mean, it was just sort of like, let's say, to capture a moment in time. That's what we're trying to do.
00:59:40.250 - 00:59:46.786, Speaker A: I love it. I love it. They're so great. All right, well, where can people learn more about you and LongHash?
