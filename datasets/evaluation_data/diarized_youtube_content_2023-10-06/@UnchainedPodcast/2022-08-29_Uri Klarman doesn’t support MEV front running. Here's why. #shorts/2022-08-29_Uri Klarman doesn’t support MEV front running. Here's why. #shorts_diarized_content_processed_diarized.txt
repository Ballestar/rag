00:00:00.250 - 00:00:10.240, Speaker UNK: You said that mev costs users 160,000 E per year. That's roughly $300 million. And about 50% of that is front running.
00:00:11.090 - 00:00:49.622, Speaker A: That's kind of like taking it from the immediate result of flashback was kind of like that effect. On the other hand, I think front running is bad. Okay? Basically, if a user make a transaction and somebody else come and this user gets worst trade, then the outcome is friction. It's not value, it's not economic activity. It's that me trying to buy 1000 E cost me, I don't know, 1.1 million rather than 1 million, okay? That kind of thing. And I'm trying to look for ways to capture all the good and the upside of the mev in the system.
00:00:49.622 - 00:00:54.540, Speaker A: Kind of figuring figuring that piece out without hurting the users, which is hard.
