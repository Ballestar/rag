00:01:34.246 - 00:01:35.530, Speaker A: Welcome, Mudit.
00:01:35.870 - 00:01:36.860, Speaker B: Hey everyone.
00:01:38.270 - 00:01:56.080, Speaker A: This week saw the largest exploit in DFI history. In fact, it was one of the biggest hacks in all of Crypto history in which an attacker was able to steal more than $600 million worth of coins from the cross chain protocol Polynetwork. Why don't you give us an overview of what happened here?
00:01:56.930 - 00:02:30.826, Speaker B: Yes, sure. So I'll start with the basics. The brief background about Polynetwork is that it is a cross blockchain application. It allows you to pass messages from one blockchain to another. One of their main product is a bridge between different blockchains. So if you have tokens on Ethereum, you can move them to BSE or numerous other blockchains that Polynetwork supports. The way this bridge works is that you lock tokens on one blockchain and then you can unlock them on other blockchains.
00:02:30.826 - 00:02:53.810, Speaker B: So it maintains a balance between locked and unlocked. What the hacker eventually managed to do is break this balance and unlock their tokens without locking any tokens in exchange. So they basically broke this balance and withdrew all tokens without having to lock their own tokens.
00:02:55.050 - 00:03:21.200, Speaker A: Wow, that is quite a simple actually attack to extract a huge amount of tokens. So, as you mentioned, Polynetwork is a cross chain network, but I did see a lot of crypto people and I myself also had not heard of Polynetwork before this moment. So can you tell us kind of how it is that it was know many of us had not heard of it.
00:03:21.570 - 00:03:53.830, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So firstly, this hack was actually relatively complex. There were a lot of steps involved. I'm just oversimplifying here in some sort, but it was indeed a complex hack. And the reason probably none of us have heard about Polynetwork is that their target audience is in China. I'm sure most of the Chinese users would have heard about it and probably used it, but outside China I don't think anyone really uses.
00:03:55.290 - 00:04:19.294, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And actually when I called it simple, what I meant was it's not like they had to hack keys, right? They ended up just kind of making their key the one that could give themselves the money. So in that sense it was, I guess sort of like almost like what you might call it, just kind of going around the normal route or something.
00:04:19.492 - 00:04:49.270, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. It was indeed a unique attack. It wasn't like your previous hacks in the DeFi space, which usually use something like flash loans, price manipulation and stuff like that. It was quite different, honestly. Polynetwork has quite a unique architecture from other protocols. So yes, the hack was also unique. The attacker managed to kick out the trusted parties from the system and replace them with their own malicious party.
00:04:49.270 - 00:04:58.860, Speaker B: They call it Keeper in their system. So once this key was replaced of the Keeper, the attacker was free to do anything they want.
00:04:59.550 - 00:05:15.618, Speaker A: Yeah. So just to actually break down the steps a little bit more, you kind of mentioned at the end you did give us the overview, but why don't you just walk us step by step what they did without obviously going into such technical details people won't be able to follow.
00:05:15.784 - 00:05:54.320, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I can start with some background about Polynetwork. Firstly, they have a concept of keepers. Keepers are trusted entities that sign messages that are then validated by the blockchain. So as we know, Ethereum can't directly talk to other blockchains like BSE. So we need an intermediary source that can validate messages that happened on Ethereum and tell BSE that it actually happened. And similarly, if something happens on BSE, these guys validate it and tell Ethereum that this actually happened.
00:05:54.320 - 00:06:57.170, Speaker B: This is the basic job of keepers. Now, as long as these keepers are trusted entities and they are not behaving maliciously, they will only verify actions that only actually happened. So if they sign a transaction of Ethereum, then that transaction must have already happened on Ethereum. They won't sign any transaction that hasn't yet happened. So with some background, the way Poly network passes messages around is that they have manager contract on every blockchain that once it receives signed data from the keepers, it verifies that the signature is correct. If the signature is correct, it assumes that the transaction actually happened on a different blockchain. It has no way to verify it apart from those signatures, that this transaction has already happened or not.
00:06:57.170 - 00:07:37.370, Speaker B: When the signature is given to it. It assumes that the transaction has happened and it rebroadcasts that transaction on the target chain on which the code is now running. So now this is the complete cycle of message passing transaction first happens on a source blockchain. The keepers sign it and then pass the data to the destination blockchain. And then the destination blockchain rebroadcasts this transaction. This means that anyone can make the manager contract on the destination blockchain. Basically rebroadcast almost any transaction.
00:07:37.370 - 00:08:20.694, Speaker B: They just do that transaction on a source blockchain. The keepers will verify it because the transaction has happened. And then the destination blockchain will also execute it. The manager and the destination blockchain will also execute it because this has happened. The security concern with this approach is that since anyone can make the destination chain, the destination manager contract, do anything, we should make sure that this contract has no special permission on anything. It does not hold any tokens, it is not an admin of any contract or anything like that. Otherwise, what can happen is, let's say I do a transaction on source blockchain, which is an admin action.
00:08:20.694 - 00:09:01.770, Speaker B: Obviously, I don't have those admin permissions, so it will fail on the source blockchain, but on the destination blockchain, since the transaction is done by the manager contract, not me. If the manager contract has these admin permissions, this transaction will actually go through rather than failing. And this is a problem. The transaction which was supposed to fail is not going through. And this is what the hacker exploited. They did a transaction on one of the blockchains that failed on that blockchain because they didn't have enough permissions. But it actually went fine on the destination blockchain because there it was executed by the manager rather than the user directly.
00:09:01.770 - 00:09:46.310, Speaker B: They used this transaction to replace the keepers in the system. Now, once the keepers were replaced, you could make the destination blockchain do any transaction you want. You don't even need to do that transaction on the source blockchain. The hacker basically created such false transactions, which did not happen on the source blockchain, but they still signed it with the keeper. They controlled the keeper now, so they can sign whatever they want. They signed these transactions which basically said that take all money out of the system and give it to the hacker. These wouldn't have happened on the original network because these can only be called by a specific permission contract.
00:09:46.310 - 00:10:13.550, Speaker B: And this contract is obviously not going to call these unless you lock your tokens. But since keepers can now sign anything that the hacker wants, they did sign these transactions. They broadcasted these on the destination chain. The destination chain verified the signature, the signatures were correct. And it let the hacker take all the money, withdraw all the money by unlocking these funds.
00:10:14.150 - 00:10:56.606, Speaker A: Yeah. And ultimately it ended up being $273,000,000 of Ethereum coins, coins, $253,000,000 worth of finance smart chain coins, and $85 million worth of USDC and then Tether. It also stole $33 million in Tether. But Tether the company ended up blacklisting those USDT. So there's a lot of twists that happened after the actual attack and we'll get to discussing those. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Do you love sports collectibles or fantasy sports?

Back to my conversation with Mudakupta.
00:12:06.130 - 00:12:29.290, Speaker A: So the exploit itself was pretty crazy, just especially the eye opening amount. But then after that, a number of twists happened. So first, let's start with a tweet from Slow Mist, which is, I guess like a security company or an audit company or something. So let me tell us what it is that SlowMist discovered.
00:12:30.510 - 00:12:38.400, Speaker B: Yes. So Slow Mist has been working on finding who the hacker is and what they did.
00:12:41.010 - 00:12:41.470, Speaker A: Since.
00:12:41.540 - 00:13:31.840, Speaker B: As soon as people knew that this hack happened, I assume they are working closely with Polynetwork and other entities. So they discovered that one of the wallets is linked to this hacker's account. And that wallet has done transactions on an exchange which requires users to go through KYC process. This means that there is a chance that the hacker messed up and actually used a KYC verified wallet, which will allow the agencies to actually know the identity of this hacker and get him in real life. So this was one of the slip ups by the hacker. The hacker later claims that they didn't slip up. Maybe they used fake KYC or a stolen account or something.
00:13:31.840 - 00:14:18.590, Speaker B: It's basically like we can't verify these claims. Either thing is possible. It's also possible it's their real identity or they are just making it up. So this was one of the things SlowMist discovered then. Slomist has also been working on finding the underlying root cause of this hack. I think they did two analysis brief one on the day of hack just a few hours later, which didn't contain many details, but it did give a brief overview and then recently they added a more detailed analysis where they went over a bit more details. So yeah, SlowMist has been working on finding who did this and then the.
00:14:18.660 - 00:14:28.754, Speaker A: Attacker began returning the majority of the tokens, at least as of by Thursday noon Eastern time. So how did that turn of events come about?
00:14:28.952 - 00:15:02.460, Speaker B: Yes, so by now I think about 50% of the tokens have been returned. There are two sides to the story. One, the hacker is claiming that they are white hat. They always intended to return these tokens. The only reason they hacked them, because they didn't trust that polynetwork team. If they disclose this bug bounty, then the polynetwork team will take proper actions and resolve this issue properly. They were scared that such a big amount might persuade the team themselves to run away with these funds or whatever.
00:15:02.460 - 00:16:01.230, Speaker B: So it's their claim that they actually saved the project, they actually saved the money of the users and now they are returning it. And since the project now is under limelight, the project will not run away with these funds or anything. But the other side of this story is that it is highly likely that Slow, Mist and other teams were narrowing down on the real identity of the hacker. This identity linked to exchange was one of the slip ups that the hacker did and some other stuff. So if these teams were getting closer and the hacker was realizing that so they might have changed their story, I believe their original motive was not to return these funds. The actions they took after immediately getting these funds, like they sent out a tip to a person who tried helping them launder these funds. They were talking about creating a dow trawling the polynetwork team and stuff.
00:16:01.230 - 00:17:04.738, Speaker B: All of these kind of actions are usually not done by white hackers, but people who have malicious intentions. That being said, it is hard to tell what the exact intentions of the hacker were, but I believe that they changed their motives once they realized that they can get into trouble if their identity is released. This is obviously a very large amount of money and people will do their best to grab hold of this person. In real life, even laundering such a large amount of money is very risky. So if they wanted to actually use these funds, they will have to go through a lot of risky hoops. And now they are trying to get a legit bug bounty reward in exchange for returning these funds. So they're negotiating the terms with the team right now, but I guess in the curtains they are saying maybe I return you 95% of the funds, you let me keep 5% and you don't take any legal actions or anything against me.
00:17:04.738 - 00:17:20.858, Speaker B: You announce this as a reward and give me legal money that I can legally use without any troubles. These negotiations are still going on. I guess they are negotiating the amount and the terms. But this is where the situation is right now.
00:17:21.024 - 00:17:38.480, Speaker A: Yeah, the whole thing just every twist and turn has been pretty crazy. One other aspect of this is that they've been broadcasting a bunch of messages through the blockchain. Can you talk about kind of how that conversation has been going and how that came about and why they're doing this?
00:17:39.010 - 00:18:14.042, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I think at the start it started out as something a bit cocky in some sense. They were teasing people, trawling the team and posting such comments when they also tipped a user who tried helping them launder money and stuff like that. So I think it started out as a nerfarious thing, chaotic, evil or some sort. But over time it has become a bit more neutral communication medium. Now they are actually doing Q and A's on the blockchain. I think they have done four till now.
00:18:14.042 - 00:18:55.080, Speaker B: People are asking them questions by sending them messages and they are answering those questions on the blockchain. They also use the blockchain to communicate with the polynetwork team. They posted address and they said encrypt messages with the public key of this account. They know the private key, so they can decrypt these messages. So they have established an encrypted medium of communication between them and the polynetwork team. These messages we can't decipher, we don't know what they are talking about. And similarly, different agencies that might be listening on will not be able to decipher these messages unless the polynetwork team decides to disclose this.
00:18:55.080 - 00:19:10.780, Speaker B: So now I believe these communication medium has become something quite useful. This is the only medium to talk to this hacker right now. So I think yeah, it's a very important bit.
00:19:11.470 - 00:20:18.340, Speaker A: Yeah, one thing I wanted to add was that tip that they sent to the person who said don't use your tether because it's blacklisted. The tip they sent was the amount of 1337, which is like this internet leap speak. And what leap speak is, is a way of using numbers to spell letters and words and so yeah, it's just kind of like a deepened internet culture thing and it sort of shows kind of maybe a little bit of the personality of the attacker. This attack just raises all kinds of questions because obviously Tether, which is a centralized company, was able to blacklist the tether. But then there were people, I think that maybe also were questioning whether Binance, because it has launched Binance smart chain or whether USDC could do anything about what happened with those coins. So what do you think happened there and should have happened there?
00:20:18.710 - 00:20:45.580, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So let's talk one by one. Tether actually responded quite quickly after the hack. They immediately blocked the balance. So that's great. USDC has similar functionality but I guess they were just a bit slower in reacting and the hacker had already deposited these tokens in curve by then. So even if USDC wanted to blacklist them, they wouldn't have been able to do it.
00:20:45.580 - 00:21:59.170, Speaker B: So props to Tether for reacting so quickly. But for other folks, I guess maybe somehow they need to improve their alerting monitoring system or something. As far as BSE goes, although BSE is relatively centralized as compared to other blockchains, but it's not centralized in a way that any single identity or entity can block this hacker from doing transactions. There are still two dozens validator on BSE and all of them will have to collude to block this person. And getting that sort of collusion is not easy in a short time frame. And even if it was possible for to, let's say, anyone to get that sort of arrangement on BSE, they wouldn't really want to do it. Because BSE is positioned as a chain that is free, that is censorship resistant, and if you take an action that blocks these hackers, it does not look good from Optics point of view from BSE's users.
00:22:00.070 - 00:22:14.120, Speaker A: Yeah, so as you mentioned, at this point, the attacker is negotiating with the Polynetwork team to keep 5% of the tokens as sort of like a bounty. What do you think the Polynetwork should do at this point?
00:22:15.050 - 00:23:17.434, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I think we can take a page from your traditional ransomware requests and stuff like that. So the suggested approach in these cases is to pay the ransom whatever the demand is, get your product back, get as much of funds secured as possible, and once that has happened, then you can continue taking all those legal actions and whatever you were originally planning on taking. So even if right now polynetwork agrees to a settlement with the user, this settlement, like if they wanted to pursue a legal action at a later date, this settlement won't matter. What this person did will likely be treated as illegal in most jurisdictions. Now, I'm not a lawyer, but these are my views. So whatever Polynetwork agrees to right now will not really be considered as a final agreement in the codes and all.
00:23:17.434 - 00:24:03.850, Speaker B: So right now the strategy for Polynetwork should be to secure as many funds as possible and then decide if they should continue pursuing other means of getting to this user. If the amount remain, like if the hacker agrees that they'll keep a bug bounty of like one hundred K dollars or something and return everything else, then I think it makes sense to not take any further actions. The hacker probably deserve those 100K. But if the hacker is saying that I want to keep $10 million, I think 10 million might also be fine. But let's say they are saying 100 million. They have returned 50% of the funds now, so they still have 300 million left. If they are saying they want to keep anywhere between 100 to 300 then I think that is not really justified.
00:24:03.850 - 00:24:14.110, Speaker B: For now, the polynetwork team should give into these demands but still consider options of taking these traditional legal methods.
00:24:14.610 - 00:24:18.670, Speaker A: Yeah, but what is the typical amount for bounty?
00:24:19.330 - 00:25:05.710, Speaker B: The traditionally accepted value for critical bots like these is 10% of the amount hacked. So adverse, you should be giving this was a 600 million hack, so you should at most be giving 60 million to the user. But I personally feel that this amount should be decaying as the amount at risk increases. So if the hack amount was $1 million, then maybe 10%, 100 and k is justified. But for such large amounts like 600 m, I don't think 10% is justified. Even like a million dollar bug, bounty is a life changing amount and I think it's a fair amount for this hack.
00:25:06.130 - 00:25:17.650, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree with that, but we'll see what happens. All right, well, this has been such a fascinating discussion. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.

First headline the infrastructure bill saga ends at the beginning.
00:26:15.410 - 00:27:15.586, Speaker A: On Tuesday, the senate passed its infrastructure bill, voting 69 to 30 to invest $1.2 trillion into the country's public works to the crypto industry's chagrin. However, the bill moved out of the senate without changing a certain provision regarding crypto taxation despite multiple amendments being offered as a refresher. The original and final language requires reporting for crypto brokers in order to bring in $28 billion in taxes over the next few years. The provision mandates crypto brokers report customer gains via 1099 and any transactions over $10,000 to the internal revenue service. While the community does not object to appropriate entities being taxed, the provision received vociferous backlash over its broad definition of a crypto broker. Kristen Smith, executive director of the blockchain association, interpreted the bill to encompass, quote, software wallet developers, hardware wallet manufacturers, multi SIG, service providers, liquidity providers, dao, token holders, and potentially even miners as brokers.
00:27:15.586 - 00:28:08.838, Speaker A: Under the current iteration of the bill, such a requirement would force pseudonymous decentralized protocols to collect and enforce know your customer or KYC information an impossible task. Senators proposed multiple amendments, though none gained the support necessary. Notably on Monday morning, a last ditch compromise between Senators Cynthia Lemmis, Pat Toomey, Mark Warner, Rob Portman and Kirsten Sinema to amend. The contentious language fell just short of approval, courtesy of a single objection from Senator Richard Shelby. The infrastructure package is now on its way to the House of Representatives with the crypto provision's original language intact. However, the crypto industry nor the House will be taken by surprise this time around. Coin center's Jerry Brito is ready to make a brand new amendment, tweeting, the bad news is that the amendment did not receive consent, so it will not make the bill.
00:28:08.838 - 00:28:57.174, Speaker A: The good news is we're not giving up. Next up is the House, where we can try to get a whole new amendment from scratch that can address all our concerns. Four members of the House's Blockchain Caucus are also prepared for another round of crypto policy debates, with Representatives Tom Emmer, Darren Soto, Bill Foster and David Schweikert pending a letter to their colleagues noting, quote we must prioritize amending this language to clearly exempt non custodial blockchain intermediaries and ensure that civil liberties are protected. On Thursday, Representative Anna Eshu also joined the fray, penning a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi encouraging an amendment to the problematic broker definition. Next headline on Coinbase ETH flipped. BTC Coinbase announced its second quarter results on Tuesday. Here are three things you need to know at $1.6
00:28:57.174 - 00:29:31.250, Speaker A: billion, q Two profit nearly doubled that of Q One. Total revenue also outperformed expectations coming in at $2.3 billion, compared to the $1.88 billion predicted by the analyst consensus compiled by Bloomberg. Second, Coinbase users were very active this quarter, with monthly transacting users growing 44% from Q One to Q Two. Its total user base also jumped, climbing to 68 million verified customers .3 coinbase also saw Ethereum flip Bitcoin this quarter, at least in terms of trading volume in Q Two.
00:29:31.250 - 00:30:18.766, Speaker A: Ethereum made up 26% of the exchange's volume, while bitcoin only held a 24% share. Additionally, in an earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong said that 10% of the top 100 hedge funds by assets under management are Coinbase clients. The exchange also mentioned SpaceX, Tesla and PNC Bank specifically as institutional clients, marking the first public acknowledgement of a Tesla Coinbase relationship. Next headline. Brian Brooks resigns as CEO of binance US. Last Friday, Brian Brooks dropped a bombshell via twitter announcing his resignation as CEO of binance us. After just a few months on the job, he wrote, quote, Greetings, crypto community, letting you all know that I have resigned as CEO of Binance US despite differences over strategic direction.
00:30:18.766 - 00:30:48.406, Speaker A: I wish my former colleagues much success. Exciting new things to come. Before his short tenure with Binance US, Brooks was the acting head of the Office of the Controller of the Currency, the regulator for national banks under President Trump. He also worked as Coinbase's top lawyer in 2018. It initially appeared that Brooks's impressive regulatory resume was a perfect match for finance, which has faced intense scrutiny from jurisdictions like the UK. And Japan. In 2021, his hiring was even considered a steal.
00:30:48.406 - 00:31:45.790, Speaker A: That ruffled feathers over at Circle, where Brooks had been on the cusp of accepting a position as president before abruptly moving over to Binance US. As described by Decrypt's Jeff Roberts in a July report in response to Brooks's departure, Binance CEO Cheng Peng Zhao wished him the best in the future and thanked him for his invaluable work a divergence from the exchange's handling of Brooks's predecessor, Catherine Coley, who was not even mentioned after being ousted to make room for Brooks. Next Headline Tether Reveals Reserve Details On Monday, Tether released a new Attestation revealing the details of its $62.8 billion in reserves for the world to parse. This is Tether's second reserves report since launching in 2014, prompted by a settlement with the New York Attorney General's Office earlier this year. CNBC's Kate Rooney tweeted out a simple description, writing Tether out with new audit on what's backing the stablecoin. Mostly commercial paper.
