00:00:00.170 - 00:00:55.020, Speaker A: I am sure that if he had wanted to plead guilty, I doubt very much that the government would have been interested in letting him cooperate because he is, so to speak, the kingpin. When the government lets somebody cooperate that is, plead guilty and testify against others to get a reduction or leniency at sentencing. Typically the government wants to get somebody in the middle or the bottom and cooperate them up against somebody higher up in the food chain. Of I don't think there's anybody above SBF. We could have a discussion about whether he maybe knows things about others who would be peers of his in the industry, but I doubt the government was interested in his cooperation. Would they have let him plead guilty just to have some reduction in sentence exposure for the certainty of a conviction? They probably would have, but I expect they would have wanted a very stiff plea. And I think SBF, as some defendants do, they take the position, I didn't do anything wrong, I didn't act with intent to.
