00:00:00.730 - 00:00:30.882, Speaker A: Gary's might be facing the loss at Grayscale, and he's focused on all these lawsuits. They're all on altcoins or things that he's claiming to be securities for the most part. The one thing he said, which you've covered extensively, is bitcoin is not a security. Even though he said in the past that ethereum is not a security. The SEC has said it in the past, he won't say it now. The one thing he's admitted unwaveringly is, yes, we we don't think bitcoin is a security. So if he's going to give ground anywhere, it might be on bitcoin.
00:00:30.882 - 00:00:57.530, Speaker A: Right? And Coinbase, they're not accusing them of fraud or these other things. They're accusing them of operating an unregistered securities exchange because they're claiming these tokens to be securities, which is regulation via enforcement, and you've covered that a bunch. But all these areas mean, like, if he's going to give anywhere, it might be on a bitcoin ETF. And also, if he can then find a way to approve of these things before being handed a negative decision from the courts, maybe this is the way to do it. Because he can say, look, there is a way to approve a spot bitcoin ETF.
