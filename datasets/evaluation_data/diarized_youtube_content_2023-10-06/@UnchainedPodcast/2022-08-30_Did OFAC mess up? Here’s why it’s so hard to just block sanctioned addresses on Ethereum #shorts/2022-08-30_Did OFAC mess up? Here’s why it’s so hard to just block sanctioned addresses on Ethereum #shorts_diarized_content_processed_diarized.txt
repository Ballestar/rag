00:00:00.250 - 00:00:50.700, Speaker A: Even the first option you mentioned kind of quote unquote, just blocking the addresses. Even that is technically far from trivial because what is relatively easy is kind of to see if you see a transaction, you can relatively easy see it has a from and it has a two. However, the two can very well be a smart contract and you don't know what this contract will do and it's absolutely not trivial to figure out in advance what this contract will do. So it's possible that you see kind of the from is fine, the two is fine, but then the two is a contract and it executes some complicated logic and it calls another contract and calls another contract and eventually this other contract then finally calls or sends money to sanctioned address.
