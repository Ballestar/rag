00:00:04.010 - 00:00:31.302, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Super excited to bring you the first ever podcast interview with two representatives from Local Bitcoins. I spoke with them at the Oslo Freedom Forum last week. Just a quick heads up that after we recorded, Local Bitcoins announced that the company had to remove local cash ads due to regulations concerning money laundering and terrorist financing. I emailed them to see if they had additional commentary, but they only referred me to the Twitter notice that they posted, which I'll link to in the show notes. Other than that, enjoy the show.
00:00:31.436 - 00:00:43.174, Speaker B: Are you ready for global cryptocurrency money laundering regulations? Cybertrade secures the crypto economy with powerful AML tools for exchanges, crypto businesses and regulators.
00:00:43.302 - 00:01:10.834, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Unconfirmed, the podcast that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon. I'm your host, Laura Shin. If you haven't yet signed up for the Crypto workshop, meltem Demure's of CoinShares and Jalak Jovan Prucha of Future Perfect Ventures and I are all teaching at Omega Institute in September.

00:01:10.834 - 00:01:27.990, Speaker A: To sign up, here's a pause for the ads. Greetings from the Oslo Freedom Forum. Today's guests are Vera Xavier, local Bitcoins community manager, and Elena Torion, chief customer success officer. Welcome, Veruska and Elena.
00:01:28.330 - 00:01:31.222, Speaker C: Thank you, Laura. It's really, really good to be here.
00:01:31.276 - 00:01:34.066, Speaker D: Yeah, we're very excited to be here.
00:01:34.108 - 00:01:47.360, Speaker A: So I think Local Bitcoins is one of the less visible companies in the industry, especially to those who mostly engage with crypto through bigger brands like Coinbase or Binance. Elena, why don't you tell us what Local Bitcoins does?
00:01:48.290 - 00:02:54.398, Speaker C: Yeah, so Local Bitcoins is a peer to peer trading platform and I would really like to go back in history and tell you how we got started and how it developed within time. So, back in 2012, there were only few companies which were offering this kind of service where you could buy bitcoin from your local dealer, you would be able to make an exchange. And at the time, our founder, Jeremias, he was checking out some of the services that were available and somehow, I suppose, he didn't find them convenient enough. And he thought that, why don't I code a website on my own? And so he coded one, the simple version of it within two weeks, and to his surprise, people really started to sign up. So it was something that people really wanted and there was genuine interest towards that. So at the time, a company wasn't profitable because there was no business model behind it. I think it was just ideology.
00:02:54.398 - 00:03:36.718, Speaker C: But in 2013, we enabled this escrow model and that's when the company became successful. And I will briefly explain how it all works. Escrow is pretty much the service we provide. It's when sellers come to our website and post an ad that they want to sell their bitcoins. Then buyers can search through the listings available, choosing the payment methods they want and connect with the seller. And so the trade starts the moment you press start a trade, it's all on. And then depending on the payment method you have chosen, usually the trade is quite fast.
00:03:36.718 - 00:04:19.374, Speaker C: Generally I think it takes a few minutes to complete it. But the basic idea is that when seller receives the payment, he just presses that payment received release in the bitcoins and bitcoins are going to the buyer's wallet. And local bitcoins takes 1% fee from all the successful trades and the fees are paid once and only by the advertiser. And that is pretty much how our business model works. Yeah, I suppose that's what we do. And obviously at the time when it started, it was one man's company. When I personally joined, it was in 2014, it was maybe five people.
00:04:19.374 - 00:04:48.562, Speaker C: And still until now, we are very small and even though we have many users, we are still a team of 35 people in a small Helsinki office. Well, small I guess, compared to other bigger exchanges. But yeah, I think we were trying to make it really easy and simple to connect people to exchange and we succeeded and I suppose that's how it became somewhat successful.
00:04:48.706 - 00:05:00.140, Speaker A: I love that story. That's a great story. And Zeta, can you tell us how many users you've had across all time and how many you typically have maybe in a month or who your typical users are?
00:05:00.450 - 00:05:18.146, Speaker D: I think we have around 3000 to 4000 new users registering every day and around half a million of them are active per month. So we do have lots of people using the platform regularly at about, I.
00:05:18.168 - 00:05:27.650, Speaker C: Think, depending on the day because weekends are a bit less active. So I suppose it's from 40 to 50,000 successful trades per day.
00:05:27.800 - 00:05:39.046, Speaker A: Oh, wow. And I also saw on the site you're in 248 countries and in 16,626 cities around the world. So pretty big presence for kind of.
00:05:39.068 - 00:05:40.818, Speaker C: A small company like this.
00:05:40.924 - 00:05:59.710, Speaker A: And for just I like how it's just sort of started as this guy's idea and then it sort of just grew into a company. I also actually just wanted to circle back what you were saying about the Escrow. So how does that work exactly? Is that something where you have to trust the app or is it kind of more like a smart contract type?
00:05:59.860 - 00:06:40.310, Speaker C: So Escrow is pretty much this safe place where bitcoins are locked. So from seller's wallet we automatically take those bitcoins to this safe place called Escrow and they are locked there until seller himself says that payment received, I'm releasing. And of course, there are situations when a buyer and seller cannot come to agreement that I didn't receive the payment or I mean, there are multiple situations like that, and that's actually where our team comes in and helps out to investigate this situation and to make a fair decision on who is getting the bitcoins from the escrow.
00:06:40.390 - 00:06:43.786, Speaker D: So I guess it qualifies as the smart contract concept.
00:06:43.818 - 00:06:48.560, Speaker A: Oh, I see. But you guys are the Arbiters, so it's not like they're okay. Oh, interesting.
00:06:50.130 - 00:07:16.342, Speaker C: I'm sorry to interrupt, but to go a little bit forward with that, obviously, in any complex situation, we enable different departments to participate, to make a fair decision, and that includes our fraud department and our lawyers. So we will have all the opportunities to make a fair call on all the disputes that happen on our side.
00:07:16.476 - 00:07:26.090, Speaker D: But considering the trading volume that we have, there are very few cases proportionally that demand or intervention.
00:07:26.430 - 00:07:27.180, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:28.910 - 00:08:01.334, Speaker C: Yeah. From, let's say, 50,000 trades, about 1000 trades are being disputed and 70% of those get resolved by itself without us even opening that dispute yet. So it happens. So that one party is impatient and he's saying, I didn't receive the payment, let's start a dispute, and then after five minutes the payment appears. So it goes without us noticing. So I would say it's a very small amount of disputes that actually happen, considering the amount of successful trades we have.
00:08:01.532 - 00:08:03.938, Speaker A: So who are your typical users?
00:08:04.114 - 00:08:53.240, Speaker D: I would say that we have a few categories of typical users. There is the tech enthusiast who is using Bitcoin for quite a while because he is interested in Bitcoin as a currency, but also as an investment. And there are other people who use Bitcoin trading to make profit. So yeah, the so called day traders who are watching the ups and downs of the Bitcoin price and making the most out of it. And there are also the people who are using Bitcoin because it has become a necessity in their day to day. And that's very like, how would I say that's? Very regional phenomenon. Yeah, it varies a lot from country to country.
00:08:53.240 - 00:08:59.626, Speaker D: What is the profile of the user from that area and what are some.
00:08:59.648 - 00:09:06.890, Speaker A: Of those regions that are kind of having economic difficulty that see a lot of local Bitcoins activity?
00:09:07.310 - 00:09:59.238, Speaker D: Well, yes, we were chatting with Elena before this interview and we were saying that it's a known phenomenon in the support group that when we notice in a typical increase in trading volume in a certain country, the reasons behind it are usually some kind of political or economical unstability. So it's usually in the developing countries where we see these typical spikes in trading volume. So we have the most famous case, and the most recent one is the Venezuela increase in trading volume. But there are also other South American countries who have a very similar trade volume graph like this, very sharp increase in the recent months, like Argentina, Colombia and Peru.
00:09:59.414 - 00:10:33.286, Speaker C: Also, I would say that we see quite a lot of increase in Russia as well. I'm not sure if the reason is economical, unstability. But it's a fact that it's so easy to get your bank account closed in Russia that maybe, possibly people don't have the trust in it anymore and they want to have this backup option to move their money if they need to, to make financial transactions in some other way that it's available for them.
00:10:33.388 - 00:10:45.258, Speaker D: So, yes, they use bitcoin to maintain control of their own wealth, but also as a store of value. In the case of Venezuela, where the local currency is much more volatile than bitcoin itself.
00:10:45.424 - 00:10:55.978, Speaker A: Yeah, and I saw a graphic that showed actually, that there's a really high concentration of buyers and sellers in the US. And so that doesn't really is that actually one of the profiles for the trading?
00:10:56.154 - 00:11:43.930, Speaker D: Yes. Geographically speaking, I would divide our users between the developing country users and the developed country users, because the developed country users have a very different purpose in trading. Those are usually the tech enthusiasts, the people who are doing the day trading. They are doing the profit driven trading, the users who are coming from the EU area, from the UK, from the US. But actually, there is a very interesting phenomenon also that in African countries, bitcoin trading has become like an important source of extra income. So we have these quite significant markets in Kenya and Nigeria, for instance.
00:11:44.270 - 00:11:54.526, Speaker A: Oh, wow, that's really interesting. I had not heard of that. All right, so we're going to discuss how local Bitcoins can be used for human rights in a moment. But first, a quick word from our fabulous sponsors.
00:11:54.638 - 00:12:28.550, Speaker B: Ready or not, the Financial Action Task Force anti money laundering recommendations soon go into effect globally.

00:12:28.710 - 00:12:41.358, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Elena and Verda of local bitcoins. So, out of curiosity, why does local Bitcoins keep such a low profile? Like, I haven't seen a lot of media on you guys or anything like that.
00:12:41.524 - 00:12:43.730, Speaker D: I blame the fact that we are finished.
00:12:44.150 - 00:13:09.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a choice and it's nothing that is part of our strategy or has ever been discussed, but I think we have a team of introverted people and we're actually comfortable with keeping maybe low profile and no one has that strong interest on being active. I suppose that's one of the reasons, but that may change over time.
00:13:09.930 - 00:13:28.462, Speaker D: I also believe that it has a lot to do with the fact that we haven't so far needed to be much out there. Local Bitcoin has never had any kind of explicit marketing strategy. Our growth has been basically organically driven. People who need the service just find.
00:13:28.516 - 00:13:31.006, Speaker A: Us, well, just like through word of.
00:13:31.028 - 00:13:32.990, Speaker D: Mouth, or word of mouth mostly.
00:13:33.570 - 00:14:05.318, Speaker C: Well, I think it's just that we are one of the biggest exchanges and since we are one of the only ones who survived, there is a lot of trust towards our company and our brand. And probably word of the mouth is one of the factors and the fact that you don't want to right away jump and trust any new service that comes along if there is local bitcoins who has a history of being rather a stable company. So I suppose in an industry like this, trust plays very big role.
00:14:05.494 - 00:14:43.720, Speaker A: All right, so we kind of started to talk about how this service is used in developing countries or actually ones where they're seeing economic instability. But here, obviously at the Oslo Freedom forum, we've had a number of panels that talked about different ways that bitcoin could be used, for instance, combat the surveillance state. How do you see local bitcoins being used in countries with authoritarian regimes or political instability? Is it literally just that you see more transactions or is there anything else you can tell us about the patterns of usage of buying and selling that are different?
00:14:44.890 - 00:15:56.000, Speaker D: That's an interesting question because the way that we recognize the patterns in the user behavior is through seeing many times the same kind of behavior in the user profiles and in the queries that we get in customer support. So it's not as if we are keeping track of the number of transactions. But I think that well, yeah, because we provide both the web wallet service and the marketplace, our platform ends up being used a lot, both as a way to get the coin moving across borders and also as a way to cash out the bitcoin. So I think that that's very convenient for the people who, for instance, need to send money back to their families. They get to do everything in the same service. They don't need to move the coin around. That's the most usual way that we identify that this user group is using local bitcoins for probably a political or economical reason of their country.
00:15:56.000 - 00:16:11.646, Speaker D: The other ones we know because we have heard about the situation of the country in other ways, but it's not something that we can spot so easily through the user behavior in the platform. It's not so explicit.
00:16:11.838 - 00:16:20.034, Speaker A: But actually what you described, is it that you're seeing people purchase in one geography or jurisdiction and then they cash out in another one?
00:16:20.072 - 00:16:32.474, Speaker D: Is that what you yes, there are lots of people who are, for instance, located in Venezuela, but they are trading with USD, so we can see that they are using bitcoin as a way of converting oh, wow.
00:16:32.512 - 00:16:37.686, Speaker A: Like they're storing their money in USD and then in order to get boulevards, they move it through bitcoin and that's.
00:16:37.718 - 00:16:38.874, Speaker D: Probably how it works.
00:16:38.992 - 00:16:48.640, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. So speaking of kind of these troubled geographies, I did notice recently that local bitcoin stopped service in Iran. Why?
00:16:49.890 - 00:17:40.126, Speaker C: Well obviously right now there are quite many regulations coming. So the industry is getting regulated and there is a lot of gray area and one of our top priorities currently is compliance. Even though we're a company acting under Finnish law, we have users from all over the world and sometimes for some reasons, for some regulatory reasons, we might stop service in certain countries. And I suppose I would not be able to give any more comments on this since it's a bit of out of scope of my responsibilities. But I think the main point is that we are definitely doing our best and cooperating with authorities all over the.
00:17:40.148 - 00:18:11.882, Speaker A: World and also in the US. Recently a few local bitcoin sellers have received prison sentences for not registering as money services businesses and then Finzen, the financial crimes enforcement network recently released a report saying that local bitcoins businesses would need to register in that way. So how does that affect your sellers and businesses in the US? Are many of them contacting you about this or are they concerned or are you seeing it change any of the patterns there?
00:18:11.936 - 00:18:37.380, Speaker C: I would say that currently we don't get any reports or questions regarding those. I suppose almost all our users, they are very knowledgeable in those topics because if you are trading bitcoin then you want to probably know everything about it. So I think a lot of them do the research on their own and hence there is no need to ask for further information.
00:18:38.710 - 00:19:02.060, Speaker D: But mostly local bitcoins, we are a Finnish company, we respond to the Finnish authorities and it's the responsibility of each user to comply with the regulations of their own countries. So yes, when it comes to registration of an individual vendor with their local authorities, there is just so much that local bitcoins can assist with.
00:19:03.950 - 00:19:18.174, Speaker A: My next question for you was actually how you deal with so many different legal jurisdictions, but it sounds like it's more that your service is there and then it's up to each individual seller on the platform to comply with whatever their local laws are.
00:19:18.372 - 00:19:35.518, Speaker D: Yes, there are those cases and there are also the cases when local bitcoins has to respond as a company. But those kind of requests come directly to us. What the user doesn't need to do, then he doesn't hear about it. It comes directly to us.
00:19:35.704 - 00:19:54.938, Speaker C: Okay, but as a company we definitely prioritize the fact that if there is a legislation coming and we need to take steps forward to stay active in certain countries, then we are cooperating and doing our best to do so.
00:19:55.104 - 00:20:00.942, Speaker A: So what's next for local bitcoins? What are you working on or what new products or services are you planning to roll out?
00:20:01.076 - 00:20:49.446, Speaker C: It's interesting because so far the core business has been so important to us because I think the main goal for us was to or the mission more like to make bitcoin liquid and just to make it easy and possible to exchange bitcoins everywhere in the world. So that hasn't changed. And for now, we're still going to concentrate on our core business, but definitely we are seeing that the future can be different and we might present different services or products, but so far there is nothing certain. So unfortunately, I cannot bring any big news yet, but we will definitely be working in that direction.
00:20:49.558 - 00:20:51.226, Speaker A: Okay. And maybe at that time I'll have.
00:20:51.248 - 00:20:53.590, Speaker C: You guys back, hopefully.
00:20:53.750 - 00:20:57.242, Speaker A: All right, well, it's been great having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
