00:02:27.334 - 00:02:31.870, Speaker A: However, once the votes were submitted, the team figured out that the bug also.

00:03:32.938 - 00:03:34.666, Speaker A: Limits in the code to protect your.
00:03:34.708 - 00:03:36.866, Speaker B: Users, putting an escape hatch in the.
00:03:36.888 - 00:03:46.366, Speaker A: Code to protect your users. All of this is worth a read for his explanation of also why this was a Ponzi game in which, as.
00:03:46.408 - 00:03:48.706, Speaker B: He puts it, quote, the first farmers.
