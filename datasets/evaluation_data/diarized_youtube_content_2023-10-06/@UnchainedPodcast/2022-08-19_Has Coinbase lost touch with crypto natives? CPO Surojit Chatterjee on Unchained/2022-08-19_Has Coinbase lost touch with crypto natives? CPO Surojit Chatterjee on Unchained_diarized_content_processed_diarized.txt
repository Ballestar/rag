00:00:00.410 - 00:00:38.418, Speaker A: One other area that I wanted to ask about, which was also perceived as a miss by Coinbase was the Degen trilogy. When you released part one of it, people were responding. Things like the SEC should be investigating this for illegally inducing. You know, Nick Tamena also mentioned this in his tweet. There's a perception that Coinbase has lost its touch with the crypto native part of the community, or frankly doesn't even even really have people like that on its staff anymore. Whereas obviously in its earlier years, it was more kind of on the cutting edge. So how do you get that back? Or even if you're going to say to me, you haven't lost it, then how do you change that perception?
00:00:38.594 - 00:01:02.080, Speaker B: Again, I'll say we try lots of different things. So this is something our marketing team tried. Some things are more successful than others. When we tried our Super Bowl ad, for example, I think Djns loved it. Crypto Forward folks really loved it. And it was a unique concept. This was probably didn't hit the mark quite for some people.
00:01:02.080 - 00:01:36.390, Speaker B: We understand that. We take the feedback and we'll go and try other things. But I think it's not true that we don't have Crypto Forward folks in Coinbase today. I think if you look at the innovation we are churning out, it would not be possible without crypto for folks. We are the first company I just talked about building this very unique MPC based wallet, right? A semi custodial wallet. I don't know if you follow Pete Kim or others. He has talked about it.
00:01:36.390 - 00:01:56.138, Speaker B: He's one of the engineers I respect a lot. There are many other people like that. We are building this interoperability bridges between multiple blockchains that would not be possible without people knowing crypto very deeply and being embedded into the ecosystem.
