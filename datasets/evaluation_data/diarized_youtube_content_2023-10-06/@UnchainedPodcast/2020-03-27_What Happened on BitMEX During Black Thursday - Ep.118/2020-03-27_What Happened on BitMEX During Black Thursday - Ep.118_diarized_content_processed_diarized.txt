00:01:13.134 - 00:01:15.010, Speaker C: Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:01:15.160 - 00:01:17.366, Speaker A: You wrote an analysis this week of.
00:01:17.388 - 00:01:20.294, Speaker B: The BitMEX liquidation spiral that occurred on.
00:01:20.332 - 00:01:38.634, Speaker A: Black Thursday, March 12. I actually covered this in an interview with Kyle Simani on my other podcast unchained earlier this week, but I thought that your post had some additional insights over what is the largest bitcoin price drop since the Mount Gox implosion. Give us an overview of what happened.
00:01:38.672 - 00:01:40.700, Speaker B: At BitMEX a couple of weeks ago.
00:01:41.150 - 00:02:38.510, Speaker C: Yeah, so, BitMEX, you know, it's a derivatives platform that allows people to trade with high leverage on bitcoin. And we also had this pandemic going on in the world, and some people decided to sell bitcoin and quite a lot of it. And it triggered a sort of vicious cycle as more people sold bitcoin. People that were trading on BitMEX with leverage got what you call liquidated, which basically amplified this cycle. And it all ended up somewhat dramatically as the bitnex platform experienced some issue, which turned out to be a sort of intentional attack, which stopped this huge drop on Black Thursday. So I spent a bit of time last week looking at exactly what happened and also looking at the deeper consequences of this event. It's not only that the price dropped, but it left an impact on the market structure on bitcoin, on both beatmax, but also outside of BitMax.
00:02:39.650 - 00:03:17.542, Speaker A: Yeah. And for listeners who didn't listen to my episode with Kyle, you should definitely check that out because he talks a lot about some of the triggers of the first price drop and then why there was a second one about 12 hours later. One thing I do want to mention is that at the time we recorded, I was not aware about the DDoS attack on BitMEX, which is something that Antoine wrote about. So we'll dive more into that. But before we do that, Antoine, in your post you wrote that BitMEX's perpetual inverse swap is critical to bitcoin's price discovery. Why don't you describe what that financial.
00:03:17.606 - 00:03:19.530, Speaker B: Product is and why it's so crucial?
00:03:19.870 - 00:04:08.646, Speaker C: Yep. So, prior to Bitmax's product, basically, you had two main ways to trade bitcoin. One was the good old, like mongox. You go on an exchange, someone deposits bitcoins, you deposit fiat or the other way, and then you exchanged the fiat for bitcoin or the bitcoin to fiat. The other way that appeared a bit later was called Futures is a way that enables trading of bitcoin in the future. But the innovation of BitMax is to create a product that replicates the structure of the spot market, like Mongox or Bitstamp or Coinbase, but allows users to trade with leverage. So instead of having to deposit one bitcoin to trade one bitcoin, you can deposit one bitcoin and trade 100 bitcoin.
00:04:08.646 - 00:05:10.942, Speaker C: This has a lot of use for many use cases for people that want to make a quick buck on price movements. It could also be people that have bitcoin and want to hedge their position. They think the price is going to drop, they deposit five bitcoin and then they transform that into a sort of synthetic dollar and wait for the price to drop. So this product actually been created in 2014 and is, I think, a novel product. I don't think it exists in traditional finance because it enables trading bitcoin with bitcoin, which is a bit weird, which is not a problem that appears in normal finance. And its relationship to price discovery was actually studied in different research papers, is something that is also noticed in traditional markets. When there's future markets on an asset class, it's quite often that we see that the price is updated first on these futures markets and then on the spot one.
00:05:10.942 - 00:05:17.970, Speaker C: There's different reasons behind that. One of them is that it's easier to move to bigger trades on its platforms.
00:05:20.710 - 00:05:53.902, Speaker A: And so in terms of the importance of this platform, then it was quite significant when there were some issues of the trading on this hugely volatile day. And as you wrote, BitMIx suffered a DDoS attack at 02:16 A.m. UTC. And interestingly, the DDoS actually affected the troll box, which kind of is more like a little messaging area. So how did the DDoS attack work.
00:05:53.956 - 00:05:56.030, Speaker B: And why did that affect trading?
00:05:57.810 - 00:07:05.650, Speaker C: So, BitMax was started in 2014 and it created this troll box, basically a chat box for traders and even people at BitMax to interact with one another. As time went on, it lost a bit of its importance, but it was still, at the time of the DDoS attack, quite deeply embedded, like running on the same machine as the training engine. And someone found a flow in. Basically, I think it was requesting the history of messages for the Spanish troll box that nobody was using in a while. And they found this a while ago, that if they requested this Spanish troll box history, it would basically slow down the website a little bit. And whoever is behind that decided that they could exploit that to basically put the platform to a crawl like nobody could trade on it. The disk and CPU usage were off the charts and they decided to use that on the day bitcoin was dropping by lots and basically they stopped the price movement and went more about how and why it stopped this price movement in a newsletter.
00:07:06.550 - 00:07:06.962, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:07.016 - 00:07:14.086, Speaker A: Well, can you go into that a little more because the timing of this really seems quite calculated. What do you make of that?
00:07:14.268 - 00:08:12.502, Speaker C: Well, I don't know the timing, whether it's a bit still unclear whether what they expected was that by doing it, it would make the price go up or down, because you would expect that when an exchange is unavailable, the price would go down. But as that they had been quite volatile, a lot of traders that were long bitcoin so that wanted the bitcoin price to go up, ended up being liquidated. And BitMEX has this liquidation engine that ensures that or tries to ensure that nobody loses more than what they put in. And as more people were losing their bets on BitMIx, they were thinking the price was going to go up, but it kept going down and down and down. The engine had to take the reverse position of these traders. So the engine as well wanted to sell bitcoin. So that made it so that as the price went down, the price had to go down even more as BitMax had to liquidate these positions.
00:08:12.502 - 00:09:23.170, Speaker C: And whenever whoever did this attack triggered it, it made it impossible for anyone of most people to trade on BitMEX. And the effect of that is as this liquidation engine was probably the largest seller on the market or one of the largest sellers, since this ADAC basically removed BitMEX from the markets, basically when you remove a large seller, naturally keeping things equal, then the price would go up at least or stop going down. And this is what happened. It was a bit of a shock as well, I guess, to many traders, because when you're on a very volatile day like that and a lot of people basically have trades on BitMEX and trades on other exchanges that somewhat cancel out each other, when you lose one of them, it also creates a lot of trouble. Maybe they have, for example, triggers that when you lose BitMEX, you close the position on your other exchange. So there's many basically when losing BitMEX availability due to this DDoS attack, somewhat created a sort of shock in the system both by removing the largest seller in the market and also by probably shutting down a lot of trading operations.
00:09:24.950 - 00:09:43.430, Speaker A: Wow. So let's dive a little bit more into those liquidations at the point that you're discussing, I think this is when $1.1 billion worth of contracts were liquidated. So can you dive a little bit more into how liquidations work on BitMax?
00:09:43.770 - 00:10:26.418, Speaker C: Yes. So when someone makes a trade on BitMax, they have to put what is called margin. So if I want to bet that the bitcoin I want to bet one bitcoin, then the price is going to go up. I have to put at least zero one bitcoin on his bet. It's like 100 x leverage and some of this margin that you put up, so this 1% is kept aside as a buffer. So when the price goes the wrong way of your bet, at some point your trade gets stopped so that you don't lose all the money. There's a small buffer that is kept of margin by the exchange to close this position to basically you were wrong, we're going to cancel your bet.
00:10:26.418 - 00:11:06.078, Speaker C: Basically. If you were wanting to buy bitcoin, we're going to sell it. If you were selling it, we're going to buy it so that you don't lose money. It's not always possible to do that at the right price. So the liquidation engine is basically the system that is in charge of closing the positions of traders that ran out of money, basically. And its inner workings are somewhat mystery and have to be, because if people knew exactly how it worked, it's basically a game of a human versus a robot, and oftentimes a robot loses, except maybe a chess. So the inner workings are somewhat obscure, but it's basically an automated buyer seller.
00:11:06.078 - 00:12:02.306, Speaker C: In normal operations, half the people that bet that bitcoin is going to go up are wrong or down. It's rare that has happened on Black Thursday that everyone on one side. So everyone that wanted bitcoin to go up ended up being wrong that day and quite dramatically. So this engine basically takes these positions of traders that basically get liquidated and tries to close them. The issue that happened on Black Thursday is that there were few people willing to bet or to take the other side, or maybe too many people actually got liquidated. There's also another mechanism that gets into place, the insurance fund. There's been a lot of talk about BitMEX's insurance fund, but it's basically a way to make sure that even if the liquidation engine doesn't manage to close the trader's position by making a small profit, basically, you bet that.
00:12:02.306 - 00:12:32.602, Speaker C: Bitcoin is going to go up. You lose your bet. There's still a bit of money left in what you put in to try to make to close the position with the profit. But it can still happen that this goes in a negative. And the role of the insurance fund is to be basically a buffer of money that the liquidation engine can use as losses. And when this engine makes a profit, it goes towards this insurance fund. And finally, there's a last mechanism that actually you don't know if it's been used in this Black Thursday.
00:12:32.602 - 00:13:00.520, Speaker C: It's called auto deliveraging. And basically, when nothing works, what BitMax does to avoid basically losing people's money, or at least having people end up with negative balances, as it has sometimes happened on other platforms, is to basically make people with winning positions pay people with or cover the losses of people with losing positions so that in the end, no ones end up owing BitMEX money.
00:13:02.090 - 00:13:12.746, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to talk a little bit more about how Black Thursday has impacted the market since that day. But first, a quick word from the.

Crypto law is run by crypto OGS in New York who understand crypto and fintech. They were already operating in the space back in 2013 and they accept crypto as payment. One of the partners, Zachary Kelman, is known for drafting a bill submitted to the US Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting onchain bitcoin transactions from US. Regulations.
00:13:59.458 - 00:14:23.630, Speaker B: The other founding partner, his brother Daniel Kelman, became well known in the crypto lawsuits for his work in the Mount Gox civil rehabilitation. So if you operate a fintech business or have a dispute with some person or business involved in crypto, or you just need legal advice related to crypto info at Kelman law, that's Kel M-A-N dot law. Or just go to their website at www. Crypto law. When you think crypto, think Kelman.
00:14:24.050 - 00:14:36.498, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Antoine Le Calve. So in your blog post, you also looked at how Black Thursday has impacted liquidity since in a couple of weeks since.
00:14:36.584 - 00:14:37.860, Speaker B: What did you find?
00:14:38.310 - 00:15:58.286, Speaker C: Yep, so BitMax is a place used by a lot of market participants of various times, for example, OTC desks, market makers and day traders to basically hedge, for example, some of their force. If you're an OTC desk and someone wants to give you a lot of bitcoin, you might want to lock in that price on BitMEX by going short. And there's many other use cases. What happened on BitMEX that day is that probably a lot of these market participants lost money. Basically, if you had a position on BitMax before the price dropped by like 40%, it's quite unlikely that you were not liquidated or at least didn't lose a lot of money. And what we've noticed, using our reference rates and also our Sochemetrics, we store the order market data from many exchanges that allows us to run analysis like this is that on the spot market so the non BitMEX, non derivatives, we've seen an impact on the liquidity. So instead of traders being easily able to buy bitcoins by creating a very small impact on the market, now there's a large, especially after this shock of 40% down in one day, a lot of people that usually provide this liquidity stop doing it.
00:15:58.286 - 00:16:54.090, Speaker C: So there's several explanations. One, it is quite normal, and we've noticed that for past events is that when the price goes up or down, basically when the volatility goes up, people whose job is to provide liquidity in the market and who make money based on that, market makers usually widen the spread. So instead of quoting very tight spreads, they buy a they sell at $101, they would widen the spread and maybe buy a buy at 1.5. This is a normal reaction, but usually this disappears. So the liquidity shock happens and few hours afterwards they go back to quoting what they were quoting before. But this has not happened yet on the spot markets, I run the analysis again this morning. The spreads are still higher than they were before March twelveTH, and on BitMax it's even wider.
00:16:54.090 - 00:17:32.990, Speaker C: While on the spot markets, on coinbase, on crack and on bitstep, it seems that the liquidity has been coming back slowly over time. It seems that on BitMEX it still hasn't gone to what it was before. But there's also another reason, maybe behind the other than the price dropping by a lot. It could be that a lot of these market participants now also work with traditional finance. They are hedge funds, they're looking playing into bitcoin, but also trading other assets. And they could just have stopped or limited the operations drastically in all markets, including cryptocurrencies, due to the crisis that the world is currently facing.
00:17:36.130 - 00:17:55.518, Speaker A: Yeah, that part was really fascinating in your post, and I do wonder what will happen. But then that last bit that you said there made me also wonder do you feel like, what would you say the Coronavirus is teaching us about how bitcoin is correlated to traditional financial assets?
00:17:55.614 - 00:17:57.960, Speaker B: Are there any conclusions we can draw yet?
00:17:58.330 - 00:18:51.270, Speaker C: It's still very hard. So we've noticed, and we've wrote in our newsletter and past issues about some events where we could clearly see that the bitcoin price was reacting to external events. For example, when there were ruckus fired by Iran in Saudi Arabia, we could clearly see an impact. Even recently there was a clear impact, at least on a very short term, from the declaration of the Fed of basically unlimited quantitative easing. We could see the price go up, but when you zoom out, these impacts are less visible. So bitcoin still has a mind of its own, but on a day to day basis you can still spot the impact of external shock events. I think for the Coronavirus, the impact will still take quite a while to see.
00:18:51.270 - 00:19:19.040, Speaker C: There's a lot of activity going on by central banks in the US. In europe and in Asia about dealing with this issue and with the impact on the economy. But I think it will take a long time if it's clearly visible to see on the bitcoin price, because these things take time. If every American gets $1,200 from the fed, maybe some will buy bitcoin with it, but I don't know how clearly it would be visible to see it.
00:19:20.370 - 00:19:49.946, Speaker A: Yeah, well, given what's going on here, for my part, I don't think a lot of people will be buying bitcoin with it, but I could be proven wrong. We will see. But over this time period, over the next few months, as coronavirus continues to affect frankly just the entire globe, what will you be looking for to understand that question better? Like, what are some of the metrics that you and your team will be looking at?
00:19:50.128 - 00:20:43.894, Speaker C: That's a good question. Of course, the price is one of the main metric that will probably encrop us, the better the information, the new information with this crisis. But if we take different positions, if we think that it's new users that will come online, then we can look at metrics like how many addresses own bitcoin or how many addresses own more than x amount of bitcoin. We could look as well at transfer count. If people buy bitcoin, usually it's recommended that they don't leave all of it on the exchange, so they would move some of it offline to hardware, wallets or other things like that. So we can see that on the chain by looking at how many people transact bitcoin on a day to day basis. But still, it's still unclear exactly how things will change.
00:20:43.894 - 00:21:23.960, Speaker C: And is there also other bitcoin specific events that will happen in the near future at the same time at this crisis in Quadrapon? The main one will be the bitcoin halving of which the consequences are still a hotly debated topic, but they think it's going to align with probably the deep part of the coming or still ongoing economical crisis as it's in, like, two months. And a lot of people file for unemployment, and the impact of that will be felt in the coming weeks, the same as they're having. So even though there will probably be an impact, I don't know how clear it will be to see it because other events happen at the same time.
00:21:24.890 - 00:21:53.870, Speaker A: Yeah, and I did talk about this on last week's show, but I think this was the analysis you guys sent out last week on black Thursday. It appeared that a lot of the bitcoin that was exchanging hands was from newer buyers who were trading. So I guess that would be another metric that we could keep watching is how long term holders react during this whole crisis.
00:21:54.770 - 00:21:58.338, Speaker B: Well, anyway, thank you so much for coming on the show. It's been great having you.

00:22:50.472 - 00:23:37.700, Speaker B: Thanks for tuning in to this week's News recap. First Headline bitcoin mining difficulty has second biggest drop in history CoinDesk reports bitcoin's mining difficulty declined by 16% on March 26 after the massive selloff in bitcoin on Black Thursday, March twelveTH. It is now at 13.91 trillion, a level not seen since December 20. This decline in difficulty comes at an especially bad time. Three days before Black Thursday, bitcoin mining difficulty reached an all time high. Now with miners falling off, and since the mining difficulty takes 2016 blocks to adjust, it is now projected that it won't adjust for another 17 days rather than the typical two weeks.
00:23:37.700 - 00:25:15.650, Speaker B: However, with the bitcoin price rising past 6600 and current decreased difficulty, older mining equipment like bitmain's ant minor S Nine is now profitable again. Also, and this news bit is only tangentially related, but a nominee to CME's board of directors has suggested that the derivatives trading behemoths start mining bitcoin. Next Headline digital Dollars Discussed as part of stimulus after all the discussion of Libra and central bank digital currencies last year, digital dollars did briefly appear in drafts of the Coronavirus relief bill before the House this week, but did not survive the final cut. The bill initially envisioned a digital payment system in which the Fed and its member banks could directly send funds to those who need financial support. Catherine Coley of CEO of Binance US argued in a CoinDesk op ed last weekend that a blockchain based stablecoin would be a good vehicle for providing direct stimulus because of the fact that digital dollars cannot accidentally expose people to the coronavirus, plus they also can be distributed to people without stable residences. However, in a CoinDesk article, Daniel Gorfine, the former chief innovation officer at the CFTC who has proposed a digital dollar with former CFT Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, argued that implementing a central bank digital currency should not be done in a hurried fashion. He said, quote, I think it's really important that this doesn't cause any delays in getting emergency funding to needy businesses and individuals through existing channels.
00:25:15.650 - 00:26:35.978, Speaker B: Speaking of that digital dollar venture, the Digital Dollar Foundation, which is founded by Giancarlo, also known as Cryptodad, named a couple dozen former government officials and industry experts to its board, including Sheila Warren, head of the World Economic Forum's blockchain efforts, and Don Wilson, founder and CEO of trading firm DRW. Next Headline Court deems Telegram's token distribution a likely violation of securities law A New York federal court issued a preliminary injunction against the distribution of Telegram's gram token, saying it would violate US. Securities laws. Though a preliminary injunction is not final, it is likely that there will be a permanent injunction and that even if Telegram appeals, it would not be successful. The block reports that at least ten Telegram investors are inclined to take 72% of the invested funds back. In October, Telegram offered them an option to get 77% of their money back, but they instead agreed to postpone the launch of the Ton network to April 30. The drop from 77% to 72% is due to some funds having been spent on development since then, Yakov Berensky, head of Russian crypto investment firm Hash CIB, said of this 72% deal.
00:26:35.978 - 00:27:57.080, Speaker B: Quote Considering what is happening in the financial markets, this offer now looks like much better than in October. On a separate track, the Ton Community Foundation, a group of developers and investors supporting the Telegram open network, also called Tun, are looking at ways to launch the network without the company's participation. After all, the code necessary for launch has already been published, CoinDesk reports. Quote the community would only need to generate the first batch of transactions, or Genesis block, and provide at least 13 computers, known as validators, to run the network. Next Headline The man behind the Petro Nathaniel Popper and Anna Vanessa Herrero of the New York Times, wrote a great feature story on Gabrielle Jimenez, a Venice willing cryptocurrency entrepreneur who had protested President Nicholas Menduro but when asked to help create a national digital currency, thought it was an opportunity to change his country from within. He told the Times quote the actual goal of the project was to change the economic model of the oppressive regime. This was my mission and my gamble in a bet that ended up costing everything I had in my life my friends, my partners, my reputation, my love, my company and my country.
00:27:57.080 - 00:29:00.810, Speaker B: Definitely. Check this story out for a great long read this week and for some news that's not related to the Coronavirus. Next Headline How crypto Companies and projects rank across five spectrums of trust for the multicoin capital blog, Tony Shang wrote a monster piece on trust in crypto and how it is multi dimensional, not binary. He breaks it down into five properties custody, Immutability, Verifiable, security, legal and regulatory protections, and insurance. He then assesses a number of crypto companies and projects, including Backed, Coinbase, Tether, Compound Maker, and Uniswap, among others. Along these spectrums, some of the more interesting analyses are, for instance, the Immutability spectrum, which shows almost all the companies and even some DeFi projects huddled toward the mutable side, which I think is probably a reflection of how nascent the industry still is in the years to come. We may see more in the most immutable column, where Uniswap currently sits alone.
00:29:00.810 - 00:29:45.282, Speaker B: In contrast, the spectrum for custody is more spread out, probably reflecting the variety in consumer choice. The post also ends with an analysis of the recent BZX attacks and how the BZX protocol scores on these factors. Shang writes quote this episode concluded with relatively minor losses, about $1 million total. But it's not hard to imagine how greater damages could occur in larger systems with more malicious actors. Fun bits. Coin metrics raises $6 million in Series A funding. Assuming you listened to the interview with Antoine Le Calvet earlier in the show, you may have wondered how I neglected to mention that CoinMetrics just announced its Series A funding round.
00:29:45.282 - 00:30:34.706, Speaker B: Well, the news didn't break until after we wrapped Recording, and he didn't mention it, so I didn't know. But now I'll take the opportunity to say congratulations to him and the team at CoinMetrics, and to let you all know that the round was led by Highland Capital Partners, with participation from Communitas Capital, Avon Ventures and Digital Currency Group, among others.
