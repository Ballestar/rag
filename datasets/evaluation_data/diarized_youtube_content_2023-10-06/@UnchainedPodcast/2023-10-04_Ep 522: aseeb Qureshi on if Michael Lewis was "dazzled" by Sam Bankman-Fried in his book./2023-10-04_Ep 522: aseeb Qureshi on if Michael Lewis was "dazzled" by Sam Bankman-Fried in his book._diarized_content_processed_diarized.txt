00:00:00.410 - 00:00:34.706, Speaker A: I think it's also true when you're writing a book, you have to paint the central character as a complex figure. So if you just write a book that says he was a bad guy, he was lying the whole time, it's all genuine. He's a trosserian fraud. Everything was all set up in order to steal money. That's not an interesting book. That's just like a detail of a serial murderer or something. It's an interesting book if there's a conflict at the center of it about know, the genuine tear of wanting to improve the world versus this utilitarian kind of calculus that ran too close to the cliff edge.
00:00:34.706 - 00:00:56.860, Speaker A: I believe that he believes it. You can tell from his interactions with the way he talks about SPF that he was genuinely dazzled by him and he genuinely thought he was a really smart guy. And I think everybody who knew Sam knew that he was a really smart guy and that he was also very strange and unlike pretty much anybody you've ever met who has ever run a like I know some people who are like Sam, but they don't run companies.
