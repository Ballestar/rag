00:00:03.820 - 00:00:23.596, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the four of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes. Next up, we have Robert, crypto connoisseur and Captain of Compound. Third, we've got Tarun, the Gigabrain and Grandpubad Gauntlet.
00:00:23.596 - 00:00:52.280, Speaker A: And then we have myself, I'm a SIB head Hype man at Dragonfly. And today we have, joining us a special guest from her airbnb in a nondescript location, we've got Laura Shin. So the four of us, not including Laura, are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice. So, Laura, first of all, congratulations on your book. I think last time we were able to say it here, but you weren't able to join us at that time. Congratulations.
00:00:52.280 - 00:01:00.416, Speaker A: I know it's been a huge effort in the undertaking and you're now on the roadshow, like, going around giving talks or something.
00:01:00.598 - 00:01:47.088, Speaker B: Yeah, I went to London right after the book came out, like, literally the day after. And I went to a chain analysis conference. And then after that, I went to a conference at Oxford. And that was actually really meaningful because I had done study abroad at Oxford. And all I can say is, when you go to a place that's so close to your heart and that was so formative for you after a major milestone in your life, I was very emotional just walking around Oxford. I'm sure people were like, why does this lady keep crying? Obviously, just going to the chain houses conference was really wonderful because they helped me with so much in the book. But obviously they had done that demixing portion for the Dow investigation, which was great.
00:01:47.088 - 00:02:20.812, Speaker B: And actually, I will step away at a certain point and get you a really cool thing that somebody gave me, which was this FBI challenge coin. And it's like a coin that I guess these FBI special agents have and it says nice things on it. Yeah. And then I had my book signing in New York last week and it was totally sold out, which is awesome because apparently that's not a common thing. So it was great and so many people came up and said hello. And then, yeah, now I'm in San Francisco. I have a reading tonight at the Commonwealth Club and then I'll be in Seattle tomorrow and there's more events coming up.
00:02:20.812 - 00:02:24.796, Speaker B: But, yeah, it's a very fun time for me.
00:02:24.898 - 00:02:26.030, Speaker A: How does it feel?
00:02:27.120 - 00:03:06.328, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Like, amazing. Honestly, I just can't even begin to tell you. First of all, announcing the news about the Dow attacker on the day my book came out, that was just incredible. And obviously it was a huge boost for the book and just kind of, I think, really got people talking about the book and was just great because I poured so much of myself into this book over the last few years. And so to be able to launch it in that way and frankly, also I had spent so much time trying to figure out who had done it that was really nice. And then, yeah, just like people have been saying such nice things.
00:03:06.328 - 00:03:28.332, Speaker B: Like the day that I revealed that news, people were tweeting at me that I was the goat, which is great. People obviously aren't usually very complimentary toward oh, yes, thank you. That's the book. I do have a copy somewhere. Oh, here, I've got one here. Yes, I have friends who are visiting Mint, so this is one of their copies.
00:03:28.396 - 00:03:44.356, Speaker A: Got my copy. I have to say, it is a very long book. I have not made a lot of progress in the book so far. It's been a busy week in crypto land, as we're going to talk about today. But I am incredibly proud of you. This is so awesome. Your book has been killing it.
00:03:44.356 - 00:03:58.440, Speaker A: It's been like the number one crypto book on Amazon, which is crazy given how popular crypto is. So it seems like surprisingly, it seems like kind of nothing has gone wrong, which is also very surprising for launching something that you've been working on for multiple.
00:04:00.460 - 00:04:52.408, Speaker B: Mean between that and then the funny thing is, so you're in the middle of you know I won't reveal too much, but in my personal opinion, there's just so many bombshells in the book. There's just so much new stuff that I uncovered and like, whole storylines that weren't even known before. And so it's just funny because this weekend, Charles Hoskinson tweeted something about my book, how it was like a work of fiction, which is kind of rich considering that if you read the book, you will find out that he has a tenuous relationship to the truth. So I was a little bit at least that's what the people who lived and worked with him said. And all their stories are very similar to each other. And so I was like, okay, well, I also found out that what you claim about your education does not match what the school's records show. So I tweeted about that, and that has also blown things up.
00:04:52.408 - 00:05:14.484, Speaker B: And I noticed I think it even boosted sales of the book because people have been tweeting at me like, oh, since you found this out, I'm going to buy the book now. And I'm like, oh, well, if you think that that's interesting, wait till you read the book, because there's like a lot more in there. But yeah, I was a little bit like, that's the criticism you're going to give me. If that's the criticism, then maybe you should look at your own history.
00:05:14.682 - 00:05:43.812, Speaker C: I have one question for you, actually, from the perspective of being an author and a journalist, how does it differ in terms of your process when it's like you're the secret bearer for many years and you have all these breaking stories that you have to collect until you hit some. You're like foraging for mush, for truffles, and you have to hit a certain number of truffles before you're allowed to kind of let them debut at some fancy restaurant.
00:05:43.956 - 00:05:44.916, Speaker D: Interesting analogy.
00:05:44.948 - 00:06:42.940, Speaker B: Tarian that was one thing because I found out this thing about Charles's education years ago that I couldn't reveal it, obviously, until the book came out. And there were so many things like that, but it wasn't like I was holding off on publishing until I had some number of things. I was trying to get the story, basically. That was kind of the main thing. I was just after what happened at that time, I want to talk to all these different people. I want to make sure I kind of get all the perspectives so I'm getting the fullest version and the most accurate version. So really? Yeah, part of it, it was a little bit hard kind of knowing all this stuff and then not being able to talk about it and also worrying, am I going to get scooped? Like, are other people going to get this story and just get it out in an article before my book? That was like a little bit of a stress and then just weird things around when we felt like we had an identity for the Dow attacker.
00:06:42.940 - 00:07:35.824, Speaker B: That all happened at the very last minute. The book was basically nearly done and it was at the point in time where I was not allowed to make anything but the most minimal changes. And then, yeah, then it was like, okay, we're going to have to make a very big change. So we had to push the publication date. And then, yeah, there was just like certain things like, you'll see that in the book. That section is much briefer than what we put in the Forbes article because since most of the book was finished, the publisher was know, you have to stick to a certain word count and was basically like, we're going to remove what you previously wrote about the Dow and then insert this new thing. So the Forbes article just has a lot more because I had more room because they were even saying things like, oh, the more you change, it even changes things like the size of the book and it's too late in the process.
00:07:35.824 - 00:07:40.288, Speaker B: You know what I mean? So it's just like there were so many downstream effects that they were the.
00:07:40.294 - 00:07:43.090, Speaker C: Original book jacket is an NFT now.
00:07:46.600 - 00:08:04.650, Speaker B: Yeah, well, we didn't change it because I did stick to the word count, but there were just like issues like that. It was great. And then of course, I was nervous that somebody was going to break the news and they were going to find out the identity and then they were going to just reveal it before my book came out, and that was a whole thing that we were worried about.
00:08:05.260 - 00:08:13.576, Speaker A: So whatever happened to the Ten X founder after the revelations? I'm sure Robert is a big Ten X whale, so I'm sure he's very interested to know OG OG whale.
00:08:13.608 - 00:08:14.700, Speaker D: No, I'm kidding.
00:08:15.120 - 00:08:52.170, Speaker B: I mean, he sent me his denial. I haven't seen anything else. I don't think he's released any additional statements. I did see that Memo Capital, where he's, like, a co founder initially in their Telegram group, they closed the chat down, and they were just like, we're looking into these allegations, whatever. But then it revived a few days later, and they were just like, he doesn't have daily involvement anyway. He's not been involved with the project, stuff like that. Yeah, but the one good thing is I haven't seen a lot of people being like, you're wrong.
00:08:52.170 - 00:09:27.780, Speaker B: This clearly is you're off your rock, or whatever. I think a lot of people recognize, like, okay, the evidence is very strong. And then even beyond just the things about what happened to that money and whatever, when you go back and fill in the story and you're like, oh, this is someone who is very into the Dow, they were looking at the code. They identified flaws. They had reached out to the creators about it. They had written blog posts about the flaws. Just all the things and even the exact problems they were talking about were the ones that eventually had to force ethereum to hard fork, because otherwise they would have been in Dow wars forever.
00:09:27.780 - 00:09:45.032, Speaker B: He identified all that at that time, and so it just even made sense when you went back. So I think people realized, like, okay, it makes sense from both sides. So, yeah, I think that's why there hasn't been any pushback, at least not yet. Have any of you finished the book?
00:09:45.086 - 00:09:47.656, Speaker A: Or guys, have any of you finished the book?
00:09:47.838 - 00:09:54.204, Speaker D: I will admit, and I'm being radically honest and transparent, that I've yet to start the book, but I will start.
00:09:54.242 - 00:10:04.952, Speaker B: The a good you have a good excuse, which is, I know you have a newborn on your hands, so I imagine you're probably not sleeping very you've got Tarun.
00:10:05.016 - 00:10:11.312, Speaker A: You have no excuse. Tarun. You've got no you're just sitting there drinking. Yeah, he's he's just hanging out in his apartment, just doing nothing.
00:10:11.446 - 00:10:12.540, Speaker C: The Diet Coke.
00:10:12.620 - 00:10:16.420, Speaker D: I'm the one drinking beer. I have robot beer for robot Ventures.
00:10:16.760 - 00:10:18.756, Speaker B: Oh, wow, that's very cool.
00:10:18.938 - 00:10:21.750, Speaker C: There's just too many math papers ahead of me.
00:10:23.000 - 00:10:23.652, Speaker E: I'm sorry.
00:10:23.706 - 00:10:27.936, Speaker C: That's the truth. I'm giving you radical transparency.
00:10:28.128 - 00:10:31.296, Speaker A: Radical. That's what we're all about here on the Chopping blog, is radical transparency.
00:10:31.328 - 00:10:36.890, Speaker B: I'm not surprised that that's Tarune's reason. And why do I totally, 100% believe that reason?
00:10:38.140 - 00:10:47.550, Speaker C: I have a stack of things that's like, it's on there. It's going in my suitcase when I'm traveling so that as soon as I finish this queue, then I move into the book.
00:10:48.000 - 00:10:51.580, Speaker E: Well, is it a stack or is it a stack, or is it a queue?
00:10:51.920 - 00:10:59.744, Speaker C: Well, that's a great joke. That's a very bad but hilarious CS joke. No, it's a queue. It's not a stack. If it was a stack, that'd be bad for book reading time.
00:10:59.782 - 00:11:05.276, Speaker D: I actually think it's more like a mem pool, and some of these compete with each other, and it's not a stack or a queue.
00:11:05.308 - 00:11:08.820, Speaker A: Transaction fees are going up in the mem pool. You're about to get ejected, unfortunately.
00:11:09.320 - 00:11:15.076, Speaker C: I mean, 400 page book is a large bundle of transactions after all.
00:11:15.178 - 00:11:16.580, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true.
00:11:16.650 - 00:11:18.760, Speaker B: Now we're getting super nerdy.
00:11:19.100 - 00:11:23.032, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, Tom, your turn for the confessional of why you haven't read book.
00:11:23.086 - 00:11:34.028, Speaker E: I've been moving. I'm in New York. I've been traveling around. So I haven't had been able to sit in a place and prop my feet up and read it, but it is sitting on my Kindle, so I'm looking forward to reading it.
00:11:34.114 - 00:11:42.460, Speaker A: Cool. Okay, so by next time, we'll have to submit our reviews. Chopping Block book club.
00:11:42.620 - 00:11:46.096, Speaker D: First up is I do think it.
00:11:46.118 - 00:11:56.450, Speaker C: Would be interesting to see what each of us thinks is the most shocking revelation, like BuzzFeed article style. This breaking will shock you.
00:11:57.060 - 00:12:05.572, Speaker A: By next meeting, it'll all be in the first 20 pages. The most shocking thing I read in the first 20 pages that Vitalik could speak when he was eight years old.
00:12:05.706 - 00:12:11.492, Speaker D: No, you have to skip whatever it was 200 and then start reading. That way, you get unique insights.
00:12:11.636 - 00:12:20.260, Speaker B: I have a feeling I know what you guys will be most shocked about, and I'm surprised you haven't heard. I have tried to ask people not to do too many spoilers.
00:12:20.420 - 00:12:26.744, Speaker A: Laura have been real. Bye. Enjoy your book reading. Bask in the sunlight of all the love that you're receiving.
00:12:26.872 - 00:12:30.510, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. All right, see you guys. Have fun.
00:12:31.200 - 00:13:26.476, Speaker A: Okay, so the big news of the week or of the last two weeks has been, of course, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is a topic that so I was actually in Ukraine last year because a number of the companies that we've invested into were based in Ukraine. So last year, I was in Kiev and Lviv last summer. So I know Ukraine quite well. So it's been really terrible, and our sympathy goes out to all the victims in Ukraine who are fighting back against the Russian invaders. But it's been a story that not only has gripped the world, but it's also one that has a lot to say about what's going on in crypto, and in fact, it has had massive effects on the crypto market. So I won't belabor a lot of the news about the details of the invasion itself, but there were a number of different elements of the aftermath of both the invasion and the sanctions that ensued from the invasion of Ukraine that had a lot of effects on crypto.
00:13:26.476 - 00:14:28.500, Speaker A: So just to go through a very brief summary of the news. So first was so Ukraine has obviously been very active in social media through the official Ukraine Twitter account and one of the things that they've been calling for is the blocking of Russian accounts within crypto exchanges. And actually there's been equivalent calls within the US from some US lawmakers to also do the same thing. Now the majority of exchanges have denied these requests to not freeze Russian accounts and to be clear, these are not accounts of Russia, the nation state, but rather of Russian individuals. So finance announced that they wouldn't be freezing Russian accounts. There was actually a large announcement by Coinbase that there are 25,000 wallets ringed to Russian illicit activity that they were going to be blocking that were belonged by Russian users. But it was unclear what exactly this had to do with sanctions or if this is just an unrelated, some kind of illegal fraud ring or something like that that they were shutting down accounts for.
00:14:28.500 - 00:15:09.116, Speaker A: We saw massive spikes in volume in rubles. So unsurprisingly there was a lot of demand within Russia for getting access to crypto, especially as the sanctions were starting to close in. Enormous amount of financial organizations are now cut off within Russia. So we saw a lot of demand for crypto and bitcoin within Russia. We saw not only the withdrawal of an enormous amount of banks that basically left operations in Russia, we also saw Visa and Mastercard shut off any access to cardholders in Russia. We saw sanctions from multiple countries. Pretty much everything in NATO and in the EU, even in Singapore was sanctioning Russia.
00:15:09.116 - 00:16:04.656, Speaker A: And you also saw some interesting things happening on the Ukrainian side. So for one, there was an announcement that Ukraine was going to give an AirDrop to crypto users and Ukraine actually posted their crypto wallets on chain which were verified by some of the prominent members of the crypto community to solicit donations. And we saw over $40 million in crypto donations go to these addresses associated with Ukraine. We also saw there was a number of NFT fundraisers, one of which raised I think like $5 million for an NFT of the Ukrainian flag that was donated entirely to Ukraine. You can see here we've got Dune analytics up showing about 40 million in total donations between ETH, Dai, USDC and a few other assets. Ukraine even announced that they were going to do an AirDrop. It was unclear what the AirDrop was or who was going to get the AirDrop, if it was donated or something.
00:16:04.656 - 00:16:38.956, Speaker A: They later announced they were canceling the AirDrop, but they were going to be selling NFTs. And I think I believe right now it's not yet public the details of all of this. So it's been basically the first crypto war that we've seen, the first armed conflict and obviously the most major armed conflict in Europe since World War II and crypto has had a very strange role to play on both sides, both within Russia and in Ukraine. So curious to get your guys'thoughts on what's been happening over the last couple of weeks. Tom, why don't you start, given that you are first on the list.
00:16:39.058 - 00:17:18.372, Speaker E: I do have it on good authority that the NFT sale is happening. So that should be interesting to see. Oh good how that actually looks. But yeah, I think there's went through so many different phases where people thought the crypto addresses that Ukraine posted weren't real to criticizing crypto donations saying hey, they actually need money, this isn't real money, how are they going to off ramp it to now? I think there's a stat that came out was like 70% of the armed suppliers to Ukraine are accepting crypto directly. They're not off ramping into Fiat, they're just accepting crypto payments directly. Which is kind of insane to think about. I know it just feels know, generally speaking there isn't a whole lot of clarity.
00:17:18.372 - 00:17:58.616, Speaker E: It feels like just sort of a people have money and they want to sling it at something. And this kind of feels like the next thing that people are aping into. Is it's constitution? Dow, like, in many ways where it's like, this is something that I think I believe in and I want to donate to and I want to back. I think the weird thing though is that the donations are not necessarily going to humanitarian causets it's not like, hey, this is going to Ukrainian refugees. A lot of the donations are going to purchase arms for the Ukrainian military, which I think is a very kind of strange and scary precedent. Certainly they need the money to defend themselves, but I don't know how many people who are donating are thinking about the fact that the money that they're using is going to be used to.
00:17:58.638 - 00:18:00.596, Speaker A: Kill people and it's kind of insane.
00:18:00.628 - 00:18:06.824, Speaker E: You have global fundraising for this army which has never really been done before in human history.
00:18:07.022 - 00:18:18.940, Speaker A: That is actually not true. Wasn't there some army that launched a fundraiser? I can't remember this. Don't you guys know what I'm talking about? There was like some armed conflict that they go fund me or something.
00:18:19.010 - 00:18:59.796, Speaker C: One during peak pandemic between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which was settled by Turkey, sending in drones and bombing the shit out of Armenia. And that was like I'm surprised no one called that as crazy as kind of the stuff we're seeing now. Because that was like there were two countries fighting over this disputed region and then this third party country just sends in a bunch of drones and picks the winner and then we moved on and the world just kind of forgot it's about this conflict region called Nagarno Karaba in that area. But the Armenian side if I remember correctly, did have a GoFundMe.
00:18:59.988 - 00:19:01.172, Speaker E: A GoFundMe?
00:19:01.316 - 00:19:07.308, Speaker C: I think it was a GoFundMe and I think they had we were thinking about doing an NFT something, it was.
00:19:07.314 - 00:19:09.484, Speaker A: Like right, I remember this.
00:19:09.522 - 00:19:18.752, Speaker C: It was like late 2020, early 2021, but it was like, a little too early. I feel like the open sea boom had just not quite taken off around.
00:19:18.806 - 00:19:21.344, Speaker A: The time it was the Nifty gateway days.
00:19:21.462 - 00:19:50.572, Speaker E: I'm surprised that happened because there was actually a GoFundMe for crypto. This is, of course, the other classic criticism of crypto. Well, you can just do this with Fiat. You can just wire in your money. You can just send Vemo. And so there was a GoFundMe to send money to the Ukrainian military, and they shut it down because they have a policy against fundraising for weapon sales. And so it's actually a great example of where, yeah, there really is no other possible thing you could do here other than use well, what's wrong with.
00:19:50.626 - 00:20:09.420, Speaker A: I mean, the reality is almost every Western government is already using tax dollars to basically fund a donation of arms to Ukraine. So at the margin, it's not making a huge amount of difference. 40 million is a pretty small drop in the bucket relative to the total amount of aid that's gone to the Ukrainian military.
00:20:09.580 - 00:20:20.836, Speaker E: Sure, it's just very direct, and that's never really been done before, and I don't think most people who are donating are considering that. I don't really think this sort of direct contribution to an armed conflict has.
00:20:20.858 - 00:20:24.196, Speaker A: Really been done and maybe a bit.
00:20:24.218 - 00:20:41.240, Speaker E: Scary to think about, hey, maybe in this scenario, these are the good guys. This is our side. But you can imagine this is sort of not too far removed from the whole assassination market meme from 2016. You can imagine that this is sort of a step in that direction.
00:20:42.300 - 00:21:11.924, Speaker A: I think the thing about this war, and one of the reasons why it's been so galvanizing in the west, is that it's like, probably one of the few examples of a just war that we've seen in the last call it 40 years, where it's very easy to identify the aggressor. There was very little provocation. Certainly Putin invading the Donbass is one thing, but him going and trying to basically attack Kiev, the capital, which is in western Ukraine, which is not even ethnically Russian. They speak Ukrainian. They don't speak Russian there. They're more European. Like, I was there.
00:21:11.924 - 00:22:00.260, Speaker A: It's like a, you know, him basically going in and ransacking the entire country was just very clearly unprovoked. There was no first strike by Ukraine. And to have a conflict that's that clean and also that public and also where, of course, Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, has been incredibly charismatic and has also very effectively used social media and the press to galvanize the world know, wanting to come to Ukraine's help. So I think it's one of the reasons why this war feels so different relative to other conflicts in the past, where I suspect if I were to donate money to ukraine. I would not be surprised that they would use it to buy arms. But I think most people are okay with that for this war relative to most other wars.
00:22:00.840 - 00:22:10.260, Speaker D: I mean, especially the people donating, I think probably believe that, right? It's not donating to an extremely morally nebulous recipient.
00:22:10.340 - 00:22:10.968, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:11.134 - 00:22:36.684, Speaker C: I mean, the problem is you don't know the recipient theoretically. Right, but if we assume that it's technically who it's claimed to be, I mean, historically there have been tons of wars funded in kind of indirect manners over the know. Whenever people are like the US funded the contras via selling weapons and doing all this, it's no different than this. If we squint think at some point.
00:22:36.722 - 00:22:39.072, Speaker A: Though that's a state actor, right? It's a state actor funding a war.
00:22:39.126 - 00:22:55.872, Speaker C: But it's a state actor doing it via these kind of the tentacles of like, hey, we're technically funding it via these weird organizations, and there's many of them, and they all have to somehow and this removes the coordination pressure of needing the state actor, but it kind of gets the same outcome.
00:22:56.016 - 00:22:59.800, Speaker D: Yeah, but it's individual to nation as opposed to like nation to nation.
00:23:00.860 - 00:23:51.960, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. Although it's like a little bit weird because if I think about the Argentina stuff, right, where they took the Argentinian warship as collateral for not paying back the bond, that's like the inverse version of this, right? In some ways. So we've seen the other side happen. So it's like I kind of feel like you could argue that the Elliott management heist of Argentina is like the inverse of this and you could probably rig the bond market to kind of let you do this. The war bonds are selling. I don't understand. So one thing I don't get the difference of is the difference between the war bonds, the raw war bonds and the cryptocurrency raise because I've seen these things, they're like Ukraine raising $230,000,000 war bond type headlines.
00:23:51.960 - 00:24:12.136, Speaker C: Presumably that's just like western governments buying those bonds or can individuals and entities. That's one thing where I've been kind of confused about where this is going. How do the corporate finances of a nation look like when they have debt issuance plus cryptocurrency donation and they have to manage that treasury?
00:24:12.328 - 00:25:02.050, Speaker A: Yeah, it is a good question of how good is the Ukrainian crypto OpSec? Do they even have a multi SIG? Is it just like one dude's address? I think that's probably likely. But yeah, it does seem like look, the crypto donations are obviously coming from retail and just random people around the world who feel passionate about the cause. It is a much easier way to donate than most other forms of donation at this point. And certainly it's more you know, if I'm looking at one of these TV fundraisers for Ukraine, I have very little confidence that it's actually going to Ukraine or that it's not going to get chopped up into tiny little pieces and taxed along the way. Whereas if I donate to the Ukrainian crypto address on Twitter, actually have pretty high confidence they're going to go turn around and buy AK 47s with that, which is in a way, it's a great endorsement for crypto for use cases like this.
00:25:02.820 - 00:25:55.630, Speaker D: It's a great endorsement for crypto. But there's also the risk on the other side, which know, the story that I'm most concerned about and aware of is know with the imposition of sanctions on Russia, the story that's coming out in crypto right now is concern from politicians that crypto will be used to evade those sanctions, and it's serving as a catalyst or a justification to impose draconian restrictions on crypto, crypto exchanges, et cetera. And I think it's probably the most important sort of reaction to what's happening with crypto is that yes, crypto is being used in new and exciting ways and that's creating a lot of fear, at least within the US. To offset it. I think NetNet there's some extremely positive things happening to crypto, but it's creating more of a pushback than I expected. Very.
00:25:56.640 - 00:26:32.264, Speaker A: So I tweeted about this in that I basically said that the language of using crypto to evade sanctions I think is like a total non sequitur because the reality is that the sanctions were very well defined. Right? There were certain things that are sanctioned and certain things that are not included in the package of sanctions. You can't include crypto in sanctions. There's nothing that says you can't, but they're not included. But in fact, some of the sanctions were OFAC restrictions on basically transacting with certain parties. And whether you are sending dollar bills or whether you're sending crypto OFAC restrictions are universal. It doesn't matter what you're transacting with.
00:26:32.264 - 00:27:17.224, Speaker A: So there are parties that are now on the OFAC list that you cannot transact with that are I think they're all Russian banks, right? So you cannot transact with these Russian banks and Russian state owned enterprises, whether using crypto or not, but transacting with private Russian citizens or with other companies in Russia that are not on the sanctions list. It is fine whether you're using dollars or whether you're using crypto. Like the idea that it is evading sanctions, quote, unquote, for Russia to transact in crypto. Okay, was it evading sanctions for Russia to transact in R B? No, obviously not. Right? That's a total non sequitur. So crypto is just not in the category of things that we can use as sanctions or that we have chosen to use as sanctions, but we could if we so chose. If the US Said, look, coinbase, you are not allowed to send transactions to anybody who is verified to be Russian, then done.
00:27:17.224 - 00:27:21.628, Speaker A: We have sanctions on Russian citizens, but we didn't do know.
00:27:21.714 - 00:28:07.400, Speaker E: It also ties back a little bit to the whole Canadian trucker bitcoin thing in some way where they also got deplatformed. And actually Joe Weisenthal from Bloomberg. Had a good piece today talking about how all these opportunities not that I think also there was I think the treasury put out a piece saying it's not even really technically feasible for Russia to know conduct business using crypto as it is today. But certainly something like these crowdfunds it's like the more crypto sort of plays to its strengths by basically creating this independent financial system and sort of do the thing that it's supposed to do. It also is somewhat bearish in that it sort of creates this bigger target on its back for regulators. And so it's like the strengths of it in some ways are also sort of its downside. And so you sort of making this case for bitcoin, but maybe true across crypto more broadly.
00:28:07.820 - 00:29:03.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, beyond the obviously enormous humanitarian costs that we're now seeing as we have north of a million, I think a million and a half refugees now across Europe as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. We're also seeing, of course, as a result of these sanctions and just a result of the instability that we're now seeing in Eastern Europe, enormous effects on commodity prices. And so you're seeing especially oil and natural gas being the most obvious. We're probably going to see a significant spike in inflation globally because of what's going on in Russia, and that's going to magnify the effects that we've already seen the beginning of this year of the inflation in the US. It doesn't spell a great year for crypto and for broader financial markets. And you're already seeing that both in equities and in crypto prices over the last week. It's a little bit cold to sort of look at a humanitarian crisis like this in terms of the financial consequences of it.
00:29:03.660 - 00:29:33.344, Speaker A: And I'm always reminded that some of the entrepreneurs that we backed are actually in Ukraine right now. And right now every able bodied man, I think between 18 and 60 has been effectively conscripted into the Ukrainian army, and they have to fight. And so some of our entrepreneurs are right now fighting in Ukraine to protect the country from, from Putin. So it's a really terrible situation and we hope that it resolves peacefully soon, but it seems less and less likely that's going to happen.
00:29:33.542 - 00:30:40.670, Speaker C: I also want to point out that, you know, in the history of this industry actually really started quite heavily in places that I'm not sure newer members of the space might not remember, but Georgia and Ukraine. So, like Bitfury, if you remember them, I mean, they still exist, but I don't think they're anywhere near their prior stays that kind of got beat out by Bitmain. But they were at one point the largest mining miner in the world there's, founded in Ukraine. And they basically used to they spurred on a huge sort of industry of Eastern European people there's, like the Bit fury mafia, which sort of led to a lot of the developers that are in this space from like, 2015 to 1819. I'm sure a lot of them are dealing with things that are kind of not great. So kind of my thoughts out to them as well. I feel like people kind of forget that the early days of crypto were actually really romania, Ukraine and Russia were like, where every single developer was.
00:30:41.360 - 00:31:18.408, Speaker A: That's right. It's still a very important area of a lot of builders in crypto. I just wanted to close out this segment by talking about what prediction markets are saying and actually a little bit out of style. I'm actually not looking at any crypto prediction markets because they don't have a lot of liquidity. But if you look at Metaculous, which is one of the non crypto prediction markets right now, they believe that the likelihood that Kiev falls for Russia by April, so basically by the end of this month, is currently about 25%. It was much higher at the start of the invasion. It was about 90% when the invasion started.
00:31:18.408 - 00:32:00.884, Speaker A: So it seems like the tide has really turned on the likelihood of Russian success in this invasion. The likelihood that Russia controls Kiev by June is currently at 46%, meaning that people believe that it's about 50 50 that Kiev will fall to Russia within two months. So obviously, I'm hoping that Kiev is able to hold strong, but it's a tough conflict ahead of them. Anyway, let's move away from some of the more sober topics and talk a little bit more into crypto land. So one of the things that's been going on this week is there's been a huge spat of fundraising announcements. There are a lot of new funds that are launched recently. First.
00:32:00.884 - 00:32:14.984, Speaker A: We have electric. They announced $1 billion fund. This is split between two vehicles. Supposedly. One is a liquid crypto vehicle, that's 600 million. And then an early stage fund, that's 400 million. So supposedly it's a billion dollars between the two of them.
00:32:14.984 - 00:33:00.036, Speaker A: Yeah. Avico, amazing timing to have 600 million to dry powder right now when it seems like prices have come down quite a bit. You can see him there laughing at how cheap everything looks after everything that's gone on in the last few weeks. So electric's got a billion. Next up, we've got actually, this is announced today, a very interesting kind of social media bonanza. So Bain Capital announced that they were launching a $560,000,000 fund and they announced it slightly unwittingly on International Women's Day, which is today. They basically got piled on on Twitter because of the particulars around how they actually made the announcement.
00:33:00.036 - 00:33:41.776, Speaker A: I think, Tom, if you want to show one of the tweets, we had no less than marking and recent jumping on them on Twitter, as well as half of crypto Twitter. Basically, this is Dunking on them. Yeah, this is a pretty good one. Just a little on the nose, the way they tried to position themselves very proudly. I think in the announcement it was like, it is my great privilege to announce that we raised a shitload of money to invest in crypto. And people were like, yeah, you got that right. All that being said, obviously it's still a lot of money coming into crypto from top of funnel, even if it's not people buying bitcoin and ether on the public markets.
00:33:41.776 - 00:33:50.520, Speaker A: We've got VCs to the rescue to come in and bid up private deals. So I don't know, how are you guys seeing the huge influx of capital coming?
00:33:50.590 - 00:33:55.128, Speaker C: You forgot about Golden Tree, which is another $600 million fund.
00:33:55.294 - 00:34:35.668, Speaker A: That's right, Avi from BlockTower is going to run Golden Tree 600 million dollar fund. Of course we've got Andreessen's $4.5 billion fund that's in the works. My understanding is that's being fundraised right now, I believe Katie Hahn's fund, which is a billion dollars between an early stage and a growth stage fund, is also closing. So there's a lot of activity going on right now in crypto, fundraising, there's no shortage of capital coming into the space. The weird thing of course, that most of this is earmarked for private deals and there's not that much except I guess maybe some of Andreessen's fund is going into publics. But it feels like there's going to be a big mismatch between the dollars earmarked for privates and for publics for the next while.
00:34:35.668 - 00:34:36.644, Speaker A: I agree.
00:34:36.762 - 00:35:40.324, Speaker D: I mean, if huge amounts of capital go into know there's really two paths for any organization, the equity path and the token path. And obviously some of it's going to go into the equity path, but I think it's going to go into a lot of companies, foundations, organizations that create Tokens as well. And I think that's where the mismatch is. So companies with investors staying on the equity path forever, eventually they IPO and they stay equity businesses. But when there's a Token, if there's going to be 100 new projects essentially creating publicly traded assets in one way or another, you run the risk of there being a mismatch or being off equilibrium where there's too many projects and not enough demand in the later stages of its lifecycle. And so obviously some of this is going into equity deals, but a lot of it's going into projects. All of those firms mentioned that are creating tradable tokens and digital assets.
00:35:40.324 - 00:35:45.630, Speaker D: And I feel like the biggest risk is that there's too much supply and not enough demand two years from now.
00:35:46.080 - 00:36:46.524, Speaker C: I actually think the question is, are these funds structured in a way that they can hedge fund style? I guess the original paradigm fund kind of be able to do venture deals plus liquid tokens and move between them seamlessly. I suspect that that's not true because a lot of them are raised as venture funds as far as I could tell from filings and stuff. But it does beg the question of will there suddenly be also this difference in liquidity terms, where people want token warrants that go liquid faster or stuff like that. I think that's going to be the interesting thing to look at is will teams that make tokens have to deliver tokens to investors way faster than right now? Because these investors have these kind of vehicles that have a certain amount of time that they have to return by and then if they do that, then they just need the liquidity as fast as possible and then that might be bad for the market, to Robert's point, supply wise.
00:36:46.652 - 00:36:47.804, Speaker D: Or you see the opposite.
00:36:47.852 - 00:36:48.016, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:48.038 - 00:37:07.412, Speaker D: So if you have ten year vehicles, they don't need liquidity for ten years. Right. And it goes the other way, where the pendulum swings towards there's no liquidity up front for the founders, for the investors, whatever, where the market demands or the market expects that it becomes liquid over a much longer and slower period of time.
00:37:07.546 - 00:37:33.024, Speaker E: I think Tareen, you mentioned Paradigm fund, and I think the difference between now and four years ago is you can't fill up a big chunk of the fund with bitcoin or ether and expect to take two on 20 on that. Now people can just go out and buy that directly. And so if anything, it's like you can't just compare the numbers that we're seeing apples to oranges compared to four years ago. If anything, these are larger because they're exclusively bookmarked for early private venture. And so it's just like a lot.
00:37:33.062 - 00:37:35.136, Speaker A: Of money going into the market.
00:37:35.318 - 00:38:01.352, Speaker C: Yeah, although you see things like Andreessen buying a ton of lido and putting a ton of ETH into lido last week. And I feel like that suggests to me that the structure of these things does allow for some liquid purchases. And it's not like this is maybe the raise of venture funds, but the Docs probably have some kind of caveat that allows people to do some form of trading that's low frequency enough.
00:38:01.486 - 00:38:11.720, Speaker A: Well, there's nothing about a venture fund that disallows you from trading. It's not the most ideal vehicle for it. But in recent, I think all of their funds have actually have been able to buy tokens.
00:38:13.980 - 00:38:15.348, Speaker C: It's more annoying.
00:38:15.524 - 00:38:53.204, Speaker A: Yes, your team is generally not built for that, but yeah, you totally can. I think what you're also seeing is that there's just the disconnect in pricing between publics and privates. Like, I was just chatting with an investor earlier today about notional finance because actually Tom, you were talking about this earlier notional finance right now. So they're basically, what is it, like a fixed rate protocol? Their market cap, their circulating market cap right now is 6.5 million and they have 500 million TVL, 75 million fully diluted market cap. Right. Just like a hot, a hot seed round is getting done at 75 fully diluted, whereas this is like a protocol that has 500 million TDL.
00:38:53.204 - 00:39:09.470, Speaker A: So that being said, it's not just positive to just point out one protocol that doesn't have a high valuation, but it goes to show that there's just a massive, massive disconnect in supply and demand right now for what you see in privates and what you see in public.
00:39:09.920 - 00:39:27.612, Speaker E: Yeah, agreed. I think it's not just supply and demand. I think investors are also thinking about EV and they have many years to deploy. And I think if the EV of doing these private deals continues to go down, as public markets draw down, private markets are going to shrink as a result. Or we're just not going to see as many deals getting done. Things just aren't going to clear.
00:39:27.766 - 00:39:50.472, Speaker A: I mean, the only real answer is that prices have to go down and ownership has to go up, right. These things have to become more and more sort of VC coins, where VCs own a large and large chunk. Otherwise they just can't put the money to work. Other than that, I don't really see a way that this capital can get absorbed, given where prices are and how few private deals there are that can really absorb large amounts of capital and stay fully decentralized.
00:39:50.536 - 00:39:58.940, Speaker C: Last time, in 2018, this led to the equity bonanza boom of funding equity, not token related crypto companies.
00:39:59.010 - 00:39:59.196, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:59.218 - 00:40:28.596, Speaker C: And I suspect we'll probably start seeing kind of a switch in that. I kind of remember sort of electric kind of claiming that something actually wrote something in their blog post announcing the fund to be like, hey, we're going to start doing more companies, less tokens. Or not exactly that, but it had that sort of intonation, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's what they told LPs that, hey, we're entering the new phase of companies need capital for being in crypto, not just tokens.
00:40:28.708 - 00:41:03.708, Speaker D: I mean, I think you're already seeing it. I'm not picking on companies like Alchemy, but you have companies that have absolutely bonkers valuations for their traction and revenue like Alchemy, because they can absorb and soak up a lot of capital from investors. And it's a palatable, politically correct company, right, where there's no token risk. It's like, yeah, you can shove hundreds of millions of dollars into it at increasing valuations, and the valuation can get really in front of the traction. And I think you're already seeing that.
00:41:03.814 - 00:41:06.708, Speaker C: Who's the last buyer? That's the hard part.
00:41:06.874 - 00:41:08.980, Speaker D: Yeah. Eventually it has to be an IPO.
00:41:09.400 - 00:41:10.150, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:10.600 - 00:41:15.860, Speaker C: Well, Silver Lake, who's very famous for looks at watch buying Skype.
00:41:17.020 - 00:41:21.080, Speaker A: They've done some great deals, though. They've done some great deals. I think they made a killing off airbnb.
00:41:21.420 - 00:41:25.144, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm just pointing out that, you know it right.
00:41:25.342 - 00:41:28.008, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. Right.
00:41:28.174 - 00:41:34.300, Speaker D: When private companies with modest revenue are trading for, like $5 billion, you should be worried.
00:41:34.800 - 00:41:35.452, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:35.586 - 00:41:44.700, Speaker C: To be fair, though, the ML boom was no different. I remember seeing price to revenue on some of these self driving car, not even just self driving car companies, just like perception.
00:41:44.780 - 00:41:46.844, Speaker A: AI revenue. None of them had revenue.
00:41:46.972 - 00:41:55.068, Speaker C: Well, they all would like, sign an Loi and claim that that was revenue. But yeah, let's ignore all the growth hacking tricks.
00:41:55.084 - 00:42:02.928, Speaker A: I mean, Alchemy is very different because it's just like a very easy to underwrite business, right? You get customers, you advertise, you get them in, you have SaaS pricing.
00:42:03.024 - 00:42:23.532, Speaker C: I mean, for all of these staking service providers at the one to $10 billion range, right? Like Block Damon was like three something figments, like 1.6, whatever. Let's just pretend that they dominate and AWS has to buy someone. Would they actually buy them at that price? That thought experiment is the one that.
00:42:23.586 - 00:42:29.980, Speaker D: Kind of confuses no, they'd build. They would build because the technology is able to be built. Right.
00:42:30.050 - 00:42:39.650, Speaker C: Also, all of those people use AWS, so they just can easily snoop on their traffic. That would be what I would do if I was in AWS, right?
00:42:40.500 - 00:43:05.284, Speaker A: Actually, I doubt that AWS would build, but they don't need to buy the I mean, that's the problem with all these staking providers, that they basically all the same product. It's like very fungible, it's very replaceable. It's just a matter of the overall security and the kind of balance sheet that's backing them in case they get slashed or they mess up. So if AWS needs to buy somebody, they don't need to buy the biggest player. Like, I don't know why you would you don't really need to yeah, Amazon.
00:43:05.332 - 00:43:08.410, Speaker D: Should buy lido tokens on the open market. That's the.
00:43:10.940 - 00:43:13.964, Speaker C: Disclosure of we are actually.
00:43:14.002 - 00:43:52.824, Speaker A: I think all of us are lido investors, so it's a tricky situation. And I think for us, I think probably the way that we want to be playing at Dragonfly, the investing over the next year, given the mismatch in supply and demand of capital, is just one. Staying out of the US. Where you're seeing these things getting done at like north of 100 X revenue, you just go outside of the US. Even whether it's emerging markets or Laddam or Asia, things are much, much lower than 100 X revenue or even 70 X revenue, where I'm seeing a lot of deals getting done in the US even now at those multiples. So I think that's a large part of the answer for us. And then also just stay early stage, because if you're early stage enough, then seed always works.
00:43:52.824 - 00:43:55.812, Speaker A: No matter where you are in the market cycle, seed always works. Doesn't necessarily.
00:43:55.876 - 00:43:59.640, Speaker C: The problem is all the big gorillas are coming down to seed.
00:44:00.380 - 00:44:02.510, Speaker A: They can't how are they going to.
00:44:03.600 - 00:44:04.904, Speaker C: That'S what they're proclaiming.
00:44:04.952 - 00:44:15.976, Speaker A: Let's put that yes, that is what they're proclaiming. That is what they're proclaiming. But listen to the economics, right? If a seed bet is like a basis point of your fund, it doesn't make sense. Like, you're not going to be spending.
00:44:16.008 - 00:44:19.280, Speaker C: Well, then you spray and pray at a thousand of those, right?
00:44:19.350 - 00:44:38.504, Speaker A: The question is simply can your brand withstand that, right? Like are you going to keep winning those deals when people know that you're just spraying and praying it eventually catches up to you. Right. It takes some time for the market signal to propagate, but eventually it gets there. Right? Like you don't give your seed round to just doesn't it's not how it works. And eventually that signal catches up. That's my view. That's my view.
00:44:38.504 - 00:44:54.844, Speaker A: Anyway, let's move on. So another big news item of the week is Andre Cronier. Andre once again rage quit supposedly this time for the final time. He announced a sunset for all the projects that he's been responsible for. Great illustration to.
00:44:54.962 - 00:44:56.424, Speaker E: I gotta love cointelegraph.
00:44:56.472 - 00:45:24.580, Speaker A: Gotta love coin. Telegraph always on it always on it just the great. So obviously associated with urine, although he hasn't been active on urine for quite a while supposedly according to banteg, also involved in phantom, also involved in solidly. A lot of the projects in the Andreo sphere have tanked in price since the announcement of his defection. How do people feel about the Andre rug pull as it's been called?
00:45:24.730 - 00:45:37.592, Speaker D: I view it as a rug pull. I mean the dude has according to people on Twitter amassed like a billion dollars of wealth for himself and is leaving with no sense of responsibility towards.
00:45:37.646 - 00:45:45.676, Speaker C: I don't know if you're going to be able to sell that much MIM and abracadabra just as a heads don't, don't mark to market on that one.
00:45:45.778 - 00:46:24.648, Speaker D: Yeah well even if you're not marking to mean I think know probably one of the most legendary figures in all of DeFi, not crypto but DeFi history. Like the most legendary marketer of new projects. He started so many projects. He is a genius in so many right like and I have a lot of respect for him in so many ways. But I feel like this was almost an inevitable end state which know after project know, you just call it quits and right off into the sunset with a billion dollars and that's know, I don't know.
00:46:24.654 - 00:47:01.636, Speaker E: I mean obviously I have immense respect for Andre. I think urine is great and I think the whole wi fi distribution and giving away was incredible. And there's very few people who I think has his kind of character in building chops frankly, just in terms of shipping ability. But I will say maybe I'm not in the Andre fan club in that the tough part in building products is not shipping is that is tough alone. But it's like finding product market fit and iterating and building something that's sticky. I would say very, very few things. Basically nothing frankly outside of yearn has had that that Andre has produced and.
00:47:01.658 - 00:47:06.790, Speaker C: You got to give Benteg all the credit and others for 100 years.
00:47:07.560 - 00:47:09.304, Speaker E: Urine is substantially better.
00:47:09.502 - 00:47:18.168, Speaker C: Speaking of our Russian and Ukrainian projects, urine is like all of these people, it's like 50 people in Russia and Ukraine for the most part urine is.
00:47:18.174 - 00:47:21.628, Speaker D: Not andre urine is a huge team of incredibly skilled people.
00:47:21.714 - 00:47:25.900, Speaker A: It's people who took it over from Andre. Right. Andre sort of basically orphaned urine.
00:47:26.320 - 00:47:45.360, Speaker E: Anyway, I'll say that's really where I think the true entrepreneurs are made, is in grinding it out and sticking out through many different iterations of the product until you find something that works. And it's pretty easy to just launch a bunch of stuff and then bail when you don't get product market fit. I think that is not as impressive.
00:47:45.700 - 00:48:19.004, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I wouldn't say I'm an Andre fan nor an Andre detractor. I feel for the guy. I can imagine how difficult it must be to be in that position where you're constantly getting pulled in so many different directions and you've got the Internet yelling at you no matter what you do. And he's been very public about his emotional experience being a builder in DeFi. And I feel for the guy, but I also feel like this is not the most responsible way to go. I get it. And I can't fault a man for following his heart and his conviction, but it does suck to see someone leave that way.
00:48:19.202 - 00:48:33.296, Speaker C: I may be more sympathetic than everyone else here, but I do think Phantom was kind of a very ill fated experiment to actually follow through on the promises that were made there I think.
00:48:33.398 - 00:48:36.240, Speaker A: Was way above one of the promises for Phantom.
00:48:36.320 - 00:48:38.790, Speaker C: I'm not super clear to be what AVAX is.
00:48:39.400 - 00:48:40.832, Speaker D: Here's my conspiracy theory.
00:48:40.896 - 00:48:41.172, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:41.226 - 00:49:04.136, Speaker D: And this is the extremely bearish take on the situation. Phantom presented itself as an opportunity where there's basically an unused blockchain. And Andre saw this as an opportunity to as a magnet, bring users and bring activity to Phantom when Phantom was unloved, unused and extremely cheap.
00:49:04.248 - 00:49:06.680, Speaker A: Right, so it's like his X die.
00:49:06.760 - 00:49:26.480, Speaker D: Yeah. And he basically was able to create the entire Phantom ecosystem himself, essentially. So, like Anne, I'm to be extremely grateful to him for know, I saw one incredible chart this week that during the mania of Andre quitting, transaction volume on Phantom exceeded that on ethereum. For a brief moment in time.
00:49:26.630 - 00:49:28.224, Speaker C: That was the Geist launch.
00:49:28.352 - 00:49:52.476, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, if you asked me a year ago if Phantom activity would exceed ethereum activity ever, I would have laughed at you. Right. But that was made a reality and he single handedly created that now, selfishly, did he probably profit from that? Massively. Yes, absolutely. Right. He basically probably owned a large portion of Phantom before being the sole magnet to bring users and activity and transactions to it.
00:49:52.476 - 00:50:01.188, Speaker D: Right. And the sole champion, to be honest. He was like basically the loudest champion and developer that the entire chain had, like by two orders of magnitude.
00:50:01.304 - 00:50:02.064, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:02.262 - 00:50:07.760, Speaker D: And that succeeded. And Phantom today is like, what, top 20? I mean, it's crazy.
00:50:07.910 - 00:50:09.676, Speaker A: I don't think it's top 20 anymore.
00:50:09.868 - 00:50:11.244, Speaker D: Right. Maybe not anymore.
00:50:11.292 - 00:50:14.752, Speaker A: Maybe it's 39. It's very not top 20 anymore.
00:50:14.816 - 00:50:24.608, Speaker D: Now it's 39, but it's still a $4 billion blockchain. That was a hundred million dollar blockchain not long ago. Look like Prion.
00:50:24.704 - 00:50:40.020, Speaker C: We all can agree that Andre is like, a genius. He's a genius at activist investing. Phantom was like, probably one of the greatest active investing coups that we've seen in crypto, period.
00:50:40.100 - 00:50:40.900, Speaker D: Agreed.
00:50:41.060 - 00:51:05.276, Speaker A: It shows the danger of having your reliance on a single person, especially when that person is not kind of tied to you the way that a founder might be. Right. Because Andre sort of adopted Phantom, and if you adopt a blockchain, you can just as soon drop. Mean, the one big difference between Phantom and AVAX is Goon, who's one of the co founders of AVAX. Goon is not going to rage quit. Right. Goon is not going anywhere.
00:51:05.276 - 00:51:15.820, Speaker A: He's tied to the hip to that thing, whereas Andre can leave whenever he wants. And when you have that enormous level of dependence on a single know you're like Germany and Russia.
00:51:15.920 - 00:51:23.828, Speaker D: However, EOS is the counterexample where all the folks around EOS bailed, and it was their blockchain.
00:51:23.924 - 00:51:29.336, Speaker A: Right, that's true. That's true. I guess. Yeah. That's the importance of not letting that.
00:51:29.358 - 00:51:31.676, Speaker C: Was a reg pool, not a rug pull.
00:51:31.858 - 00:51:32.590, Speaker D: Reg.
00:51:33.600 - 00:51:38.590, Speaker E: R-E-G. Oh, I think my joke was better, but whatever.
00:51:40.320 - 00:51:42.110, Speaker D: You guys tied for best.
00:51:43.120 - 00:52:15.208, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Tom gets runner up for best joke of that segment. So last up, I wanted to also drop this because it's a little bit of a self plug, but screw it, we're running the show. So this week we announced this blog post that we've been working on for a very, very long time called the AMM Test. A no bullshit look at l one performance. And in this test, basically what we did is we benchmarked all of the major EVM based layer ones alongside Salana, try to see they make large claims for themselves about how much performance they can actually do.
00:52:15.208 - 00:52:45.664, Speaker A: And the question is, okay, if you take a fair benchmark, the fair benchmark we came up with was being uniswap style, uniswap v two style trades. What is the actual trades per second that you can get both at equilibrium and at Max throughput on each of these chains? And the answer was maybe lower than what you'd expect. So I think Ethereum was like ten. Salana was about 270. Avalanche was about 37, I think, or something at equilibrium. But then Max was like 170. Binance smart chain, by far the largest of the EVMs at, I think, like 190.
00:52:45.664 - 00:53:29.536, Speaker A: So that gives you a good sense of what kind of throughput blockchains can actually do today. And we thought that this was really important because we saw, especially among entrepreneurs, so much misunderstanding about how much throughput these projects can actually do and when, of course, when they release their own numbers. And this is true even of companies that we've invested in, when they release their own numbers. Their benchmarks that they use are very misleading because they're usually all transfers and they're almost always done on testnets, which are completely unrepresentative of what real smart contract engineers are going to be doing on these chains. And so we ended up publishing this and getting some love and then the Solana crowd got really mad at us. And I think to be fair, you.
00:53:29.558 - 00:53:31.490, Speaker C: Did kind of go after them.
00:53:32.340 - 00:53:35.990, Speaker A: Look, we kind of have to, right? They're the king. You got to go out.
00:53:37.160 - 00:54:10.476, Speaker C: I think the interesting thing that this brought up in general is just this idea that a blockchains are pretty cool because you can actually go test this. So first of all, that's like an improvement, right? You can test this without you committing a ton of resources versus like, if I want to measure some SaaS startups claim on AWS, it's a lot more nuanced to actually be able to do that. In fact, there are companies that do that for you. And it's interesting there's going to be.
00:54:10.498 - 00:54:13.660, Speaker D: A Bureau of Weights and Measures for blockchains in like 20.
00:54:13.730 - 00:55:12.896, Speaker C: Yeah, well, it's going to be all the funds who are invested in one blockchain. So I'm not doing it. But kind of like this, this seems like to be the way I would expect it to play out. But the interesting thing I thought from the Twitter commentary was this fact of people caring about message types of like, how many messages do we consider consensus messages, how many messages do we consider non consensus messages? And if you consider consensus messages in your transactions and in your TPS rate, that's kind of like juicing it a bit right, because you're like, hey, those had to happen anyway. And those aren't necessarily messages that are economic transactions. So I think the interesting thing we're going to see is that we're going to have non fungibility of accounting over time in all these metrics and it's only going to increase because no one's incentivized to make a homogeneous thing. Instead, you're going to have the cat and mouse game of people like you guys going and do.
00:55:12.998 - 00:55:51.900, Speaker A: I mean, that's the role of benchmarking, right? The whole point of a benchmark is to have a third party that isn't any of the parties involved. That's a go in and run a neutral test. Yeah, exactly. That's reproducible. And so we put all the code on GitHub so people can go run the test themselves and post their numbers. Now, the question of methodology is a fair one, right? Because when we benchmark Solana, one of the things that makes Solana not ideal for this particular test is that this test really only measures a single threaded execution of a single uniswap pool. And Solana has this concept that actually nobody we talked to actually understood how Solana worked.
00:55:51.900 - 00:56:31.820, Speaker A: So we had to go in and go through a bunch of shit ourselves. That none of the validators, none of the people. Even on the Salana team could explain it to us. So we had to go to the source material and go into the code ourselves and understand how Salana has this notion of compute units, which is kind of like gas but not exactly like gas. And there's a limit of 12 million compute units per block per account and there's 48 million that you can total be in a block. So which means that if you wanted to max out uniswap trades, you could do four different uniswap pools. So provided that there's no that they're completely segregated in state, you could do four uniswap pools simultaneously within a single block.
00:56:31.820 - 00:57:32.108, Speaker A: But of course we did not include the consensus overhead because as you mentioned Tarun, every block on Solana, the consensus messages are part of the on chain transactions which fill up a block, which is weird because no other blockchain does that. So in order to get a real apples to apples about what can you actually do at user level? The real metrics you care about is like what can a user do or what actual throughput can applications get on top of Solana? To really get the apples to apples is complex, but of course none of these other blockchains are multi threaded in that way. You can't paralyze uniswap trades on any other blockchain. So a truly fair benchmark would involve multiple things, not just, okay, how many trades can you get on a single uniswap pool? But of course when Solana goes down it's because there's a single pool or a single ido or a single thing that everyone's sniping at. And this is the reason why it goes down is because it gets overloaded on a kind of single piece of state that's in high contention.
00:57:32.284 - 00:58:14.440, Speaker C: Well, I think the other thing that's interesting about their compute model that probably also makes this even more annoying is that technically the user is supposed to provide dependencies to some extent to state, and obviously, I'm sure literally zero wallets do that and they just try to run everything serially. And so then you get this weird thing where there was some extra parallelism but the user can't figure out how to send the right transactions to take advantage of it, which I think is way less common in other sort of chains because basically EVM, even though it's annoying, assumes the user is an idiot. Which is kind of the goal.
00:58:16.000 - 00:58:19.960, Speaker A: The EVM is trying to move to stateless clients as well. Right? That's on the e two roadmap.
00:58:20.040 - 00:58:28.050, Speaker C: Well trust me, everything's on the e two, they're going to have Celestia now soon. Right? Dank sharding. It's like what isn't on the e two roadmap is the better question.
00:58:28.820 - 00:58:34.236, Speaker D: My takeaway, and this was the important one to me, was that all of the blockchains almost equally suck.
00:58:34.428 - 00:58:36.608, Speaker A: Well, if you look at the graph, they don't all equally suck, but they.
00:58:36.614 - 00:58:40.668, Speaker C: All suck relative to claims relative to claims relative to claims.
00:58:40.684 - 00:59:08.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I say relative to claims, the spread between blockchains is much smaller than advertised. I think that's the big thing and the ultimate thing is it's not to say that none of these blockchains will get there. Right. I'm bullish that Solana will figure out a lot of these things. And the reality is a lot of these blockchains are just not very optimized. They haven't been around that long, and the workloads that they're going to be under are surprising to the founders involved. And so there's a lot of work that can be done both at the smart contract layer but also at the infrastructure layer, to just optimize the hell out of these things.
00:59:08.620 - 00:59:14.124, Speaker A: So I'm going to guess there's at least like a four or five X you can get just out of optimizing the current workloads.
00:59:14.252 - 00:59:24.400, Speaker C: We didn't talk about the failure of the week. Actually, speaking of this now you remember me, which is Evmos. Quite an epic fail.
00:59:25.160 - 00:59:32.276, Speaker A: I feel like it's unfair to talk about, like, a blockchain stumbling in its first week of launch. I feel like I agree with that.
00:59:32.298 - 00:59:38.630, Speaker C: But the this was an interesting what happened. We can save that.
00:59:40.280 - 00:59:42.052, Speaker A: Give us a TLDR. Give us a TLDR.
00:59:42.196 - 00:59:53.116, Speaker C: I think the best view of the TLDR is a lot of people beforehand were talking about how the code base was not super well thoroughly tested before you got there.
00:59:53.138 - 01:00:20.452, Speaker A: True. And so quick background. So Evmos is an EVM compatible Cosmos chain that was very hyped up. There was no pre mine. There was going to be this drop. Everybody in the Cosmos ecosystem was very excited about the launch of Evmos. And after the initial launch, there was a protocol upgrade, and the protocol upgrade failed and the chain halted, and it's still in a halted state as of right now, is my understanding, while the Validators try to figure out how to get the system back up and running.
01:00:20.586 - 01:01:06.208, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a pretty good summary. I think the main thing that has been its issue is that Degens are still trying to they're having this problem where the Validators are trying to restart the chain, and within 2 seconds, there's 5 million transactions trying. It's kind of like the Solana restart problem, except at Genesis. It's a lot harder to have that happen right at birth. And it's sort of a little bit weird. I mean, there is this kind of interesting thing. If you compare Validator communities and say Solana or AVAX to Cosmos, there's a lot more DIY Validators and a lot more sort of like it's just a more diverse set of Validators, if we're going to be honest.
01:01:06.208 - 01:01:33.388, Speaker C: And the cat herding to get this kind of off the ground is a little bit crazy. And I feel like they really rushed the launch because they hyped up the drop and they didn't do a lot of testing. Their testnet was live for like, three weeks, two weeks. It was a very short testing period because they Hyped up this drop where Anyone Who'd Ever Been Sandwich attacked On Ethereum would automatically get a ton of Evmos. My real Question Is, is there going.
01:01:33.394 - 01:01:34.616, Speaker E: To Be a Wrecked squared drop?
01:01:34.648 - 01:01:37.710, Speaker C: Like if I got wrecked on the wrecked drop, do I get another?
01:01:40.080 - 01:01:42.504, Speaker A: You should launch a Fork that has a wreck.
01:01:42.552 - 01:02:01.380, Speaker C: No, I mean, I wish them all luck. I feel like if they just didn't hype it so much, it would have been easier to launch this thing. And now they're instead, like there's like this bot army ready to try to collect all of the drops. And so it'll be a little bit dicey, I think.
01:02:01.530 - 01:02:08.196, Speaker A: Yeah. Ironically, their attempt to reward people for being victims mev has now made them a massive victim to me.
01:02:08.218 - 01:02:23.290, Speaker C: V they should have tried to do it on the testnet. Like test the rec drop out first on the testnet before going straight to prod with it. I Think that's the thing that because It's a novel Mechanism, and it's Worth kind of like, making sure it works first.
01:02:23.680 - 01:02:28.264, Speaker A: How do you actually prove that you were Sandwich attacked on ethereum? Do they just have a snapshot?
01:02:28.312 - 01:02:38.930, Speaker C: They just did a snapshot. All the addresses they did a snapshot. But the problem is, it's like part of their consensus that you can claim it. So It's like a consensus Rule that's built in.
01:02:39.380 - 01:02:40.304, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
01:02:40.422 - 01:02:45.750, Speaker C: It's very tightly coupled in A way that is not Great.
01:02:46.680 - 01:02:47.620, Speaker A: Got It.
01:02:47.770 - 01:03:06.264, Speaker C: But I think it'll be interesting. The Cosmos ecosystem is interesting because it's grown so much organically. Without any bridges, it's basically impossible to get from ETH. To cosmos without going through Luna. And going from ETH. To Luna, to cosmos is like without.
01:03:06.302 - 01:03:16.220, Speaker A: Any bridges, you say? Is it a little strange that Cosmos has been so successful without Bridges? I thought the whole idea was supposed to be the interoperability.
01:03:16.720 - 01:03:28.544, Speaker C: No, no, sorry. Without bridges. To ETH. To get people's capital over. I mean, more like hey, when you grow these ecosystems, you need to be able to let people onboard their capital from other places that they have.
01:03:28.662 - 01:03:45.750, Speaker A: No, no, I know. I'm being facetious. Yeah. We were early investors in cosmos. And I love the Cosmos vision. I think they've done very well. But I'm still a little bit mystified at what's really going on in the ecosystem, because it does feel like a lot of face planting that's been going on in the last couple of months.
01:03:45.750 - 01:03:49.210, Speaker A: But it seems the momentum behind Cosmos is really, really strong.
01:03:49.580 - 01:04:11.676, Speaker C: Yeah. And I do think the IBC user experience is 100 million times better than the bridges. It is just coherent. I think the real problem is the luna. Luna actually has made its own little territory that tries to make the UX difficult for some of the cosmo. Those wallets.
01:04:11.868 - 01:04:31.710, Speaker A: Yeah. But Ultimately, when Most Of The Value is outside of Cosmos, that Is Where IBC really struggles when you're outside of the kind of cosmos walled garden. Anyway, we're over time, so we should call it here. Thank you, everybody, for tuning in again this week. And we'll be back in a fortnight from now. Thanks, everyone.
