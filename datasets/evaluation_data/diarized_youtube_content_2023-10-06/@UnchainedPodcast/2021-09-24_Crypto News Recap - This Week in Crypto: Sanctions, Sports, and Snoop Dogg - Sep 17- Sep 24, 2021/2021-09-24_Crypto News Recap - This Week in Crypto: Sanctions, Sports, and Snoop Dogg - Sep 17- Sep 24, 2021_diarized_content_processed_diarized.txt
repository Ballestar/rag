According to Chainalysis, the blockchain analytics company that helped OFAC in this case, SUEX deposit addresses, quote received over $160,000,000 in bitcoin from ransomware actors, scammers and darknet market operators. The exchange is now officially listed on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List barring us.
00:00:58.694 - 00:01:13.086, Speaker A: Residents and businesses from interacting with the firm. The move comes shortly after a Wall Street Journal article last Friday reported Treasury's intent to target crypto ransomware payments with sanctions. Next Headline Twitter rolls out verified avatars.

For hardcore bitcoiners, Twitter will allow users to utilize Strike, a Lightning network based payment app to send tips. Bitcoin tips went live starting Thursday on all iOS devices. In addition to bitcoin tips, Twitter shared plans to explore NFTs for authentication. Think blue check marks but for NFTs, said Twitter executive Esther Crawford, quote we're interested in basically making it somehow visually clear that this is an authenticated avatar and then give you some interesting info and insight about the provenance of that NFT.
00:02:03.190 - 00:02:04.370, Speaker B: Next headline.
00:02:04.710 - 00:02:41.530, Speaker A: Binance is under investigation for insider trading. Bloomberg reported last Friday. That us. Officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are investigating the world's most popular exchange for possible insider trading and market manipulation. According to Bloomberg, the CFTC is looking into whether Binance or its staff took advantage of its customers to generate profit. Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg says that the CFTC has contacted, quote, potential witnesses as part of its inquiry. For now, Binance is not formally accused of committing any wrongdoing, and it is unclear if the investigation will lead to any actions from the regulator.
00:02:41.530 - 00:02:47.970, Speaker A: The exchange is already under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service and Department of justice, as well as the CFTC.
00:02:49.110 - 00:02:50.290, Speaker B: Next headline.
00:02:51.110 - 00:03:39.166, Speaker A: Robinhood users will soon have crypto wallet capability. Robinhood is planning to roll out its highly anticipated crypto wallet and transfer features starting in October. With Wallets, users will be able to transfer ETH, BTC, Doge and other supported tokens. Off platform security features like identity verification, multi factor authentication, and email and phone verification will be implemented for storing crypto on Robinhood. According to Christine Brown, chief operating officer at Robinhood Crypto, the trading platform will slowly launch its crypto wallets, with only a small group of customers testing the Alpha program next month. More customers will be able to join later through a waitlist. At publishing time, there are at least 115,000 users on the initial waitlist, which is less than 1% of the 13 million crypto traders on Robinhood.
00:03:39.166 - 00:04:19.520, Speaker A: Perhaps the reason for the low waitlist number can be attributed to the fact that Robinhood crypto traders are dogecoin dominant. In Q, 262 percent of crypto revenue came from Dogecoin trading alone. However, data from Bit Info charts shows that Dogecoin is not widely used in actual blockchain transactions. Despite its popularity in Robinhood, Dogecoin facilitates far fewer daily transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum. For example, on Wednesday, Dogecoin executed 16,000 transactions, while Bitcoin executed 275,000 and Ethereum saw 1.17 million, respectively. It will be interesting to see if Robinhood's new wallet feature will affect such numbers going forward.
00:04:19.520 - 00:05:06.126, Speaker A: Next Headline The Evergrande news was not grand for the crypto market as concerns around Evergrande, the heavily indebted Chinese property giant, caught momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with traditional and crypto markets, took a big hit on Monday and Tuesday. Bitcoin dropped to $40,835, while Ethereum dipped below $3,000 for the first time since early August. According to the Crypt, over $1.2 billion in crypto futures were liquidated in just 24 hours in traditional markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Monday, down 600 points. The dip was most likely related to negative sentiment regarding Evergrande's balance sheet, which showed over $300 billion in debt, an amount that some analysts believe the company would not be able to pay back.
00:05:06.126 - 00:05:17.380, Speaker A: However, on Wednesday, Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, calming the tumultuous market. The total crypto market cap jumped 6% on Wednesday, according to data from Coin market cap.

La Liga will have its own marketplace on Dapper's Flow Blockchain, where NFT moments and highlights with varying degrees of rarity will be bought and sold. The Dapper Labs news comes right on the heels of two similar announcements from So Rare, an Ethereum based NFT fantasy soccer game. On Tuesday, So Rare announced a raise of $680,000,000, valuing the NFT company at $4.3 billion. The latest funding run was led by SoftBank. So Rare also signed an exclusive partnership deal with La Liga to issue NFTs for its players less than two weeks ago.
00:06:30.120 - 00:07:07.278, Speaker A: Regarding the overlap between So Rare and Dapper, Dapper Lab CEO Roham Garagoslu believes there is room for both platforms. He told CoinDesk, quote Companies like Soware can be complementary to us, adding they're much more focused on fantasy, while video is very important to us and sets us apart.
