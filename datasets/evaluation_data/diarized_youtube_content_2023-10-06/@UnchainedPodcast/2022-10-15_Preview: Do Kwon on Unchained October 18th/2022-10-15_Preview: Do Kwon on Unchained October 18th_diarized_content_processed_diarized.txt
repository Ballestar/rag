00:00:08.330 - 00:00:23.520, Speaker A: I would never do anything, not that I could, that are adversarial to the interests of the Terra network. Terra USD is currently the fourth largest stablecoin in the world within a relatively recent future. Looking at its current growth trajectory, I think it's going to be number three relatively soon.
00:00:23.970 - 00:00:38.162, Speaker B: Back in April, Luna, which is a token that governs Terra's ecosystem and helps keep UST at $1, hit an all time high of $116. As of Thursday morning eastern time, it was trading at around one cent.
00:00:38.316 - 00:00:48.470, Speaker C: The problem here was that he was aggressively calling everyone that tried to point out flaws, retarded and useless and spreading FUD.
00:00:48.550 - 00:00:56.938, Speaker A: From my private conversations with a lot of people at the time, there was actually plenty of people who didn't think that it would work, that the whole thing was doomed to implode.
00:00:57.034 - 00:01:15.310, Speaker C: Do Kwan claims that he is not on the run, which is a kind of on the run thing to say. I just wouldn't even think of it as a stablecoin. Like, if you wanted it to exist, it would have to exist in such a way that it was not really being granted as a stablecoin, it was being granted as an algorithmic. Weird kind of thing in Jiggle.
00:01:15.850 - 00:01:17.110, Speaker B: Welcome. Doe.
00:01:17.690 - 00:01:18.980, Speaker A: Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me.
