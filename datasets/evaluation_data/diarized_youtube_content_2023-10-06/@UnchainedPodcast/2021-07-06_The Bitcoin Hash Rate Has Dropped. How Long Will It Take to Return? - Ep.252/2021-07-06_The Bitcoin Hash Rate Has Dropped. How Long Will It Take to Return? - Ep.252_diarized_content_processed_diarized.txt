00:01:36.910 - 00:01:38.650, Speaker A: Thanks for having me on. Laura.
00:01:39.310 - 00:01:50.270, Speaker B: Before we get into all the bitcoin mining news, and there is a lot of it, why don't we just start with your background because you're kind of like a crypto OG. Tell us how you got into bitcoin.
00:01:50.610 - 00:02:23.370, Speaker A: Sure thing. So, like many others, I'd heard about bitcoin quite early, back in college in 2011, and I actually wrote it off it's. Oh, it's magic Internet money. Nothing just goes to thousands. I'm not really backed by anything, and I kind of disregarded it for several years. But then it came back to me when I was quite bored of my corporate finance job at Ford, and it was actually through some of my video gaming friends, world of Warcraft, they introduced me to bitcoin mining. And that particular friend that introduced me to it, he was childhood friends with Roger Beard.
00:02:23.370 - 00:02:42.110, Speaker A: And when he told me that he was building a mining operation out in California and he was looking for someone that had a background in finance, could speak Chinese to work with the manufacturers, and a passion for technology, I was sold right away. So I packed my bags and I flew to California to kind of pursue this crazy bitcoin mining endeavor.
00:02:43.490 - 00:02:52.782, Speaker B: I love that story. And tell us where you worked there because I think that you worked at some companies that were associated with Roger Veer.
00:02:52.926 - 00:03:32.958, Speaker A: Oh, absolutely. So prior to me joining Roger@bitcoin.com, I was working on several different large scale projects in North America. So I spoke about there was this project out in california? Well, very quickly we learned in late 2014 how difficult it is to operate and maintain a mining facility in very hot climates like California. We also needed cheaper electricity and more scale. So we eventually refounded the business up in Montana, and that became known as Project Spokane, which eventually got acquired by a group called HyperBlock in 2016. That was what we claim was one of the largest facilities, if not the largest in North America at the time.
00:03:32.958 - 00:04:06.266, Speaker A: Eventually, I did join Roger Over@bitcoin.com, helped him with his bitcoin mining operations and bringing business to bitcoin com's mining pool. Eventually, I did find my way back into the US. I worked on a project called Gridge Generation, which was a very large scale natural gas power plant and first fully compliant behind the meter mining operation for bitcoin out of the power plant. I guess that caught the attention of those at DCG. And I joined mike and Barry here at foundry Digital. All right.
00:04:06.288 - 00:04:14.318, Speaker B: Yeah. And we'll dive a little bit more into some of the details there later on. So tell us, what does Foundry do and what do you do there?
00:04:14.484 - 00:04:34.786, Speaker A: Sure. So I'm the vice president of business operations or business development here at Foundry. Foundry is a decentralized infrastructure play for Digital currency group. What that means is we provide services in the infrastructure layer for both proof of work and proof of stake. But my guess is for today we're mainly going to focus on the bitcoin mining side.
00:04:34.968 - 00:04:42.920, Speaker B: All right. So why did DCG decide to start Foundry? Because they had been industry players for quite a while before doing so.
00:04:43.370 - 00:05:17.454, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. Prior to me joining DCG, I was at Greenwich. We were looking to raise capital and partner up with many of the known staples within the crypto community and investors. And there was this saying that was being passed around where a lot of the more institutional investors, they were saying, friends, don't let friends mine. And clearly there was something that was missing there. And what it all came down to was we realized the bitcoin mining space needed cleaning up, for lack of better term. It really was quite a shit show, especially for Westerners.
00:05:17.454 - 00:05:58.842, Speaker A: Trying to break into the market certainly lacks a lot of transparency. It's very opaque. Lead times for deliveries can be very long. It's a very risky and capital intensive endeavor, and most people have typically shied away from it. And DCG, our mission is to build a better financial system for the future. And part of that is bringing in institutional adopters, right? And to get that institutional adoption, you got to make the industry more mature, bring more transparency and credibility. So we realized that we have an ability and opportunity to leverage our balance sheet, our capital and our reputation to break into mining ecosystem and really clean up the ecosystem for other investors to kind of follow the path that we're leading.
00:05:58.842 - 00:06:51.502, Speaker A: A clear example would be, let's say with both our subsidiaries and sister companies at Grayscale and Genesis. They're dealing with a lot of flow and a lot of coins that they're custody or that are from customers are looking to generate yield returns on the crypto that we're managing for them. Well, when you're dealing with billions of dollars in digital assets, it's very difficult to trust, let's say, two college students in a dorm room for their staking service. And we realize that as the space needs to be more mature and institutionalized, should first be able to serve our own sister companies and portfolio companies. And if we can provide an institutional product internally, then we can offer it to others. And the same is true with mining. I've mentioned before that there's all these risks with not only procuring the miners, but also building your facility, knowing to invest in what colocation and sites to work with.
00:06:51.502 - 00:06:57.026, Speaker A: And we wanted to bring our credibility experience to the table and just to.
00:06:57.048 - 00:07:28.058, Speaker B: Kind of draw out the issues there. It's that when you talk about the delay in purchasing miners, it could be that you calculate what your costs would be and figure out whether or not you could be profitable based on the price at any given time and the difficulty your electricity costs. But as time goes by, those factors start to change a little bit, and then that could affect whether or not you could have a profitable operation by the time the miners arrive. Is that kind of what some of the issues are there?
00:07:28.224 - 00:07:56.898, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I think one of the most critical things that a lot of investors and market participants miss when they enter into the mining space is timing. Right. To actually be quite countercyclical, where usually if you're buying and purchasing miners or building your sites, when the economics are very profitable, usually it's too frothy. And by the time you actually get your operations online and units are delivered, they're very long lead times. Right. We're talking six to nine months, if not a year.
00:07:56.898 - 00:08:06.470, Speaker A: So by the time you actually get your equipment and everything powered on, the economics are no longer there because the rest of the competition has either cut up or the markets have themselves corrected.
00:08:07.530 - 00:08:24.480, Speaker B: All right. Yeah. So now that we understand a little bit what the mindset is of a mine operator, let's now talk about the news coming out of China regarding mining. Obviously, there's been this ban that's been in the news. Why don't you tell us what happened?
00:08:25.250 - 00:09:13.562, Speaker A: Sure. So this may be quite long tangent, but I think there's a lot of things to cover. Right. The way I look at how China is cracking down on mining and crypto regulations in general, it's not focused only on mining. The CCP and China as a country main focus is social stability and maintaining their authority and the status quo by making sure everything is under control. And that is oftentimes challenged when crypto is in everyone's faces, everyone's fervent investor, right? And it's on top of everyone's mind. And I vividly recall that in the middle of believe it was May, friends texted me from China.
00:09:13.562 - 00:10:11.482, Speaker A: They were like, hey, Grayscale, DCG and Barry, they're on CCTV too. Right? So when you have a state ran news channel that's broadcasting on cryptocurrencies, and they spent a whole 30 minutes segment covering doggy coins and the crazy returns you can get on those coins, you know, that okay. The Chinese governments have to respond in some way with their own news channels are broadcasting to people. So a lot of this is focused around financial risk and control, and this has been ongoing and it's been a pattern of cyclical for some time now. We saw the same thing in 2017 when there was the ICO boom and bitcoin was pushing 20,000 almost immediately after the state ran CCTV news channels are covering all these crazy returns from ICO investments. A few weeks later, the Chinese government came and cracked down on exchanges. At the time, so many of the staple exchanges, like Hulby Finance, Okx, they moved overseas.
00:10:11.482 - 00:10:51.574, Speaker A: And this time around, it's very, very similar. The one thing that I think is different is we also have the focus in the spotlight on the 100th year anniversary of the CCP. That was just yesterday. Right? So I think they want to demonstrate even more control over what's going on in the space. And the one thing that's different than three years ago was there's a lot more of an effort on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining and ESG efforts from the Central party. So bitcoin mining was more in the crosshairs this time around, and they did crack down. Everyone's talked about the same narrative that, oh, China banned mining, china killed bitcoin.
00:10:51.574 - 00:11:01.662, Speaker A: Again, this and that. But this time around, they actually did enforce and crack down quite hard in different provinces. And we can go through the whole timeline and the cascade of events, if you'd like.
00:11:01.796 - 00:11:25.298, Speaker B: Yeah, why don't we do that? And also when you do that, if you could just explain a little bit what the relationship is between power plants in China and miners. Because from what I understand, this 100 year anniversary really did affect even how the power plants themselves, how willing they were to enforce these crackdowns. So let's go into the timeline.
00:11:25.394 - 00:12:01.358, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So we won't go all the way back to 2017. We'll just start with this year. Right, so I think the first major news that hit the time around was March 1. So March 1, Inner Mongolia announced that they were cracking down on bitcoin mining. They had listed several large facilities that they were going to inspect and further offer more stringent regulation for operating their bitcoin mining farms. What ended up happening by the end of the month was that further stringent regulation turned into, oh, we're going to suspend mining activities in Intermongolia.
00:12:01.358 - 00:13:08.290, Speaker A: So at the time, most people were suspecting, oh, this is more of environmentally driven type effort from the central government, because inner Mongolia is largely backed by coal buyer plants that supply the Bitcoin miners. And before I talk about some of the other events that happen, I think it's also important to illustrate that in China, there usually is an annual migration of miners. So during what we call wet season, anywhere from mid June to late June, when there's a lot of rain, oftentimes miners will send their equipment and their ASIC servers down to Sichuan, where there's an abundance of hydropower. And then by the time November rolls around, they'll return their miners to the northern regions or the coal fired regions like Xinjiang or inner Mongolia. And in this case, the miners were starting off in their position in Intermongolia waiting to be sent to Sichuan. So a lot of that got accelerated. And even then, during this period of March and April, most people, they were still not fully confident the Chinese government would actually come in, step in, and actually shut down some of these operations.
00:13:08.290 - 00:13:46.360, Speaker A: So there were those that actually stayed behind. What ended up happening is by the end of April, operations that did stay behind, they were all shut down. They were sealed with police tape and the transformers and a lot of substations they had padlocks on them. So mining operations did cease for good at the end of April, at least this time around. One of the largest GPU mining farms that I'm friends with over in Mongolia, they had all their equipment stuck and they couldn't even access them because they went with the bet that maybe the Chinese government isn't actually going to regulate this or crack down so hard. Unfortunately, they're quite serious this time around.
00:13:47.770 - 00:13:59.522, Speaker B: But when you say that their equipment was padlocked and everything, why wouldn't they be allowed to ship it out where they want, as long as they're just not in inner Mongolia?
00:13:59.666 - 00:14:42.040, Speaker A: Yes, I think one thing that may have glossed over was the tone of the crackdowns. And the regulations from the beginning of March, towards the end of March changed drastically. So initially in March, they were like, we're going to take a look at this and offer guidelines for how to maintain bitcoin mining and be compliant. But towards the end of the month, the tone had changed to, okay, we want to cease all Bitcoin mining activities. So they've given the deadline for that, by the end of April 1, they want everything out. And that's why the people that decide to stay behind and kind of go with a gamble or risk that maybe they aren't going to actually inspect a crackdown that hard. They were kind of caught with their pants down there.
00:14:43.690 - 00:14:48.246, Speaker B: Wow, is that mining equipment going to be destroyed or confiscated or something?
00:14:48.428 - 00:15:12.030, Speaker A: So there's a lot of conspiracy theories, this or that, that the state's going to confiscate this all, and the Chinese government is going to shadow mine and do this and that. But no, there actually been some videos that have been circulating on the internet or some pictures over the years, but they actually do confiscate it into their police departments and depots, and it's all just sitting there collecting dust.
00:15:13.010 - 00:15:14.080, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:15:16.390 - 00:15:17.460, Speaker A: Quite a lot.
00:15:18.230 - 00:15:20.750, Speaker B: Okay, all right, so keep going with the timeline.
00:15:20.910 - 00:16:20.694, Speaker A: All right, so what also happened during the middle of April was bitcoin also pushed all time highs. Right? So not only did bitcoin price push all time highs in the mid sixty s, sixty thousand s or so, so did bitcoin money hash rate. Bitcoin money hash rate, it was averaging around 170 x hashes, maybe even 180 x hashes for that time period. So the inner Mongolia crackdown hadn't really affected the global mining network too much. The people that did move out, which was the majority of miners up there, they were able to find other open capacity available in China or abroad. And then things started shifting and changing come May 13 and May 15, towards the middle of May. When I mentioned before that story of the CCTV two broadcast, that was when bitcoin had really crypto in general had really hit mainstream news, and it was all over the state broadcasting media, this and that.
00:16:20.694 - 00:17:13.682, Speaker A: And then almost immediately afterwards, this was, I believe, May 21 or so, the state council of the people's public, China, they made an announcement that they want to crack down hard on trading and mining. But this was only just a couple of sentences, so they wasn't focused only on mining, but they wanted to crack down all cryptocurrency activity. And they did say, we want to regulate trading and mining. During that time, bitcoin price had also been correcting. It had already fallen from 64,000 down to low 40s or so, and the hash rate had also been dropping, and it recorrected down to 150 extra hashes. And around that time, this is kind of where it started, the sharp decline of hash rate as we entered the month of June. So June 2, at the very start of June 2, a lot of the miners already started sending their miners over to Sichuan.
00:17:13.682 - 00:18:12.122, Speaker A: So I talked about how miners will relocate. Their miners take advantage of lower rates and abundance of electrical capacity that's stranded at the hydro dams in Sichuan. So a lot of the mining equipment was actually migrating from northern China and other coal fired areas to Sichuan. And a lot of the power plants and miners, they're worried that, oh, if China, during the May 21 announcement, if they're going to be taking a harder stance on bitcoin mining and trading, how are they going to regulate us here in Sichuan? Right, so they proactively set up a council and a meeting to discuss how to do fully compliant mining within Sichuan. They wanted to weigh the pros and cons of should they permit mining at a provincial level. What came out of that was, okay, we're going to continue mining and we're going to see what's going to happen at the state level. That was a ghost signal for a lot of miners to kind of send their equipment to Sichuan if they hadn't already.
00:18:12.122 - 00:19:05.194, Speaker A: Then on June 9, we also had announcements come from xinjiang and Qinghai that they were also going to be suspending mining activities. So that forced the hand of all the other miners that hadn't moved to sichuan. So essentially at this point, most miners were moving their equipment to Sichuan, China, in hopes that the hydro power would be sustained and would be allowed for bitcoin mining. And then the big bombshell came on June 18, and this is when sichuan made the announcement that they were going to suspend all bitcoin mining activities. They initially called out 26 of the largest power plants in the mining facilities. Everyone else, they essentially shuddered. And they were like, well, if these were the same plants that participated in the June 2 meeting, they proactively set the guidelines for how they were going to be compliant and the regulations that were set forth in front of them.
00:19:05.194 - 00:19:51.020, Speaker A: And they were told to shut off many of the other even smaller medium sized mines. They decided to shut off their operations as well. So this is the point where we saw global hash rate start spiraling downwards and take ourselves to essentially present day, roughly the end of June. The last province, which is unan, also followed suit with banning any remaining mining activities, which essentially took off 90% of the hash rate capacity that was being mined in China. And we can see that global hash rate now from an all time high of 100 and 7180 exit hash averages back in April May. Those have now plummeted down to 90 exit hashes or so.
00:19:52.350 - 00:20:16.020, Speaker B: Wow, that's incredible. At this moment, it just feels like we're in this transition period and we haven't really seen a ton of the miners come online yet in other places. But as far as you know, at this moment, where are miners looking? Or what are the factors that they're considering as they decide where to set up shop?
00:20:16.470 - 00:20:49.770, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. I think that's the question on everyone's mind, right? And the tough answer is that there really isn't that much space to plug in this much capacity into, right. When essentially it's overnight. Over the course of one or two months, you had over 50% of the entire network go offline. You're not going to be able to build that capacity so quickly. We talked about before that oftentimes projects take six to nine months. That's after you've gotten the green light and approval to begin construction in some of the western, more established countries.
00:20:49.770 - 00:21:26.742, Speaker A: So the quickest turnaround, time for money operations to be built up in the countries and jurisdictions most similar to China. People that benefited the most was Central Asia. So the most popular country for a lot of these Chinese miners to migrate to was Kazakhstan, no different than everyone else. Kazakhstan, they can only support so much capacity as well. Much of the network has actually remained dormant and offline since these crackdowns. And we're seeing that with this large difficulty drop, the largest ever that's going to take place very end of today, friday, July 2. Yeah.
00:21:26.796 - 00:21:38.860, Speaker B: And so when you say that there isn't this amount of capacity elsewhere, when you say it's just because they tend to look for excess capacity, is that why?
00:21:39.230 - 00:21:56.734, Speaker A: It's not just excess capacity. It's open capacity. Right. So a little bit of background in the mining infrastructure needs to first be built before miners can be plugged in. You have to step down a tremendous amount of electricity, usually at the substation level. So you have high voltage electricity. Then you got to step it down to medium voltage.
00:21:56.734 - 00:22:33.358, Speaker A: And that medium voltage then needs to be brought down to low voltage. And you have all these different layers of electrical equipment permitting and sourcing of equipment infrastructure. That takes a very long time. Very interesting kind of dynamic that's being playing out in front of us, is there's major bottleneck supply crunches on not just the bitcoin mining equipment ecosystem, but all over the world. Electrical transformers are at a premium, and there's a massive shortage there, too. All raw materials have spiked in price. So for all those Reddit traders and everyone else, they know exactly what we're talking about.
00:22:33.358 - 00:22:45.300, Speaker A: Copper prices have shot through the roof lumber, et cetera. Right. So a lot of these materials that go into electrical infrastructure or into the building of these facilities, those are shot up not only in cost, but in lead time.
00:22:46.070 - 00:22:49.442, Speaker B: And all of that is because of the pandemic, obviously.
00:22:49.496 - 00:22:50.734, Speaker A: Largely pandemic driven.
00:22:50.782 - 00:23:03.958, Speaker B: Right, yeah. Quite the storm. One other thing that I saw that you tweeted, which was really interesting to me, was you said a lot of the mining equipment is not up to code for Western countries. So what do you mean by that?
00:23:04.124 - 00:23:44.990, Speaker A: Great. So we also talked about so you have all this equipment that's being shut off in China. A lot of infrastructure. Actually, let me take a step back. One of the ways we can tell that the Chinese government's much more, quote unquote, serious about this crackdown suspension of mining is that many of the power plants that were fully compliant and got the green light to go proceed with mining from the provincial governments. They're now being told to not only uproot and take out their bitcoin miners, they're being told to uproot and take out and withdraw all their electrical infrastructure they've installed. So all these things that taken months to source, they're being able to they need to remove it from the premises.
00:23:44.990 - 00:24:39.990, Speaker A: And what I meant by some of this equipment won't translate so well into the west is one of the advantages that China and the Kazakhstan of the world has had over the US. Has been that they don't have as stringent electrical code. We do over in Western countries. In Europe, you have C certified type electrical equipment, and in the west, you have Ul listed equipment that you have to run. That's a fancy way of saying you got to build your electrical equipment with higher code and regulations and with better, more stable materials. So the aluminum that's being used in Chinese transformers, that's often required to be copper over here in North America, that equipment won't be allowed to be turned on here in the States. So you have all this equipment that now is no longer able to be translated and used again in the west, but they sometimes can be sent to countries in, say, Central Asia, where it's much more similar to China.
00:24:40.890 - 00:24:52.070, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. And one other factor for those who are looking to relocate in the US. Aren't the US. China tariffs also a part of this calculation?
00:24:52.230 - 00:25:23.794, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So that tariff is still there, guys. So for those that are looking to purchase used miners, oftentimes it doesn't make sense to send them directly or to run them in the US. There are proactive stances that the manufacturers have taken. So right now, we're obviously focusing on the dormant miners that were taken offline in China. But the manufacturers have done a great job of also spinning up assembly and manufacturing sources in Malaysia and Thailand, other parts of the world. So most of the US.
00:25:23.794 - 00:25:54.106, Speaker A: Mining participants, they are actually purchasing directly from the manufacturers from these overseas manufacturing sites where the tariff doesn't apply to them. But most of these used miners, they still have the tariff because they're mining in China and they're produced in Shenzhen. So that's another reason why a lot of these miners are going to the Central Asia groups and even Canada. So the tariffs are only applied to the US. And China. So Canadians have benefited a lot from this, as well as other non American countries.
00:25:54.298 - 00:26:11.938, Speaker B: So what's your take on what this ban means for bitcoin? Just to make clear, it sounds like you're saying you think this will be permanent. Do Chinese miners think at all that maybe, like, in a year or two, they can kind of turn the lights on again?
00:26:12.104 - 00:26:58.306, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. It's also another question on everyone's mind, and there are those in China that think that there's this theory that maybe it's only so stringent and so severe of a crackdown because it's centered around the CCP's 100 year anniversary. But large part of this actually plays back into what I mentioned before, which is how prevalent and how much of a splash is bitcoin and crypto at large making in the social circles? Right. Bitcoin is pushing all time highs again towards the end of this year, I'm quite certain that mining will still be suspended. Right. The last thing they want to do is to show weakness or show that, oh, we actually don't have much authority in that. We spend a mining once and it's coming back again.
00:26:58.306 - 00:27:37.694, Speaker A: Right. If we look back at, say, 2017 exchanges ultimately found a way back into China. They re registered overseas and they still targeted the same retail investors that were in China. Mining may be similarities in that if bitcoin were to correct or were enter another into another bear market or price action right. Where there's less volatility and less news in the media, then perhaps Chinese government overlook it. For them, it's all about I think it's about the perception and to show that they're kind of in the driver's seat, they have a good handle of things and that they're limiting financial risks and controls. Yeah.
00:27:37.732 - 00:27:58.100, Speaker B: One other factor I wonder is as they get rolling with their digital yuan, DCP, if that will kind of push them to enforce the crackdown more as time goes on, because they'll kind of want the population there to interact or transact with that.
00:27:58.810 - 00:28:39.922, Speaker A: Definitely. That's a very popular narrative, and I think there's correlation, but I don't think there's too much causation there. And ultimately it's the same thing with the environmental stance. Right. So the bitcoin mining council, they released some data that shows that bitcoin is actually largely renewable. And Feinstein over at blockcap, he's tweeting some awesome data statistics where bitcoin mining uses just a drop in the bucket of the total power that's out there. So when people talk about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, or they talk about how it can challenge a digital yuan, it's very small percentages and numbers, statistically, against what they're competing against.
00:28:39.922 - 00:28:51.878, Speaker A: So once again, I think it's more the perception and the narrative around how much they're actually controlling, actually contributing against the networks that they're competing against.
00:28:52.044 - 00:29:04.970, Speaker B: All right, so I think maybe the last thing I want to ask is just what would you say is going to be the overall significance of this ban and the migration for bitcoin?
00:29:05.470 - 00:29:39.030, Speaker A: Yeah. So the overall significance is you're going to see much more decentralization across the entire network, which is great for the security and the longevity of bitcoin. It's very unfortunate for a lot of our colleagues and friends. I've heard some people say brethren and comrades right, over in China, and they are they are very close friends and colleagues. Right. And it sucks that they had such a sharp stance and they had to remove a lot of their operations they've been building up over the years. But the rest of the world stands to benefit.
00:29:39.030 - 00:30:09.006, Speaker A: The more decentralized and the more distributed the bitcoin mining network becomes, the more secure it is. And I think what this will actually help accelerate is development of new technologies to support mining activities in previously prioritized regions. Right. So if you look. At mining distribution maps, you'll see that much of the southern hemisphere doesn't have mining activity. And that's largely because even though they have cheap electricity or access to cheap renewable power, they're typically much hotter climates. Right.
00:30:09.006 - 00:30:46.614, Speaker A: They're closer to the equator or they're more humid. So when there was capacity available in china and there was abundant capacity in north America, people started prioritized expansions there. But now that these regions now have excess capacity you touched on el Salvador earlier, I think these places stand to gain a lot. Right. And technologies that will be developed to support those regions. Typically bitcoin miners are cooled with open air solutions, but now we may look at more developments and maybe accelerated when it comes to merging. So that's submerging your miner into fluids, into cooling your miners.
00:30:46.614 - 00:31:07.810, Speaker A: And we can see much more of that coming out in countries like El salvador, in south America, in Australia, southeast asia, maybe even parts of africa. Right. I'm hoping to see that much more mining spreads out to these regions because they do have dormant capacity and cheap electrical rates that are very conducive to bitcoin mining.
00:31:09.190 - 00:31:53.150, Speaker B: All right, I'm going to have to ask you more about that. But one last thing I wanted to say about this significance for bitcoin and how you said the hash rate would become more decentralized. I remember back in 2015, when I wrote one of my first really big articles on Bitcoin, that I said one of the risks was that since more than half the hash rate was in China, that if the Chinese government ever decided they just were going to take over all the miners, then that would be a way for the Chinese government to kind of like 51% attack the network. And so now that the hash rate in China has fallen below 50%, I think that's the first time since I've started reporting on this face that I can say, okay, well, now that's not a risk.
00:31:53.730 - 00:32:24.170, Speaker A: Absolutely. So it's another stress test that proved just how resilient bitcoin is. Right. Yes, some of the block times were maybe a little bit longer during this difficulty period, but here in the next other 8 hours or so at the end of this Friday, when difficulty readjusts times will resume much closer, back to ten minute averages, and the network prevails and continues soldiering on. So I think that it just further emphasizes how awesome of a technology bitcoin mining is, or bitcoin.
00:32:24.990 - 00:32:45.278, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk more about what the drop in this hash rate means.

So, as we've been discussing in the show, the Bitcoin hash rate is going to see what is likely to be its biggest drop ever today.
00:34:52.202 - 00:34:53.306, Speaker B: Is that right?
00:34:53.488 - 00:34:55.980, Speaker A: It's going to be definitely the biggest drop ever.
00:34:56.830 - 00:35:09.642, Speaker B: All right, so we kind of talked about how the network is resilient, but still, what does this mean for the network and for all the various actors and industry players on the network?
00:35:09.706 - 00:36:07.038, Speaker A: I've tweeted out some threads about this and I've shared some of my thoughts already. But now that we're getting even closer to the difficulty adjustment here, in 8 hours or so, economics are pretty much locked in right there's. Only so many more blocks are going to be solved, and we can already forecast knock on wood, unless bitcoin moves in very much one direction, we can kind of forecast what it's going to look like. So we're looking at anywhere from a 27% to 28% difficulty drop, which will be the largest ever. That being said, it's well within the limit. So the way the Bitcoin difficulty adjustment algorithm works, it can grow or decrease by a factor of four, so it can grow significantly more or drop up to 75%. This is actually well within its normal bounds and well within the network's algorithm, but what we're going to see is from the market participants, so from users, they're going to be excited because block times will return back to a much more of a norm, around a ten minute average.
00:36:07.038 - 00:36:57.278, Speaker A: By difficulty dropping so much, the block times, did they go higher? Right? We were looking at 1314 minutes blocks. It slows down the network somewhat and fees go up, but the network still worked. But people prefer more normal block times, so to speak. But the people that stand the benefit the most are those that have miners plugged in. So when the difficulty is going to drop 28%, that's effectively 38% increase in revenue because there's a lot less competition, and especially if you're a very competitive operator with lower costs, you're going to see even bigger impact on your bottom line. So for miners that do have capacity and do have their equipment already plugged in or bring more miners online, they stand the game the most. So much so that the profitability of a minor.
00:36:57.278 - 00:37:42.786, Speaker A: I was tweeting this out earlier and I've actually just updated the numbers before our call minor during the middle of April, when price was around 60,000 or so, pushing all time highs. And back when difficulty and hash rate were also at all time highs, s 1900, Terrahash minor was yielding and producing about $35 to $36 a day. Once this difficulty adjustment takes place, that same miner will be making roughly $33 a day. So it's a very, very small drop in revenue, and the bitcoin price has almost been cut in half since then, and it's largely because the difficulty and the hash rates dropped with it. So once again, miners that have equipment plugged in, they stand to gain the most, and it's a very good time to be a minor. Yeah.
00:37:42.808 - 00:38:34.350, Speaker B: And all of this is happening at the same time that we've been seeing bitcoin gain much more mainstream adoption, which has also meant that a lot more mainstream concerns have been coming to bitcoin. And probably top of mind there would be the environmental concerns. And just wanted to ask you in general, at this moment in time, especially now, where we're seeing hash rate move out of China, and a lot of people tend to think, and I don't know how true this is, that a lot of the dirtier energy is the bitcoin that's mined in China. Do you have a sense of whether or not bitcoin is becoming greener at this moment? What do you think? Are the prospects that it will become greener?
00:38:34.690 - 00:38:58.930, Speaker A: Yeah, so I have a couple of thoughts there before I dive into that answer. I'll just kind of give some context on Foundry, another reason why we entered into this space. Right. Part of bringing more institutional adoption, obviously, is cleaning up the ecosystem, making it more credible and transparent. But another is kind of combating these narratives. There's two big narratives that we've been combating since we were founded. The first was bitcoin is centralized and it's controlled by China.
00:38:58.930 - 00:39:41.110, Speaker A: Well, we just discussed how that's kind of solving itself in front of our eyes. So I won't go too much there. We can also cover how we've been combined, the narrative that bitcoin is destroying our planet or blowing the oceans. And as a bitcoin miner and as having access to many different sets of data and many operations that we work closely with, the facts are actually on the bitcoin miner side. Bitcoin is largely renewable or taking advantage of stranded energy that otherwise be wasted. And I also talked earlier, before that Darren Feinstein at blockcap, he issued awesome report statistics. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the total energy usage that's out there, and especially that's being wasted.
00:39:41.110 - 00:40:50.380, Speaker A: But the other thing I want to leave listeners with is that my colleague, our CEO, he often says that bitcoin has a ruthless drive towards cost efficiency and some of the most cost efficient sources of power are from renewable sources. Right? So bitcoin will naturally become, quote, unquote, greener in that the power consumption that it uses will be largely from renewables. As we trend towards those technologies, one of the things I think is often forgotten is that we can't just flip the switch off overnight and switch from, quote, unquote, dirty energy into these renewable sources overnight. And bitcoin mining serves as this incredible opportunity to be the battery for a lot of these unstable grids. One of the large negatives and the drawbacks of using renewable power is that it's not sustainable or it's not very sustained, it's very intermittent. And having an energy consumer that can stabilize and turn off or turn on and flip the switch is a very powerful synergistic tool to keep to empower those technologies. And bitcoin mining is just that.
00:40:51.170 - 00:41:22.840, Speaker B: Yeah, what you're referencing there, I think, is the idea that was posed in this white paper put out by square and Ark invest. Can you outline a little bit how that could work, about how bitcoin mining could be a complement to renewable energy production? And how much are we seeing that actually take place now or whether or not there's any critical mass of projects like that in the works?
00:41:23.370 - 00:42:27.610, Speaker A: Sure, so I can't speak about specific projects and I'm also not an expert on electrical side, but at a very high level. I talked about how a lot of these renewable energies, whether it's solar or wind, oftentimes these are not very stable sources of power because oftentimes there's not someone that's going to be out there taking that power on. So oftentimes there's a ramp up time, there's a need to store the electricity and the batteries that are required to build out. The capex of these deployments can be very cost prohibitive. But if you deploy bitcoin miners and you have another revenue source that can readily use the power and also give it back when it's no longer needed or when the grid and the energy markets spike and peak, bitcoin miners are the perfect solution to answer to that. They can flip on and off like a switch. Being New Yorkians, it's very front of mind for us, or top of mind for us because of what happened this week, or we got those alerts in our phones to conserve electricity, this and that.
00:42:27.610 - 00:42:40.800, Speaker A: People oftentimes take for granted that power doesn't just come out of thin air. Right. It has to be generated and it has to be sustained over time. I think bitcoin miners are absolutely the solution to that problem.
00:42:41.730 - 00:43:14.954, Speaker B: Well, just for people who don't know, it was like an amber alert on my phone. Suddenly it just started screeching that I had to turn off as much energy as energy usage as I could. And being a good citizen, I did that. But I was like, oh, wow. Okay. Anyway, one other thing I wanted to ask about was earlier you mentioned something that I'm not super familiar with, which is underwater mining or I don't remember what phrase you used to describe that, called immersion cooling. Okay, yeah.
00:43:14.954 - 00:43:16.106, Speaker B: So how does that work?
00:43:16.208 - 00:44:18.046, Speaker A: Several types of immersion cooling technologies. So one of the biggest challenges of running a bitcoin mining operation or running even a single bitcoin miner is dissipating the heat. So the latest generation bitcoin miner uses about three and a half kilowatts. So you can imagine three and a half kilowatts being three microwaves condensed into a shoebox that never turn off, that constantly run. So imagine the heat that's dissipating the amount of power it's consuming, right? So most cost efficient way and prevailing strategy for cooling those miners have been installing very high frequency fans to move the airflow. Move the airflow and dissipate the heat. We talked about earlier, before that now that there's supply crunch and bottlenecks of capacity in those open air cooled areas, and there is available capacity electricity in a southern hemisphere closer to the equator where it's hotter and it's more humid, air coolant would no longer work.
00:44:18.046 - 00:44:56.038, Speaker A: So we can look at immersion technologies. Immersion technology is actually submerging your miner into dielectric fluids high level. There's two different types, what's called single phase coolant, and there's also two phase coolant. A single phase coolant means that they're moving the fluids that you're submerging your minor into and the chips and the hashboards into, and it moves the fluids and it cools the fluids in the heat exchanger and it recirculates it. Once it move in air, you're moving these fluids that dissipate and grab the heat off of the boards and the chips. The other methodology is two phase. Two phase sounds a lot fancier.
00:44:56.038 - 00:45:29.942, Speaker A: It's a lot cooler, but it's also much more expensive. It's actually taking the state that the fluids are in and changing it into gas to cool the fluid before it recirculates it into the miner. So these technologies, they haven't been as prevalent or as proven at a large scale because they have largely not been prioritized. But as we see these other regions and the need for decentralization pop back up, these technologies will see a lot more interest and a lot more you.
00:45:29.996 - 00:46:09.406, Speaker B: Know, I had Miami Mayor Francis Suarez on the show, and he didn't seem aware that the temperature in a certain location would affect whether or not you would want to mine there. But if I ever have him on the show again, I'll mention this to him and say, well, if you want to bring mining to Miami, then think this is the way. Well, so speaking of mining in North America, there's been a lot of talk in recent years about more mining moving to this continent, and I don't really know. But is that just kind of like patriotic Americans and Canadians wanting to see more mining here, or are there tangible benefits to having more mining in North America?
00:46:09.598 - 00:46:43.750, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think there certainly are a lot more benefits, right. First of all, it is very much real, and the data stands behind it, and it's that much more multiplied now that China has shut off a lot of their operations. Right. China has been anywhere from 50% to 70% of the global mining network for the past few years. And when you lose 90% of that capacity in the last few months, the other percentages and the other distribution of network across the network grows. So right now, we're looking at anywhere from 25% to 30% of the entire network being in North America.
00:46:43.750 - 00:47:20.150, Speaker A: That's both us. And Canada right before about the differences between China and the US. As far as from a building side, when they can source cheaper electrical equipment and they can build on shorter time frames because it's not as stringent from the permitting and regulatory side. But the one advantage the US. Has is the capital markets. And we've seen that play out in the last half year or so, right when Bitcoin went on its run, some of the biggest winners in the space has been the publicly listed companies. So the capital markets is the one big advantage that can really accelerate the growth and the amount of capital you have at your disposal.
00:47:20.150 - 00:47:54.846, Speaker A: Build large scale mining operations, and many of those have already come online, and they're continuing to grow, expand. Where it gets really ironic and interesting is we talked about previously, oh, China, it's so centralized there, they made 51% impact the network. The government takes over this or that. Well, we're actually going to be turning to the point where the US. Or North America may be too much of the global hash rate, but where I have confidence that that scenario won't play out is obviously the US. And the west, for a large part is a lot more democratic. The government's not going to step in and just kind of seize all your equipment.
00:47:54.846 - 00:48:30.254, Speaker A: Knock on blizzard. But ultimately, a lot of the regulations that come at the federal level is very mixed and it's not consistent across the states. So what you're going to see a lot more regulations on the local jurisdictions at the state level where it's very different from China, where essentially their national or state or federal level. Right. Whatever they say goes. So even though certain provinces wanted to keep mining, like the Yunnines or Citrons, that held off a little longer, they were ultimately their hands were forced and they had to shut off mining even though they were previously compliant. In the US.
00:48:30.254 - 00:49:07.098, Speaker A: It's a lot more up to the local jurisdictions. You have some states that are a lot more friendlier to miners like the Kentucky's, the Texas, the Georgias of the world or of the US. And then you have other states that have issued moratoriums or actively trying to stop bitcoin mining. Right. You have moratoriums in Chilean County over in Washington and Plattsburg, New York. And we saw that the recent bill proposed up in the state of New York that was clearly targeting specific bitcoin miners. So one way of saying certainly hash rate is growing in the US.
00:49:07.098 - 00:49:15.600, Speaker A: Almost too fast. And it's great to see in a company that is based here, but we'd also like to see growth not only in the US. North America, but all over the world.
00:49:16.370 - 00:49:27.940, Speaker B: One thing that I found interesting was your previous firm, Greenridge, used a behind the meter system. Can you explain what that is and why it is that that was beneficial for your company?
00:49:28.310 - 00:49:56.618, Speaker A: Yeah. So behind the meter is a fancy way of saying like, you generate your own power. It's power that you're not pulling from the grid. And ultimately what that means is you're going to be extremely cost efficient. So long term, I think more and more of the bitcoin miners that are going to be entering ecosystem are these large energy companies and power generation assets. Right. Grinch prior to instituting bitcoin mining struggling, peaking plant right.
00:49:56.618 - 00:50:28.694, Speaker A: It was on the verge of shutting down and a lot of jobs and taxes would have been lost. But because they implemented bitcoin mining, grid previously was not giving them a sustainable enough business model to be a peaker plant. Right. So we talked about how, say, New York or New York City struggled with electrical stability and everyone takes for granted that the power just isn't readily available. But it's not like these peaker plants need to be incentivized to stay there to provide stability to the grid. Right. And the market economics as they weren't conducive to that.
00:50:28.694 - 00:51:13.620, Speaker A: So bitcoin mining allowed Greenwich to run base loaded and they can ramp on much quicker. They have the power plant constantly running to provide stability to the grid. Anyways, I kind of went on tangent there, but behind the meter once again is you're using the own power that you're generating. You're no longer paying a lot of the same transmission and distribution costs that your competitors are. And that's why I think over time, as there's more clarity and as there's more data that backs just how environmentally friendly and quote unquote green bitcoin actually is, more of these players are going to enter into the ecosystem. And the people that move first, they're going to have an advantage because they're going to have the know how the capital built out. And once again, we talked about timing, right? They're going to be first movers and Greenwich is certainly one of them.
00:51:14.630 - 00:51:27.014, Speaker B: And we've mentioned this a few times, but haven't really discussed it in depth. So as we know in El Salvador, they're looking into volcano mining. Is that going to be a real thing? What do you think is the plausibility of that?
00:51:27.212 - 00:52:00.834, Speaker A: If it's not a real thing, we're going to make it into real thing. Right? Jokes aside, geothermal technology for bitcoin mining has been happening for a long time. Right. Iceland has been mining off of volcano power for quite some time now. So I think the challenges that they face is obviously going to be, once again, how do you mine in a hotter and a more humid climate? But the technologies are there, right. Immersion is not like it's not some new foreign technology that hasn't been used before. It just hasn't been built largely at scale at cheap enough cost.
00:52:00.834 - 00:52:41.678, Speaker A: But now that we're seeing a lot of miners being displaced, the economic incentive is there to solve that equation. There is going to be new hurdles and biologics with. How do you source and get miners over from China into South America? What is the regulatory framework going to look like? Right? Is it going to always be this stable? That's one of the risks you look at and evaluate when you enter into a new jurisdiction and region. Can they bridge the cultural language barriers for miners coming out of China? I think these are all problems that will get solved. The President is obviously very bitcoin friendly and is pushing it very hard. And we love seeing that. A lot of it is one of those things where only time will tell.
00:52:41.678 - 00:53:01.400, Speaker A: Right. It's one thing to have massive buying in crypto and bitcoin when bitcoin is pushing all time highs and it's in a bulk market. But is your operation or are you as interested when the market's in a very down cycle right. Which is when you actually should be building and investing more capital. So time will tell.
00:53:02.570 - 00:53:11.370, Speaker B: So amidst all of these changes, there's also been this new Bitcoin Mining Council. Tell us what you think the significance that will have for the industry.
00:53:11.870 - 00:53:41.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So I talked earlier about the importance of using real data and facts to combat these narratives that are hurting the reputation of bitcoin. Right. And the big one they're combating is a lot of the concerns around climate and ESGS. Right. I think yesterday, this is Thursday, thursday night, they had a meeting where they issued and they released data and reports that show that bitcoin once again is over. I think it's 53% carbon or emissions free.
00:53:41.330 - 00:54:02.060, Speaker A: So once again, the data is on our side, right. So it's awesome to see that these miners have banded together to collect data and hard facts to kind of combat these narratives. And I think more time as bitcoin gains more credibility, maturity, and largely on the back of these miners being more transparent and disclosing more data.
00:54:03.470 - 00:54:13.360, Speaker B: So another thing that people have talked about for a while is the financialization of bitcoin mining. What does that mean exactly, and what new developments are you seeing on that front?
00:54:14.130 - 00:54:57.722, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great topic. So this has been a tricky puzzle that a lot of people have been trying to solve for some time. Financialization of bitcoin products is another way of saying how do we make sure that miners can actually hedge their profitability? Right? Now, let's take Greenwich as an example or any other data center that's out there. It's very easy to actually hedge your energy costs or your input costs on the electrical side. Either you're locking in your energy rates along PPAs or you're purchasing your energy source hedged out for a long period of time. So you can lock in your input costs, but your output costs are where you're exposed or your output variables are where you're exposed. Mining, we talked about it all this entire call.
00:54:57.722 - 00:55:59.486, Speaker A: There's many variables going to it, right? It's not just bitcoin price. It's also what's the difficulty in the network hash rate, where's that at? So sometimes people say, well, why don't you just lock in a bitcoin price? Well, a bitcoin could be more expensive or less expensive to purchase based off of what the network and the hash rate is doing. Just tonight, we're going to see that it's going to be 38%, quote unquote, cheaper to mine a bitcoin when a difficulty readjusts difficulty is dropping 28%, where your revenue goes up 38. Right? So being able to find a product in a market for these miners is very, very powerful. The tricky side of it and why it hasn't been proven at scale is that who are the buyers? Right? Even though there's obviously demand from the sellers of the bitcoin miners, there largely hasn't been a business case or use case for the buyers of these products. And once again, I think it all circles back into the credibility and maturity of bitcoin. Right.
00:55:59.486 - 00:56:36.540, Speaker A: Obviously, if a markets were efficient, there would be buyers here because miners are able to produce bitcoin at such a steep discount. So how can we actually close this loop and actually make an efficient market where people there's interest in buying these products? So that's kind of one thing that a lot of different people have been trying to solve over the years. Some of it has been in hash rate contracts, this and that. But oftentimes the buyer gets burned. Either they're buying it at too steep of prices or they're demanding very large discounts. So that's one thing that we're keeping a very close eye on, is the financialization of hash rate products.
00:56:37.150 - 00:56:50.160, Speaker B: All right, why don't we wrap with kind of what your predictions are for what will happen to Bitcoin mining by the end of the year? What will it look like in the second half of 2021?
00:56:50.930 - 00:57:28.106, Speaker A: Man putting me on the spot. So I think I was a little overly eager and already shared several predictions. Right? So I think immersion technology will be more prevalent. I think we'll see more projects announced where there'll be immersion deployments at scale. I also think that hash rate will struggle to give back to its all time highs early of this year, largely because there's such long lead times for miners to come back online, especially when it comes to building new capacity and new infrastructure. So I think we're going to not see those all time highs. On the difficulty in the hash rate side, I also see that over time, I'm not sure if it's by the end of this year or not.
00:57:28.106 - 00:57:48.050, Speaker A: You'll see more countries embracing Bitcoin mining and more jurisdictions openly welcoming Bitcoin miners, because as there's more data and there's more facts being shared and there's more transparency from groups like our group the Foundry, the Mining Council, and other market participants, the business case is going to be undeniable for bitcoin mining.
00:57:49.030 - 00:57:52.130, Speaker B: All right. And what about the future for Foundry?
00:57:52.790 - 00:58:28.298, Speaker A: Oh future for foundry. So that's a good question. We're so busy working every day, hard to think about the future. So here we offer several different services. On the mining side, we've been a very large financier mining equipment. I talked before how one of our mandates is breaking up the narrative that China or Bitcoin is very centralized, right? And in doing so, we actually financed over 50% of all the latest generation equipment that came into America back in 2020. So a large majority of the S were financed by Foundry.
00:58:28.298 - 00:59:27.922, Speaker A: We also have deployed our mining equipment at many different sites all across North America, and we're branching out to other parts of the world to help them get up to speed and leverage our expertise. And that's also through our advisory business. So we also offer advisory for miners that are new to the space, publicly traded companies, large firms that know that there are the financial incentives here, but they don't have expertise and experience to execute, as well as helping Chinese miners move out of China because they're now displaced, where can they actually plug in their miners? What operators and builders are actually credible for them to work with and lock into contracts even before the sites are built? And lastly, certainly not least is our mining pool, right. Part of the decentralization effort that we've been very large proponents of has been our mining pool. Our mining pool is called foundry USA pool. To really emphasize. Even its namesake, that we are a US.
00:59:27.922 - 00:59:51.850, Speaker A: Based, fully compliant mining pool. Right. We're leveraging once again our balance sheet and capital. When times were tough, that's when we started building, because we knew no one else had the capabilities of doing so. So having alternatives outside China ready beforehand and in place was one of the smartest moves we could have made, and we continue to do so to help decentralize the network.
00:59:52.590 - 00:59:56.010, Speaker B: Great. And where can people learn more about you on Foundry?
00:59:56.430 - 01:00:12.282, Speaker A: Yes, you can visit our website@foundrydigital.com. You can also check me out on Twitter. I guess I'm a little bit more active than I used to be. I had a lot of peer pressure from some of my close friends and colleagues in the space. So you can find me at Sino Crypto on Twitter.
01:00:12.346 - 01:00:16.190, Speaker B: Perfect. All right, well, thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
01:00:16.530 - 01:00:17.566, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks for having me.
01:00:17.588 - 01:00:29.330, Speaker B: Laura, thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about Kevin and Foundry, check out the show notes for this episode. Unchained is produced by me, Laura Shin, with help from Anthony Yoon at Daniel Nuffs and Mark Murdoch. Thanks for listening.
