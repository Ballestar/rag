Like that is the actual biggest source of mev, as far as I can tell. It's not really being extracted yet, but exchanges know when you go click the exit button from an exchange, they're going to know they may be able to buy. What were you looking at in coin Gecko? Like right when you clicked exit on your exchange, they're going to have a lot of insight just from customer profiling about what financial actions are likely to come from that exit on the exchange. And at some point, exchanges are going to start front running this and that is the source of value that Adam holders. I think when we designed Adam 2.0, this is what the vision is really about, is like, if we don't have a block space futures market, we're leaking all of that value back to the exchanges.
