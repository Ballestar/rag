00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.606, Speaker A: This is the thing that I think optimism very uniquely has at.
00:00:02.628 - 00:00:03.214, Speaker UNK: This moment.
00:00:03.332 - 00:00:25.350, Speaker A: Is you have a bunch of people who are making this commitment and saying, hey, we want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. And that's the commitment basis saying, right, we didn't go and say we're going to do this by ourselves. Instead. We said, we believe that at the end of the day, this is going to be bigger than us and we want to help build that thing that's bigger than us. And I think that that's what optimism is saying. I think that that's what Zora's saying. I think that that's what a bunch of these folks are saying.
00:00:25.350 - 00:00:54.140, Speaker A: And my intuition is, like, we've seen crypto be positive sum for the last decade in really new ways. And I think that there's an opportunity for us to build something positive sum here that's way bigger than Base or Op mainnet or any single component of an L two and is actually a superchain that brings a billion people on chain. And so is that a little crazy? Is it optimistic? Yeah. But here we are. We're going to do it. Hey.
