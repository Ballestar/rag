00:00:00.330 - 00:00:52.300, Speaker A: There's, I think 40, 50, 60 million Americans that own securities and trade securities. That's not a problem. Something being a security is not a problem. Where it is a problem is well, with a lot of these networks the asset has a utility component and that a user ought to be able to spend the asset in order to consume a service. And that's where an asset being deemed a security can be problematic because it means that if I send it to you as a form of payment or I just use it in a game or something, if that's a securities transaction that causes a lot of hair around it and so that's not sustainable. So this ruling is really important to protect that aspect of the space. The fact that the average user, not the investor transactions with investors should be regulated and should be subject to disclosures and should be subject to investor protections and other such things.
