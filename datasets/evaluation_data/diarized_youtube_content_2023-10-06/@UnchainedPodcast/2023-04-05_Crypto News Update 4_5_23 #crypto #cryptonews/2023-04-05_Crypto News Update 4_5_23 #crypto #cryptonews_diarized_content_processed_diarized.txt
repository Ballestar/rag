00:00:00.170 - 00:00:59.130, Speaker A: The failure of a $10 billion crypto hedge fund and Twitter serve subpoenas hasn't stopped Three AC founders Kylie Davies and Su Zu from launching a new exchange. Open Exchange went live on Tuesday, offering spot and futures trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Open exchange was founded by three AC founders kyle Davies and Su Zu in partnership with CoinFLEX founders Mark Lamb and Sudu Orumigan. After raising $25 million from investors earlier this year, three AC declared bankruptcy in July 2022 and its liquidators have since struggled to establish contact with Davies and Zoo eventually resorting to Twitter to deliver subpoenas to the firm's founders. Not long after the collapse of Three AC, CoinFLEX halted withdrawals, citing extreme market conditions, and filed for restructuring to despite members of the crypto community. Highlighting the irony of these founders starting another crypto venture. Zoo and Davies appeared unfazed when responding to critics on Twitter.
