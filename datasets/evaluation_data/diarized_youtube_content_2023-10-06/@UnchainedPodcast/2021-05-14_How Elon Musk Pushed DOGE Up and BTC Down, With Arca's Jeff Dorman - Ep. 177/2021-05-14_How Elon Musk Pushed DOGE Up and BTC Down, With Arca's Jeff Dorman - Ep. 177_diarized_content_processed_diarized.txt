00:01:37.150 - 00:01:41.770, Speaker A: Today's guest is Jeff dorman, chief investment officer at Arca. Welcome, Jeff.
00:01:42.190 - 00:01:44.000, Speaker C: Hi, thanks for having me.
00:01:44.370 - 00:02:00.530, Speaker A: So it's been a wild week in the crypto markets, but before we get to some of the very specific events that drove some of the market movements, let's just talk about the broader picture in general as we're coming out of this pandemic. How do you see the different macro forces intersecting with the crypto?
00:02:03.270 - 00:03:17.238, Speaker C: I mean, it depends what you say by crypto markets, and this is a big thing that we talk about a lot at Arca, is we don't really think it's one market anymore. This is a large asset class with a lot of different types of digital assets that all have very different drivers of what makes the price move and what makes interest in them move. So cryptocurrency itself, especially Bitcoin, is obviously very affected by the economic data in the macro picture, but a lot of the other assets in this asset class really aren't and really shouldn't be. In some ways, you can think of digital assets almost like the ETF, right? The ETF wrapper itself is consistent across all ETFs, but there's really no reason why a healthcare ETF would react the same way as a bond ETF, which would react differently than a gold ETF. What you put inside the wrapper matters, and I think the same thing is happening in digital assets so specific to cryptocurrency and bitcoin. This is a huge week from a macro standpoint, right? We've had strong economic data for the past six weeks, really across retail sales, across GDP, but now you have the inflation, whether it's transitory or not, but you are starting to have it creep up. What I think is probably most interesting though is everybody is concerned about the rise in rates, but rates themselves are going nowhere.
00:03:17.238 - 00:03:53.160, Speaker C: So we have all this inflationary data, we have all these headlines talking about rates are going to have to rise and that causes bitcoin to go down. It causes the Nasdaq and small cap stocks like the Russell to go down, but rates themselves are going nowhere. So I think inflation is on people's mind. I think bank of America recently said that. I think it was four or five times the amount of mentions of inflation on earnings calls than last year and more so than anytime since 2004. But the reality is, without rates really going anywhere and without the dollar going anywhere, it's still very supportive of risk assets. And I think most of these fears will probably subside pretty quickly.
00:03:54.010 - 00:04:01.734, Speaker A: And so when you were talking about how you view crypto as encompassing sort of different categories, how would you break those out?
00:04:01.932 - 00:04:45.538, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think there's four types of digital assets right now and there might be more a year from now and two years from now, but right now there's four. There's your cryptocurrencies, which for all intents and purposes, honestly, is just bitcoin. But now you have Dogecoin and Ripple and some other ones that have high market caps but aren't necessarily being used for anything. Then you have your protocols and platforms led by Ethereum, which is certainly the biggest and the most highly used. But you do have some competitors, binance, smart chain on the more centralized side. And then you have things like Solana and eventually Cardano, avalanche, algorand, you name it. But these protocols and platforms are base layers where it's really the total economic activity that happens on the chain is kind of how you value this as an investment.
00:04:45.538 - 00:05:18.082, Speaker C: And then you have asset backed tokens. There's not as many asset backed tokens, but these are regular securities. Maybe not in the eyes of the issuers or by the SEC yet, but these are securities. These are tokens that are backed fully by either equity or debt or some sort of an income stream, like an NBA salary in the case of Spencer Dinwiddie last year. But asset backed tokens can be modeled and valued based on what the underlying asset is. It has nothing to do with crypto or money or macro. And then the fourth one is probably the largest group of digital assets and certainly the most interesting.
00:05:18.082 - 00:05:54.234, Speaker C: And that's what we call pass through tokens. And these pass through tokens are hybrid instruments. They're quasi loyalty or rewards program on one side and they're quasi equity on the other side. These are instruments that generally, if you own them, you can participate in some way, shape or form within the network because you own it. That's the quasi loyalty or rewards part. But then you have some sort of an economic interest, either it's revenues or profits that are being passed through to you or some sort of inflation schedule of new tokens that are being passed to you, but you actually generate some sort of economic benefit or yield from owning it. And it's these pass through tokens that have driven DFI.
00:05:54.234 - 00:06:20.310, Speaker C: It's what's driving NFTs and gaming, it's what's driving Web 3.0. And these generally have nothing to do with the economic factors that drive Bitcoin and the stock market and rates. So it's not surprising to me at all that DeFi has completely uncorrelated to Bitcoin, especially in a week like today, because those factors that drive DeFi are not relevant to what's driving Bitcoin.
00:06:21.050 - 00:06:29.800, Speaker A: That's fascinating. Yeah, I love what you said there about I guess what I would call governance tokens, which, of course, obviously.
00:06:31.770 - 00:06:32.038, Speaker C: I.
00:06:32.044 - 00:06:56.000, Speaker A: Don'T know if, like, self contained is the word, but yeah, they're sort of like if you're interested in whatever protocol those represent, whatever that's doing, whether it's like a lending protocol or something around a stable coin, then that is really kind of what will, I guess, affect the price movements in those?
00:06:56.610 - 00:07:38.160, Speaker C: Well, I would also say that part of the reason they used to be called governance and now we call them pass through tokens. And there's a reason for that is that governance without any cash flows to govern is kind of pointless. Nobody cares about governing something that's a shell that has no actual revenues and cash flows. Now, in the last 18 months, you're starting to see real revenues and real cash flows at these centralized exchange companies like BNB and FTX, like these, like the DFI ones, like uniswap sushi swap, et cetera. Once you actually start having real cash flows and have the ability to pass through something real back to your token holders, the governance really gets replaced with this pass through element. It's the same thing, but you're actually governing something that has value for the first time.
00:07:39.330 - 00:08:04.040, Speaker A: So let's also talk about one of the more recent notable market moves in crypto, which is of course, ethereum trading at all time highs. Earlier this week it reached a little over $4,300, although as of press time, I think it's around 3700. Why do you think we've seen ethereum go from $740 this year to about 4K?
00:08:05.050 - 00:08:58.498, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, the short answer is there's been a lot of money flowing into ethereum. That has been evidence no matter where you look. Whether you talk to some of the OTC brokers who are starting to see institutional money coming in, or you see some of these new products like the Canadian ETF and some of the other products that are specific to Ethereum coming in, there's real money pouring into Ethereum and I think that is for real reasons. The first and foremost is even though we've talked about Ethereum Killers Forever and who might usurp Ethereum's throne as the top smart contract platform, the reality is there's an enormous amount of economic activity that is happening on the ethereum Network and in the protocol from, again, all the things we just mentioned. From DeFi to NFTs and gaming to everything that may or may not have as much traction as those two. And probably more importantly though, for the first time you can value Ethereum as a protocol.
00:08:58.498 - 00:09:44.354, Speaker C: A lot of the protocols and platforms, especially when they're up and coming, they're really more like call options. Right? This is why venture capital firms love to invest in the protocols they're call options on future economic activity. But there's no way to really support what that value might be. But with this new proposal that's coming through Ethereum with EIP 1559 and this switch to E 2.0, what that's saying is all of these transactions that are happening on Ethereum that are producing real value right now only to miners, that cash flow is going to start being distributed back to token holders. So now, instead of just looking at this as a what if and look at all this economic activity now, you can run a real GCF analysis or a real dividend yield model and say, well, if ethereum has produced $50 million in fees in the last seven days. I can annualize that and I can figure out what percentage of that is going to token holders.
00:09:44.354 - 00:09:57.930, Speaker C: And now I can come up with an actual price for what Ethereum is worth. And I think that's probably the biggest takeaway for me is that not only are the venture capital firms loving Ethereum now, but now you have real traditional value investors who are starting to look at this as a technology with real cash flows.
00:09:59.070 - 00:10:18.420, Speaker A: Yeah, so I do agree that everybody is talking about this and I'm very interested to see what happens when it does get adopted. So in a moment we'll continue that discussion, plus also turn to Elon Musk's effect on the markets. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:11:23.210 - 00:11:46.446, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Jeff Dorman. So, as you were talking about with Ethereum, there's this big shift coming. Do you feel that right now it's sort of like a bitcoin having where once it happens, we won't really see the price rising because everybody is expecting it? Or do you feel that afterward we will see it rise even more?
00:11:46.628 - 00:12:29.926, Speaker C: Well, there's a big difference between catalyst and event driven investing and long term fundamental investing. Generally. We do both at Arca and when we think of something long term and fundamental, it's usually something that already has KPIs and metrics and cash flows and something that we can really model. When we look at events and catalysts, we're looking at a hard date or some sort of hard catalyst that we are basing an investment off of. I think with Ethereum right now, you have to still put this more in the event and catalyst driven bucket, because even though we're talking about this transition to ETH 2.0 and the EIP 1559 proposal and these cash flows coming, it hasn't actually happened yet. And for anyone who's actually worked at a technology company and has ever pushed code or seen a GitHub commit, things can go wrong, right? There could be bugs.
00:12:29.926 - 00:13:06.502, Speaker C: And that's when you have three or four developers in a small company. Imagine thousands of developers across the world all working on this project. So there is a good chance that this could be buggy. There's a good chance there could be some effects of this transition and migration that we haven't really thought through. And I think until you see it, it's too early to say that, yes, this is a fundamentally sound token that has these real cash flows, but there's no question that Ethereum economic activity is going to continue even if there's hiccups with this migration. So it depends on what type of an investor you are. But if you are long Ethereum, there are real reasons to be long.
00:13:06.502 - 00:14:02.060, Speaker C: Given all of this activity that's happening as an investor, it depends on what your mandate is and depends on how you think about how smooth this transition will be and how long your time horizon is on sticking with something with Ethereum. And I've said this multiple times before, I still think that a lot of the applications that are built on Ethereum are probably going to be seen by traditional investors as better places to put their money than Ethereum itself once they really learn about the ecosystem. Not necessarily because it's better, but just because it makes more sense to them. A traditional equity analyst who is used to analyzing companies with cash flows is probably going to gravitate towards something like DeFi or something like a gaming company before they gravitate towards ethereum simply because it just is easier for them to understand. But long term, rising tide lifts all boats and they should all perform pretty well as long as the economic activity on ethereum continues to be strong.
00:14:02.510 - 00:14:52.780, Speaker A: That's interesting. I guess I think of it differently because ethereum is more proven and the DeFi stuff is more risky. But I take your point about just how they might be able to grasp some of the DeFi tokens more easily. So here we're making this kind of or you are making this pretty smart analysis just based on the fundamentals. But let's now kind of talk about some other things that have been going on in crypto, especially in regards to Elon Musk's effect on the markets. Let's just first talk about dogecoin. What happened with that, would you say? And what do you think all that says about the crypto market? I don't know if you saw the SNL skit about what is dogecoin, but I think it represented everything pretty well.
00:14:53.310 - 00:15:29.070, Speaker C: Sure, yeah, I did see it, and I've been writing a blog every week for three plus years talking about the digital asset market. And never, if you would ask me at any point did I think I'd ever be talking about dogecoin. I'm not highly emotional, I'm not a bitcoin maximalist, I'm not an ethereum maximalist, I'm an investor, I'm a profit maximalist. And we will look to wherever we see value. I never thought I'd be writing about dogecoin, but we did. We wrote about it a few weeks ago because it is taking over the market's interest. Dogecoin fits in the cryptocurrency basket, which is similar to bitcoin.
00:15:29.070 - 00:15:54.458, Speaker C: Bitcoin cannot be valued, right? You can look at it in terms of relative value versus gold. You can look at it in terms of total market size based on money supply. But there's no way to value bitcoin, despite the fact that many analysts have tried, and I've heard many of them on your show, I don't believe it. I think bitcoin is a belief system. Bitcoin is, you know, how many people want to own this relative to the amount of bitcoin exists? And that's really it. Dogecoin is the same thing. There's no valuation to dogecoin.
00:15:54.458 - 00:16:30.614, Speaker C: But the way to think about it is thinking about options. And think about what the black scholes market tells you when you price an option, the black scholes model tells you. You need to have the strike of the underlying, you need to understand the security price, the time to expiry, the risk free rate and the volatility. Those last three things are the most important. There is no time to expiry when you're talking about a new cryptocurrency or a protocol, right? This is not like a company where there's a ticking time bomb and if they run out of cash, they ultimately default. These things can stick around forever. So right away you have infinite expiration, which gives an option value, then you have the risk free rate.
00:16:30.614 - 00:17:04.014, Speaker C: Well, we all know interest rates are zero and some points negative. So right there that makes options more attractive. And then you have the volatility. And there's no question that these instruments have a lot of volatility. So when you think about it in that way, I personally don't think dogecoin will be successful as a real store of value or as money like it is intending to do. But if you just think about it mathematically, bitcoin has a 900 billion dollar market cap and dogecoin has a $50 billion market cap. So the market is basically telling you that there's roughly a 5% chance that Dogecoin can one day be a form of money just like bitcoin.
00:17:04.014 - 00:17:44.660, Speaker C: And I don't know what the right percentage is, I don't know if it's zero or one or two or 10%, but it's probably not zero based on the fact that there's no real way to kill this. And if you believe what I think, which is that all these cryptocurrencies are belief systems, who am I to say that millions of people around the world aren't going to rally behind Dogecoin more so than Bitcoin? Now, from a security standpoint, it makes no sense. Bitcoin is a much more secure network and there's hundreds of other reasons why bitcoin makes more sense as a store of value than Dogecoin does. But again, if its popularity increases and there's people who really will this to succeed, there is a small chance that it succeeds and the market is basically pricing it based on that option value.
00:17:45.110 - 00:18:03.542, Speaker A: And do you have the same take on all of these other dog coins? Like the shib coin for shibi and Akita and bone and dog elon Mars which had the ticker symbol elon. I just wondered what you made of that whole thing as well.
00:18:03.676 - 00:18:51.574, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, honestly, we ignore most of know just because we're in the digital asset market doesn't mean we have to be paying attention to every little thing that pops up on Twitter. So we're aware of it, we understand that it was driving some interest and some value. But there's a difference between waiting for something to actually have real KPIs and real metrics where you can look at how many users are using it, or how many wallets are interacting with it, or how many transactions are being sent versus something that's just taking advantage of a theme and popping up overnight. We're patient investors. If any of these new Dog coins that come up are still here in six months or twelve months and have the same type of success as some of the others, then we'll have some real numbers to dig into. For now, it seems like a little bit of a sideshow to the main event and quite frankly, as an active manager, we love that. Right.
00:18:51.574 - 00:19:31.300, Speaker C: The more the market and the media continues to focus on things that we don't find to be all that relevant and valuable, the more we can focus on the things that are. And the most interesting thing from my standpoint, especially having come from places like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch and Citadel is the sweet spot for active management or investing is always when the asset class is evolving and growing and the opportunity set is growing, but the competition isn't. And truthfully, a lot of these things that pop up, that grab everyone's attention, it's just providing a nice smokescreen for the real economic activity that's happening and it means the competition is focused in the wrong place. So I love it personally as an investor, even though I honestly have no idea what these are and probably would never invest in.
00:19:32.070 - 00:19:49.510, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And just to note, Chingpeng Zhao of Binance, the CEO there, tweeted that Binance ran out of ETH deposit addresses due to Shib today. That was the day they listed it. And he said never happened before for any other, ERC, 20 coins.
00:19:49.930 - 00:19:50.678, Speaker C: Wow.
00:19:50.844 - 00:19:55.898, Speaker A: Yeah. It says something about what the demand was, and if that demand is still.
00:19:55.904 - 00:20:17.460, Speaker C: There in six months, it might become interesting. I think it's a little too early to tell, but like I said, a lot of these are option value and I'm never going to tell somebody that it has a 0% probability of working. So for those who have done the work and enjoy it, it could very well be profitable and very well interesting. But for those who do real fundamental valuation, we certainly have to see more than just a few days.
00:20:17.830 - 00:20:47.610, Speaker A: Yeah, and we'll have to see now, after Vitalik's sales of the Shib token and some of these other dog coins did crash the price, or I don't know if crash is the word, but definitely took some of the air out. So now let's talk about Elon Musk's announcement that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment. The company did say they would continue to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. So tell us what effect that had on the markets and why you think that was the reaction.
00:20:48.510 - 00:21:44.654, Speaker C: Well, first of all, I think that might have been the final catalyst that took the markets down in the last few days here, but I don't think it was the only thing that was happening. Right. We've already talked about the macro lens, between the inflation data, between what we saw with some of the stocks, the publicly traded stocks that are of basically digital asset companies, all being down somewhere between 30 and 40% in April and already being down 20% to 30% here in May. Not to mention the Nasdaq having three or four days down. There was a lot of other signs that were leaning towards people wanting to err on the side of selling over buying. And I think the Elon Musk news or the Tesla news that came out yesterday was kind of the nail in the coffin for those who are trying to make a buy or sell decision. But at the same know, I wrote back in february, how many times can bitcoin rally on the same news? Because if you look at the rally from november through middle of april, it was the same news over and over again.
00:21:44.654 - 00:22:20.454, Speaker C: Tesla announced that they bought bitcoin square, announces that they buy bitcoin. BNY mellon and deutsche bank are reviewing crypto custody. Mastercard and visa and venmo and PayPal and morgan stanley. It was all the same news over and over again. You could summarize that in one sentence, which is, there are new entrants to bitcoin. So if that is a central theme that drove bitcoin up five x over the course of six months, by that same definition, if one of those players pulls out, you should have a negative reaction to it. Now, it doesn't really change anything in terms of the full scope of what bitcoin is or how much penetration is having in the market.
00:22:20.454 - 00:22:44.126, Speaker C: But again, if the markets are going to reward that type of news on the way up, they should also negatively punish it on the way down. And I think the reaction was actually in the beginning, the reaction was great. It was a very bitcoin specific piece of news. Right. Tesla and elon musk said, we don't believe that bitcoin is environmentally sound, and I don't believe in that. I think there's been enough on your show as well. There's been enough people who have refuted that.
00:22:44.126 - 00:23:06.920, Speaker C: So I don't want to get into that, but it was very bitcoin specific. Tesla said, we do not want to accept bitcoin anymore because it is not environmentally sound. And that was it. So in theory, the only thing that should have gone down was bitcoin. And for the most of yesterday, that's actually what happened. Bitcoin was going down, and the rest of the market was holding in pretty well. Today, you had a little bit of a spillover and contagion effect where the rest of the market started to trade off as well.
00:23:06.920 - 00:23:18.570, Speaker C: That's when you get back into these high correlations and whether or not this is all just one market. But I thought the reaction was healthy yesterday, even though I don't think it has any real long term consequence.
00:23:19.230 - 00:23:37.950, Speaker A: Oh, okay. That interests me that you said that, because I just feel like this year with the NFT thing, there's been a lot of talk about environmental stuff, and I feel like sort of like now that the normies are coming, that they're highlighting this way more than normal crypto people. But you don't think this will have a long term effect on the crypto markets?
00:23:38.030 - 00:24:33.438, Speaker C: Well, I mean, look, I wasn't there when satoshi wrote the white paper, but I'm pretty know seeing mark cuban and elon musk battle on twitter about whether or not bitcoin is environmentally sound, I'm pretty sure that's not what was intended. Two eccentric billionaires fighting over the value of bitcoin. So, no, it's one piece of a giant mosaic theory puzzle. I think the ESG concerns are valid across the entire globe, and I think there is some components of what bitcoin is offering that you can say has a negative impact on the environment because of the electricity. But at the same time, again, we've been refuting it. People like Nick Carter have been refuting it. I mean, there's enough evidence to also support that energy is a grid and there's excess energy available, and miners are efficiently looking for the lowest cost surplus of energy, and therefore, it's not really adding any more of a carbon footprint than would be there without bitcoin.
00:24:33.438 - 00:25:22.290, Speaker C: So it really just comes down to people either believe that bitcoin should exist and this idea of a government state free monetary system should exist or not. If it does, then you would say, yes, this is worth the energy that goes into it. If you don't believe bitcoin should exist, of course you're going to say the energy isn't real. There's all kinds of things that utilize energy in the world that you can validate if you believe the means justify the end. So I'm not a big believer that the bitcoin ESG concerns are going to have a huge impact on this market. But I do understand why, if you're Tesla and you have this brand of being environmentally conscious and you sell renewable batteries and you're looking for energy credits, why you would take that stance.
00:25:22.710 - 00:25:40.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I do obviously see why for the position they're in, it was probably something that had to happen at some point. But I do think this is a growing concern. I'd like to keep my eye on it. Well, this has been such a fascinating discussion. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.
00:25:41.310 - 00:25:43.130, Speaker C: Well, thank you for having me, Laura.
