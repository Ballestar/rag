00:00:00.250 - 00:00:59.290, Speaker A: We have to get beyond the point of where we're just trading DeFi tokens on DeFi rails with other DeFi traders. And what I think NFTs did, while again, there was a lot of speculation, there's still a lot of junk out there. What they did is they set the stage for new types of these digital assets to be created and to interact with both one another, to create ways in which you can start to build out things like decentralized identity, right, and bringing personality to crypto, space, case and identification. And so the culmination of all of these, I think, is what really sets us up for while 2023 might not be the year in which we see a true rebound in kind of a big crypto rally, I think it's going to set the stage for a lot more interesting creative use cases for these assets. And we're going to see not just the Web Three Natives building, but one of the big trends we're looking at is brands, companies, kind of the quote unquote Web Two world starting to move into the space because again of the relatability of something like an NFT for memberships and starting to build out on chain social graphs and things of that nature.
