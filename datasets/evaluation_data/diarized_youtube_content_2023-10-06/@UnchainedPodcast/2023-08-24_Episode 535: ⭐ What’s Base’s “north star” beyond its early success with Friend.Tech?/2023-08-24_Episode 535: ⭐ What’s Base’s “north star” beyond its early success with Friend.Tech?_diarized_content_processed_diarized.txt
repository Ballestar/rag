So it's a million people who are going to create the next experiences that a billion people actually come on chain to use. And I think we're starting to see kind of that next wave of experiences really being built this summer. Stuff like friendtech, stuff like base paint. Obviously the DeFi stuff is happening too and NFTs. But I think it feels to me like we're a little bit of an inflection point right now where we're starting to see real consumer use cases that actually have the potential to bring in millions of people, tens of millions of people. And that's probably what gets me the most fired up.
