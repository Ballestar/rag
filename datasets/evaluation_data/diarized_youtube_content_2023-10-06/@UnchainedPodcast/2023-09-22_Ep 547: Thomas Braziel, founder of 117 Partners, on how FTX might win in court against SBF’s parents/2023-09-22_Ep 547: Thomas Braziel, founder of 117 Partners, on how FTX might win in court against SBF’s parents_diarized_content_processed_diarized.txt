00:00:00.170 - 00:00:45.140, Speaker A: I think almost all the stuff, though, they'll win on the merits of just the of the fraudulent conveyance. I mean, these are all fraudulent transfers, potentially while the debtor was insolvent, potentially while there was commingle of funds. So clearly all that money has to come back. I think that's pretty easy. The question is, like, what's it worth now and who can actually pay it back? Like, if money was given to a charity, can you actually go and get it back? Meaning, is it there? Has it been spent? Kind of stuff. And you can only squeeze whatever rock so hard. So the question will be, what is the real estate in the Bahamas worth? The $10 million or whatever that was gifted to them, where did that money end up going? Can they trace it? So these things cost money and then to do and then the question is, like, how much of an effort do you want to make?
