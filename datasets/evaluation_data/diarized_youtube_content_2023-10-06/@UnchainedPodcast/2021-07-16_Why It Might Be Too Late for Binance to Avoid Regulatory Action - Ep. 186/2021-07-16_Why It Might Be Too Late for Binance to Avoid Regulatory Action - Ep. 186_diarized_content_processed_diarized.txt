Welcome, Christine.
00:01:34.510 - 00:01:36.220, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:01:36.590 - 00:02:02.660, Speaker A: In recent weeks, binance has become the subject of a number of warnings or announced investigations by regulators across several jurisdictions. So we're recording on Thursday, June 15. And just this morning, there was yet another one where Italy's securities regulator Concept said finance was unauthorized to offer services in the country. Can you give an overview of the various notices and actions against binance in recent weeks?
00:02:03.110 - 00:03:05.922, Speaker B: Sure, they certainly are sailing into some headwinds. And just to be clear, when we talk about binance, I'm talking about binance. Binance, which is the sort of the global derivatives exchange that doesn't really sit in any particular jurisdiction, and market participants, investors have been accessing it through their website for a number of years now. So just to distinguish that binance from the Binances that sit in a number of different jurisdictions, including the US. So the larger binance entity has absolutely attracted the attention of regulators in the US, in the UK, italy and a number of other jurisdictions, and in particular in the US. We understand that the CFTC, the Department of justice and the IRS are all looking into their activities, presumably as a derivatives exchange that is being accessed by US. Customers, but we obviously don't know the facts.
00:03:05.922 - 00:03:33.890, Speaker B: Similarly, in the UK, the FCA restricted access as of June 30 to retail customers in the UK, likely along the similar lines as to the investigations in the US. And the Italian authorities essentially said the same thing italian customers are not allowed to receive any investment advice from binance or to do any trading activities on the sort of larger global exchange.
00:03:34.630 - 00:04:10.374, Speaker A: Yeah, and some of the others have been japan's Financial Services Agency, which issued a second warning about Binance. The Ontario Securities Commission said Binance failed to comply with local regulations. Thailand announced it filed a criminal complaint against Binance for unregistered operations. The Cayman Islands said that Binance Group and Binance Holding Ltd were not authorized to operate there. And Singapore is announced that it's watching two Binance entities and also Poland's financial regulator caution against using exchange. So it's quite the list. And even in the US.
00:04:10.374 - 00:04:23.498, Speaker A: Silvergate bank also cut off withdrawals and deposits for Binance, but not for Binance. US, the US entity, as you mentioned earlier. What is the significance of all these actions and announcements?
00:04:23.674 - 00:05:18.420, Speaker B: That's a great question. I would have to say I think the Binance has certainly been on the radar of the global regulators for some period of time. But I certainly think the lack of jurisdiction of the entity itself has really hampered their efforts and ability to bring these actions against them. Typically in the cross border setting, what we see is the regulators will submit an MoU, or work through an MoU with a foreign regulator in a foreign jurisdiction, and they'll submit their request for information or their subpoena or what have you. That's been a challenge with Binance because it's really kind of hard to pin down what their actual jurisdiction is. And so I certainly think that has slowed things down. But I'm certain that Binance has been on the radar, the regulator, certainly the US regulators, for a number of years now.
00:05:18.870 - 00:05:42.790, Speaker A: What do you think is the likely outcome of all these reports about these? Because especially for the US ones, it was not 100% clear whether or not they really were. They probably are, but it was just reported and not generally confirmed. So what do you think is the likelihood that these reports are accurate? And if and when do you think these inquiries would result in an enforcement action?
00:05:42.950 - 00:06:26.040, Speaker B: My guess is that the reports are very know. I think we've got some precedents in the BitMEX case where we heard reports that the CFTC and DOJ were investigating them and that turned out to be correct. My guess is that probably in the next six to nine months, you'll see either a settlement with the CuPc, DOJ and IRS, or not, in which case they will likely seek to sort of enjoy their activities in the US. And charge them for whatever violations of law us. Law that are applicable know the Southern District of New York, or perhaps Washington, DC. Given the number of federal agencies that are involved in the case.
00:06:26.650 - 00:06:31.900, Speaker A: And then what would the trajectory of Binance be after that?
00:06:32.270 - 00:07:09.378, Speaker B: I think it's unclear. When you take into account the activities of, you know, for them, the best resolution would be of something very speedy, some kind of settlement with Binance to allow them to move forward in the US. With the US. Regulators, with a somewhat clean slate. But there just may be a difference of opinions. Binance may take the view we're engaging in activity in our jurisdiction, wherever that is, that's unregulated and they may want to fight the case. They may not want to settle with the regulators and create some interesting precedent.
00:07:09.378 - 00:07:24.890, Speaker B: But I do think that there will be tensions with binance us. I mean obviously separate entities that will make it, I think, much harder for binance us. To move forward in the US. If binance the sort of parent company fighting any charges bought by u. S. Regulators.
00:07:25.550 - 00:07:56.760, Speaker A: Binance has been hiring a number of former regulators or compliance directors from other big fintechs to key roles and as advisors. For instance, former financial action task force executive secretary mick McDonald and former head of the canadian delegation to the FADF, jose Nadot were appointed as compliance and regulatory advisors. And also max bacchus, the former u. S. Senator from montana and us. Ambassador to china, will also provide high level guidance. What's your sense of how effective this strategy will be?
00:07:57.210 - 00:08:36.898, Speaker B: It is certainly worth pursuing. It's certainly worth trying. I think binance us. And binance are certainly sailing into headwinds in the US. Partially of their own making, but also just sort of the currency to play here in the US. With respect to crypto at congress and with the you know, on one hand, I think it clearly shows and demonstrates that they want to turn the corner and sort of move forward with a new attention to laws and statutes and regulations and compliance and the like and really want to put their best foot know, when dealing with regulators in the US. And with the global regulatory body.
00:08:36.898 - 00:09:06.362, Speaker B: So that certainly makes sense. It should be effective. But I think we're just in the US. In particular, we're really at sort of a challenging point in the innovation of crypto. And by that I mean there's a lot of consternation on the hill with crypto. There's certainly supporters, there are certainly members of congress that are interested and have areas of interest. But you have vocal members of congress who are not supporters of crypto and the regulators in the US.
00:09:06.362 - 00:09:58.700, Speaker B: Hear that and see, you know, max bacchus can certainly be an effective advocate for binance and the crypto industry at large, but there are a lot of folks he's got to be talking to on the hill and they've got to change their tune. And the regulators have to feel comfortable and convinced that the hill is now supportive of crypto. So they've got the right players, they're going to action them. I think the question is, is that enough to surmount those in congress who are not supporters of crypto? And that's not just binance, but certainly they look to the binance holding company as a key example, know what they don't like in the crypto space. So there are certainly challenges, but they've identified key players that could really be effective. But it's an issue that's larger than just them.

Back to my conversation with Christine Parker in the 2018 interview I did with finance CEO Chang Peng Zhao, who goes by the name CZ. I asked her about Finance's history of leaving jurisdictions when it looks like regulators might clamp down on binance. And this was very early on, when they would leave China or Japan or whatever, when these regulators kind of started making noise. And at that time, he responded to me, quote, what's wrong with going to a country where dot dot, dot things are viewed favorably for you? Why do you have to be stuck in a country that is not good for this kind of stuff? Meaning, for crypto, this is like saying, if you don't like hot places, why don't you stick yourself in Florida in the sun all the time? So at this point in time, three years later, how well do you think that this modus operandi has served binance?
00:12:12.090 - 00:12:21.546, Speaker B: Well, on one hand, they have incredible market share, incredible liquidity. If not the biggest, they're one of the biggest out there.
00:12:21.648 - 00:12:22.646, Speaker A: The biggest.
00:12:22.838 - 00:13:06.354, Speaker B: Okay, so they are the biggest, and everybody wants to trade on them. They've got liquidity, they've got leverage, they've got the products that retail customers in the US. Or pretty much anywhere else can't access. So on one hand, this approach has allowed them to build up an incredible market presence. On the other hand, the regulators hate it. They don't think that it makes them a credible partner in being sort of a responsible, yet innovative crypto company that they want their retail investors to have access to. It is certainly a viable approach, but I think if you want to have continuing access to retail investors from the larger jurisdictions.
00:13:06.354 - 00:13:41.986, Speaker B: That won't last forever, and I think we're seeing that now. I think we're sort of at that inflection point. That being said, there is not that much that US regulators can do to prevent US customers from accessing finance. All it really takes is a website and a VPN. I think the key tension will be with their payment partners and whether customers can continue to trade and withdraw their money or deposit funds. I think it's helped them to build an incredible market, but I think in the long term there are challenges to that approach and we're seeing them right now.
00:13:42.168 - 00:14:06.170, Speaker A: In a recent blog post, CZ cited a number of ways in which Binance plans to become more compliant. And one of the techniques he mentioned was that it would localize its operations similar to how Binance US is an independent entity, compliant and regulated in the US. Do you think that will be an effective strategy or is that going to SAP Binance of its strength in being able to source liquidity from around the globe?
00:14:06.830 - 00:15:10.286, Speaker B: That's a great question. From a regulatory and legal perspective, it is a great approach because every jurisdiction takes a different approach to what's essentially the regulation of derivatives. And there's some commonality, but it's a pretty local regime and so the US and the UK and Singapore all have different approaches, particularly with respect to retail customers. So on one know that will hopefully put them in the good graces of the US regulators. On the other hand, exactly to your point, they are going to lose that global liquidity because the cross border regulations are really tough when it comes to retail participants trading on derivatives exchange and there's just not that cross border liquidity that you see right now with Binance. So yes, it allowed them to stand up in the US, but they're going to lose that global liquidity. Also in the US, we don't have any leverage products that are available for retail customers anyway, so it's going to reduce their offerings, which will be less attractive to retail investors in the US.
00:15:10.286 - 00:15:19.106, Speaker B: And you lose that global pool of liquidity. That being said, it puts you in the good phrases of the regulator, so there's ostensibly some benefit to that.
00:15:19.288 - 00:15:26.530, Speaker A: And do you think that there are any other good strategies Binance can use now to avoid penalties or enforcement actions?
00:15:26.690 - 00:16:06.930, Speaker B: The ship might have sailed on that one. It might be too late for that. It's really a strict liability test in the US. If you offer derivatives and you're unregulated in the US and you allow US customers to access that exchange, even if they pivot now, it's too late to sort of clean up the past bad acts. But that being said, again, they're standing up finance US. It seems like their plan is to work with the regulators, to stand up a new entity and hopefully they will be successful in pushing the regulators to allow more regulated products that are more commercially attractive to retail customers. I e products that have leverage.
00:16:07.670 - 00:16:28.860, Speaker A: We just heard the news that Shapeshift will be moving over to a decentralized exchange, and Binance, of course, has the Binance smart chain. Do you think that Binance could switch to a Dex and in that way avoid at least maybe, if not enforcement actions due to past behavior at least going forward?
00:16:32.350 - 00:16:58.660, Speaker B: Binance could certainly take that approach. Again, I don't know if it absolves them of prior misconduct, and their decks would have to be in compliance with local regulation. Whatever applies in the circumstances of how it turns itself into a decentralized entity, certainly a possibility for them going forward. I'm not sure that it solves their current issues.
00:16:59.190 - 00:17:16.840, Speaker A: All right. And then earlier you mentioned BitMEX. Based off of what has happened there with the CFTC and DOJ enforcement actions against that exchange. What would you say is the relevance there for Binance in terms know, what is this spell for them most.
00:17:19.530 - 00:17:59.910, Speaker B: Mean? Look, if they're going to take the same route, you don't know until you don't know. But I think there are probably very similar allegations against Binance that there are against BitMEX in which they're operating an offshore unregulated exchange or Futures Commission, Merchant FCM. They should be regulated and they are not conducting themselves as if they are regulated. That was another charge, a novel charge the CTC brought. And they failed to do anti money laundering compliance, know Bank Secrecy Act requirements as they would be required to do if they were regulated in the US. I mean, I think that's a pretty clear roadmap going forward.
00:18:00.060 - 00:18:07.030, Speaker A: And so you think then it could result in criminal charges against perhaps CZ or other executives?
00:18:07.370 - 00:18:23.658, Speaker B: I don't know. I was really surprised by the criminal charges against the founders of IMEX. I mean, that was really something. I would not want to see that as a tool necessarily going forward used by the regulators in this space. But I'm not this other district of New York U. S. Attorney.
00:18:23.658 - 00:18:26.030, Speaker B: It's certainly they have the precedents.
00:18:26.370 - 00:18:36.926, Speaker A: Okay. All right, well, I guess we will have to check back to see what comes of all this. But it's been such a pleasure talking to you and thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:18:37.038 - 00:18:39.810, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me. This was a great conversation.

00:20:21.310 - 00:21:21.682, Speaker A: According to Bloomberg, Fidelity Digital Assets is planning to hire up to 100 new employees in response to increasing institutional demand for cryptocurrency. The hiring spree would bolster the company's headcount by 70% and allow Fidelity to develop new products and expand services strictly beyond Bitcoin. Tom Jessup, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, explicitly mentioned Ether, saying, quote, We've seen more interest in Ether, so we want to be ahead of that demand. Speaking of hiring, decrypt's Jeff Roberts reports that Binance US's hiring of CEO Brian Brooks has caused tension with leadership at Circle and Coinbase. Brooks recently joined Binance US in April after a ten month stint as the head of the Office of the Controller of the Currency. Before his time at the OCC, Brooks was Coinbase's top lawyer. Roberts reports that multiple sources say Brooks joined Binance US while negotiating for the role of president at Circle, a move that left the stablecoin provider blindsided.
00:21:21.682 - 00:22:25.686, Speaker A: Coinbase was also rankled, as Roberts put it, as Brooks was still consulting with the exchange when he took over the reins at competitor Binance US. Next Headline Jack Dorsey announces new Bitcoin platform Business Square, along with seller, cash, app and Title, is creating a new platform business with Bitcoin as its primary focus, tweeted Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

As of now, the company lacks a name. Next Headline DFI Education Fund Sells half its Uni The DFI Education Fund announced the sale of half of the 1 million uni tokens that it received from Uniswap's Treasury roughly two weeks ago. The deal made waves as it contradicted Def's initial proposal, which outlined a plan for the tokens to be allocated over a four to five year period to not dilute uni's price stemming from a Harvard law Blockchain and Fintech initiative proposal. Uniswap.
00:22:25.686 - 00:23:12.042, Speaker A: Dow members approved the DFI education fund on June 29. From there, 1 million Uni tokens were released from Uniswap's Treasury to fund and create the DFI Education Fund, a 501 for nonprofit intended to provide grants to further support existing and new political groups engaged in crypto policy and or lobbying. DFI watch's Chris Black was a vocal critic of Def's $10 million Uni sale. He tweeted, DFI Education Fund is dumping 500K Uni all at once for $10.2 million in USDC. Why in the hell do they need $10.2 million all at once? Why not just sell Uni as they need? It amazing that Uni governance has absolutely no say in what is happening here.
00:23:12.042 - 00:24:06.454, Speaker A: In response to the blowback, Def posted on Medium explaining its Uni USDC sale as a diversification play, adding that an annual budget would be published in the next 90 days. The fund also updated its Twitter profile picture after initially leaving it blank, which many users found quite fitting. Next headline us. Regulators, crave crypto clarity and stricter regulation. On Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell told Congress that stablecoins should face stricter regulation. Powell said, quote if they are going to be a significant part of the payments universe, which we don't think crypto assets will be, but Stablecoins might be, then we need an appropriate regulatory framework, which frankly, we don't have. On Thursday, Congressman Tom Emmer reintroduced the securities Clarity Act, a bill that would provide a framework for the SEC to determine which digital assets are securities, saying that regulatory uncertainty has hindered the US's.
00:24:06.454 - 00:25:04.718, Speaker A: Ability to compete in the crypto industry. Next Headline Shapeshift is decentralizing Crypto exchange Shapeshift is shutting down formal operations and has begun fully decentralizing. It is open sourcing everything and has commenced the largest AirDrop in history, distributing $98 million worth of Fox tokens to over a million customers and DFI community members. All 900,000 Shapeshift users will be eligible for the AirDrop, along with 120,000 addresses associated with popular DFI tokens. According to a blog post by CEO Eric Voorhees, the decentralization process started last fall when Shapeshift began replacing its trading systems with popular DEXes. Through integrations with Zero, X and THORChain, Shapeshift was able to fully offer decentralized trading at scale for ERC, 20 and Bitcoin transactions. Once ShapeShift's trading systems were replaced by DFI integrations, Voorhees saw no reason for the centralized aspect of ShapeShift's existence to continue.
00:25:04.718 - 00:25:45.818, Speaker A: He wrote, quote without integration of these DEXes, Shapeshift no longer provided trading services and yet users didn't lose their ability to trade. This was better for our users, better for us, and appropriately in line with the ethos of crypto, privacy, immutability and self sovereignty in finance. Next Headline Revolute's fundraising round is the third largest in crypto history Revolute, a London based neo bank with a crypto offering, has raised $800 million in a round led by SoftBank and Tiger Global. According to a Sky News report. The deal values the company at roughly $33,000,000,000.06 times greater than its February 2020 round at $5.5 billion, making it the most valuable company in British fintech history.
00:25:45.818 - 00:26:21.074, Speaker A: Revolute recently allowed customers to withdraw Crypto from its platform. Additionally, according to Business Insider, So Rare, a soccer based digital collectibles game, aka NFT Game, is expected to announce a $532,000,000 raise at a valuation of $3.8 billion, which would be the largest raise in the history of France's tech sector. Based on data from Dove Mountain, the raise from Revolute and presumably So Rare would rank as the third and fourth largest funding rounds in crypto history, respectively. Next headline bullish's. $9 billion valuation comes with no product. The Cryptocurrency exchange.
00:26:21.074 - 00:27:15.042, Speaker A: Bullish is set to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Far Peak Acquisition, headed by former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley. According to the press release, Bullish expects the transaction to close by the end of 2021. The deal values the Crypto exchange at $9 billion, roughly one fifth of Coinbase's market cap of $47 billion. Farley will take over as chief executive officer, leading a company backed by Peter Thiel, Alan Howard, Richard Lee, Galaxy Digital and Nomura. The exchange has yet to release an actual product, though it plans to offer a pilot in the coming weeks on which participants will be able to test the platform before Bullish's public launch. Next Headline Dogecoin founder says crypto has the worst parts of today's capitalist system Jackson Palmer Dogecoin's Cofounder. Who left the project in 2015, published an Eviscerating Tweet thread on why he refuses to return to cryptocurrency.
00:27:15.042 - 00:28:19.770, Speaker A: Two quotes stand out after years of studying it I believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently right wing hypercapitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight, and artificially enforced scarcity. Second, financial exploitation undoubtedly existed before cryptocurrency, but cryptocurrency is almost purpose built to make the funnel of profiteering more efficient for those at the top and less safeguarded for the vulnerable. Palmer ended a thread saying that he will no longer publicly discuss cryptocurrency. Okay, time for fun bits. Cardano's Smart Contract race heats up Polymarket, a DAP that allows users to bet on certain beliefs on Ethereum's, Blockchain recently opened up a new market asking if Cardano will support contracts on its main net by October 1, 2021. Cardano, the Charles Hoskinson led Blockchain network, has not yet launched smart contract capability, even though Cardano has been around since 2017. Ada, the native token of Cardano, is the fifth largest token by market capitalization.
00:28:19.770 - 00:29:22.730, Speaker A: On Twitter, Hoskinson, an Ethereum cofounder, sarcastically commented on the market, saying, you people really make me laugh. Polymarket, however, shot back, saying, you know what's really funny? Charles? Cardano's still not having smart contracts. We'll bet you $50,000 on Polymarket that you won't have live smart contracts for Cardano Ada by October 1. Time to put your money where your mouth is, charles winnings go to charityofchoice as of press time, it appears Polymarket users give cardano smart contracts a 39% chance of being live by October 1 2nd.
