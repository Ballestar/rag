00:00:04.570 - 00:00:59.134, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's News Recap. First Headline Twitter hack breaches VIP user accounts to perpetrate a bitcoin scam, a coordinated attack hacked numerous high profile Twitter accounts, such as those of Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama to run a bitcoin scam. The corporate accounts of Apple and Uber were compromised, as were the accounts of a host of influential players in the crypto space, including Binance, Gemini, Coinbase, CoinDesk, Charlie Lee, and others. Larry Cermak, director of research at the Block, compiled all the high profile Twitter hacks in chronological. He says, quote the takeaway is that the hacker started with large crypto accounts and stuck to only a few formats and addresses. The hacker then moved to noncrypto celebrities 2 hours after the first hack. It's totally unacceptable that it took Twitter to act as long as it did.
00:00:59.134 - 00:01:31.818, Speaker A: At 04:17 P.m. Eastern Time, it was absolutely clear to anyone that was paying attention that Twitter was compromised. It took Twitter 2 hours at Eastern time to start acting. Initially, these hacked accounts promoted a bitcoin giveaway scam associated with an organization dubbed Crypto for Health. Later, the hackers posted tweets with a bitcoin address along with messages such as I am giving back to the community. All bitcoins sent to the address below will be sent back doubled. If you send $1,000, I will send back $2,000.
00:01:31.818 - 00:02:22.780, Speaker A: Only doing this for 30 minutes. Enjoy. While Twitter reacted quickly to remove many of the messages, similar tweets were sent again from the same accounts, indicating that the hackers had completely overwhelmed Twitter security. The popular social media platform had to eventually disable some of its services temporarily to prevent the scam from spreading further. On Thursday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had to open an investigation into the hours long hack. According to reports, the bitcoin wallets promoted in the tweets received over 300 transactions and bitcoin worth more than $100,000, indicating that some Twitter users did fall prey to the scam. A Twitter investigation revealed that the hackers had compromised employee accounts in a coordinated social engineering attack.
00:02:22.780 - 00:03:26.080, Speaker A: Security experts have suggested that the blame for the incident squarely rests with Twitter due to security flaws in its service. However, a new report by Vice even suggests that the hackers may have convinced a Twitter employee to help coordinate these takeovers. Following the hacks, the social media platform is now restricting posts containing crypto addresses. It has disabled the ability to share strings of numbers and letters on its site typically used in crypto addresses. According to tests conducted by the Block Research Litecoin, XRP, Monero, bitcoin and ethereum could not be shared through the Tweets.

Next Headline ERC 20 Token market cap now surpasses that of Ethereum As Ethereum inches closer to ETH 20, the ERC 20 token ecosystem seems to be having its own big moment. According to data compiled by Camilla Russo, founder at crypto media publication The Defiant, the ERC 20 tokens running on the Ethereum network had a cumulative market cap of $33 billion, while its native token ETH was at a market cap of $27 billion. Many of the popular ERC 20 tokens are used in DFI, and according to Decrypt, DFI, tokens are growing at a faster rate than that of Bitcoin. Interestingly, Camilla tweeted, the ethereum economy is now more valuable than the asset securing it. This challenges the Fat Protocol thesis, which says blockchain protocols capture more value than their apps. Next headline.
00:05:21.810 - 00:06:04.590, Speaker A: Coinbase Plans First Ever Investor Day. Coinbase has planned its first Investor day on August 14, fueling rumors that the exchange is exploring options to go public. A Coinbase spokesperson said that the upcoming meeting is meant to, quote, facilitate a wider understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Last week, there were reports that the exchange may be planning a stock market listing later this year. The announcement of this Investor Day comes at a time when Coinbase is facing flak from the crypto community for providing its blockchain analytics software to the US. Secret Service. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote a tweet thread to defend his company's decision of licensing analytics software to government agencies.
00:06:04.590 - 00:07:01.902, Speaker A: He argued that blockchain analytics software has been around for a long time and said that people still had the option of using privacy coins if they wanted, quote, true privacy. However, on Twitter, Larry Cermak of the Block pointed out various inconsistencies that he saw in Brian's tweets, saying, quote what's still not clear is whether Coinbase is giving government agencies access to the full cluster of all their addresses. Coinbase has always had a notoriously difficult set of addresses to cluster. That data is only ever probabilistic unless you are Coinbase. Remember that in 2018, Coinbase served client data of 13,000 users to the IRS. When you combine client data exports with perfect knowledge of the cluster, it creates a new, dangerous dynamic.

On the other hand, the CFTC charged both firms for entering into, quote, illegal of to exchange swaps in digital assets and foreign currency with customers and registration violations. Even though the arbor products were technically not securities, the SEC said that these swaps were nonetheless subject to US.
00:08:29.342 - 00:08:59.930, Speaker A: Securities law. Will this open a can of worms for other DeFi products? Blockchain Consultant. Maya Zahavi certainly thinks so. She tweeted, quote Me thinks the SEC and CFTC are starting to signal they don't like DeFi. The legal construct Aubra used in these swaps contracts is essentially the same as those underlying most DeFi products. Hence, they can potentially face the same exact charges. Fun bits.
