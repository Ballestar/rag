00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.442, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.506 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.570, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.650 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:16.530 - 00:00:34.386, Speaker B: Alright, hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next up we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and captain of Compound. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet.
00:00:34.386 - 00:01:11.630, Speaker B: And finally you've got myself. I'm haseeb the head hype man at dragonfly. All four of us are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is an investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. All right, so it has been an interesting week because markets for the first time in a long time are actually up. We've seen crypto and alts rally really significantly, basically about 30% plus in the last week, which has been down only essentially since fall. And this is the first time that we've seen some signs of life in the markets.
00:01:11.630 - 00:01:37.978, Speaker B: There's been some macro tailwinds, so broader growth assets are doing well, but we've seen crazy run ups, especially in altl ones like Solana. On one of the previous shows we were talking about how Salana seemed to have been put in its grave after the collapse of FTX. Salana is now back up to where it started up. Aptos is up over 300%. Liquid staking derivatives are up like crazy. The L two S are driving hard. What have you guys been noticing in this market and what do you think is driving all this?
00:01:38.144 - 00:01:46.400, Speaker A: I just want to say I'm happy that I on this show said that Salana hit it going under ten was their ETH $88 moment.
00:01:47.650 - 00:01:53.760, Speaker B: You did say that. You did say that. You're always the Salana light at the end of the tunnel guy.
00:01:54.850 - 00:02:06.580, Speaker A: I just think it's really hard to build communities that don't disappear on the moment the price is down. And they have done that and you have to in this industry. I think that goes probably the farthest of anything.
00:02:07.110 - 00:02:47.666, Speaker B: Solana metrics still look really good, right? They are one of the most in terms of daily actives, one of the most used blockchains still in existence. So I was definitely surprised at how aggressively it sold off. Today it's sitting at around like 23 $24 and it sold to below ten, which I thought was just bananas. It became like number 30 or something on Coin market cap, despite the fact that it's still one of the only household names among layer one blockchains. So now it's gone back and reclaimed its throne, which seems appropriate. I mean, Solana still has issues. And of course DeFi on Solana has gotten completely destroyed and we now have the Mango markets case is starting to play out.
00:02:47.666 - 00:02:59.926, Speaker B: And so I think there's definitely headwinds facing Salana, but it clearly should be sitting higher than a lot of these zombie l ones that are sitting somewhere in the top 30.
00:03:00.108 - 00:03:37.006, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels like some of this is narrative driven, right, with like the Shanghai upgrade coming up, people getting excited about those staking derivatives and withdrawals coming up and maybe making some of those assets more attractive. But part of it also seems to be kind of uncorrelated. We were talking a little bit about optimism's, retro AirDrop period stopped and so their transactions just kind of totally fell off a cliff in the past few days and yet the token is still doing quite well. So there's definitely a lot of beta, there's maybe a little bit of alpha in some of these sectors and then obviously a lot of the macro tailwinds. It looks like some of it was liquidation driven, so all things kind of kind of combined.
00:03:37.198 - 00:04:20.080, Speaker A: I also want to say I think that 2021, this is a very boring reason and a reason that doesn't apply to all of crypto, but I think a significant portion of crypto, which is 2021 taxes, probably took people an insane amount of time to do. And I think the first time people probably could have figured out their true ability to make new purchases may have been January 2023. So there might just be some very boring, systematic stuff like that. Because I know in normal finance, a lot of people I know basically said something akin to that for why their funds were net zero in the market for the last six months and then started investing again.
00:04:20.450 - 00:05:04.118, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard some speculation that people were afraid of funds being wound down or redemptions that were dated for January. And so now that we're past those, or presumably past the lion's share of those, there's a certain degree of seller exhaustion that you just run out of people who want to sell. And once all the assets rotate in the stronger hands, then it's like, okay, well, we're kind of done. Another element of it must surely be that people were very worried about contagion after FTX. And of course we saw some of that with Genesis, which we'll talk about at some length today. It's kind of like, okay, well, who else is going to fall? It doesn't really seem like there's that many other dominoes that are that closely situated at this point. It's like, okay, we kind of know what's going to happen.
00:05:04.118 - 00:06:00.014, Speaker B: And what markets hate more than anything is uncertainty. So once that uncertainty subsides, at least to a degree, it makes it easier for markets to sort of get repriced without people being afraid of being in the line of fire. So now that said, liquidity is still pretty bad and obviously a lot of people have gotten hurt over the last few months, so you don't want to be too sanguine. Relatively small moves can affect the market in a very large way with liquidity being this shallow, so who knows where it goes from here? But it's definitely a good opening to a new year and I hope that things continue with this trend because last year was so brutal and it was brutal just end to end, right? There was almost no respite last year. So having a nice kind of 30% rally to start off the year, I think bodes well for the industry. Having just like a little bit of good news every once in a while, I think is healthy. But with that good news being acknowledged, let's move on to the bad news.
00:06:00.014 - 00:06:45.318, Speaker B: So Genesis has filed for bankruptcy. So last time we were talking, we were detailing the back and forth between DCG and Gemini. Gemini, of course, is the biggest creditor to Genesis. Genesis is a subsidiary of DCG and there was this big fight going on and there was a speculation that the creditors of Genesis may decide to negotiate a prepackaged bankruptcy. Okay, so prepackaged bankruptcy basically means that instead of fighting it out in bankruptcy court, you decide exactly how the pie is going to get split up in the bankruptcy, what the settlements are going to be. But the bankruptcy court itself basically just shepherds this agreement along, make sure that it gets instantiated, but everybody already knows what they're getting and how things are going to get done. So that allows a bankruptcy to be much less expensive and move much faster.
00:06:45.318 - 00:07:38.414, Speaker B: So there was speculation that this was going to happen and the way it was going to be structured was some cash paid out up front, a forbearance period, meaning that people were going to be patient and wait to get the rest of their consideration back. And then they were also going to get some equity conversion into DCG. So creditors to Genesis would own equity in DCG and they would get some payouts over time from DCG. That was roughly how this negotiation was going. But apparently this negotiation fell apart because Genesis was pushed into bankruptcy. We don't know yet by whom, it's really hard to tell. It could have been Gemini at this point because it's very clear that even after the bankruptcy was initiated, cameron is still coming after DCG, still tweeting that DCG is acting in bad faith and they were forced to do this because these guys are stonewalling them.
00:07:38.414 - 00:07:46.270, Speaker B: But now the stakes are higher now that they are in bankruptcy. Robert, do you have any color on how exactly they were entered into bankruptcy?
00:07:46.350 - 00:07:55.102, Speaker D: Yeah, Genesis itself filed for bankruptcy, so it wasn't an involuntary bankruptcy filing. Genesis pushed themselves into see.
00:07:55.176 - 00:08:05.030, Speaker B: And so why do you think they decided to file themselves into bankruptcy given that presumably it's worse for everyone than a negotiated settlement?
00:08:05.690 - 00:08:30.080, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a great question. So the first day hearings are tomorrow. In advance of that, a number of piece of information and documents have been filed. I would recommend everyone read them for themselves as opposed to getting a non lawyer such as myself's opinion on them. But you can find the documents at restructuring. Raw. Comgenesis and there's a lot here already.
00:08:30.080 - 00:09:16.522, Speaker D: I'll give a quick rundown of my personal read of them, which could contain inaccuracies. So don't take it as gospel, read the documents for yourself, inform your own opinions. But there was a huge amount of information that goes through who the creditors are and the rough state of the business. This is like in preparation for the first day hearings. This was provided by Genesis. The business doesn't sound like it's in great shape. The biggest question is how many assets do they actually have and how much do they owe people? Based on a quick read of it, they had a lot less cash on hand in digital assets than most people would think, which means the hole is potentially a lot bigger than has been reported by Genesis, by DCG, et cetera.
00:09:16.522 - 00:10:18.782, Speaker D: The more interesting thing is that there was a prepackaged bankruptcy plan that was filed. Now this plan is not what the rumors on Twitter were, where there would be a forbearance period and that there would know some DCG equity and all of this. The plan which you can find on the documents is actually really simple. It says either the creditors agree to equitization and they wind up owning this business, which by the way, the business is probably a worthless husk of a business, even if it restarts operations or they don't agree and it's pushed into liquidation. If it goes through liquidation, there's actually two classes of creditors which get treated differently. And having any creditors treated differently is always a huge red flag and pretty weird. But it proposes that there's Gemini as a creditor group and quote, institutional borrower, institutional creditors as the other group, and they actually get treated differently.
00:10:18.782 - 00:11:10.734, Speaker D: So the way it's worded, and I can see that this plan is probably not going to get approved because it seems ridiculous on its face. But the way it's worded is there's a trust set up with all of the assets to be sold, to distribute to all of the creditors, whether they're Gemini earn creditors or whether they're institutional creditors in a pro rotated basis. For the institutional creditors, there's still like a to be concluded like dollar amount. It's like an empty input field. But it says DCG will contribute some unknown amount of money as a DCG contribution on top for the institutional creditors. So that could be $1, that could be $1 billion. It could make the creditors whole, it could not make them whole, it's unknown.
00:11:10.734 - 00:11:49.694, Speaker D: The outcome is wildly different based on how big that dollar sign is. It's probably based on them selling off assets like CoinDesk and whatever and then using that to plug the hole. I have no idea what the number would be. And it says for Gemini creditors there'd be a Gemini contribution. So I think it was like deliberately like and I'm not a lawyer, but it seemed like a slap in the face intentionally towards Gemini, which is like, oh, for those other guys we're going to kick in money and for you, you're going to have to kick in money so retail doesn't get screwed in. Some know, I don't know who would approve this plan and how. I think the idea is that Barry used to work in restructuring and all of this stuff.
00:11:49.694 - 00:12:24.780, Speaker D: I think the idea is that there's some game theory where if the DCG contribution is large enough, there's enough non Gemini creditors to approve this plan and screw over Gemini and come out. Then, you know, Barry can raise his hands and say like, mission accomplished. We did know there's a successful resolution and everyone's happy and it comes out of bankruptcy very quickly, but we'll see what happens. Tomorrow are the first day hearings and there's going to be a lot of information that comes out and a lot of analysis that comes out. And I think all of our opinions are going to evolve very quickly in the next couple of days and weeks.
00:12:25.710 - 00:12:36.634, Speaker A: Quick question, just as a moment of levity. Who do you think will generate more fees for bankruptcy lawyers? SBF, FTX or DCG?
00:12:36.762 - 00:12:37.418, Speaker C: Mni.
00:12:37.514 - 00:12:42.286, Speaker B: Definitely FTX. Definitely far.
00:12:42.388 - 00:13:06.550, Speaker A: I'm just curious. I was watching the Madoff and Netflix special and I didn't realize that the trustee had a billion. I thought they earned like 100 million. So I was off by a factor of ten. So that's why I was kind of curious about your estimates of this because it is actually quite a large chunk of change in a lot of cases.
00:13:07.210 - 00:14:10.726, Speaker B: Well, so remember that DCG is one of the largest interested parties. Like with FTX, FTX was basically abandoned, right? Like all the FTX leadership is gone and so there is really nobody to kind of keep the show orderly, right? So the lawyers can just kind of they can basically just pick it apart and there's almost no limitations provided that a bankruptcy judge doesn't think that they're way out of line. So with FTX, there was a story about Sullivan and Cromwell basically swooping in like vultures and just flagrantly charging massive fees, know, routing around all these conflicts of interest, which nobody could stop, right, because there's nobody really there to run the show besides the lawyers. Whereas in the case of Genesis and DCG, DCG has a real interest in maximizing the recovery because of course they're one of the people who are going to participate in that recovery. Gemini as well. So I don't think this is the same kind of situation. And the complexity of the bankruptcy is going to be quite a lot lower than FTX, right? Like FTX.
00:14:10.726 - 00:14:16.430, Speaker B: I mean, people are projecting. It's going to take multiple years. This one is probably not even going to take a year would be my guess.
00:14:16.580 - 00:14:19.230, Speaker A: You think less than a year? That's your prediction?
00:14:19.810 - 00:14:22.480, Speaker B: I believe so. I mean, I don't know. Robert, what do you think?
00:14:23.490 - 00:15:03.974, Speaker D: I think if people can agree to a prepackaged set of terms, it'll be pretty quick. I think if they don't, it's a total cluster. If there's lawsuits from the Winklevi twins, if anything is contested, I think this gets dragged out dramatically. There's already people contesting some of the very simple facts that have already come out. Like a number of creditors have stood up and say like, hey, you got the amount that I'm owed completely wrong. Like one example is like Cumberland came out and said, oh, it says you owe us like 18 or 19 million and that's wrong, you owe us $40,000. There's already confusion and dispute of some basic facts.
00:15:03.974 - 00:15:51.180, Speaker D: And there's another one that came out, another creditor came out and said $150,000,000 credit was incorrect and that the filing was done in an incredibly sloppy manner. In both these cases, it seems like they were potentially overestimating the total dollar value of the creditors. Potentially also underestimating the dollar value of the assets, but potentially to spook everyone into a rapid settlement. So I think there might be facts that get disputed along the way. I think people are going to have to figure out who owes who and what if they can't even agree on the basics, then this becomes a lot harder, especially as it relates to Gemini Earn, who's going to be negotiating pretty hard.
00:15:51.630 - 00:15:55.678, Speaker C: Congrats on not being one of the top 50 unsecured creditors, by the way.
00:15:55.764 - 00:15:59.098, Speaker D: Yeah, no one wants to be into the top 50. That would be really unfortunate.
00:15:59.194 - 00:16:08.606, Speaker B: Is that a congrats or is that like a would you rather you'd rather be in one of the top 50 creditors because it means you have more money to potentially recover?
00:16:08.798 - 00:16:12.686, Speaker A: That's right, yeah, no, it could also mean you were smart enough to remove.
00:16:12.718 - 00:16:16.580, Speaker B: Your money prior to the that's another way to look at it.
00:16:17.510 - 00:16:37.350, Speaker A: Okay, actually, can we just take 2 seconds to talk about the list of the top 50 because there were some very weird people I was like bybit the Stellar Foundation. Decentraland, decentraland. I guess if I remember correctly, during the Pandemic, Barry was always shilling it on Twitter, so I'm guessing he owned a bunch.
00:16:37.510 - 00:16:40.710, Speaker C: Well, they also have the Grayscale Mana trust, right?
00:16:40.880 - 00:17:08.594, Speaker B: Right, yeah, that's right. Yeah, a bunch of interesting names. So the three big businesses, or four, I guess big businesses that seem to be entwined in the top 50 creditor list. So one is Van Eck, which of course is trying to run some of these ETFs Abra, which is another institutional lender. I don't know if you call them institutional, but they're another lender. And then Donut, which is one of these what are they called? Sort of crypto neo banks.
00:17:08.642 - 00:17:09.266, Speaker C: DeFi mullet.
00:17:09.298 - 00:17:13.846, Speaker B: Donut was also why do they call it DeFi mullet, Tom?
00:17:14.028 - 00:17:21.926, Speaker C: Because it's business in the front, party in the back. I guess this is maybe the opposite and that it was actually not a DeFi mullet and just putting it on Genesis.
00:17:22.118 - 00:17:25.046, Speaker D: Yeah, it was kind of the opposite. It was almost, know, retail.
00:17:25.158 - 00:17:26.474, Speaker C: This is just a buz cut.
00:17:26.592 - 00:17:30.454, Speaker A: What's the inverse of a like, I really don't bangs.
00:17:30.502 - 00:17:31.770, Speaker D: Really big bangs.
00:17:32.110 - 00:18:14.070, Speaker B: Really big bangs. Okay, well, they got banged pretty good at this one. All the creditors DRW of course, is contested donor of Cumberland, who they say that they're not actually big creditors murana, which is affiliated with bybit Seller Foundation, another big creditor. Now a bunch of the creditors are still redacted, so we actually don't know who they actually I was surprised, Robert, to your know, with TX there was so much fog of war because the record keeping was so terrible. That's also part of the reason why I think you should expect the FTX liquidation takes so long is that there's so little clarity about the accounting and who owns what and when were the customer balances supposed to be snapshotted. Genesis is like a real grown up business. They have much better record keeping.
00:18:14.070 - 00:18:59.282, Speaker B: So it seems like it's very strange that we already have so much incorrect information in the filing when this stuff should be really easy to figure out. I think Cumberland claimed that they liquidated the collateral of Genesis, like in November or something. Like a while back, they claimed that they had liquidated the collateral and so what the hell is they doing on a January petition? But so, technically speaking, we haven't seen a balance sheet yet from Genesis, but we should get one soon to actually see the real state of what's on the balance sheet. But we do know that they have roughly 5.1 billion of liabilities and about 1 billion, a little bit more than 1 billion of liquid crypto assets. That indicates that in the worst case, a recovery might be something like $0.20 on the dollar.
00:18:59.282 - 00:19:49.234, Speaker B: But of course there's a lot of other stuff in there. There's the promissory note, there's other receivables that they have. One of the big elements that people have pointed out is that there was a loan to Alameda of 2.6 billion, which is roughly half the value of all the current liabilities of Genesis. So if that loan is subject to clawback, meaning that the FTX bankruptcy says, hey, guess what, this takes precedence. This was in the last 90 days, so we're going to claw this back because it was not in the ordinary course of business, then basically half of the dollar value, basically fifty cents to the dollar would be lost from Genesis, which might be potentially the entire recovery or a significant portion of it. So right now it's pretty hard to project what you would get in a Genesis recovery.
00:19:49.234 - 00:20:11.710, Speaker B: From what I've heard, claims are trading at 2020, $0.05 on the dollar. That generally implies usually when these people are buying claims, they're buying looking for like a two, three X. So that means that if you hold it to maturity, there's a good chance that markets are projecting 50% to 75% ascent recovery. But at this point, there's so little that we know. It's hard to say. And as you said, Robert, there's very likely to be lawsuits.
00:20:11.710 - 00:20:37.030, Speaker B: This whole thing between Gemini and DCG about the current asset representations, about the Promissory note, that's still up in the air, we've yet to see if that's going to be adjudicated. So there's a lot of question marks still about this bankruptcy. So we'll learn more soon. But Tarun, I do expect that this thing is going to move faster and we're going to learn a lot more, a lot more quickly than we have with FTX.
00:20:37.710 - 00:20:42.010, Speaker A: Yeah. When you're speaking of claims, I hear there's a new claims exchange.
00:20:45.390 - 00:21:11.346, Speaker B: That's right. So one of the other interesting and connected pieces of news is that we have a comeback tour from some crypto villains. So the three Arrows guys, Kyle and Suzu, they were reported as being founders of a new exchange called GTX alongside Mark Lamb, the founder of CoinFLEX. So CoinFLEX, if you recall, was an exchange that went into bankruptcy because of what's his name?
00:21:11.368 - 00:21:12.574, Speaker A: Roger Vera.
00:21:12.702 - 00:21:39.318, Speaker B: Roger Vera. That's right. And so these guys, they ended up partnering up together to build an exchange for trading bankruptcy claims because of course that is now the store of value in crypto has moved on from bitcoin to bankruptcy claims. They were lambasted on Twitter. The name is GTX, which stands. Why is it called GTX? It's called GTX because G is one letter after F. I think that's why they're calling it GTX.
00:21:39.318 - 00:21:53.710, Speaker B: And then after they got skewered on crypto Twitter, they decided to change the name from GTX to something else. So they're going to announce later the new name for the exchange. I was talking to you, Robert, you were telling me you guys didn't take the pitch.
00:21:54.370 - 00:21:58.626, Speaker D: We have not spoken to them yet. But I heard that you guys spoke to them, right?
00:21:58.808 - 00:22:01.314, Speaker B: We did. They told us we were their first call.
00:22:01.432 - 00:22:04.450, Speaker A: I'm sure you were the first of many first calls.
00:22:06.950 - 00:22:45.242, Speaker B: We may have been, we may have been. I will say when we talked to them, I told them, look guys, I don't know that this is Investable, but I will offer you one piece of advice. Please change the fucking name for no, there's absolutely no way that this is a good idea to name this company GTX. And I guess they didn't listen because when the news came out, they just got completely destroyed on Twitter for it. But they are changing the name now, but apparently they've lined up the capital and this thing is going to get funded. These guys are for whatever you might think of them. They clearly have a big following and a lot of people still find them to be very influential.
00:22:45.242 - 00:22:53.698, Speaker B: So I can believe they're going to pull something off. And Lauren knows the bankruptcy claims in Crypto are proliferating, so I can see it happening.
00:22:53.864 - 00:23:15.946, Speaker A: All I have to say is CoinFLEX was a very weird exchange. I just hope that they don't build this entire thing on bitcoin cash again. One of the reasons Roger Ver was a large CoinFLEX user before he became a large CoinFLEX abuser is that they built and did most of their settlement on bitcoin cash.
00:23:16.048 - 00:23:17.546, Speaker B: Wait, didn't they have an, ERC, 20?
00:23:17.648 - 00:23:24.560, Speaker A: Yeah, eventually, but they started as a bit. How do you think they attracted the certain types of users that they had?
00:23:25.090 - 00:23:27.120, Speaker B: What were they settling on bitcoin cash?
00:23:29.250 - 00:23:35.274, Speaker A: 50% of their balances or something were in bitcoin cash. The majority of their volume was BCH for a long time.
00:23:35.412 - 00:23:40.546, Speaker B: So they were attracting that volume, but they weren't, like, settling, but they were.
00:23:40.568 - 00:23:43.810, Speaker A: Attracting that volume because you had to post BCH to margin.
00:23:45.430 - 00:23:47.142, Speaker B: But certainly not only BCH. Right.
00:23:47.196 - 00:23:56.550, Speaker A: Not only accepted, but not only, but they were like BitMEX, where it was a pretty dominant like their wallets were probably the biggest BCH active wallets.
00:23:57.050 - 00:23:57.462, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:57.516 - 00:24:10.518, Speaker A: So the only word of advice outside of the horrible name is I do really hope that they try to take some lessons learned in exchange technologies since then.
00:24:10.624 - 00:25:15.054, Speaker B: Yeah, well, actually, it's funny enough, it's somewhat connected because, of course, the Three Arrows guys, they were brought down by the GBTC trade. And we actually learned something from the filings about the GBTC trade, which is that, if you recall, when Genesis was filing for bankruptcy, GBTC plummeted in value. And apparently part of the reason for this is that Gemini had actually pledged 31 million GBTC shares to Genesis for Gemini earn, which were liquidated. And so a lot of these there actually is a very large overhang of GBTC has already been liquidated. Meaning that it's quite possible, actually, that in the coming weeks we will see that there's much less fear around GBTC and some of the grayscale products just because of the fact that Genesis has already unloaded a big portion of their GBTC assets that they have on hand. Supposedly they have another 30 million of GBTC behind that, but basically half of what we initially thought that they were going to have on hand. Yeah.
00:25:15.172 - 00:25:25.700, Speaker C: The NAV gap has already been recovering a bit over the past week, I think in part just because there's also this forced selling right. That's like 5% of all GPTC shares being sold on the market, which is quite a lot.
00:25:26.150 - 00:25:34.438, Speaker B: Yeah, which is pretty nuts. What is the discount now? And I assume when markets open on Monday, we'll see a refresh price there.
00:25:34.604 - 00:25:43.370, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's around 40%. So still quite large, but up off of high. Forty s or something like that, where it bottomed.
00:25:44.110 - 00:25:45.318, Speaker B: Nature is healing.
00:25:45.414 - 00:25:46.710, Speaker C: Yeah, nature is healing.
00:25:46.790 - 00:25:52.454, Speaker B: I think ETH E was like trading below 50% discount. It was really bad.
00:25:52.592 - 00:25:56.030, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it had like a 60% discount at 1.60.
00:25:56.100 - 00:26:22.662, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely insane. So, yeah. DCG is now exploring a sale, as you mentioned, Robert, of CoinDesk. And what I've heard is that the bids they're fetching are like 20 million ish, which is much lower than what they were hoping to get. And it's mostly media companies that are bidding for it. So despite the fact that public markets have recovered, it seems like private markets are still pretty icy right now.
00:26:22.796 - 00:26:27.910, Speaker A: In before Justin son or Charles Hoskinson bid for cardano for CoinDesk.
00:26:28.730 - 00:26:36.694, Speaker B: That is true. That is true. Especially if we see Binance step in. I think we might see a hardier bid. I mean, finance didn't they spend so much money on Forbes?
00:26:36.822 - 00:26:39.754, Speaker D: They paid $400 million for Coin market cap.
00:26:39.872 - 00:26:44.126, Speaker B: Well, that's a different story. I feel like that makes more sense.
00:26:44.308 - 00:26:46.558, Speaker A: Yeah, they probably made money from that.
00:26:46.724 - 00:26:50.878, Speaker B: I could believe it. I could believe did they bought a.
00:26:50.884 - 00:27:13.400, Speaker A: Lot of press coverage. You are sort of right, but I don't remember. I mean, the problem is it's very hard to compare anyone because FTX shown brightly in spending money on PR more than anyone else. So much so that everyone else probably looks like it looks like one of those GPT-3. GPT. Four horrible memes of like, this many parameters and this many parameters, but yeah.
00:27:15.610 - 00:27:41.422, Speaker B: I see. Okay. All right, well, moving on. Oh, sorry. The last piece of news connected to this, and this is also a little bit surprising. So right after Genesis filed for bankruptcy, the SEC swooped in to save everybody at the last minute and slapped both Gemini and Genesis with charges of unregistered securities offerings. So we also saw the same thing actually happen to nexo a settlement with the SEC for, I think, 40 million.
00:27:41.422 - 00:28:33.406, Speaker B: A pretty significant settlement. But Genesis and Gemini were both charged in saying, hey, you guys were marketing and offering this to retail customers. This is a security, it should have been registered. And so really hitting them while they're down and protecting basically no one. The SEC has come back in once again after disaster has already been guaranteed. So this will likely also play into the expected recovery, of course, is like, how will these charges be evaluated and what will the penalties be? I suspect the SEC is basically going to say, like, look, we're going to punish potentially DCG and Gemini and get them to throw in more for the recovery of especially retail investors in the bankruptcy. That'd be my guess of how this is going to play out, but it's too early to say.
00:28:33.406 - 00:28:41.394, Speaker B: But this may actually sweeten the deal for the recovery and for retail investors who are caught up in this. But it might also not. It's hard to say at this. Point.
00:28:41.512 - 00:29:34.180, Speaker A: So one thing I had seen people speculate on, and I don't know enough to actually have a strong belief on this, is that Gemini may also be having to be a little careful about bankruptcy because of this indictment. Because I think if it goes through and it's declared a security, all the earn users are allowed to sue them. Whereas if it's like a loan that isn't, they're not, it's like the recourse condition changes. And so if the SEC's claim goes through, then Gemini may actually it might be cheaper for them to go to bankruptcy than to try to fight the future legal claims. I have no clue about the again, this stuff is so insanely boring to me personally, compared to real crypto stuff. I just don't know.
00:29:34.550 - 00:30:19.220, Speaker C: There is something a bit ominous. So we were talking about GTX earlier and there's already a couple other claims marketplaces out there, including one called Xclaim, where you can trade your FTX claim or your blockfly claim or whatever. And it's funny because it's kind of morbid because it looks like a normal sort of finance startup kind of thing, but they're sort of like green and emojis around these bankruptcies and people trading their claims of these bankruptcies and they have like a pending section, so they have Silvergate and Gemini. Stay tuned, we're monitoring. It's like an upcoming product. And I feel like it's just like very it's funny when Father starts to do that, but I certainly hope not. I certainly hope there is no upcoming product here.
00:30:20.710 - 00:30:22.900, Speaker B: But the banks have been recovering, right?
00:30:23.270 - 00:30:23.826, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:23.928 - 00:30:27.346, Speaker C: I find it hard to believe something like Silvergate, but who knows?
00:30:27.458 - 00:30:33.462, Speaker A: Well, Silvergate would be hard to, I think, settle because they're a public company and it seems like a very public.
00:30:33.516 - 00:30:37.446, Speaker D: Company, but a publicly traded yeah, the.
00:30:37.468 - 00:31:02.842, Speaker A: Silvergate one seems like whoever made this site didn't think very hard about the settlement aspect of it. But maybe if we take the glass half full version of this claim stuff is this might actually be a really good time for the CDs market to develop in crypto in the sense of like 1994 when the CDs market started, it was like due to these large scale commodity company banks.
00:31:02.906 - 00:31:04.574, Speaker B: Can you explain what a CDs is?
00:31:04.692 - 00:31:58.526, Speaker A: Sorry? CDs is a credit default swap. It's like a way for you to know. Morally similar to bankruptcy claim, of course might be different exactly in the structuring, but it's a way for investors to bet on a company defaulting. And so they buy these claims. Where if a company defaults, then they get paid out. And then people can take both sides of that bet at a very high level. Of course, in the last ten years, there have been a bunch of really crazy I don't know if I want to call them scandals or good trades, but in traditional finance, where people figured out a bunch of very famous hedge funds figured out this idea of go give a loan to a company that you own a CDs on and tell them that you'll give them the loan only if they synthetically default, which causes the other side of the CDs to have to pay that side of the CDs.
00:31:58.526 - 00:32:04.914, Speaker A: And there was all this type of weird stuff going on. I think the cool part about the crypto version of this is that actually.
00:32:05.032 - 00:32:19.014, Speaker B: This is kind of like prediction market, like assassination markets in prediction markets where you open a prediction market on something and then you're very motivated to kill someone in order to make the prediction market come true. But synthetically for sure.
00:32:19.052 - 00:32:19.414, Speaker C: For sure.
00:32:19.452 - 00:32:20.870, Speaker B: Get someone to fake their own death.
00:32:22.010 - 00:32:44.714, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's like GSO which is like this big product. I forget if it's blackstone. There have been a couple of these. There's this one company called Codeere which has this very large lawsuit. I find this stuff more fascinating than the crypto bankruptcies because the crypto ones just seem filled with less strategy and more bluster. So it seems.
00:32:44.714 - 00:33:31.598, Speaker A: But the interesting thing about the credit default swap market was like it started right before a huge bull market in 1994. That was like right before the beginning of the run up into the Asian financial crisis and it was like sort of the new financial product that caused some of the excitement of that time. Obviously they're tech companies, but like post Asian financial crisis obviously was like the run up into the 99 bull market. So I actually would say that there's a nontrivial probability that these claims markets actually are. Now I feel like I hate myself because I sound like one of those like anything is bullish for bitcoin type of people, but I actually think these claims things get a ton of liquidity. It might be like the credit default top market which caused it, but do.
00:33:31.604 - 00:33:38.386, Speaker B: You think that's a bubble cause or do you think that's just like it just happened to play out that way? It doesn't seem like that's a cause for a bull market.
00:33:38.568 - 00:34:06.214, Speaker A: Well, I think sometimes when there are just new instruments that people have not figured out how to value correctly that have a lot of interest and actually have some notion of guaranteed payoffs, which in this case there will be some payoff for some of these claims. Right, so there is money sitting there locked and you're speculating on it. It's not just like a prediction market of like I'm speculating on this purely synthetic, I am speculating on this pool of cash and the percentage that gets distributed.
00:34:06.342 - 00:34:16.222, Speaker B: So what you're telling us, what you're telling us is that Three Arrows is going to kick off the next bull market with GTX. Sounds like that's what you're saying. Sounds like you should invest.
00:34:16.276 - 00:34:34.974, Speaker A: To be honest, I'm not saying that. I'm not saying anything of that form. I'm just more pointing out that this type of product could actually, if we look at different points in financial history. After some certain types of crashes, this type of product can be useful for bringing.
00:34:35.022 - 00:34:39.910, Speaker B: Tarun is predicting the start of a new super cycle. That sounds like what I think that's what I'm hearing.
00:34:40.970 - 00:35:30.662, Speaker A: I'm not saying that that's haseeb's interpretation, I'll let anyone interpret how they will, but I think this claims thing will be very interesting because you can structure them as you're seeing the difference between X claim and claims market. I think those are the two live ones. The exact payout structure is different and settlements different. I think these have a little more legs than your normal prediction market. Because again, you're speculating on a real pool of cash, right? You're not just speculating on like I'm hoping that there are enough people in the future who want to speculate on this so that there's a larger pool of cash to get distributed, right? You've gotten rid of that. There are assets. And so in that sense, it's like a very clean prediction market type of process.
00:35:30.662 - 00:35:39.958, Speaker A: And I think obviously this industry is set up to build things, to speculate on them. So that's sort of a glass half full.
00:35:40.044 - 00:36:01.900, Speaker B: That is precisely the story that the GTX guys are telling, which is that, look, you've got this proliferation of assets, which are all these bankruptcy claims, right? And people don't have cash anymore, interest rates are high, everyone's gotten wrecked. But they do have these bankruptcy claims, and most of the people who have these bankruptcy claims are degenerates and they love crypto trading, which is why they lost all this money in the first place. So.
