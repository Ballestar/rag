00:00:00.250 - 00:00:53.260, Speaker A: If they were deemed securities and there was a settlement or if it went to court and a judge found that that was a proper distinction by the SEC, that they are securities, the issuers would be on the hook. For unregistered securities issuance because they were supposed to do disclosures or else fit into some other exemption like only selling to accredited investors or things like that, which, to my knowledge, most NFT projects don't do, whereas lot of token projects do, do. Now, out of abundance of caution, the assets, to the extent they trade on secondary markets, wouldn't be able to trade on secondary markets like Coinbase or Kraken or things like that. They'd have to trade on national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems that are supervised by the SEC and the purchasers well, you're not doing anything illegal when you purchase the security, even a security that's unregistered because you're sort of considered the victim in the SEC's eyes.
