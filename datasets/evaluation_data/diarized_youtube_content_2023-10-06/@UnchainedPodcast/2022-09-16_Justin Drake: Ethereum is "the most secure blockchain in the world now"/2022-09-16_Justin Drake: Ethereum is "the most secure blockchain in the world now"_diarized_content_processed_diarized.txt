00:00:00.250 - 00:00:33.350, Speaker A: The way that the Lindy effect works, in my opinion, is kind of logarithmic. So the fact that the merge was successful for 1 second is already a huge breakthrough. The fact that it was successful 1 minute is a huge breakthrough. Ten minutes, a whole day, a whole week, a whole month, a whole year. And I think if it can survive the next few days, the next few weeks, next few months, this is high, high, high confidence that, you know, this is this is reliable. All I must also highlight that the proof of stake chain has been running for a very long period of time. It's been running for over a year and a half now.
00:00:33.350 - 00:00:53.390, Speaker A: It's the most secure blockchain in the world. Now it has $20 billion of economic security. And also, unlike proof of work chains, it has the ability to recover from 51% attacks thanks to slashing, and the ability to identify and remove attackers if and when there is an attack.
00:00:53.540 - 00:01:05.802, Speaker B: Yeah, and just to draw that out, it's because, in contrast, in a proof of work system, they would still have their equipment, so it's kind of, like, harder to keep them off the network. Is that the implication there?
00:01:05.876 - 00:02:03.498, Speaker A: That's correct. When you are under attack in proof of work, you cannot distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. All the hash rate is fungible, and so you can't just target the data centers of an attacker and kind of remotely burn them down. But this is effectively what we're able to do with proof of stake, because every unit of stake is identified and can be removed from the system either automatically, for example, in the context of two inconsistent finalized points, there's an automatic process whereby anyone who voted on both sides of these finalized chains will get automatically slashed. And there's also a process, if required, called social slashing, whereby, as a community, we kind of observe, for example, that there's been censorship on the chain, and we can react with a soft fork or hard fork that removes the attacker from the chain.
