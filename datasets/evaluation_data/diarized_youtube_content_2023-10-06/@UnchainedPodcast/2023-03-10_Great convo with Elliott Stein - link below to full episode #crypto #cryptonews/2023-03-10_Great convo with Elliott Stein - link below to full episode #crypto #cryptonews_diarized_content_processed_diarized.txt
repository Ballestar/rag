00:00:00.250 - 00:00:48.530, Speaker A: The SEC's argument is that even though there is this 99.9% correlation between the prices in the spot market and in the futures market, they're not convinced that fraud in the spot market would show up the same way in the futures market. They never really clarified what that meant, but they said that Grayscale needed to provide more empirical evidence of how fraud in the spot market might manifest in the futures market. And the judges pushed back on that quite a bit and said, Why do they have to show that? Why is it not enough that the prices are correlated so extensively? And in addition to that, what type of empirical evidence do they need to show? And the SEC didn't really give a satisfactory answer for that, in my opinion.
