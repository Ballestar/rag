00:00:00.170 - 00:00:39.126, Speaker A: They don't have the right to appeal now because the case isn't final. What they'd have to do if they wanted to appeal now is basically very soon, either by the end of this week or early next week, because I think they have to do it within ten days. They have to tell the district court, your Honor, we'd like to appeal your summary judgment decision, and we're going to ask you for permission to do that. And then they have to essentially present an argument to the judge why she should allow the case to basically be put on hold while they go to the Second Circuit and ask the Second Circuit to review her decision. There's going to be some briefing papers on that. They may even argue it in court. All the while on a parallel track.
00:00:39.126 - 00:00:57.020, Speaker A: The judge and the magistrate judge assigned to the case are going to be preparing for trial and doing all the administrative and evidentiary things that are attended to that. But let's say the judge says, okay, it is important enough an issue. It would be more efficient to decide this issue now at the Second Circuit rather than waiting to the end of the case.
