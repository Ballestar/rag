00:00:59.010 - 00:01:03.674, Speaker A: Today's guest is Frank Chaparro, director of news at the Block. Welcome, Frank.
00:01:03.802 - 00:01:07.538, Speaker C: Laura, thanks so much for having me on. So great to be back.
00:01:07.704 - 00:01:09.250, Speaker B: It's great to have you.
00:01:09.400 - 00:01:15.694, Speaker A: Coinbase has been a major topic of discussion this week, not only in the crypto world, but also in the wider.
00:01:15.742 - 00:01:18.898, Speaker B: World of tech business and politics.
00:01:19.074 - 00:01:21.478, Speaker A: Why don't you give us a recap of what happened?
00:01:21.644 - 00:03:28.794, Speaker C: It's been a major reason for why I haven't gotten any sleep this week as well. But yeah, just basically to recap, on Sunday, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, released a blog outlining effectively his apolitical vision or anti social activist vision for Coinbase as a firm, a very mission driven sort of a very product driven mission for the company, effectively. And so obviously, that kind of set the crypto and tech world more broadly aflame with different perspectives on whether or not that's sort of the right course of action for a company that's so public facing like Coinbase to take a company that could in many ways drive messages of social justice and Black Lives Matter to large audiences. And so lots of debates around that, lots of coverage in mainstream and crypto media alike about what this means for Coinbase from a company's perspective and from the perspective of whether or not it will result in folks leaving. And then on Tuesday, the night of the debate, literally right after the debate ended, I got an email from a source, which was basically the email that Brian Armstrong sent out to employees saying, listen, if you are uncomfortable with this new mission or the way that we've sort of outlined the mission, perfectly fine. We will give you a very generous, honestly package, severance package to then leave the company, which you have until next week to consider. So that was obviously, you know, still this was in the media being talked about on Twitter and definitely being talked about at Coinbase internally in various Slack channels.
00:03:28.794 - 00:03:59.862, Speaker C: And then today they had an AMA discussing this. And I'm in the process of putting out a report that's going to walk through this timeline, an AMA addressing all of the stuff that's been going on this week. And then, as you know, some of the attention has been sucked away by quote, unquote rival, not necessarily a rival BitMEX, getting slapped with charges from the Department of justice. So that's been the week in a nutshell. That's been what we've seen in a nutshell, and it's been interesting, but not necessarily unsurprising.
00:04:00.006 - 00:04:39.378, Speaker A: So you mentioned social justice and Black lives matter. Were those the specific social and or political issues that employees at Coinbase wanted the company to take a stand on, know, take action on, or were there other issues? Because obviously we've seen with Twitter and Facebook that there's also a lot of talk in the tech world about what companies roles are in managing misinformation. And I know Coinbase isn't in the business of misinformation, but there is a lot of talk about how tech companies, what their actions can do in terms of our lot of there's a lot.
00:04:39.464 - 00:05:13.310, Speaker C: Of talk around this, right? Like, let's not forget that we are just a few weeks away from what many would consider one of the most important elections of our generation of many people's lifetimes, maybe. And so there is probably, just as there is this sentiment at many other companies, of how do we take action? How do we provide employees with the right tools to go vote, to make their voices heard, and to have an impact on this decisive election?
00:05:13.650 - 00:05:18.174, Speaker A: So those were the issues at Coinbase, or what were specifically the ones at Coinbase.
00:05:18.222 - 00:06:19.718, Speaker C: I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised if that was sort of something that was underpinning this blog that Brian felt like he needed to put out on Sunday. Now, rewinding the clock and this is what my report gets at. This isn't an isolated thing that happened on Sunday. And if you go and wind the clock back to this, okay? And this was hinted at in Brian's blog, but not explicitly talked about back in June, there was an AMA. And you know this from covering coinbase through your own reporting that they have these AMAs where employees can submit questions and ask company management, senior leadership about a myriad of things from personal preferences of ice cream. I don't know if that's ever been asked, but that could be an example to thoughts about company product launches, to other personal and business questions alike. And so someone asked, according to several sources, a question about Brian's view on Black Lives Matter.
00:06:19.718 - 00:07:17.382, Speaker C: Okay? And so that kind of resulted in him I wouldn't say rebuffing the question, but one source described him as not necessarily knowing if the person was asking about Black Lives Matter, the movement, or Black Lives Matter, the specific organization, and kind of saying, like, I'm not ready to talk about this. And so what that ended up resulting in was a walkout. In Brian's post, he describes there being walkouts plural, not necessarily sure if that's because obviously we're in this decentralized working situation where none of us are in offices. So people know, walk out, turn their computers off and signed off for the day. So that's been brewing since June, right. This question of whether or not Coinbase should make a definitive statement in support of Matter. And so that just to be clear.
00:07:17.436 - 00:07:21.434, Speaker A: He did tweet from his personal account. That's what you're going to say.
00:07:21.472 - 00:08:23.594, Speaker C: Yeah. So that next day, as a result of sort of all this commotion, I guess, for lack of a better word, he then did go out and tweet that he definitively supports black lives matter as a movement supporting the idea that black lives, as a result of the state of African Americans in this country need to sort of be recognized and uplifted to an extent. And then he had a pretty long tweet thread outlining that and in that Tweet thread as well, I think, I'm not 100% sure he mentioned the walkouts as well. So it's kind of been, at least from my understanding, a long thread. Also, underpinning it, aside from the issue specifically, there's a question or an interesting point to be made about Brian himself. And I'm sure you also can speak to this given your previous coverage. In 2014, there was a Bloomberg article that described him and Fred as, these Vulcan bankers, right.
00:08:23.594 - 00:09:05.740, Speaker C: Like very not the most gregarious characters that you'd come across, and very serious. And Brian, I was talking to a source about this basically an hour and a half ago. Brian is someone who probably wanted to build the most used, most important product in crypto, but not run the largest, most important company in crypto. And so I think that also undergirds this situation where I'm sure Brian is a fairly nice guy and I'm sure his sympathy or concern about certain social justice issues could be legitimate. But he wants to build Coinbase. He wants to build this company.
00:09:06.590 - 00:09:14.862, Speaker A: You know what's so funny about that? Yeah, I have a feeling I know which Thor said that to you, but anyway, we'll check about that later.
00:09:14.916 - 00:09:47.910, Speaker C: We can check after the show. Yeah. But yeah, so that's basically where we're at with this. I've just been surprised, and I'm sure I don't know how surprised I am. No, I am surprised that it's gotten so much attention. I think maybe because of the language of the blog and the language of the email. And apparently that's been another thing that's been discussed in the AMA today and just generally internally, and this is probably not surprising, like, did we word this right? And that's obviously evident in the fact that they've changed some of the language in the post.
00:09:47.910 - 00:10:29.800, Speaker C: Right. So originally there was a reference made, a kind of like strange reference, some would say, to Brianna Taylor in which they sort of talk about the events regarding recent events as opposed to this tragedy. Someone probably want more passionate language. And so there's been talks about whether or not the language in these two documents were appropriate. And I think it's not so much about what's going on maybe internally at Coinbase that people are reacting to, but these two, this blog post and then this email, right. Which are really kind of coldly written people might argue. Right.
00:10:29.800 - 00:10:34.982, Speaker C: And so that's what I'm sort of, like, been thinking about in these past few days. Yeah.
00:10:35.036 - 00:10:41.580, Speaker A: So in a moment, we're going to talk more about the reaction to this. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:11:11.110 - 00:11:38.220, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Frank Chaparro. Yeah, I actually just want to call out maybe some of the quotes from the original post just to give people a you know, as you kind of mentioned, some people maybe weren't surprised to hear these things from, you know, for know I've been interviewing Brian himself as well as people who work closely with Brian now for five years. And yeah, I could practically hear him saying these things.
00:11:38.750 - 00:11:48.670, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but you can if you've heard this guy speak, you can totally see him saying this in a non malicious way.
00:11:48.820 - 00:12:22.826, Speaker A: Exactly. This was just 100% the DNA of Brian. Things. Like, he talked about how Coinbase's mission was to build an open financial system for the world and said, for Know, some people interpreted the mission more broadly. So now I'm quoting to include all forms of equality and justice. It makes sense if you believe that economic freedom is not possible without equality for all people. Others interpreted the mission more narrowly, believing that we were trying to create infrastructure for the crypto economy and that, yes, this would create more equality of access for all people, but we weren't trying to solve all forms of inequality in the world.
00:12:22.826 - 00:13:05.334, Speaker A: The narrower interpretation is how I intended the mission to be understood. And this is like Brian from 2016 to 2017 to 2018, 2019 and now to today. This is the same brian. He says, quote, I don't think companies can succeed trying to do everything. Creating an open financial system for the world is already a hugely ambitious mission, and we could easily spend the next decade or two trying to move the needle on global economic freedom. He's very much the like, I have a huge goal, and in order to make that goal happen, accomplish that, I have to focus only on that. He's famous for the headphones rule only wearing the headphones in office or wearing the headphones in the office.
00:13:05.334 - 00:13:25.198, Speaker A: And then if you are wearing them, nobody can interrupt you. That kind of thing. But let's talk a little bit about the reaction to this. It was pretty know. I saw Paul Graham of y Combinator tweet yet again, Brian Armstrong leads the way. I predict most successful companies will follow Coinbase's lead. On the other hand, Matthew Green, a.
00:13:25.204 - 00:13:28.046, Speaker B: Cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins, tweeted, the.
00:13:28.068 - 00:13:59.506, Speaker A: Coinbase post genuinely makes it harder for me to recommend that my students work there. And then the most interesting one actually came from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who tweeted, Bitcoin, aka. Crypto, is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society. Important to at least acknowledge and connect the related societal issues your customer face daily. This leaves people behind. And then he linked to the blog post. So I wondered, what did you make of the reaction?
00:13:59.698 - 00:14:52.986, Speaker C: I think it makes sense in light of the fact that a lot of people who probably vaguely know of Coinbase don't really know that much about Brian, right. And so they don't have that context of his sort of demeanor and the way that he kind of views his role within the company and the crypto ecosystem more broadly. It's not even that Brian is disinterested in issues of social justice. He is not someone who is even going out and talking about some of these more crypto native topics on a regular basis, like someone like, I don't know, maybe Mike Novogratz for right. Like, he rarely does interviews. He rarely is sort of speaking at conferences and panels and so to sort of know which is maybe dissimilar from a lot of other executives right. Who kind of come out and say these things.
00:14:52.986 - 00:15:22.098, Speaker C: So that kind of made sense or kind of what I was thinking. And I guess a lot of it, I thought, was just fueled by just this broader sort of political discourse of the election coming on the horizon and this broader push among many different companies. And I think I shared you this DM this morning. ESG has gripped markets and many companies.
00:15:22.184 - 00:15:24.146, Speaker A: Across people what ESG is.
00:15:24.168 - 00:16:04.500, Speaker C: Yeah. So we're talking about these environmental, sustainability, governance goals that are becoming increasingly more important, not just to investors, but to broader financial services companies. It's not just about like, okay, you're not a tobacco company anymore. It's not just about like, are you a tobacco company? Are you a gambling company? Are you what they call a sin company? You need to start hitting the bar even higher and passing. There was an article in the Ft this morning that talked about passing these Positivity tests. You need to be actively doing things. And so there's this dichotomy in the world.
00:16:04.500 - 00:17:19.590, Speaker C: I see it in my DMs and in my mentions of is being apolitical good or is it bad? And so a lot of the tech world has kind of moved towards the direction of being just, like, inactive politically is sort of political in of itself and bad. And you have a similar sentiment on Wall Street where this idea of if you're not, like, contributing to the greater good and what the greater good is, the definition is a little flimsy. It's not something that many people would say is objective, right? And so that's kind of at the heart of this controversy as well, is, well, why aren't you taking a stand? Why aren't you being political? Whereas other people are saying, this is exactly know some people I tweeted this. The other was in the midst of all of this, so many people were giddy that Brian had did this and sort of set the line and set a tone for future founders and CEOs to kind of just say, hey, I care about building, I care about creating a strong business. And let's not forget that they potentially have an IPO on the horizon.
00:17:22.190 - 00:17:25.738, Speaker A: Meaning they have a financial incentive to not take a stand. Is that what you're saying?
00:17:25.824 - 00:17:48.820, Speaker C: Meaning that they have a financial incentive to focus on building product and not being concerned about what Brian might deem peripheral issues, because you got to hit revenues and you got to hit the expectations of the street. So that might be playing into it as well.
00:17:49.590 - 00:18:14.906, Speaker A: So let's now talk about the offer of the exit packages for people who aren't comfortable with this Apolitical stance. And as you mentioned, it's really generous. Four months of severance for employees with less than three years tenure, six months for those who have been there more than three years, six months of Cobra and a seven year option exercise window. Why do you think they decided to go with something so generous and also to offer this in the first place?
00:18:15.008 - 00:19:03.786, Speaker C: This is totally my speculation. I actually haven't talked to people inside of Coinbase about this, but there is a gentleman that they hired. So LJ Brock is the Chief People officer at Coinbase. He was at Citadel securities citadel, the affiliated firm of Citadel, the hedge fund, or maybe he was at the hedge fund. In any case, Citadel, who know, obviously, that's a firm that's sort of run by Ken Griffins and the billionaire hedge fund Chicago guy. Citadel has a strong history, a well known history on the street of just having high turnover, right? And sort of like being a sort of like you're either in it to win it at Citadel. If you're not, then, you know, you don't need to be here.
00:19:03.786 - 00:19:51.900, Speaker C: And so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of this memo was influenced by Brock and and this maybe Citadel like mindset. But that is total speculation. Historically, Coinbase, to be fair, has had great benefits, very high salaries, very impressive fertility benefits for women at the firm. So maybe it's a mix of that. But certainly everyone I talked to and everyone commenting on Twitter, right, they saw this and didn't believe it. We didn't believe it either at the block when we first got this anonymous, they were like, there's no way that they're just going to be giving away money to people when in fact they clearly are.
00:19:52.350 - 00:20:10.570, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it's probably one of those calculations where they feel that it's worth it to spend the money to get a team that is 100% aligned on their mission. Do you have a sense of how many people will be taking the severance package?
00:20:10.730 - 00:20:20.580, Speaker C: No, that's a good question. I have a sense of, like I said earlier, of how many people will probably be leaving. I imagine I don't know if everyone.
00:20:22.150 - 00:20:24.878, Speaker A: You said that to me privately, so can you just say it for the show?
00:20:24.984 - 00:21:09.860, Speaker C: Oh, that's right. So it's not clear the parameters around which people will accept these packages. So whether or not they'll have to sign an NDA or et cetera. So my sense of the number of people leaving is around maybe one to two dozen, maybe upwards to like 50 people is my sense. And then of those people, those that will sort of take this package, which could include things maybe not delineated in the email, right. Because it's like, hey, we'll talk about this through HR. So that remains to be seen the exact number who will take this package, but I would expect personally, my sources described a lower number, but I think probably more than 50 would leave.
00:21:10.710 - 00:21:23.606, Speaker A: Wow, okay. Yeah. And there also wasn't all hands today the day that we're recording, which is Thursday. Do you have a sense of what happened or what people at least plan to say, if you don't know what actually happened?
00:21:23.788 - 00:22:13.154, Speaker C: There were a few different I mean, obviously it was basically to discuss some of the controversy in that one slack channel that I was talking about. Just the sort of the vitriol and high emotions and contentious sort of. Discourse that was taking place and just about the general reaction to the blog post that went out and the way in which Coinbase has communicated these points have all been up for discussion during this AMA. Some people described it in many different ways. It's been interesting to sort of condense what I've been hearing. There are some real gritty Wall Street types at the firm, obviously, who just are so kind of let's just get through this. Why is it so emotional? Some people have described it as boring.
00:22:13.154 - 00:22:20.860, Speaker C: Some people have described it as completely chaotic. Right. It really depends on your vantage point, but it's certainly interesting.
00:22:22.030 - 00:22:49.940, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so let's also now just cover the other huge news this week very quickly, because I saw that you tweeted know, the BitMEX news about how the owners have been charged by the CFTC and DOJ with running an illegal crypto derivatives exchange and for allowing money laundering on their platform. And you tweeted that you had just spoken on the phone with CEO and co founder Arthur Hayes last night. What did you guys talk about and did he seem to have any awareness this was coming?
00:22:50.630 - 00:23:42.946, Speaker C: It's a really good like like I said before we turned the mics on, I was finishing up a long day and obviously it's morning time in Hong Kong when it's nighttime here in New York. And so it was a run of the mill prep call for a podcast. I'm sure you've done a few of those. He was supposed to come on tonight in 3 hours time. And I will say in know not to say that Arthur wasn't his usual funny self. He was gregarious, he was charming, but his answers were shorter than any interview that I've seen him do. Kind of just like to the point his communication representatives were all there and we were just trying to get a sense of some of the things we would talk about on a show.
00:23:42.946 - 00:24:40.294, Speaker C: And my thinking was, well let me ask you some questions to see how you would answer them. So then just like when we came on before, you kind of asked me about my report so you could get a sense of maybe how to better frame your questions. And so that was kind of the idea. And he was basically normal, but he was his usual self, aside from maybe the fact that his questions seemed a little like the opposite of me and I can ramble on and on all day, just very maybe a little bit shorter than normally, but that could have just been because he finished a 60 miles bike ride. I asked him what were you doing for this? And he goes, I just finished up 60 miles biking. And so classic Arthur response, right? And I'm just like, okay, I'm like literally laying in bed in my pajamas. But fair enough.
00:24:40.294 - 00:25:53.070, Speaker C: Yeah, we talked about a lot of the recent developments. Obviously BitMEX has been in the headlines more. They've almost become sleepy, frankly, like in the past, aside from after the 2019 CFTC Bloomberg article rather that broke that the CFTC was investigating them. They're not like FTX, right? They're not like finance where they're launching all these products and making crypto CoinDesk the block headlines every day. They're kind of just like oh, I remember BitMax from 2017 and from the Lambos parked out of consensus and then they rolled out KYC, right? And so they've been trying to button themselves up from everything I can tell. I don't know if you've engaged with them in the past six months, but they work with Edelman now and are very much trying to communicate in a more I don't know if refine is the best word, but kind of really solidified this message and they kind of did a restructuring of the parent company. So the original question you asked was whether or not if Arthur seemed like he had a sense of what was coming.
00:25:53.070 - 00:26:07.282, Speaker C: Yes, maybe. But just looking more at a high level, you have seen the firm kind of like taking these different steps that maybe indicate that or do indicate that something like this was yeah.
00:26:07.336 - 00:26:17.220, Speaker A: Looking back, I sort of had a feeling because why would they start doing all these things after they've been in existence for six years?
00:26:17.590 - 00:26:18.340, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:19.370 - 00:26:28.406, Speaker A: Anyway, well, we will see what happens. I'm sure there's a lot more to discuss on that, but we'll do it another time.
00:26:28.508 - 00:26:38.314, Speaker C: Well, maybe if Arthur gets back on whether or not he'll do he was supposed to come on the podcast tonight. We can have you on and we could do like a co thing.
00:26:38.512 - 00:26:39.162, Speaker A: Really?
00:26:39.296 - 00:26:40.910, Speaker C: We can talk about yogi.
00:26:43.490 - 00:27:03.906, Speaker A: For listeners. I was just telling them that Arthur and I both are really into yoga, and so that makes him quite similar to a lot of people in my normal real life, like my real life friends. But anyway okay, well, this has been hugely informative. Thank you so much for doing this.
00:27:04.008 - 00:27:04.766, Speaker C: My pleasure.
00:27:04.878 - 00:27:09.538, Speaker A: I would love to talk with you and Arthur. That would be great. So thanks so much for coming in unconfirmed.
00:27:09.634 - 00:27:11.762, Speaker C: Thanks so much, Laura. Talk to you soon. Cheers.

00:27:55.444 - 00:29:01.042, Speaker B: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline u. S. Regulators file criminal charges against BitMEX owners on Thursday, the Department of justice charged BitMEX, one of the biggest crypto derivatives exchanges, with two bank secrecy act violations, each of which can carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The commodities futures trading Commission also filed charges against BitMEX for allegedly illegally operating a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange and violating anti money laundering regulations.
