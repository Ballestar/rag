00:00:00.330 - 00:00:55.500, Speaker A: And the notion of prosecuting someone for using the code in a smarter way that other people didn't predict is anathema to that. Right? Because that really means if he was able to do that, and if that's somehow wrong, right? If something that the code could do is the wrong result, that ultimately means that it's not the crypto system that governs things things. It's our understandings and expectations. And if it's our understandings and expectations, well, then it's exactly like a normal contract, and it ought to be illegal or frowned upon to set things up in a way where you can't fully perform that contract because of immutability and these other things. So it's a real tension. And that's why I say, really, we need to kind of find way to make it acceptable for people to opt in this set of risks and understand what risks they're opting into.
