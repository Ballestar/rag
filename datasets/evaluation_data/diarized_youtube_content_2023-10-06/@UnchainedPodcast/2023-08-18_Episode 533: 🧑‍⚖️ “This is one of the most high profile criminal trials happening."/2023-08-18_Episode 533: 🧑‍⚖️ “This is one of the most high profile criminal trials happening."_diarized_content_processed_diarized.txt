00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.582, Speaker A: Based on the more slimmed down indictment, I would say several weeks, definitely. Obviously more than a week. We'll take a while to select a jury here. You know, this is a complex case in the sense know, it's sprawling, and I would suspect several weeks. A lot is going to hinge on whether Sam testifies, because if he testifies, that's going to be probably several days too.
00:00:21.636 - 00:00:22.446, Speaker UNK: And they might have their own.
00:00:22.468 - 00:00:45.126, Speaker A: Experts. So it wouldn't surprise me. This trial is two to three weeks. I don't know what the estimates they've given now. They might have to give some new estimates based on the new indictment. That's something the judge will be keen to know, because when they call the jury and they're going to have a large jury pool here, they'll probably do a questionnaire. They're going to need to know the people are available for those periods of times.
00:00:45.126 - 00:00:59.100, Speaker A: Most cases don't last weeks and weeks. Right. And Arc is high profile. You know, setting aside the Trump case, which is consuming all the oxygen in the room, this is one of the most high profile criminal trials happening.
