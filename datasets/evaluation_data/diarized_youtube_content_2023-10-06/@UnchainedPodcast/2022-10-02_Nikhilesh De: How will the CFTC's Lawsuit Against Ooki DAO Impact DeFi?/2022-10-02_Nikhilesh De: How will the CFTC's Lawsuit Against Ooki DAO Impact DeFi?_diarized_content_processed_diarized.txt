00:00:00.170 - 00:00:39.622, Speaker A: You got sued by the CFTC for engaging in illicit activity. What's that about? Not a good look for a lot of people. So I think that's just one example of how this could be presidential in a kind of not great way for people who are participating in Know. Is the effect going to be to depress dao participation? I don't know. I do know that you mentioned Gabe Triviro earlier. I know he has put out a call for any member of Ukidao who wants representation to reach out. So we'll see if they're able to pull together some legal counsel and fight this.
00:00:39.622 - 00:00:52.170, Speaker A: But there are definitely a couple ways where intentionally or not, the CFTC might be depressing dow participation and or not centralizing, but at least limiting kind of the growth of this industry.
