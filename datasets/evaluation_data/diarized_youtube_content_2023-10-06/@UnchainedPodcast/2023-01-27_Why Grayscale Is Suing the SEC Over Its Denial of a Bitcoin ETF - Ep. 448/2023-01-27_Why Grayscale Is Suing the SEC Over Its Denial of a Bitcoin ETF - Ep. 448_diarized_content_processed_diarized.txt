00:00:39.150 - 00:00:42.598, Speaker C: Today's guest is Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale.
00:00:42.694 - 00:00:43.702, Speaker B: Welcome, Michael.
00:00:43.846 - 00:00:46.346, Speaker A: Hey, great to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:00:46.528 - 00:01:04.158, Speaker B: The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, is currently trading at a 42% discount to the net asset value, or NAV. Because the 2% fees on the trust are tied to the NAV, people invested in the trust are effectively paying almost a 4% fee per year compared to.
00:01:04.164 - 00:01:05.114, Speaker C: The price of the underlying.
00:01:05.162 - 00:01:18.840, Speaker B: And on top of that, investors cannot redeem their shares for bitcoin and also would probably struggle to share their shares to somebody else willing to pay those fees. Do you think that's an appropriate fee for investors to pay when they don't have the option to leave the product?
00:01:19.290 - 00:02:14.562, Speaker A: Well, so a couple of things to clarify there, Laura. So one, the total annual management fee for any and all GBTC shareholders is 2%, right? And when somebody invests in the product, it's not as though they put a dollar in and $0.98 only goes into giving them exposure to bitcoin. It's instead, similar to other investment products, that the underlying bitcoin per share ratio over the course of a year will decline by 2%. And the fee on the product today, I think, is certainly borne by just a lot of costs that go into running a product in the crypto space. It's not analogous today to the kind of economies of scale that you'll see for equity products or fixed income products. And we've said publicly, and I'll say to you again, we are committed to lowering the fee on GBTC when it converts to an ETF.
00:02:14.562 - 00:02:41.902, Speaker A: But certainly in the meantime, all the fees that are being generated on GBTC, that is all the capital that we as an organization are putting into our lawsuit against the SEC, bringing the best legal minds possible to the case and really just continuing to advocate for our investors. So we feel very strongly about the case. The full resources of the firm are behind it. And again, yeah, we'll lower fees in an ETF state.
00:02:42.036 - 00:02:42.334, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:42.372 - 00:02:58.230, Speaker B: So let's actually now just play out some of the scenarios around the know for listeners we'll catch them to see. Grayscale is suing the SEC over its denial of Grayskill's Bitcoin ETF application. Oral arguments will be heard March 7, which is coming up pretty soon.
00:02:58.380 - 00:02:59.234, Speaker C: If it fails.
00:02:59.282 - 00:03:17.894, Speaker B: You've said that you would appeal at this point, you are saying that under the ETF, that's when you would consider lowering the fees, there's another scenario where you would appeal. But if the appeal also is not successful, then are there any other conditions under which you would reduce the fees?
00:03:18.022 - 00:04:10.250, Speaker A: Sure. So let me just lay this out, just to set the record straight. And who better to do it with than you? Contrary to what folks may think, we didn't, somewhere along this journey in the last nine years, decide that an ETF was the ultimate goal for GBTC. Right. An ETF format was what we always conceived of and that's always what we intended to do even before we launched the product back in 2013. So we have been on a journey for the last nine years, not only growing this product and bringing bitcoin accessibility to investors in a regulated and accessible way, but we've always been in pursuit of an ETF. So when we think about the journey that we've been on, yes, it was very unfortunate and very disappointing that the SEC denied our application to convert GBTC to an ETF in June of 2022.
00:04:10.250 - 00:04:38.626, Speaker A: Investors have been patient. We think investors deserve this, and it really is a signal that in the near term, investors have really seen that their regulator is pretty much shutting the door on the opportunity to take the world's largest bitcoin fund and bring it closer into the regulatory perimeter. So it left us no option other than to initiate a lawsuit. Right. We have a fiduciary obligation to our shareholders. This is what they want and this is what they deserve. So we had to proceed that way.
00:04:38.626 - 00:05:21.678, Speaker A: The case is moving swiftly. So, again, we filed the case in June of 2022. It's now late January 2023. Oral arguments, as you said, coming up in a couple of weeks. And we do expect a decision on the case by this fall, the fall of 2023, if we lose the case. Although we're confident that we have really common sense, straightforward arguments, we've definitely seen overwhelming support for the strength of our arguments that the SEC is looking at bitcoin futures ETFs and bitcoin spot ETFs in a very disparate way in an arbitrary kind of capricious manner. We would seek to appeal the case a couple of weeks ago as well, in the spirit of transparency.
00:05:21.678 - 00:06:14.610, Speaker A: We did really want to communicate to investors that if ultimately, we exhaust all of our judicial options. And again, that would really not only know continuing to fight the SEC in a judicial setting, but it would also mean that the SEC was continuing to deny investors the additional protections of an ETF and we were done with all options. We would then consider putting out a tender offer. Right? A tender offer would be a material deviation from the long term path that this product has been on. And of course, the details of a tender offer would need to be worked out with the SEC receive shareholder approval. SEC approval. But that would be an outcome that would really, again, be more indicative of regulatory postures than it would be Grayscale's intentions or what investors ultimately want, which we know is an ETF.
00:06:15.110 - 00:06:18.680, Speaker B: And can you walk us through what that tender offer would look like?
00:06:19.290 - 00:06:49.530, Speaker A: It's really tough to say because a tender offer is really rooted in the idea of the details of which being completely fair and equitable for all shareholders. And so when you have a product like Bitcoin, or in this case, GBTC, where the value of the asset moves around, every single know, a more bespoke tender offer would need to be worked out with the SEC to get comfortable that the tender offer was being administered in a fair and equitable manner.
00:06:49.690 - 00:07:41.050, Speaker B: So, as we mentioned at the beginning of the show, a number of investors are underwater on their GBTC investment and also paying what to them feels like high fees. And I'm sure you're aware that some segment of them are calling for Grayscale to seek what's called Regulation M relief from the SEC that would allow investors to redeem the shares for the underlying asset, which is, in this case, Bitcoin. Why has Grayscale not filed for the Reg M relief? I get your timelines that you talked about for the lawsuit and stuff, but are you essentially saying to these investors that they need to hang on for the resolution to that? Because obviously that's a long wait for some of these people that, for instance, have this money in their retirement accounts and are not really able to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
00:07:41.210 - 00:08:40.078, Speaker A: So, Laura, it's another great question, and let's take this opportunity to clear up some confusion about this. Regulation M is something that is really tied to ETFs. What Regulation M offers is a product relief from Regulation M to simultaneously create and redeem shares. And so Reg M is an exemption or an exemption from Reg M is something that's granted to all ETF applicants. And so an ETF, as we all know, is a financial instrument that is holding some other asset or giving exposure to some other asset. And because the ETF will move around throughout any trading day, it's important that the ETF is able to be kept in line with the value of what it owns based on creations and redemptions and an exemption from reg. M so those folks that are calling for regm being something that's obtainable in a vacuum, that's simply just not a possibility.
00:08:40.078 - 00:09:17.760, Speaker A: And so when we think about the conversion to an ETF, when we think about the application that was denied by the SEC, when we think about now the lawsuit Grayscale has filed challenging that decision, the core heart of what that lawsuit is is not just an ETF, but obviously comes with Reg M relief as well. So the investors that want to see that Reg M relief, they're the ones that certainly can be frustrated with the discount. We as a team are frustrated with it, too. We want to see reg m relief. We want to see the conversion to an ETF, and that really is the core part of the case and really what we're advocating for.
00:09:18.290 - 00:09:25.438, Speaker B: Hedge fund Furtree is suing Grayscale to obtain more details around the trust, and it looks like they're doing so in.
00:09:25.444 - 00:09:26.974, Speaker C: The hopes of getting Grayscale to resume.
00:09:27.022 - 00:09:35.086, Speaker B: Redemption and also cut fees. Are you going to grant their request for information, and do you feel that shareholders are entitled to you know, it's.
00:09:35.118 - 00:10:17.394, Speaker A: Funny to see that so many investors are taking an interest in Grayscale and Grayscale's operations. We continue to feel that the ETF is going to be the best long term solution for any and all shareholders. Again, it addresses any concerns over fees being too high because we've committed to lowering them in an ETF state. And we're also confident in the strength of our lawsuit against the SEC. And so I think, given the kind of recent mistrust we've seen in and around in the crypto space, there has certainly been a small vocal minority of folks that are further frustrated. And we share in that frustration, Laura. We really do.
00:10:17.512 - 00:10:40.966, Speaker B: In a moment, we're going to talk about some of the questionable incidents that have happened around GBTC.

Back to my conversation with Michael. Last Friday, bankruptcy documents showed that Gemini liquidated 31 million shares of GBTC that had been pledged to it by Genesis. And they liquidated all of that in a single transaction in November. Because GBTC is a restricted security.
00:11:11.620 - 00:11:25.158, Speaker B: An issuer of these kinds of restricted securities cannot sell more than 1% of the shares per quarter. And this was actually a sale of 5% of all the shares. Did Grayskill know that this liquidation was going to happen?
00:11:25.324 - 00:12:02.580, Speaker A: So, as the case is, with any investment manager or with any investment product out there, we're not necessarily going to be party to every transaction that takes place. So the result of what you're seeing and when you saw it in the market is the same time our team saw it. So the transaction that you're referencing, I think, was something that was floated through the documentation that Genesis Capital put out as a part of their bankruptcy proceedings that kind of detailed the transaction between Genesis and Gemini. We were not party to the transaction itself, and we're not aware of the transaction itself that it had taken place.
00:12:03.110 - 00:12:11.762, Speaker B: So if the transaction took place as documented, then would you agree that the amount sold was five times the allowed limit?
00:12:11.906 - 00:12:29.990, Speaker A: So I am not a Rule 144 expert, so it'd be tough for me to comment on it. I would certainly direct you to the folks at Genesis or Gemini to really think through the transaction, although I'm sure both of those parties were very thoughtful about the transaction, given the relationship that they have.
00:12:30.160 - 00:12:33.406, Speaker B: So another big GBTC trade that's been.
00:12:33.428 - 00:12:35.022, Speaker C: Talked about quite a bit this past.
00:12:35.076 - 00:12:46.754, Speaker B: Year was, for instance, sort of this levered long trade using GBTC made famous perhaps by Three Arrows Capital. Can you talk about how you think that trade worked?
00:12:46.952 - 00:13:58.060, Speaker A: Sure. So I think certainly earlier in GBT's lifecycle we've seen the product trade at both premiums and discounts to its net asset value. And so there was certainly a period of time where GBTC was in fact trading at a premium to its net asset value. And so investors who were subscribing to the private placement when they were locked up, cause of the private placement shares anywhere from either twelve months or eventually six months. Once GBTC became an SEC reporting company, they had to certainly take the risk on over that twelve or six month period, not knowing where they'd be able to monetize their GBTC shares out in the public market. And so for some investors who waited out that twelve or six month period, they may have reached a time when their shares became freely tradable and GBTC was trading at a premium to its NAV, or a premium to where the spot bitcoin price was, and thus were able to actually monetize their investment at a value that would have earned them a higher return than had they just gone long bitcoin itself. And so that is certainly something that some investors were able to profit from.
00:13:58.590 - 00:14:13.498, Speaker B: And do you think that they were also buying shares of GBTC, pledging that as collateral with Genesis to obtain more bitcoin, which they were then using to create more GBTC shares?
00:14:13.674 - 00:14:37.186, Speaker A: Yeah. So certain investors were able to obtain loans to be able to trade in GBTC or to create shares of GBTC. The collateral arrangements, I think, with each of those investors would have been different in something that Genesis would have been the party that was extending credit to the investor, not something that was born by Grayscale.
00:14:37.378 - 00:14:57.718, Speaker B: And so for the structure of GBTC, investors are not allowed to transfer shares until after six months. And those shares also cannot be uncumbered for that period. Was Genesis allowing three AC to use these so called unseasoned shares, shares that are less than six months old, to borrow bitcoin?
00:14:57.814 - 00:15:40.054, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think that there's some minutiae to get into there, into the legal docs that surround GBTC and the unencumberance has to do with the underlying bitcoin that stays within our products itself. And so the bitcoin that underpins GBTC, the ethereum that underpins EThe, those coins are unencumbered. They're owned by the shareholders themselves. They're not loaned out. There's no liens or pledges, et cetera, against them. But there is certainly the opportunity for shares to be pledged in certain financial arrangements so long as those are disclosed and signed off on, and that wouldn't.
00:15:40.182 - 00:15:43.782, Speaker B: Violate that restriction against them being encumbered.
00:15:43.926 - 00:15:49.210, Speaker A: So long as the pledges are properly disclosed and documented.
00:15:49.710 - 00:16:16.194, Speaker B: Okay. Genesis had long been GBTC's authorized participant. And what that means is that's the entity that has the ability to create and redeem shares in the Trust in October, grayscale changed the authorized participant to Grayscale. And obviously, the timing on Know, October is the month before things went quite far south in the crypto community. Why did Grayscale make that change at that time?
00:16:16.312 - 00:17:05.070, Speaker A: So it was actually a change that I believe we set in motion about a year or a year and a half prior to that October date. As we have been continuing to grow as an organization, some of the functions that we've been working to build out are, for instance, our own broker dealer and our own registered investment advisor. And so in 22, we obtained both Grayscale securities, our broker dealer, and Grayscale Advisors, our RIA. And so it was quite a bit further along than that October time frame that this was already on a path to having operational independence and actually taking over the role as authorized participant here at Grayscale securities. So this was something that was planned for and just happened to be a switch over in and around that October 2022 timeline.
00:17:05.230 - 00:17:27.258, Speaker B: I'm sure you're very well aware the crypto community has a lot of questions about the relationships between Grayscale, Genesis, and DCG. Can you explain sort of what the information is that Grayscale, for instance, has about Know? Do you know who the shareholders are? Do you know when transfers occur? How is information shared? How are decisions made just to outline all of that?
00:17:27.344 - 00:18:13.030, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think from an outside perspective, it's sometimes a little hard for folks to wrap their head around. But DCG Digital Currency Group is a conglomerate, and there's tons of conglomerates out there. And whether, Know, Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate that owns NetJets and Geico and other businesses, or LVMH is a conglomerate and owns tons of companies underneath it that are operating subsidiaries, I think the DCG scenario is really analogous to those where Grayscale is a standalone entity that has common ownership under the DCG umbrella. The same is true of Genesis. The same is true of CoinDesk or trade, block or foundry. And so Grayscale is a standalone entity, separate and distinct from these other businesses.
00:18:13.030 - 00:18:33.600, Speaker A: I have my own management team surrounding me. We have our own budgets, our own governance, our own policies, our own procedures as I shared, our own broker dealer, our own RIA. And so we're not privy to or party to what's transpiring in any of the other entities, despite the fact that they are owned wholly by Digital Currency Group.
00:18:34.290 - 00:18:49.122, Speaker B: And can you also just in that? I mean, maybe you sort of answered it, but I think people are also very curious to know how involved Barry is, barry Silbert, the head of DCG, how involved he is in the decision making and strategy of Grayscale.
00:18:49.266 - 00:20:00.074, Speaker A: So I think, given that a lot of what has happened at grayscale was Barry's idea to start barry was the one who was early enough into bitcoin to say, I think we should start an investment vehicle to make it easier for people to access bitcoin as early as 2013, when folks quite frankly, Laura thought he was crazy. I think strategically and directionally, barry has set Grayscale out on a path, but then he brought someone like myself in, and I brought a leadership team in around me as well, to really execute on that early vision that Barry had. And so he is not involved in day to day decisions, he's not involved in changes to policies and procedures. Barry's focus has primarily been on investing at the DCG level, whether that's in protocols, and I think DCG now has invested in over 200 companies in over 40 countries around the world. So a lot of his focus there is on keeping track of what's transpiring in the broad crypto asset class on a global level and not being bogged down in the decisions that my leadership team and I are making day to day.
00:20:00.112 - 00:20:21.470, Speaker B: Here at Grayscale, the trust documents were also restated to remove shareholder rights, specifically the right for shareholders to replace the sponsor. As long as there was a 75% threshold of shareholders in favor of that, why was that move made? And can you talk a little bit about the process for changing the trust documents?
00:20:21.630 - 00:21:09.330, Speaker A: Yeah, so there have been several amendments to the Trust Agreement over the life of GBTC and other Grayscale products, which is something that's not unique to our product family. You see changes occur all the time in investment products. And to be clear, when changes do come about, to the extent that they are the least bit or possibly adverse to shareholders, they are ratified by a majority of shareholders. So these are not decisions that Grayscale is making in a silo. So it's really important to know that exact distinction. So any of the changes that have been put forth out to shareholders have in fact given them the statutory opportunity to weigh in on any of those changes and ultimately weigh in on them over time.
00:21:09.480 - 00:21:13.022, Speaker B: And do you publish the results of those shareholder votes?
00:21:13.166 - 00:21:33.130, Speaker A: That's a really good question. I think the last time the Trust Agreement was updated may have been as recent as 2016 or 2017, when perhaps there were some changes associated with converting GBTC to an ETF. But I'm not sure of the exact date or the last time the Trust Agreement was updated.
00:21:33.630 - 00:21:55.630, Speaker B: So as we alluded to at the beginning of this. There are a number of investors in GPTC who they're hurting at this moment. And I wondered if you felt that there was anything that Grayscale or DCG could have done differently to engender more trust. If there's anything over the last few years that you feel could have been improved upon.
00:21:55.790 - 00:22:32.122, Speaker A: I got to say, Laura, I think that we have amassed an unbelievable investor base. We have now a million or more than a million investor accounts in the US alone that own GBTC. All 50 states are represented. Small holders, large holders, institutional holders. GBTC is inside of ETFs, inside of mutual funds. And so I'm really proud of the team that I've built, the work that we've done. And I feel that shareholders do, in fact, trust that we operate as an organization that has really thought about not only its construction, but its operation.
00:22:32.122 - 00:23:20.854, Speaker A: We were born in the US. We made use of existing US rules and regulations. We've continued to push the limits on fair and full disclosure for investors. We voluntarily went to the SEC and became the first SEC reporting company. We worked to develop definitions, risk factors, policies, all of which has only resulted in greater shareholder protection. And I think you'd be hard pressed to find another asset manager that is so bold as to actually file a lawsuit against the regulator that oversees every aspect of their business. And that's a decision that both as a CEO and we as a team, we didn't take that decision lightly, but we knew it was the right thing to do for our shareholders.
00:23:20.854 - 00:23:32.510, Speaker A: And so we have been on a journey on this path towards ETF, and we continue to, again, feel really strong about our arguments and really continuing to advocate for shareholders.
00:23:33.170 - 00:24:11.678, Speaker B: Yeah. And I should add that just before recording Andrew Parrish, who has a very active Twitter feed where he talks a lot about what's going on at Grayscale, DCG and Genesis, he tweeted know, somebody took a look at the legal arguments and felt that they were very strong to the point where they thought maybe they could even go to the and, you know, for more information on that, I either did an interview with Matt Hogan, or I at least wrote an article in which I quoted him. I will put whatever piece of content that was in the show notes so people can find out those arguments. But Michael, it has been such a pleasure having you on Unchained. Thanks for coming on the show.
00:24:11.764 - 00:24:13.962, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Laura. Always good to chat.
00:24:14.106 - 00:24:17.994, Speaker B: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this Week in Crypto.
00:24:18.042 - 00:24:49.874, Speaker C: After this short break. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. BlockFi has a $1.2 billion exposure to FTX and Alameda bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi accidentally revealed financial documents that showed it had over $1.2 billion worth of assets tied to the cryptocurrency exchange. FTX and its sister company, Alameda. The extent of Blockfly's exposure to the exchange was not previously known, as the financials had been censored as of January 14.
00:24:49.874 - 00:25:43.930, Speaker C: The documents show that Blockfly assets connected to FTX are worth almost $416,000,000, while loans to Alameda amount to about $831,000,000. This is significantly higher than the previously reported figures of $355,000,000 in assets on FTX and a $671,000,000 loan to Alameda. The document also reveals that Blockfly's 125 active employees are being paid generously, with a combined compensation of $11.9 million a year. Bloomberg reported that Blockfly is selling off $160,000,000 in loans backed by about 68,000 bitcoin mining machines as part of the company's bankruptcy proceedings. Some of these loans have already defaulted and may be under collateralized. Given the decline in the price of bitcoin mining equipment, the entities bidding for the debts will likely be debt collection businesses buying for cents on the dollar.
00:25:43.930 - 00:26:37.990, Speaker C: US seizes $700 million of FTX assets. US? Authorities have taken possession of $700 million worth of assets linked to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman Fried. According to a report from CoinDesk, the government is seeking the forfeiture of these assets on the grounds that they are not the property of the bankruptcy of State. The assets in question include $525,000,000 worth of Robinhood shares, which Bankman Freed purchased with money borrowed from Alameda Research, and $171,000,000 in cash from bank accounts tied to FTX related entities. The government seized these assets and more in early January and is now seeking their forfeiture. Furthermore, the DOJ seized $50 million in assets linked to Bankman Freed. This sum was held in Farmington State Bank, a small, one branch institution based in Washington that primarily focused on providing agricultural loans to farmers.
00:26:37.990 - 00:27:18.674, Speaker C: The bank had a mere three employees at the time of Bankman Fried's account creation and had been serving the local community for over a century. Additionally, on Wednesday, FTX's long awaited creditor list was revealed, albeit with millions of customer names redacted. It turns out the bankrupt exchange owes money to a wide range of companies and individuals. Tech companies include Apple, Netflix, Meta and Amazon web services and crypto firms such as Chainalysis Coinbase, Yukiles and Binance Capital Management are all owed money. Publications include the Wall Street Journal, CoinDesk and Benzinga. And athletes like Tom Brady and David Ortiz were also on the list. As with Supermodel Giselle bunchon.
00:27:18.674 - 00:27:56.030, Speaker C: Sam Bankman fried invested $400 million into Modulo Capital.

Binance issues its own version of ETH USDC and USDT to be used on the BNB chain, which are supposed to be backed by one to one reserves of the currencies they are based on. However, mixing of B token collateral with customer assets is against Binance's own guidelines. Earlier this week, Binance also announced that its Swift banking partner, Signature Bank, will no longer support transactions under $100,000 in value.

The final version of the Shanghai upgrade is set to go live on the Ethereum main net in March. It will also allow validators to withdraw the $26 billion worth of Ether that sits in the deposit contract.

Blockchain security firm Certic reported that the wallet address associated with the wormhole hack, which occurred in February 2022, moved $155,000,000 of Ethereum this week. The funds were moved to the OpenOcean decentralized exchange and then converted into lido finance's staked ether and also wrapped staked ETH. The hacker then used the Steeth as collateral to borrow coins and repeat the process.
00:34:23.230 - 00:35:07.662, Speaker C: This was the largest movement of these stolen funds in recent months. Speaking of exploits, the FBI announced that the Lazarus Group, a cybercrime organization sponsored by the North Korean government, is responsible for the theft of $100 million in crypto from Harmony's Horizon Bridge in June last year.
