00:01:16.970 - 00:01:18.840, Speaker A: Hi, it's good to be back.
00:01:19.690 - 00:01:38.060, Speaker B: Late Wednesday, CoinDesk reported that the IRS is claiming $44 billion in taxes on FTX and Alameda, both of which are in bankruptcy. I see people commenting on how can that be when Alameda may never have made that much money? How do you think the IRS is coming up with these.
00:01:41.070 - 00:02:28.794, Speaker A: Mean? Obviously, it sounds like they don't actually have the details to figure out what the number actually is, so they just go for as high end numbers as possible. So there's been a lot of experts in the space. I'm not a tax expert, but I've been saying that meet TC has an incredibly bold summary of what's going on and why the IRS is saying all these things. But the view, which is what is explained is that the IRS is basically reclassifying some contractor arrangements and employee arrangements and sort of claiming back taxes on that. And essentially, because they don't have the details, they just go for as high a number as possible. And then we probably expect the number to actually come down quite significantly if and when it actually gets paid.
00:02:28.912 - 00:02:34.478, Speaker B: And one other thing is that the claims are being filed as admin priority. What does that mean?
00:02:34.644 - 00:03:41.410, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the annoying bit. So under the US. Bankruptcy Code, the amount of money to Uncle Sam take priority over the average Unsecured creditor, which, unless the sort of more creative trust arguments hold bad fruit, that's what the average customer is, an unsecured creditor. So what you potentially have is you have these tax claims coming in in priority to Unsecured claims. Just to sort of clarify a bit further, because people have been asking, how does this affect FTX International Depositors, given the large tax bill is hitting Alameda? So to sort of recap FTX is an unsecured creditor of alameda. So that's what happens when Sam takes all of our money out into Alameda and uses it know, invest in stuff. What actually has happened is that he's borrowed that money from FTX International and in order for FTX International to recover that money, they recover in the capacity of unsecured creditor.
00:03:41.410 - 00:03:57.474, Speaker A: So having let's just say if it's a $20 billion tax liability show up at the elevator, it means that the tax man gets paid before any money goes back into FTX International where it can then be used to pay well us.
00:03:57.612 - 00:04:02.460, Speaker B: And the other thing I noticed is that they're also being called Unliquidated. What does that mean?
00:04:04.190 - 00:04:23.970, Speaker A: Unliquidated claim is basically a claim for an agreed amount of damages, if that makes sense. So when you've liquidated damages clause, it means you've agreed that if there is a breach, this would be the amount of liquid of damages payable. Unliquidated just means, well, they're not liquidated. Okay.
00:04:24.040 - 00:04:28.286, Speaker B: Meaning that there's a dollar amount but that hasn't been agreed upon.
00:04:28.398 - 00:04:31.854, Speaker A: Yeah, the dollar amount is not agreed.
00:04:31.982 - 00:04:35.074, Speaker B: Okay. So it's like one side still has.
00:04:35.112 - 00:04:38.550, Speaker A: To quantify and assess the damage, if that makes sense.
00:04:38.700 - 00:05:09.870, Speaker B: Okay, so you started to talk about kind of like the order of preference when we were talking about the admin priority. But obviously some of these tax claims are not just against Alameda, but also because obviously when you look at the docket you'll see there's many different IRS claims against all these different entities in the FTX Alameda empire. So in general, now how does this affect the bankruptcy.
00:05:11.970 - 00:05:47.530, Speaker A: Mean you're basically applying the admin priority rule to each individual entity. Right? So let's say I noticed there's a tax claim against FTX International as well. So that's the straightforward in a way straightforward one. Right. So FTX International, you've got your customer deposits in there, all of your customers are claiming, I'm assuming at this point as unsecured creditors, there is a tax claim from the IRS on top of it. It means the IRS needs to get paid its money first before any of the customers can take their money out. Now you apply that across the board to all these entities.
00:05:47.530 - 00:06:38.300, Speaker A: For instance, like I explained about Alameda earlier, alameda owes FTX International $10 billion. If Alameda sells its assets and manages to get $10 billion and moves it and uses it to pay FTX International, FTX International then now has that money which can use to pay its own unsecured creditors. I e asset depositors. Now if there is a $20 billion tax claim sitting in Alameda, which ranks ahead of FTX International's claim against Alameda, what happens is your $10 billion that you may have gotten from liquidating whatever random Sam Coin shitcoins investments, now that all just goes to the tax man. So no money comes into ftex National and that means no money is there to pay down the customers.
00:06:40.050 - 00:07:55.830, Speaker B: So as we alluded to earlier, the way that these numbers are being presented in the bankruptcy is not with some kind of, I guess what's the word, proof of how they were arrived at. And I saw some tax analysts calling into question how it was that the IRS came up with these calculations. So meet TC, who you mentioned. His profile says he's a principal at Dgen Legal and he tweeted about the $20 billion tax bill in Alameda and said, quote, in part, it appears the IRS went back and reclassified all employees from contractors to employees and hit them for unpaid employer side employment taxes. So for people who don't know this, when you are an employee, then your employer will pay a 15% tax on your income and then you also pay taxes if you're like, self employed, you are responsible for both sides of that. Another tax related person, it seems, Mr. Purple DJ tweeted, quote, the IRS claims $8 billion in same tax for 2022, which would exceed all revenue.
00:07:55.830 - 00:08:30.030, Speaker B: He also says that it claims $122,000,000 per quarter for payroll taxes, which are 15%. And he said that would imply that they had $3.2 billion in salaries. And then he also flagged that the IRS is not claiming any interest or penalties. And he said typically that's where you usually see large amounts. So it looks like people are kind of skeptical of how it was that the IRS arrived at these numbers. So is there any point at which the IRS will have to show its calculations in the bankruptcy?
00:08:31.490 - 00:08:37.886, Speaker A: To be honest, I'm not tax lawyer, so I can't comment on that. I can sort of quote from high.
00:08:37.908 - 00:08:43.614, Speaker B: End the bankruptcy court require the IRS to show how it's arriving at presumably.
00:08:43.662 - 00:09:15.742, Speaker A: At some point that they're going to have know. I think this will certainly be defended and litigated like John Ray is not going to sit there and just hand over money to the IRS. This is something that's going to be an ongoing matter and it's something that will be determined further down the line for an amount that is going to be vastly smaller than the $20 billion. Even if it's a billion dollars, it's painful. Even if it's $500 million, it's painful because of the administrative priority. Right.
00:09:15.796 - 00:09:23.502, Speaker B: But I guess what I'm asking is, it seems like you think John Ray is he's not going to just accept these.
00:09:23.556 - 00:09:26.062, Speaker A: He's absolutely not, no.
00:09:26.196 - 00:09:30.260, Speaker B: Is that a typical thing or is that uncommon or how does that even work?
00:09:30.710 - 00:10:20.638, Speaker A: I mean, what the IRS have put in is a claim, right? It's just that it's a claim and anyone can go in and put in a claim against the FTX estate at this point of time. The question is whether or not that claim actually exists and the quantum of that claim, that is something that needs to be worked out and fleshed out over the coming weeks and months. And presumably the estate is going to start doing a lot of homework to figure out. Look, even if we reclassify of our contract agreements, the employment agreements, this is the maximum amount of tax will be payable, and it will be paid out of this silo and this silo as opposed to that silo. So, yeah, I fully expect a lot of work going to be done. The Sullivan Cromwell is definitely calling up the tax department and putting them on, making them work late tonight.
00:10:20.814 - 00:10:59.002, Speaker B: Okay, so in a moment, we're going to unpack a little bit more how all this will affect the proceedings.

00:11:43.450 - 00:11:55.810, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Wasi lawyer. So you also tweeted about a potential saving grace for the ftex creditors. You called it the trust argument. What is that?
00:11:55.960 - 00:12:38.538, Speaker A: Oh, boy. Going to need way more than 15 minutes. Probably like an hour or 2 hours, maybe five. It's short the argument that arose a very long time ago. I think we may have discussed this briefly around how the FTX terms and soft services worked, where customers who put in digital assets retain title to those digital assets. The trust argument is simply that those digital assets that customers put in were always held on trust by FTX International, and when they transfer them to Alameda, the customers continue to have a proprietary interest in those assets. So if you have a proprietary interest in those assets, you are not an unsecured creditor.
00:12:38.538 - 00:13:06.598, Speaker A: You aren't a creditor at all. You're just taking assets that's yours. You're asserting the proprietary interest that you have in those assets. The reason why I said it's going to take a very long time to flesh out in detail is because it isn't the silver bullet, which a lot of people seem to think it is. People seem to think, hey, if the trust argument works. That means that my bitcoin, which is sitting on FTX is my bitcoin. So FTX has to give it to me in full without effectively in priority to everything else.
00:13:06.598 - 00:13:43.874, Speaker A: The thing is, the release isn't that simple because it has massive, massive knock on effects. For, for instance, you can no longer have your preference claims, right? Your preferential withdrawal period, because I didn't withdraw any money. I'm not a creditor. I just took assets that belong to me. So you're no longer using that preference section of US Bankruptcy Court to start clawing back assets against other customers. You're using something else completely different, potentially something founded in unjust enrichment, which again is going to take us a very long time to talk about.
00:13:44.072 - 00:13:59.058, Speaker B: If it's thought that those assets simply belong to the customers and they are not unsecured creditors, then basically the notion of claw vex almost doesn't exist anymore, at least for customers not in accordance.
00:13:59.074 - 00:15:00.790, Speaker A: With the US Bankruptcy Code. Because now what happens if you essentially think of everything as if you think of the substantially of the customer funds as being on trust, as opposed to customers being unsecured creditors of the company, then you aren't looking at bankruptcy law anymore. You're looking at trust law. You're looking at a trust shortfall, clearly, and someone who is withdrawn, has withdrawn in priority to others, and therefore not taken their prorata share of that shortfall and you're basically back to trust law, common law. It's going to be incredibly, incredibly complicated almost. To add to that digital assets, if the trust argument does bear fruit, it's basically going to pick winners and losers. There's going to be customers who wired $10 million or $100 million to Alameda or FTX.
00:15:00.790 - 00:15:43.930, Speaker A: They wired to Alameda because FTX used Alameda's bank account. But there's going to be customers that wire fiat money and there's going to be a customer that wired the same amount and send the same amount in USDC. And the guy who sends it in USDC gets all of his money back, whereas the guy who wires the money via bank transfer gets zero or close to nothing. So it's going to end up in a pretty crazy situation. You're going to have a situation where there's going to be a lot of litigation around what assets are in trust, what assets are not in trust. If you started using the leverage trading functions of FTX, do you then give up a proprietary claim? I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.
00:15:44.000 - 00:16:13.826, Speaker B: Okay, wait, we're going to have to put a pin in that one. Yes, but what I wanted to ask first was just when you were talking about the person who wired money and how if they were wiring US dollars, then they might not have any claims or get any money back. But what if you were wiring money because you thought that you were buying a whole bitcoin? Like you wired $20,000 because you thought you were getting one whole bitcoin, then.
00:16:14.008 - 00:16:39.946, Speaker A: You'Re absolutely seeing the absolute insanity that ensues, because if I wired a buy a bitcoin and I buy the bitcoin, do I now hold the bitcoin? The bitcoin is now in trust. And the guy who deposits the bitcoin, does he no longer have a proprietary interest in the, quote, unquote, trust? Does he now only have a claim as unsecured credit against the FTX estate? You see why this creates a lot.
00:16:39.968 - 00:16:54.738, Speaker B: Of well, I don't see why they wouldn't both have their assets and trust there. The only problem would be is if Alameda didn't actually buy the bitcoin at the time with the US. Dollars, which it looks like maybe they didn't for some of them.
00:16:54.904 - 00:17:16.040, Speaker A: Yeah, that's that as well, of course. So you are looking into very complex areas of trust law, and I can't say that I have all the answers right now. There is literally no one here who can say that they have all the answers right now if we were to end up in a world where customer assets were held on trust.
00:17:16.490 - 00:17:55.650, Speaker B: Okay. And before we I still want to get to the leverage question, but before we move to that, I just wanted to ask it sounds like all of this is raising the exact same issues that came up with the Mount Gox case. But at that time, the Japanese court decided to denominate everything in dollars and not return investments to people based on the amount of bitcoin they had. So is this kind of like a question that keeps coming up over and over again in different courts worldwide, and do you think that we're just going to end up with different jurisdictions that have different standards, or do you feel like we'll start to see a particular standard emerge?
00:17:56.150 - 00:18:46.382, Speaker A: So, I mean, I spoke with Gonbi about this Montgomery thing as well, and I think what the there was some sort of arrangement that happened where I think the creditors are in fact getting the bitcoin back. Because the value of bitcoin has gone up so massively that I can't recall the exact details of the arrangement or the court process they use. But it's very different from the US court system. The issue of denomination, of crypto claims is going to be something that is going to be an issue. It is likely going to be litigated. It doesn't really have to be determined unless you actually liquidate. You completely liquidate the company because you could agree as part of a Chapter Eleven plan, or agree as part of the restructuring plan how you're going to deal with those assets.
00:18:46.382 - 00:18:56.200, Speaker A: You could the one where I can see this being litigated very seriously is Trias Capital, because that's a liquidation scenario where there is a lot of finality to it.
00:18:59.050 - 00:19:04.940, Speaker B: I'm sorry, what is it about the Three Arrows case that makes it different?
00:19:05.390 - 00:19:21.438, Speaker A: Oh, because it's a liquidation scenario where we're looking at Chapter Eleven, chapter eleven is a reorganization procedure for the most part. Right? I mean, we could still end up having to liquidate bits and pieces of it. I mean, the customer claims may end up just being denominated in US. Dollars.
00:19:21.604 - 00:19:28.098, Speaker B: Okay, all right, I guess we're just going to have to see how but.
00:19:28.104 - 00:19:37.458, Speaker A: The denomination of crypto claims is very different from the trust argument. The trust argument is an almost uniquely FTX matter. Just to clarify.
00:19:37.634 - 00:19:38.950, Speaker B: Oh, okay.
00:19:39.020 - 00:19:39.398, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:39.484 - 00:19:42.450, Speaker B: There's no other bankruptcy. I mean, I guess like with Celsius.
00:19:42.610 - 00:20:12.506, Speaker A: Celsius, correct. It's basically the custody lawsuits in Celsius. Right. Whereas people would say, my SSI and custody. The thing is, Celsius actually had a custody function and a non custody function where it was very clear that those in the non custody function were not secured creditors. And then there was a custody function and then there was a withhold function somewhere where I think that was where a lot of the litigation was now in FTX. The argument is that even though FTX never really had a custody function or anything like that.
00:20:12.506 - 00:20:30.950, Speaker A: They are arguing that from the terms of service, the FTX never had title to any of those assets and therefore FTX using those assets, lending them to Alameda when they did so, it was an appropriation of custom assets and there was a trust over those assets.
00:20:31.610 - 00:20:32.886, Speaker B: Right. But am I right?
00:20:32.988 - 00:20:36.054, Speaker A: Proprietary interest over those assets, am I right?
00:20:36.092 - 00:20:52.922, Speaker B: That that probably is the correct interpretation. Like any crypto person would definitely say when you have your money on an exchange, that it's still your money. It's not like you gave the money to the exchange. It's just like they're holding it, but you own it.
00:20:53.056 - 00:21:25.334, Speaker A: Yeah, probably. Except it's also a complicated effect. It's been a while since I revisited this, but I've had quite long discussions with Gondi about this, and it doesn't help that the Terms of Service were changed semi recently to the English Terms of Service, which kind of provides this your title does not transfer provision which everyone is hanging their heads on. So potentially you then have a timing issue as well as to which terms of Service your specific deposit came out under. Oh, wow.
00:21:25.372 - 00:21:29.930, Speaker B: Wait, and I'm sorry, what did you say? And under English law, your title does not transfer.
00:21:30.080 - 00:22:13.554, Speaker A: No. So the Terms of Service that everyone is referencing in order to make this trust arguing is a Terms of Service governed under English law which specifically states that your digital assets remain yours and title does not transfer to FTX. And this is the provision which people use to say, the digital assets belong to me. They're held on trust. I have the right proprietary interest in these digital assets. The slightly complicating bit is that these Terms of Service were fairly recent, and there were previous versions of it which may not have language that put it in such a specific manner. And from recollection, they were also not english law governed.
00:22:13.682 - 00:22:22.166, Speaker B: Okay, but in that case, is the basic reading what? That FTX owns the money or the creditors or the customer?
00:22:22.348 - 00:22:42.426, Speaker A: I have to dig it up, but I have to dig it up. But I recall the language not being that clear. Like if you want to have a further chat about the trust argument, I'm happy mean, I thought we're talking about taxing here, but if we're talking about the trust thing, I could sit down with you for an hour and we could go through the eventualities and what the arguments actually are, if that helps.
00:22:42.538 - 00:22:50.930, Speaker B: Well, okay, so obviously we're not going to do that right now, but at the moment, does it look like the bankruptcy estate is leaning toward that interpretation?
00:22:51.590 - 00:23:02.646, Speaker A: I think the court is going to decide on it so fairly soon as well, if I'm not wrong. So we'll probably hear a bit of it soon enough.
00:23:02.828 - 00:23:05.510, Speaker B: And any indication on how the judge is leaning?
00:23:05.930 - 00:23:08.520, Speaker A: No idea. Absolutely no idea.
00:23:09.130 - 00:23:16.234, Speaker B: All right. And then the last thing, because you said it so fast, but I didn't quite catch it, you said something interesting about leverage as well.
00:23:16.352 - 00:24:00.940, Speaker A: The leverage it just goes back to the trust argument that we were discussing earlier, which is if you're using leverage functions, let's say you have your digital assets, right? And you're saying I have direct proprietary interest in those digital assets, but you then borrow money from FTX secured on those digital assets. What is the nature of the security on those digital assets? Do you give up your proprietary title when you use any leverage functions? Maybe not depending on what the security ends up actually being. Obviously it's not specified. And to what extent do you give it up if you do? No idea. Absolutely no idea. There's a lot of open questions with the trust stuff. That's what I'm saying.
00:24:00.940 - 00:24:09.706, Speaker A: It's not a silver bullet where trust finding means I get all my money back and everyone else gets fucked. Okay.
00:24:09.808 - 00:24:16.350, Speaker B: Yeah. It sounds like in this pick a path adventure, every ending is a little messy.
00:24:17.170 - 00:24:43.080, Speaker A: Yeah. Personally, as a lawyer, I want to see the trust argument because it'd be so interesting. I think a lot of lawyers want to see it because it's interesting. But if you are a customer of FTX, you do not want to see it because I say you do not want to see it. I think a lot of people do because that may or may not give them better recoveries. But what's happening is this is all going to be litigated on the FTX customer dime. Right.
00:24:43.080 - 00:24:55.994, Speaker A: So do I want new law being made with the estate's money paying lawyers? Probably not. It's just going to be a very convoluted, complex and annoying matter.
00:24:56.112 - 00:25:11.470, Speaker B: Okay, right. But it sounds like it would be good for the space as a whole if it was decided in that way, at least in my opinion, because I feel like well, I don't know or maybe not. Maybe it would be good if it was decided the quote unquote, wrong way and then nobody would put their money on centralized exchanges.
00:25:12.130 - 00:25:53.040, Speaker A: I would like it to be as a crypto participant, there is an implied understanding that your coins belong to you and when you put them on an exchange, they still belong to you and the exchange can't just steal it or basically convert it into credit. But obviously that's what FTX did. I think I mentioned previously, FTX was basically trying to do what your Voyager and your Celsius did, except Voyager and Celsius had terms and conditions that allowed them to use and rehypoticate customer assets, or FTX did not. And now we're figuring out what happens if you do not have those terms and you do it anyway.
00:25:53.890 - 00:25:57.200, Speaker B: That is such a great description of what happened there.
00:25:57.650 - 00:25:58.446, Speaker A: Yeah.

Time for fun bits Unchained's. Jenny Hogan has something to say about Binance needing to temporarily halt Bitcoin withdrawals.
00:38:26.250 - 00:38:50.978, Speaker C: It's allergy season, and finance is congested. That's right. They paused Bitcoin withdrawals twice on their platform in the last 24 hours. Withdrawals are back now, but bitcoin prices have fallen 3.5%, which honestly does seem like a normal weekend. But we should still be mad at Finance. People can't just have their bitcoin withdrawals halted, okay? What if they need that bitcoin to pay rent? Said dozens of bitcoin traders who live rent free in their parents basements.
00:38:50.978 - 00:39:15.886, Speaker C: Finance is calling this issue a learning opportunity. That's not what a learning opportunity is. A learning opportunity is when I hire an unlicensed plumber because he's cheaper and he ends up creating an issue that floods my downstairs neighbor's apartment and I get charged $700. Finance apologized and thanked users for their patience. I mean, duh. Nothing screams patience like a crypto trader. They also adjusted their fees to deal with this in the future.
00:39:15.886 - 00:39:22.266, Speaker C: The only issue is they adjusted them upwards. Please accept our sincerest apologies and also higher prices.
