00:02:05.304 - 00:02:05.602, Speaker A: Welcome.
00:02:05.656 - 00:02:08.962, Speaker C: Plan B. Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:02:09.096 - 00:02:14.278, Speaker A: Heads up. For those of you watching the video, plan B uses a pseudonym so as to hide his real identity, which is.
00:02:14.284 - 00:02:17.926, Speaker B: Why we are showing an image rather than the video on his side.
00:02:18.108 - 00:02:20.226, Speaker A: So, plan B, your bitcoin price models.
00:02:20.258 - 00:02:21.882, Speaker B: Have done really well over the years.
00:02:21.936 - 00:02:23.434, Speaker A: And this week you got even more.
00:02:23.472 - 00:02:32.170, Speaker B: Validation for your projections. In case people are unfamiliar with your professional background, just give us a brief history and tell us how you came to bitcoin.
00:02:33.150 - 00:03:08.806, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm in traditional finance for the last 25 years. I started in dealing rooms and moved my way up to bank balance sheets, insurance balance sheets, and managing pension balance sheets, mainly in structured finance or risk management functions or in the investment offices of those firms. So, yeah, I've seen a lot in the last 25 years, but one of the most interesting things I came across was bitcoin. And for me, that was 2013 that I first read the white paper. I was hooked from the start and.
00:03:08.828 - 00:03:09.946, Speaker A: Tell us how you came to create.
00:03:09.968 - 00:03:12.700, Speaker B: The stock to flow model and what that is.
00:03:13.310 - 00:04:12.090, Speaker C: Yeah, one of the things that I missed when I entered the space was a valuation model for every asset. We have a valuation model for equities, for all the derivatives, not for gold, by the way, that has the same problem as bitcoin. There's not really a valuation model, although you can look at the mining costs of gold, and that's what most of the models that were there for bitcoin were as well. So what I tried to do was make some fundamental case for why bitcoin has any value at all. Because most people were saying, well, there's nothing backing it. Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme or bubble, whatever. So I sort of started from the assumption that scarce assets like gold and real estates, et cetera, have more value than less or non scarce assets.
00:04:12.090 - 00:05:23.902, Speaker C: And, of course, in the commodity markets, there is this stock to flow measure where you can sort of quantify the scarcity of an asset. And I use that known measure to correlate it with the price, first only with the time series of bitcoin, so the bitcoin price over time and later with a stock to flow cross asset model. I combined the data with gold data, real estate data, silver, diamonds, other scarce assets. And what I found was a perfect linear relation between the scarcity measured in stock to flow and the market values of all those assets. And that was astonishing for me and just gave me a rough I must say it's a very rough model, but it gave me a rough indication that bitcoin should be well worth somewhere in between silver and gold and going towards gold, since it now has the same stock to flow and the scarcity as gold. So, yeah, very interesting discovery. I put it on paper and since then on Twitter and with the interviews like we're having now, it really took off and caught me by surprise.
00:05:23.902 - 00:05:31.318, Speaker C: So, yeah, especially now with over a million followers. I'm really astonished by that.
00:05:31.484 - 00:05:48.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I only imagine, especially because you do have an anonymous account. So I've heard you say you also use other price models. I don't know if you've made too much about them public, but in general, I think your models have been vindicated this week.
00:05:48.320 - 00:05:49.626, Speaker A: Why do you think we've hit this.
00:05:49.648 - 00:05:54.240, Speaker B: New all time high of nearly $67,000 for bitcoin this week?
00:05:55.010 - 00:06:49.040, Speaker C: Yeah, I could give several answers to that, but, yeah, maybe one step back. When I made the model, that was in March 2019, we were below $4,000 bitcoin after the 2017 all time high of 20,000. So we crashed all the way to 4000, even going to 3000, I think it was 3.2 at the bottom. And everybody's calling for $1,000 bitcoin at that time and through the stock to flow and through the scarcity. Yeah, that guided me towards, well, there will be a halfing bitcoin will be more scarce, approximately as scarce as gold. So we have to go up from here and not down, and we have to go up to the $1 trillion market cap, and we reach that cap at the moment.
00:06:49.040 - 00:07:54.210, Speaker C: So the last two years or three years were really spectacular and roughly led us towards that $1 trillion market cap. And I think based on that stock to flow model and the scarcity of bitcoin at the moment, that we should go a lot higher than we are today, towards the five or $10 trillion cap. At first, the same dollar market value as gold has. But yeah, more recently there's of course all sorts of things happening in the macro and geopolitical sphere that caused the that were the immediate triggers, I should say, for the rises. And of course, the bitcoin ETF is one of the things that we have been waiting for a long time to happen. And that was a reality since this week. And that caused a major upwards movement, I think, in bitcoin, that helped us a lot.
00:07:54.360 - 00:08:20.460, Speaker B: And so since that was bitcoin futures ETF, which I think the community maybe didn't necessarily expect at least until recently, and has also criticized for saying it's not maybe as efficient or as good a product as a spot ETF would be. So why do you think that it affected the price that way and how do you think it'll affect the bitcoin price going forward?
00:08:21.330 - 00:09:20.202, Speaker C: Yeah, that's very true. Bitcoin's futures ETF is better than nothing, but it's not as good as a spot ETF. So I'm already happy with the futures ETF. And I understand it because futures are instruments that the SEC understands. And for example, in the companies I used to work for, the latest company was a pension balance sheet of $100 billion. They did not understand bitcoin or well, let's say my colleagues did understand bitcoin and had bitcoin in their personal portfolios, but we did not have a mandate to go into bitcoin or virtual currency like assets because our board did not understand it. And likewise the SEC does not understand, I guess, bitcoin or has to get used to this digital currency world and futures.
00:09:20.202 - 00:10:09.582, Speaker C: And I saw that in my company as well, futures on bitcoin, that was interesting because they knew the instruments. So a futures ETF? Well, yeah, it's the first step, but it's not as good as a spot ETF. For example, I have been talking about the cash and carry trade before that. There's a huge premium and contango premium between futures and spot prices. The future bitcoin price is approximately annualized 10% higher than the spot price at the moment. So a bitcoin futures ETF would lose that 10% contango premium compared to a spot ETF. If bitcoin goes two x or ten x, then that 10% is worth it.
00:10:09.582 - 00:10:42.454, Speaker C: But on the other hand, it is 10%. And as I used to say, there is a very interesting counter trade to those future ETFs, and that is the cash and carry trade where you buy the spot and you short the future bitcoin and cash that 10% annually for really low risk. So, yeah, I think it's a nice step, a nice first step, but Spot for sure is better than futures.
00:10:42.582 - 00:10:58.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting that you said you felt maybe the SEC didn't understand because the chair, Gary Gensler, used to teach courses on blockchain technology at MIT. I think he understands, but I think he just doesn't trust that they can't regulate the spot.
00:10:59.730 - 00:11:05.038, Speaker C: Yes. Yeah, he understands this for sure. Gary's a good one.
00:11:05.204 - 00:11:13.620, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, so we're going to talk a little bit more about the price action and your models. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:12:18.970 - 00:12:34.270, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with plan B. So in the past there have been articles that have come out saying that the authors felt that when they tried to retrofit the stock to flow model with gold, it didn't work. And so then they felt that stock to flow for bitcoin won't work.
00:12:34.340 - 00:12:36.110, Speaker A: What do you say to such critics?
00:12:36.930 - 00:13:37.090, Speaker C: Yeah, that was one of the critics. There's a lot of them. I like the discussion and we have had a lot of discussion. This is one of the arguments that I don't really understand because I know that one study that was published with this argument used like 100 years of gold data and then concluded, well, yeah, there is no relation between the stock to flow over that 100 year period and the market value. But they forgot that since 1971 or everything before 1971, the gold price was the dollar price. So there was no movement in the gold price denominated in dollar at all. If you look at the charts, for example, there is one little jump around the World War II period where Roosevelt it was a little before that it was 33, I guess, where Roosevelt stole the gold from the American people and that it was illegal to have gold.
00:13:37.090 - 00:14:23.454, Speaker C: And in that period, they jumped the price, the dollar price of gold a little. But from there, it has been flat. And before that 1933 Roosevelt action, it was flat as well. Bitcoin or gold dollar was gold. It was defined literally as a measure, a certain amount of ounces of gold. So you can't take a data set with a lot of data before 90, 71, and then conclude that the gold price did not move with a stock to flow because it did not move at all. And in fact, in my own charts, I take ten years of data, stock to flow data of gold and market value data.
00:14:23.454 - 00:15:00.860, Speaker C: And what you see, it's one little dot on that chart. So you see bitcoin move, but the stock to flow of gold and the market value of gold did not move that much at all. So I'll repost that chart in one of the tweets later this week. You can see for yourself it's really not moved at all. And in that study you are referring to, there was a chart with 100 years of data. And, yeah, they just didn't acknowledge the fact that data, that gold and dollars were the same before 1971.
00:15:01.310 - 00:15:08.026, Speaker B: So, speaking of dollars, obviously we're in a very unusual time historically right now with the pandemic.
00:15:08.138 - 00:15:09.694, Speaker A: How would you say the pandemic has.
00:15:09.732 - 00:15:13.460, Speaker B: Influenced the bitcoin price over the last almost two years?
00:15:14.950 - 00:16:08.674, Speaker C: Yeah, in the beginning it went down. So in March 2020, everybody was scared, everybody was panicking, and sold everything from stocks to bonds to real estate, even gold and bitcoin. But in the long run, I think it has been very good for the bitcoin price of debasement because of the fed printing all that money. And of course, that was the reason why satoshi nakamoto invented bitcoin for the first place. The problem with our current money is the debasement that the central banks are doing. And they have been doing that for ages, literally since the roman empires. They diminished the silver content of the daenerys as a way to enrich themselves and literally steal from the people.
00:16:08.674 - 00:16:37.158, Speaker C: And that's what central banks are doing right now. They do it for the greater good, of course. That's the narrative. So to save the banks in the 2008 financial crisis and to save all the companies, for example, airliners now in the COVID period. But somebody has to pay that, and it's paid through debasement. Our dollars, the dollars that you and I have in our pockets become less valuable. And we see that in inflation.
00:16:37.158 - 00:17:24.010, Speaker C: First asset inflation, house prices, equity prices, everything of value rises, including bitcoin. It has been very good for the bitcoin price, but now it trickles down to energy prices, energy inflation, gas, electricity, et cetera, and even core inflation. So of course, central banks have been saying it has been transitory, but we all know it's not transitory. It's here to stay, and it will become worse. So, yeah, those trillions and trillions of dollars, I think it's 8 trillion to be exactly that. The Fed and also the European Central Bank, by the way, is also $8 trillion that they printed. That problem has to be solved.
00:17:24.010 - 00:17:47.678, Speaker C: I don't know how it will be very interesting to see in the next couple of months or years how that's getting resolved, but it will be nasty, I think, and there will be winners and losers, and I think bitcoin is one of your safe bets in this scenario.
00:17:47.854 - 00:18:07.480, Speaker B: Well, speaking of kind of some of the geopolitical issues, we have seen this big change in the bitcoin network due to China banning mining there, and also the government just cracking down even more stringently on trading. How would you say that all that has affected the price and will continue to affect bitcoin going forward?
00:18:08.270 - 00:18:51.046, Speaker C: Yeah, China has been a big factor in bitcoin and especially in mining, because all the free electricity in the provinces where the dams were and hydro energy was available, that was very cheap energy. And of course, yeah, it has to be used, and bitcoin is a perfect use for that. So I guess at one point, China had 50% of the mining power, the hash rate of the entire bitcoin network, and then they banned it. They made it illegal. And that had an enormous effect on price. It was April, I guess, this year. May, April or May this year.
00:18:51.046 - 00:19:48.086, Speaker C: And, yeah, they just switched off half the network, which technically is not a problem, of course, but for the miners that are impacted was a very big problem. And their entire business model and investment, of course, were rendered worthless, or at least they had to go to a Plan B scenario, which they did. They moved their mining equipment, their hardware to the neighboring countries of China and also to America, of course. And I guess now, a couple of months later, the situation is completely opposite that the United States has 50% of the hash power of the bitcoin network, and China has zero. So China has decided not to play the bitcoin game. And, yeah, in my opinion, they gave away their a very strategic and important advantage. That's how I see it.
00:19:48.086 - 00:19:49.558, Speaker C: As an investor, of course.
00:19:49.724 - 00:20:01.258, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, yeah, I think it's also good for the bitcoin network because there was always the talk that there could be a threat if the Chinese government decided to take over the miners or something like that.
00:20:01.424 - 00:20:02.186, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:20:02.368 - 00:20:30.950, Speaker B: Yeah. So now it's stronger. And I think the last debt that I heard was that in July, the US had 35% of the bitcoin hash rate. So let's talk about your models for the price of bitcoin for the next, I don't know, six months or so. I did see you say that the floor for November will be 98K. For December 135k. How are you getting there, and what drivers do you think will bring us to those prices?
00:20:31.850 - 00:21:14.910, Speaker C: Yeah, so I basically have three kind of models. The first model is the fundamental one, the stock to flow model that we talked about. The second one is a floor model that is more a technical analysis price based model. And it makes use of a mathematical error that most people, especially the technical analysts, make when looking at markets like bitcoin. Because bitcoin is not normally distributed, the returns, it's following power laws, and you need different math for that. And all the technical analysis tools, they are for normal markets. For example, the RSI, the relative strength index, it normally bounces between 30 and 70.
00:21:14.910 - 00:21:54.538, Speaker C: When it's 70, an asset is overbought. If it's below 30, it's oversold. While bitcoin's RSI never goes below, at least well sometimes, but almost never goes below 45 and can go as high as 95. So that tells you there's some really different dynamics and also mathematical processes behind the bitcoin price. And you have to look at things like fractal dimensions, hearst components, that kind of stuff. So that's the floor model. And the third thing I'm looking at, and actually I'm spending most of my time there at the moment, is on chain models.
00:21:54.538 - 00:23:04.680, Speaker C: So the big advantage of bitcoin is that we have all the transactions on chain transactions available in the blockchain. Everybody can download the blockchain if they run a node, it's about 400GB of data, so it's a big data crunch, but you can get that data and analyze it, and you see all sorts of patterns in the transactions, where they came from, from old investors or new investors, big investors, small investors, all sorts of patterns. And those models are very useful for timing tops and bottoms. So FOMO transactions, for example, are very noticeable. And at the very bottom, the emotions there are very interesting and seeable in the transaction. So I use those three models. And the model that got most attention the last couple of months was the floor model, because I predicted in June 20, that was the same time, by the way, that the Guggenheim chief investment officer predicted bitcoin to go below twenty k.
00:23:04.680 - 00:24:11.610, Speaker C: At about that same day, I made the prediction, no, it's going to 47. And bitcoin was, mind you, was below 34 at that time. I said, well, in August it will close above 47, in September it goes down a little, but it will close above 43, and in October it will close above 63. Well, it's a bit of luck, of course, involved in there, it has to be one cannot be that precise, but at least all those targets were met. So 47, 43, and we're waiting for the close of the month, of course, now of October, but 63 is in the book, and if that continues, and frankly, I would be very surprised if it doesn't, that would be a black swan event. That we haven't seen in the last ten years. But if that continues we'll go to 98,000 in November already and 135,000 bitcoin in December.
00:24:11.610 - 00:24:15.680, Speaker C: So that will be a very nice Christmas this year if that comes true.
00:24:16.210 - 00:24:53.500, Speaker B: I agree. So in the past bitcoin has breathed, as one of my sources call it in cycles of hitting a new high kind of basically in a bubble like fashion and then drawing down again but to a floor that was higher than in the previous cycle. Do you believe that we're in a cycle like that again? Or do you believe that with these new levels of institutional validation that we're seeing and also I think kind of like a more diverse set of drivers. Do you think that bitcoin will not see that same kind of cycle again in which the price sees a massive drop after this next high is reached until the next having?
00:24:54.510 - 00:26:12.994, Speaker C: Yeah, I seem to be one of the few that thinks we're in a normal cycle that will go down again after the all time high, because everybody, I guess, hopes for the super cycle or the hyper bitcoinization to start right now and that we do not have a big crash after next all time high. So that we don't see a -50% or even a -80% drop like we have seen last three times right and as much as I would hope that were true that we don't see that crash anymore. I think we will we're still in a phase where bitcoin is very small compared to traditional assets. Institutional investors either flat out deny the asset don't want to have it think it's for criminals or bad for the environment. And all this stuff you read in the mainstream media they're still there. So I don't think the world is ready yet for hyperbitcoinization or the super circle I think we will be managed by greed right now and fear later on and see another -80% after we top out at a couple of hundred thousand dollars. But there will be a point in time and in that way it's a timing question.
00:26:12.994 - 00:27:06.200, Speaker C: There will be a point in time later on, maybe after next halfing, in 2024, when the market is ready and ready for bitcoin, but also ready to see that bitcoin is the better money because it's scarcer than anything else. It's more divisible, it's more fungible, it's more portable, it's really mathematical and thermodynamically the best money there is. And as soon as people realize that, see that, then maybe the dollar is in trouble. And we'll have a global reserve currency that's called bitcoin. But I guess my timing for that hyperbitcoinization or super cycle event is after 2024 maybe somewhere between 2024 and 32.
00:27:06.570 - 00:27:18.118, Speaker B: Okay, well we'll have to check back and see because I agree. I have other sources who also believe that this cycle will be different. So I guess maybe we'll do a.
00:27:18.124 - 00:27:20.154, Speaker A: Show with you and somebody who believes that.
00:27:20.192 - 00:27:26.780, Speaker B: And then you can discuss and we'll try to do it for December or January or something like right as we're hitting that high.
00:27:28.750 - 00:27:33.170, Speaker A: Okay, well, this has been so much fun. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.
