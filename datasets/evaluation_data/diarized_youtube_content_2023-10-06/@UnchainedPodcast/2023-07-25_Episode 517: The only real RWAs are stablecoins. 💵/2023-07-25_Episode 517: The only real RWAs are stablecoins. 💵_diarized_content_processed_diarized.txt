00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.674, Speaker B: What's your theory of the case of why other things haven't migrated onto the blockchain?
00:00:03.802 - 00:00:25.830, Speaker A: Well, I think it's a supply and demand problem. So I think this is really like the invisible hand of markets not getting people excited enough. Because when there's enough demand, when there's enough of a pain point, when there's enough excitement, it will happen. People will figure it out. The one thing that has gotten people moving, so to speak, are stablecoins. There is a clear demand for stablecoins. There is clear private market fit.
00:00:25.830 - 00:00:57.740, Speaker A: That is a use case where the market ushered it into existence because so many people around the world demanded it or wanted it. I think when it comes to things like tokenized real estate, the demand is like microscopic still, right? There's very few people who are like, man, I'd kill for that skyscraper live on the blockchain. It's incredibly cool. Doing it is like achievement unlocked. But I don't know how many people do demanded, I don't know how much capital demands it. I don't know how big the invisible hand is that wants to will it into existence. It's super cool.
