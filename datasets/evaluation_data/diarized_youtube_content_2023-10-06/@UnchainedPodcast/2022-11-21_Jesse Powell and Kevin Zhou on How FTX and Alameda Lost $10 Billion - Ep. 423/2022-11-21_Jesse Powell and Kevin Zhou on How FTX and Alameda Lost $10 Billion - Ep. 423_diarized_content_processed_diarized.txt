00:00:00.730 - 00:00:52.006, Speaker A: Just a quick note that we're releasing what would typically be a Tuesday show on a Monday due to the Thanksgiving holiday coming up. But don't fret, we have a great conversation for you to tune into on Tuesday as well. A special edition of The Chopping Block to go over the first aid declaration in the FTX bankruptcy, the US versus Bahamas jurisdictional battle, genesis and crypto lending, and all the other craziness that happened last week. As for this episode, I reached out to Jesse Powell, co founder of Kraken, who ran a centralized exchange for a long time, and Kevin So of Galwa Capital, who could offer his perspective as a trader on FTX. The two of them mention some past observations about FTX that in hindsight, seem suspicious. Plus, discuss how Alameda, which had been seen as top traders, could have lost so much money. As you might expect, Sam, coins such as FTT played a big role.
00:00:52.006 - 00:01:28.122, Speaker A: I also asked Jesse for his views on not your keys, not your coins, since he is an exchange owner and we dive into how FTX's collapse reflects on the media, VCs and regulators. This was an incredible discussion, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Hey everyone, just a quick note before we begin.

Here to discuss are Jesse Powell, co founder of Kraken, which Disclosure is a former sponsor of the show, and Kevin soh, co founder of Galwa Capital.
00:03:09.734 - 00:03:11.450, Speaker A: Welcome, Kevin and Jesse.
00:03:11.790 - 00:03:12.906, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:03:12.928 - 00:03:14.074, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:03:14.192 - 00:03:38.066, Speaker A: The crypto industry has been absolutely rocked by the seemingly never ending saga of FTX, which every day seems to reveal even deeper levels of incompetence, malfeasance, perhaps fraud. Jesse, since you're an exchange owner, I wanted to get your opinion on what exactly happened here. What do you think the root of the issue was?
00:03:38.248 - 00:04:25.722, Speaker B: Yeah, I think these guys, first of all, didn't really know what they were doing when it came to running what should be like a Fort Knox type of operation. I think they were traders first and foremost. I think they were very inexperienced operators and they took on a lot, I think, a huge amount of work for the number of people that they had on the team. Our whole security team is like 100 plus people, and they were doing what the whole company is doing with like 50 people at one point. So they wouldn't have been able to do all the things that you would normally do and build. And from the outside, we figured that this was going to catch up with them at some point, that they were accumulating a lot of technical debt. We didn't anticipate that it was as bad as it is.
00:04:25.722 - 00:04:38.114, Speaker B: It seems like they hadn't done any kind of accounting or reconciliation in like three years and that they basically had no controls in place and very few people knew what was actually going on there.
00:04:38.232 - 00:04:45.718, Speaker A: Yeah. And Kevin. What about you? I know you're approaching more from the trader perspective, but I was interested to hear what you thought the core problem was.
00:04:45.884 - 00:05:17.278, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I definitely agree with Jesse. And actually, before starting the firm, I used to work two years each at two different exchanges, one of them being Kraken. So I'm pretty familiar with some of the operations that go on within exchanges. And like Jesse said, there's a lot that goes into it. And with a small team, it's very difficult to run because there's so many different divisions. It's a full fledged business, right? If you look at a trading there's, you don't have to do any marketing. There's very little BD, there's not too much legal overhead.
00:05:17.278 - 00:06:18.626, Speaker C: There's a lot of these divisions that aren't fully fledged, but in exchange, the full fledged business, so you have all these different divisions. And then I think on top of that, some of these guys from FTX, from Alameda, they were coming in from the TradFi world and they weren't super crypto native at the time. And there were a lot of lessons, I think, that were learned in history. Everything from like, gox to mean to some extent, like Bitcoinica. I mean, there were so many lessons along the way crypt c with big vern, all these pieces of history that I think folks that had lived through it really internalized, and folks that just came by later, they knew about it. They understood it intellectually, but they hadn't gone through sort of the experience, the harrowing experience of what it was like to see gox collapse or all of these major hacks or exploits happen in real time. So I think the attitude that a lot of these guys at FTX and Alameda took probably was a little bit too cavalier in how they were blitz scaling their exchange.
00:06:18.626 - 00:07:19.474, Speaker C: Something that they thought of as kind of like a startup financial product, rather than some kind of like what Jesse said, like a Fort Knox, where at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how good your systems are, how good your trading platform is, if you can't manage to hold on to your user's funds, right? And that's only from the sort of the angle that these guys had some incompetencies. Now on top of that, maybe there was actually some actual bad behavior and some fraud and malfeasance. Now that can also happen on top of them not knowing what they're doing, right? So it just makes a bad problem even worse. I'll even share a really kind of random story about when we met Alameda first, before they started FTX, sometime in late 2018 or early 2019. And I actually distinctly remember talking to them about accounting systems, and this is before FTX existed. So this is just for Alameda's accounting Systems. And what they were saying is that, yeah, at the end of the day, we do our best to try and reconcile.
00:07:19.474 - 00:07:56.082, Speaker C: We spend some time, half an hour or a couple hours, I forget exactly how much time they said, but they spent some amount of time at the end of every day to try and reconcile the records. But then they're like, at the end of the day, sometimes you just can't get to the right number. And if it's plus or minus ten grand, 100 grand, which back in the day was a lot of money, right. They said, well, just move on to the next day. Right. So I think looking back, there were so many different signs like that, that I think in retrospect were sort of clear warning signs and signals for the risks that were to come. But at the time, we didn't really think too much of it.
00:07:56.082 - 00:08:01.862, Speaker C: Right, so it's one of those things where hindsight is definitely 2020.
00:08:01.996 - 00:08:37.460, Speaker A: Yeah. And I don't remember how big they grew to, but I feel like the latest numbers I saw were somewhere in the 300 range. But clearly for the size of the operation, that still was an extremely lean machine, which Sam would sort of boast about. But obviously, as Jesse mentioned, that is a kind of red flag. And to see your comments about the security, that was literally my very first thought. Like, how does this even happen when you know what should have been like a security team? I couldn't even figure that out. Clearly, I don't think they've really had one as the answer.
00:08:37.460 - 00:08:51.574, Speaker A: So my next question actually was going to be if you two had any inklings of something being amiss beforehand. And Kevin actually already answered that. So Jesse, did you have any experience with them prior that kind of made you think, oh, there are some red.
00:08:51.612 - 00:09:07.766, Speaker B: Flags here, we had no direct experience with them. I've never met Sam. I interacted with Bret on one occasion about some regulatory stuff and I disagreed with them on know, but they clearly had their own strategy they were pursuing.
00:09:07.958 - 00:09:10.538, Speaker A: And can you talk about what that difference was?
00:09:10.704 - 00:10:17.218, Speaker B: Yeah, there was some bill, I don't remember exactly what it was, but there's some very problematic language in it. And Kraken actually went out to our users and notified all of our users about it to try to contact their government representatives about it. FTX felt like the better approach was to use their contacts in DC and try to negotiate this in backroom deals and things like that. We felt like through our experience over the years that that was basically going to be futile and we were kind of beyond the point of being able to do that, to be able to reason with a few people behind the scenes. And so I think that was kind of like that interaction was sort of representative of their whole approach, which was like basically they thought they knew better than everyone else, even though they were relatively new to the scene, they thought that, well, things aren't better because all you guys before us, maybe you weren't doing things right. And so they had new ideas which they thought would be better. And I mean, they didn't appreciate that.
00:10:17.218 - 00:10:40.540, Speaker B: We actually tried all these ideas years ago and we've developed over the course of a decade the strategy that we have now. But I think that was just par for the course, for them to come in and think that they could do things in a way that no one else had tried before and that would make them successful, not learning from the lessons of the past. And obviously that played out with the implosion of their business as well.
00:10:41.230 - 00:10:58.510, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Yeah. I have a feeling maybe the bill that you're talking about is the infrastructure bill from a year ago. That might have been that, because I remember a Kraken at that time calling upon its users. So that may not have been it, but that was one time I remember your company did that.
00:10:58.580 - 00:11:00.160, Speaker B: Yeah, that's probably it.
00:11:00.930 - 00:11:28.550, Speaker A: Okay, so Kevin, I just have to ask you, and I'm so sorry about this, but obviously the news this week was that Galwa Capital had $40 million worth of assets stuck on the exchange. And I was curious just to hear why it is that Galwad didn't withdraw earlier. What was your experience using? Like, why did you kind of have some confidence to leave the assets on the exchange?
00:11:28.970 - 00:12:23.190, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm happy to talk about that a little bit. There's some things that are confidential with regards to the fund, but generally the idea is that slowly over time as a US based business, we kept getting kicked off of international exchanges. So sort of the scope of our trading started to get more and more concentrated on FTX. And then at that point there was also, I think, some sense that we really didn't see this coming. I mean, in retrospect there were so many red flags, but at the time we thought the exchange was secure. We thought he was sort of the golden child of crypto going to meet with all the regulators and whatnot seemed to be smart, seemed to be knowing what they were doing turned out not to be the case. And so I think we were kind of lulled into a false sense of security there and then on top of that had a lot of positions open at the time that we had to unwind before we could withdraw.
00:12:23.190 - 00:13:48.166, Speaker C: So just given the size of those positions, it was very cumbersome unless we were willing to puke it and then just take on all that slippage, it was very cumbersome just to unwind all those positions to withdraw. So a mix of many different factors, but I would say that's mostly it and I also wanted to maybe just take a step back and sort of respond to what Jesse was saying before, which know, I completely agree. I think there's a lot of lessons of the past that new people coming into the space, whether it be new exchange operators or new token project founders, but there's always this kind of sense that we can do things better and I think that that is a good attitude to have. But at the same time, I think there's a lot of history lessons that a lot of the newcomers have not quite learned yet. And there is something to be said about having experience in the space, having lived through some of these events. A lot of times I think the road to hell is kind of paved in good intentions, right, where it's sort of like we think we know better and we think not only do we know better, but we know better for everybody, right? Not just for ourselves, right? In taking this kind of approach, very easy to become misguided and maybe here or there make certain shortcuts that they shouldn't make. All for the sake of the greater good.
00:13:48.166 - 00:14:54.540, Speaker C: I'm reminded by early on, before FTX, I was doing some just due diligence on these guys because we were trading counterparties with Alameda and I stumbled upon Sam's blog, which has since become very popular as all of CT has now been reading this. You know, I thought it was curious that he was a Utilitarian, right? And in particular, and maybe just to explain very quickly, utilitarian is someone with the philosophy that people should act in a way that does the greatest good for the greatest number of people, never mind how to measure this goodness, right, and which people count, which people don't count. This whole thing gets very messy. But it's generally this kind of sense, right, where you're kind of like reducing people down to numbers and then trying to add them up to get the greatest sum, right. You've turned it into a math problem, an optimization problem, which I think is a little bit questionable to begin with. But in any case, reading through this blog and then now having reread it, I realized something which is that not only is this philosophy that of a utilitarian, but that of an act utilitarian rather than a rule utilitarian. Right.
00:14:54.540 - 00:15:19.698, Speaker C: So a rule utilitarian is someone who would say generally there are good rules to follow which yield the greatest good for the greatest number of people. For example, do not steal. That is generally a good rule to follow. We should create these rules and then we should follow these rules because they have a lot of utility in them. Right. An act utilitarian is not that way. It's not so much that you have prescribed certain rules to follow.
00:15:19.698 - 00:15:26.278, Speaker C: It's that you judge every single circumstance and event and you decide whether or not you think the outcome will be good.
00:15:26.364 - 00:15:26.758, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:26.844 - 00:16:30.870, Speaker C: So under that kind of paradigm, sometimes it may be okay to steal if stealing yields the greater good. Right? Now, obviously this can very easily get into murky moral and ethical territory because the allure of having an excuse to do something for the greater good if we are sort of not cognizant of our own biases and our own self interests can allow us to do great evil, right? And that's sort of this sort of idea about the road to hell is paved in good intentions, right? So now that kind of stood out to me, right, having now sort of revisited his blog and realized, oh, that's right, he was an aft utilitarian, not a rural utilitarian. Right. So there's all these small pieces that I think, and I'm sorry I went on a random tangent, but I feel like there's all these small pieces that kind of add up to a picture of a person who basically told us what he was going to do ahead of time. It was right under our noses. It was right in front of us, but there was no single thing which was alarming. But when you add it all together, it paints the picture of a person who is rather ruthless.
00:16:31.710 - 00:16:52.702, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know if you guys listened to this week's episode of The Chopping Block, but this is the exact argument that Tarun and I had with Haseeb where he and I kind of agreed with you, Kevin. Sorry. Tarun and I and then Haseeb has called himself an effective altruist. Although when he talked about it, it just seemed very different from the way Sam talked about it. So not sure what to make of that.
00:16:52.836 - 00:17:06.900, Speaker C: I don't mean this as an indictment of effective altruism. I don't see it as that way at all. I just think that his personal philosophy was little bit bizarre. And I think not all effective altruists are probably active utilitarians or even.
00:17:09.590 - 00:18:02.838, Speaker A: People, if they listen to the shopping mark, they'll hear that I asked him this. But I'll just mention this because the last time I interviewed Sam, I did ask him a question like, when you make these political donations, is your guiding motivation to do that your EA philosophy, or is it to help the crypto industry? And he basically said it was the you know, but that was another way of thinking about that question is what I really was asking him is, are you an effective altruist using crypto or are you a crypto person? That's kind of what I was trying to get at. It's what you talked about, and it's like when you think that you have a better idea of what to do with other people's money or whatever than they do, then it just leads to you to do things like, oh, I'm going to justify using people's customer funds anyway. But I'm curious for Jesse's response to all this.
00:18:03.004 - 00:18:07.320, Speaker B: Well, I agree with everything Kevin said, and I was a philosophy major in college.
00:18:07.930 - 00:18:12.122, Speaker A: Me too. Well, more like literature and philosophy, but love it.
00:18:12.256 - 00:18:57.382, Speaker B: Cool. My concentration was ethics and law and this kind of stuff was the stuff I would write papers about. And like Kevin said, this utilitarianism is a slippery slope. You know, like you said, you can just you decide that, you know, that $5 is better spent on a political donation. Not knowing that this person was going to use that $5 that was the last $5 they needed for their life saving surgery or something like that. You have to make a lot of assumptions about the relative value of things. Either Sam is just making all this stuff up or it seems like from that Vox article, the screenshots that were posted, it sounds like he was pretty much like an ends justify the means kind of guy.
00:18:57.382 - 00:19:57.100, Speaker B: Like Kevin said, I'm just going to do what I think is going to get me the best outcome in this scenario without having any specific kind of moral compass, basically, or even his own internal persona that he was trying to maintain. He's sort of saying, like, I'm just going to be a chameleon and do whatever's going to get me further ahead in any situation and I'm going to if donating to the Democrats is what does it, that's fine. If stealing client funds is what does it, that's fine. Ultimately, I don't even know if we buy that he was actually going to use all this money that he misappropriated in the end for some greater good. Like, what would that be? I think delivering cryptocurrency to the world is a pretty great good. It might be the biggest thing that any of us could work on and do in our lifetimes, but I don't know what the greater thing that he was planning on investing in would have been. I don't think he said that.
00:19:57.470 - 00:20:00.038, Speaker A: Actually. I know some of them.
00:20:00.144 - 00:20:00.622, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:20:00.676 - 00:20:37.410, Speaker A: One is pandemic preparedness. Another one was some kind of AI thing like protecting people from future AIS that would hurt humans, something like that called anthropica. Tarun mentioned this in the show. Have you heard of that? Or do you know it okay, those are the two on my show. He talked a lot about pandemic preparedness, but as Tarun put it, because the Ontario's teacher pension invested in FTX. Tarun was like, okay, so he stole from the grannies to protect people from an AI that might hurt humans 10,000 years from now. That was what he said.
00:20:37.580 - 00:20:51.310, Speaker B: But anyway, pretty much the pandemic preparedness thing also sounds like something that would just play well in the current climate with the media and everything. So I wonder if that's even true.
00:20:51.380 - 00:20:53.882, Speaker C: It's current thingism. It's current thingism.
00:20:54.026 - 00:20:55.200, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:20:56.930 - 00:21:44.954, Speaker C: And maybe just to say one last thing too. I'm starting to think more and more that the personal philosophies of the founders of these exchanges matters a lot. Especially given what happened. Because from what I remember with conversation with Jesse, jesse is a deontologist, which is the complete opposite of a consequentialist. Meaning that it's the means that matter much more than the, you know, I'm more inclined, and I think know, being truthful. When I talked with him about it, I think he was being, you know, then I have some very strong confidence that Jesse is not only going to look for what's the best outcome for people. What's the best outcome? For him, but he's going to try and do the right things in the right right to reach those think, you know, I think that really matters.
00:21:44.954 - 00:21:48.480, Speaker C: At the end of the day, I think character really matters in this space.
00:21:49.010 - 00:22:37.134, Speaker A: Okay, well, we can discuss this at Infinitum, but I actually want to just dig into some more details. You guys, I'm sure you've probably at least heard, if not read, the first day declaration that the new CEO John Ray published. But he mentioned certain things like corporate funds were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors. It also said that Alameda loaned $2.3 billion to Paperbird, which is an entity wholly owned by Sam. It also lent $1 billion to Sam himself, $543,000,000 to the director of Engineering, Nishad Singh, and $55 million to Ryan Solomay, who is the co CEO. So all that together accounts for about $4 billion.
00:22:37.134 - 00:23:24.814, Speaker A: The New York Times reported that Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison said that Alameda had taken out loans to make venture investments. And I remember that earlier in the year they announced that their venture investment plans were going to total 2 billion. The information also reported that Alameda invested at least 20 million in Paradigm and that Alameda Research and FTX Ventures committed hundreds of millions of dollars to sequoia Ultimateer Capital Management, multicoin capital. These are venture funds. And that some of the funds also backed K Five Global, which is an advisory and investment fund run by Michael Kivis, who's a close advisor to SPF. So I was just very curious. So obviously that's a huge amount of money.
00:23:24.814 - 00:23:49.506, Speaker A: I don't know what that totals. Maybe somewhere in the ballpark of 4.5 billion or something, people think maybe about $10 billion is missing. I was kind of curious. What are your theories on where the money went and why so much went missing? Is it like bad trading? Because people have said to me, oh, they were on the top of the leaderboards, we thought they were great. Like, what's your theory on what happened with all this money that's missing?
00:23:49.618 - 00:23:51.926, Speaker B: I would love to hear Kevin's take on this.
00:23:52.108 - 00:24:43.394, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I'm happy to know there's a Twitter account, I can't believe I'm saying this, there's a Twitter account called Zero X FBI femboy, and this person writes a blog called Milky Eggs and I think theorizes on a lot of where the money went. I don't entirely agree with all the assessments, but I think it's pretty comprehensive and I mostly agree. So I think it's all of the above. So I think, first off, when they first started and they were on top of the BitMEX leaderboards, I think they were like the rank two, rank three, and rank seven accounts on BitMEX. I think back then the game itself was a lot easier and you could have like a ragtag prop shop just coming out of TradFi. There were not many institutional players, there were not many sophisticated players back then and it was kind of easy to do market making across a lot of different exchanges.
00:24:43.394 - 00:25:37.926, Speaker C: But for the most part from these shops that they came from, predominantly Jane Street. Jane Street's not particularly known for speed. Now they're not slow, but they're not known for being very high frequency, right? In terms of like HFT, for example. So I think as things progressed and you started having a lot of these bigger players like Jumptower, HRT, these really proper kind of HFT market makers come in, then they started squeezing out a lot of these crypto native. Firms on the market making side and probably profits started drying, you know, at that point they probably started it's very it's a lot harder now to make sort of like risk neutral, kind of market neutral returns on just market making. Maybe they'll get more into riskier stuff and more into long short punting or speculating on BC investments, that sort of thing. I remember that.
00:25:37.926 - 00:26:39.962, Speaker C: And this was, I think, even before we met the Alameda team in 2018 and 2019. But there was a little period before that where there was a fracture within Alameda itself because Sam had a co founder, Tara McCully, who eventually went on to start Lantern Ventures. And basically there was an internal disagreement where two thirds of the team kind of wanted to take more risk and one third of the team wanted to take less risk. So the one third of the team branched off and went to Lantern and then the two thirds stayed with Sam. Each part of the team went with each of the different co founders. So basically where things may have started sensibly with kind of this kind of check and balance system between people want to take more risks and people take less risk. There was some kind of self selection process after that split where you had all of the risk takers on one side and all of the lower risk tolerance people on the other side.
00:26:39.962 - 00:27:26.300, Speaker C: So now all of a sudden, now things start to get more extreme. Right? So that's one thing. I think probably the fact that they were using a lot of possibly amphetamines or other pharmaceutical drugs probably didn't help. I think once you start messing with the Dopamine system, particularly the mesolympic dopamine system, which forecasts reward and pleasure, it can really start affecting your judgment on possibly taking on more risk or just general cognitive impairment and function. I thought it was very interesting that people brought up the fact that Sam is hard stuck at Bronze two in League of Legends. I think this is if you play three years and you're stuck at that rank in League of Legends, there's just something wrong. You're just not learning anything.
00:27:26.300 - 00:28:13.814, Speaker C: It just seems like he's struggling to pick up and learn new things. Right. I think there was a great analogy on Twitter, which is like, if you've been trying to figure out how to learn to ride a bike for three years and you still can't ride a bike, you probably are a little bit impaired cognitively. Right? And that's kind of what I think that represents. Even though it's kind of a bizarre example, I think they did do a lot of speculation on venture investments and in particular in the Solana ecosystem with these high float or low float, high fully diluted value coins. And now reflecting back at the time, I thought it was like it's a little bit greedy to do it that way because you want some high marks on the books, this and that. But I didn't think it was like, that nefarious.
00:28:13.814 - 00:29:09.734, Speaker C: It was just like slightly shady, right, to have these projects always do that on Solana. But now I'm thinking maybe it was actually way more nefarious than that because maybe they already had the intention of using it as collateral, so they needed it to be as high mark as possible. Right, but when you have a situation like that, the higher the artificial mark is, the worse the liquidation is when it finally comes. Time to do liquidation. And on top of that, them using FTT as collateral to borrow funds from FTX, or for FTX to borrow funds from Know. Whichever way that relationship went, using the exchange token itself creates also a bunch of reflexivity, because now, as the solvency of the exchange gets called into question, the value of the token plummets, further putting the exchange in a weaker balance sheet state, further pushing it into insolvency. Right? So these are the kind of like debt spiral effects that we saw with Luna.
00:29:09.734 - 00:29:53.030, Speaker C: This one is not as extreme, it's not as reflexive. Right? Maybe the multiplier, if you wanted to quantify it, then the numerical value of the debt spiral effect is lower, but it's still, let's say, greater than one, greater than some critical threshold in which these kinds of spirals can happen. Because honestly, a 500 million dollar sell of some kind of fairly high market cap token in top 50, top hundred by CZ should not crater the price to near zero and bankrupt in exchange. That should not happen. Right. If things were constructed properly. And then there are also suspicions that Alameda had unique accounts which could not be liquidated on FTX.
00:29:53.550 - 00:29:59.414, Speaker A: Well, that's what the first day declaration said. So this is like a fact, according to the new CEO, John Ray.
00:29:59.462 - 00:30:55.802, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think this is true. So there are screenshots of this document, it's called the CLP Program, and we've also heard about it ourselves. Basically I think it's in Japanese or I forget what language, but basically, from what I understand of the terms, the CLP program is a program that market makers can participate in. And if they put extra collateral on the platform where they have certain levels of margin, normally then during extreme situations they'll actually get a call on the phone rather than auto liquidated. And then on top of that, there are certain risk checks that are bypassed by their risk checking system. Basically, from our study of their systems, there's two queues that your orders go into in the API. Whether you click through the screen that generates that order placement into the API, or you actually connect up to their API and send them packets.
00:30:55.802 - 00:31:16.994, Speaker C: There's two queues. The first is the risk queue and your order goes through that. Once that's finished, then it goes into the matching queue. Right. And the risk queue, there are some nuances there and from what we've been told, normal customers go through the risk queue and things are checked in serial. So there's a number of different things that have to be checked one after another. Right.
00:31:16.994 - 00:31:43.210, Speaker C: And I think it has to do with the fact that there's like multiple assets and they do cross asset collateralization. There's a whole bunch of different collaterals that you can use. You can use anything to collateralize anything almost. Right. But then with the CLP Program, they basically run it in parallel and there are some race conditions, but they're willing to overlook that because your credit is good or you've signed a document with them, that sort of thing. So I do think that program exists. I think that not many people even knew that it existed.
00:31:43.210 - 00:32:13.494, Speaker C: And probably Alameda was there from the very beginning with this kind of favorable treatment. Now I think whether or not they actually looked at people's stops and passed that information to Alameda to go run people's stops or push them over mean that I don't know, I wouldn't really speculate on that. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. It just really depends on just how much malfeasance there was. But at least I would say there probably was at least some kind of advantage for alamena with this CLP program.

So Jesse, what do you think happened to all this money? How could there be this much missing?
00:34:00.306 - 00:35:04.382, Speaker B: It's kind of wonder, I wonder how much of it was just lost through market making. If they felt like they needed to prop up their own books and make a liquid market and they were willing to bleed off some amount of money just to do that over time. And they knew that if their markets weren't liquid that they would just lose the exchange game, period. So it could be some was due to know. I think to Kevin's point, I think they probably started to take on some directional and if they were market making a bunch of these shitcoins, they would have been holding those coins. But it seems know, maybe Luna was like the start of this for them, like the real liquidity crunch and there's this cascade of other dominoes falling that ultimately led to this. And I think that if you had had other lenders on Kraken, for example, when we look at sort of like the equity value of somebody's account for margin trading, we look at tokens that they have and each token gets its own discount rate.
00:35:04.382 - 00:35:54.894, Speaker B: Basically, USDC is basically like zero discount. Bitcoin might be like 5% discount or something like that. And then you go all the way down the list and some tokens are like 95% discount to the current price in a liquidation scenario toward the account equity because we just don't feel like we're going to be able to liquidate that asset. It might be very volatile or it might be illiquid markets. And if FTX went outside to try to get a loan against their FTT, someone else should have looked at that and said, hey, you want like a $5 billion loan against this asset that there's like $50 million of liquidity out there. And if we ever had to liquidate this, it would be basically going to zero. So maybe you would put a cap on how much you lend out.
00:35:54.894 - 00:36:45.562, Speaker B: You would lend out like up to $50 million or something like that against all the FTT or against $500 million worth of FTT if you mark it at the current price. But because they were lending to themselves, they obviously ignored this risk and just marked it at the most favorable rate possible, which allowed Alameda basically to borrow client funds against a collateral that was almost worthless. They just greatly exceeded what the risk level should be to the lender. FTX never should have lent Alameda client funds at like a one to one ratio. Basically, they should have marked it down like 95%, really, to even be reasonable. I think they probably just basically took out a bunch of leverage bets on coins that ultimately just crashed. And I can't believe they were taking out loans to make, like, seed stage venture investments.
00:36:45.562 - 00:36:54.450, Speaker B: I mean, that's just like madness. Clearly I'm working at the wrong exchange because Kraken hasn't bought me a $30 million penthouse.
00:36:58.310 - 00:37:03.570, Speaker A: Well, since Kraken is still around, I think maybe you are working at the right exchange.
00:37:04.230 - 00:37:08.082, Speaker B: We'll see it hasn't played out yet. Yeah, maybe.
00:37:08.136 - 00:38:04.678, Speaker C: Just to add to what Jesse said, I actually read their margin docs and basically there was a couple of things that really stood out to me at FTX, which is there is a collateral weight factor which was basically putting FTT at a 5% discount. So something that should have been like 95% discounted was 5% discounted. And on top of that, another very weird feature is that in their loan book, in their lending pool, right, you can borrow all sorts of different assets, right, but you couldn't borrow FTT. And I think maybe that the reason for that, is that they designed that on purpose because they didn't want people having a lot of FTT to short it. Right. Even when they started and they opened their books for FTT, they started with the spot market, and it took a lot of time and a lot of lobbying by their customers to introduce a perp book on FTT. If you guys remember, when it first launched, it was only a spot book.
00:38:04.678 - 00:38:51.714, Speaker C: Well, these days, when they launch new tokens, they list the spot and the futures and the perps at the same time. So why all this very strange treatment for FTT, which is different than everything else? And my thought is that there's a little bit of smoke there. Maybe it's fire, right? But certainly there's a lot of smoke there, suggesting that they knew exactly what they were doing and they were like, in a wonky financial engineering way, trying to create something that is hard to go down because they themselves held so much of it and were using it as collateral for so much debt. Right. So they wanted as few shorters in the market as possible, and therefore wouldn't even lend it out. So I think those are all these small, interesting tidbits now coming out. No single thing by itself is that suspicious.
00:38:51.714 - 00:38:58.070, Speaker C: They're all like slightly suspicious, right? And you add them all together and the entire picture looks kind of horrifying.
00:38:58.590 - 00:39:42.470, Speaker A: Yeah, one last bit that just my jaw on the floor was in that vox piece. I don't know if you remember, she kind of asks him about what happened with the money, and then he says something like, oh yeah, we had these accounting issues. Like, for instance, oh, FTX doesn't have a bank account. We'll just have customers send their money to Alameda. Three years later, whoops, all the money got sent to Alameda and we know put it in this dub account for FTX or something. And I was like, oh my God. And then other people started tweeting like, oh yeah, when I deposited my money on the bank slip, it said Alameda.
00:39:42.470 - 00:40:02.140, Speaker A: And I was just whoa. Like, customers were literally sending their money straight to Alameda. And so I just feel like it appears, at least from that Twitter DM, that there literally was no separation and that Alameda just kind of considered customer funds, their own funds to trade. That's how I read that. Am I wrong?
00:40:02.670 - 00:40:35.714, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's exactly what happened. Now that I'm thinking back, I think I remember that too. Right? So, like, you know that somebody on Twitter posted, hey, look, here's the wire instructions for FTX OTC. And it clearly says on there the name of the firm is Alameda. And I think that we actually have those same wire instructions. I think when we traded with FTX OTC, we also had to wire money to Alameda OTC. So I think that these are some of the things where it's just like you really just can't be doing that because it's not clear that in the back end, everything is being tracked correctly.
00:40:35.714 - 00:40:37.560, Speaker C: Like this whole Stub account issue.
00:40:40.570 - 00:40:40.898, Speaker B: I'm.
00:40:40.914 - 00:41:26.998, Speaker C: Sort of reminded of there have been other times with other exchanges where it's like, you know, just we've managed to catch money disappearing out of the account. And I'll and I'll give you one example, which is pretty bizarre, right? Which is that one of our counterparties was settling a trade with us and we told them to settle it to I won't mention the name of the exchange to this exchange's account. But instead of sending the tether to the Tether address, they sent it to the Bitcoin address. Right. So it's still recoverable because it was still Bitcoin based tether right at the time. But we need the exchange to go and figure out how to retrieve the funds and then credit us. So the exchange charges some amount of money for doing that.
00:41:26.998 - 00:42:28.602, Speaker C: And we noticed that they actually charged us twice because they just kind of forgot they didn't remember if they charged us or not, but they charged us twice. So I'm sure these kinds of things happen all the time. I remember doing a trade with Alameda, just like somebody said on crypto Twitter, where they settled their leg of the trade but forgot to remove money from our account. And we had to go ping them and say, oh, by the way, I think you guys forgot to take money out of our account, but trade settle on your side, so go, feel free to do that. And oh, sorry, we forgot. So it was just a lot of that kind of sloppiness everywhere. And I'm even reminded of another anecdote where I was talking with basically one of the employees at FTX and I was asking Know, because the person was looking around for vehicles to invest in, right? And I'm like, but like, don't you guys have like a really profitable prop? Like, why don't you just invest in Alameda and you work there, you work at Know, why don't you just invest there? And he's like, Well, Sam won't let us.
00:42:28.602 - 00:42:58.280, Speaker C: And I'm like, well, why is that the case? He says, well, it's just really messy because all the bookkeeping and stuff, it's just very hard to say exactly what the right marks are and what exactly the PNL is at any time. So right now it's just like, it's just Sam's money. As I'm remembering all of this, I feel like the writing was on the wall, right? But it's just like each of these instances are just so far apart from each other and each one not suspicious enough by themselves. But I think there's tons of instances like that.
00:42:59.290 - 00:43:01.542, Speaker A: Jesse, do you want to add anything on Know?
00:43:01.596 - 00:43:31.280, Speaker B: The using of other bank accounts is something that some exchanges have. Know Quadrica did it extensively, and I think in just it's a problem for the industry that it's very hard, or at least historically was very hard to get bank accounts it's gotten easier over time. And I think these days, if you're a legit crypto company, you can get a bank account. Now they're friendly banks serving crypto, but for a time, yeah, it certainly was very difficult.
00:43:31.810 - 00:43:34.970, Speaker A: Would that have been the case when FTX started in 2019?
00:43:35.050 - 00:44:09.834, Speaker B: In 2019? No, they should have yeah, I think they would have been able to get a bank account in 2019 if they had been willing to do a little bit of diligence, maybe get a license or something like that at the time. It's definitely shady. Sometimes you question sending money to the CEO's wife's bank account or something, which is stuff that happened at Quadriga, but it's another thing to send money directly into a hedge fund rather than your exchange account. You have to wonder like, okay, what are these guys actually doing with my money? So that's definitely sketchy. Yeah.
00:44:09.872 - 00:44:20.894, Speaker C: Wasn't there like an exchange in the old days? Like there was something like the rock trader or something? You're supposed to mail an envelope of cash or something like that. It was something wild, it was something crazy.
00:44:21.012 - 00:44:42.386, Speaker A: Basically there was another one where they would tell you to go into a bank and you would have to deposit some amount that ended in some number of cents and then that was how they would match your order to what amount of Bitcoin you were buying. Yeah, this was like, I think even before the Duala days, I'm just blanking on the name of that exchange, but trade Hill?
00:44:42.498 - 00:44:44.614, Speaker B: Was it Trade Hill? Yeah, maybe trade Hill. That sounds like?
00:44:44.652 - 00:45:49.450, Speaker A: Was it Trade Hill? Okay, so I have one kind of perhaps projection. I'm curious to hear what you guys think of this, if you think this will actually happen, but I thought that one of the kind of consequences of this whole thing will be that we'll maybe have more people doing the self custody thing and participating in DeFi. But I wonder what you thought of that, because the history of crypto has been littered with numerous incidents like this. Like, obviously this appears to have been fraud and some of the other ones were more like hacks, which it's a different animal, but kind of the same thing. Customer puts their coins on an exchange and then they lose the coins. I was just kind of curious if you thought that would happen or also to hear, because, Jesse, as far as I can tell, I think you are an advocate of this mantra. Not your keys, not your coins, and yet you run an exchange, so you probably have some sort of more nuanced view on when that applies or how people should think about this philosophy.
00:45:49.450 - 00:45:52.154, Speaker A: So just curious for your thoughts on all that.
00:45:52.352 - 00:46:32.506, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope that more people take their coins off and self custody. I know not everyone's comfortable with it, and if you've only got $20 worth of Bitcoin and you don't really know what you're doing. Maybe that's a reason to leave it on, because it's not that much to risk, but also it's not that much to risk on the other side too, to self custody. It I do hope that more people learn about that and try to do that from the exchange perspective. For us, we don't get paid for keeping your coins on the exchange. We don't charge any kind of account balance fee, there's no monthly fee, there's no dormancy fee or anything like that. And so if you're not trading with the money that's on your Kraken account, that's just a liability for us.
00:46:32.506 - 00:46:58.420, Speaker B: We're vaulting your assets for free, basically. So we're taking all this liability in the event that we get hacked or something happens to your account. So it's just risk for us. And why would we want to have this risk if we're not getting anything from it? So if you're not trading with your coins, you're not staking them. There are noncustodial ways to stake as well. My preference is you just take it off because it's just risk that we don't need and we're not benefiting from.
00:46:59.510 - 00:47:10.600, Speaker A: But do you think that that will actually happen? That more people will try to do the self custody thing? Or do you feel that the vast majority of people find that sort of onerous for them?
00:47:11.770 - 00:47:59.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is onerous for many people, especially if you're actively trading. Obviously you don't want to just be moving your money on and off all the time, but we've already seen a lot of withdrawals. I mean, if you look at the blockchain, most of the exchanges are getting net withdrawals, and I think that means people are withdrawing to their own custody, which is fantastic. But it's probably just a matter of time before this is forgotten and a new wave of people come in, just like everyone forgot about Gox. In the next bull cycle, there'll be a new wave of people coming in to crypto. They'll have no idea about FTX, they'll certainly have no idea about Mount Gox. And unfortunately, there'll probably be another hard lesson to learn again at some point.
00:47:59.494 - 00:49:06.186, Speaker B: I think we as an industry need to do a better job of just calling out the bad actors. I think the ranking sites need to come up with some other metrics by which to measure venues other than just trading volume. Like maybe some kind of degree of seriousness of the business or longevity of the business. I think one of the big things that caused FTX blow up to be as bad as it was, was that even people that were experienced gox, their worst case scenario was like a hack. People just thought the hack was the way that FTX would get taken down. But because of all of the Media hype, the media fluff pieces, the political contributions, all of the people that Sam seemed to be hanging out with, the celebrity endorsements, all this stuff, I Think that helped to build up. This, you know, just like Bernie Madoff basically, and just like Elizabeth Holmes with like surrounded themselves with the elite people who from the outside, you see, that who they're associated with.
00:49:06.186 - 00:49:42.038, Speaker B: And you think, oh wow, this person just must be totally legit otherwise they wouldn't be associating with all these other elite people. That was obviously wrong. I mean, he sort of bought his way into that perception with client funds and I think people just didn't think about that. Could he be buying all these stadiums and all this stuff? People saw him spending so much money and I think thought, wow, he must just be making so much money. There's no way. He's extremely competent. Even if he does lose some money, he's making so much money that he would cover the hole or whatever.
00:49:42.038 - 00:50:04.942, Speaker B: Not thinking that actually what's going on is he's actually spending all the clients money to buy all the status. I think that's maybe like a new thing for the industry. I don't think we've had a legit bad actor like that before who just intentionally stole client funds. I think everything else, everyone else has gone down, has been hacks, I think. I don't know, kevin, correct me if I'm wrong.
00:50:04.996 - 00:50:08.800, Speaker C: I don't know. Big Vern was a bit shady. I would that's true, yeah.
00:50:09.490 - 00:50:12.720, Speaker A: Wait, what's that? Big Vern. I don't know what that is.
00:50:13.090 - 00:50:14.090, Speaker C: That was Cripsey.
00:50:14.170 - 00:50:18.590, Speaker B: He's still out there, right? He hasn't been at large, right? He's like hiding out in China somewhere.
00:50:18.670 - 00:50:23.490, Speaker C: Probably all these guys. I mean, who knows if the quadriga guy is dead or alive and who knows?
00:50:24.550 - 00:50:27.720, Speaker B: I'm still waiting for Sam to mysteriously die in.
00:50:30.650 - 00:50:38.042, Speaker A: Right, yeah, no, I think actually Gerald Cotton probably is the other big one that's known. But you're right, I can't think of.
00:50:38.096 - 00:50:48.890, Speaker C: And the one guy shows up as Xerox Sifu. Right. It's wild. The timeline is just wild. But yeah, no, I definitely agree with Jesse's sentiments.
00:50:49.310 - 00:51:44.140, Speaker A: Just well, one other thing that I wanted to ask about was so we talked about how FTT was a big part of what happened here, and, I mean, any of the other Sam coins, like serum or oxy or maps or fida or whatever these all are, which, like, I literally hadn't heard of some of these until a few days ago. I'm sure you have seen in crypto, Twitter, a lot of bitcoiners are taking a lap right now. They're all know we told you that all these coins that you guys are creating, it's like a bad idea and stuff like that. And Jesse, I know you're a bitcoiner I don't know if you would consider yourself a bitcoin maximalist. Obviously you run an exchange, so you're selling a bunch of different coins. But I was just curious, does this vindicate what bitcoin maximalists in particular, where they're more focused just on one coin, not just being a bitcoiner who also is interested in other coins? But specifically maximalists. Do you think that this vindicates them or what's your thought on that?
00:51:44.750 - 00:52:20.698, Speaker B: No, I don't think so. I mean, it doesn't vindicate anyone any more than someone who thinks that Tesla is the best car company and then the Bernie Madoff situation happens and a bunch of other investors who are not invested in Tesla get mean. This really doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin or the other coins or DeFi. This is just a straight up fraud, Ponzi theft. He could have been custodying anything. It could have been Pokemon cards or stocks or whatever. He just had custody of client assets and he stole them and that's it.
00:52:20.698 - 00:53:06.840, Speaker B: And it's unfortunate that the Bitcoin and crypto community are the victims here, but I think we need to keep repeating this for politicians so they don't come back to try to attack DeFi and crypto and say that somehow this proves that we need more regulation around DeFi. If anything, we need more regulation or better regulation around centralized venues, which I would love to hear from kevin, you said earlier you were getting shut out of other venues and so you became concentrated in FTX. Why were you getting shut out of other venues? And what was it that FTX was doing that for example, Kraken or Coinbase weren't doing which would have allowed you to kind of remain on shore in the US?
00:53:07.290 - 00:54:02.540, Speaker C: Yeah, so I mean, we were getting kicked off because we're basically a US based firm. And then I think there's been a lot of improvements know, the Kraken's sort of matching engine API and just overall systems. You know, one of the reasons we slowed down our trading earlier on was just know there was more liquidity on sort of like first of all on derivatives in general. And then second, it's nice to have being able to use any asset as collateral, that sort of thing. Just like fewer rejections, I think through the API and through the WebSockets. That being said, it's not like FTX was super great either, right, to use as a product because there were certain weird bursts of latency here and there. Sometimes their systems would fall over too and then going through the risk check in serial consumed up a lot of time, tens of milliseconds, maybe even hundreds sometimes.
00:54:02.540 - 00:54:54.278, Speaker C: I think it's just a sort of balance of considering all the different offerings between all the different exchanges. And I think there is something to be said that because FTX was kind of like a little bit skirting regulation, a little bit more than, let's say Kraken and Coinbase, they're able to kind of get away with listing some really random crazy stuff, right? Like all sorts of shitcoins and vault products and leverage tokens and all sorts of random stuff. And even though I don't particularly like any of those products or almost any of them still if there's trading and there is retail appetite or even institutional appetite, for those products, then I think market makers tend to think, well, then there must be money to be made there, so they'll bring some of their business over. So I think those are just some of the reasons.
00:54:54.454 - 00:55:44.860, Speaker A: Well, Jesse, so this leads me to a question to you, because as you just implied in your question to Kevin, I've seen a lot of people say that a big reason that this happened here is because regulators in the US. Have not come up with clear regulation here. The other kind of like, flip side of that argument is that leaving FTX us aside, we haven't seen a US exchange that has seen this level of fraud. And so in that sense, that's an argument in favor of the regulators who say like, oh, our existing laws work quite well and we don't need new laws. So it's kind of curious to hear your take on whether or not existing regulations have helped US. Customers or if you think this kind of lack of regulation that's specific to crypto has hurt US. Customers.
00:55:45.630 - 00:56:17.106, Speaker B: I think overall hurt. It basically forces people to go offshore for things that they otherwise would be able to get in the United States. Just take like futures trading, for example. It's not available in the United States. Trading certain tokens which the SEC would probably call securities, is not allowed in the United States, and there's no license to be able to do that whatsoever. It's not just a matter of getting the right license. There's no license.
00:56:17.106 - 00:56:57.378, Speaker B: And so the SEC would say, yeah, there's just no way to do this activity period in the US. Unless there's a change to the law which explicitly contemplates this new activity. So people are forced to go offshore because the domestic businesses are prevented from offering these services. And Coinbase even went to the SEC to ask them if they could offer this like three or 4% yield product. And it seemed like a very conservative product and the SEC rejected it, and so they weren't even able to launch that thing. Meanwhile, FTX is offering the same product basically with 10% yields from the Bahamas. And so if you're a US.
00:56:57.378 - 00:57:52.740, Speaker B: Client, why wouldn't you just go do that, right? Maybe you've been comfortable at your safe and secure domestic exchange in the United States, but there's this other exchange offshore that's offering 10% yields. So that's pretty attractive. And if the regulators aren't doing anything about that, we ask the regulators all the time when they hassle us about certain products or we try to get approval for certain products that our competitors are offering. Why aren't you guys going after, why are you preventing us from doing this, but you're also not going after the guys offshore that are doing it? And basically it comes down to laziness and convenience. And I think they don't recognize that by not shutting those guys off and at the same time preventing domestic businesses from. Doing that activity. They're basically forcing all of the consumers to go offshore to do what they want to do.
00:57:52.740 - 00:57:55.726, Speaker B: So it's like the worst of both worlds.
00:57:55.838 - 00:58:33.070, Speaker A: But one question about that, because both I and I saw, I forget who it was, it might have been Adam Cochrane or somebody. My thought was, oh, maybe all of this makes Coinbase feel better about the fact that they didn't end up launching the earn product because it shows kind of how risky it is to try to take customer funds and then earn yield on them. So what do you say about that? And then on the other hand, when you talk about how FTX was offering 10%, clearly the methods they were doing using to do that were risky.
00:58:33.890 - 00:59:22.938, Speaker B: They were loaning Alameda money. Yeah, they were certainly doing some very risky stuff. That was probably the most risky loan you could ever make, I think to get 3%, I think you can do in conservative reasonable ways without taking a lot of risk. They could even be doing it internally. Like Kraken has a margin program basically, right? So we have a pool of funds that go into the margin pool and clients are effectively borrowing that on the exchange to trade on margin. And we could easily offer 3% returns if we were able to open up funding the margin pool to clients because the margin rollovers are at like 20% a year or something like that. So we could easily do that without having to go outside of our system and without having to trust a third party that's all like kind of self contained.
00:59:22.938 - 01:00:15.540, Speaker B: And we have full over collateralization and liquidation control and all that stuff. So I think you can get numbers like that, especially in today's interest rate climate, without too much difficulty. But to even be prevented from offering something like that, even conservatively, it's a huge problem. And I think the regulators don't acknowledge that. And I think as a country we also need to understand what do we want our public policy to be here and what do we want our national objectives to be here with crypto. And if it's to own more of the crypto business and develop more of the crypto industry domestically, then we have to update these laws and then we have to do something for the good actors. We can't just say too bad when their offshore competitors are out competing because they're able to have a better product, because they're not enforced against.
01:00:15.990 - 01:01:08.734, Speaker C: I completely agree with know in some ways, even if the US government's goal was a little bit like against crypto, anti crypto, right, even then, strategically, doesn't it make sense for them to welcome as much business onshore as possible and then try and control things afterwards? Why be so aggressive about crypto in such early days and push everybody offshore, push all the businesses offshore, push all the users and consumers offshore. And then finally, when they do get some kind of like iron grip over their domestic crypto industry. 90% of it is already offshore. Right. Like what was the point of that? Even from their own incentives, even from their own goals. Right? So I definitely agree. I think government's generally been pretty heavy handed on regulation and a lot of it's not directed at crypto.
01:01:08.734 - 01:01:28.966, Speaker C: A lot of it is like legacy regulation that crypto maybe happens to fall under, but it's a little bit gray. But people want to be safe, so they don't want to mess up or anything like that. Right. So it just kind of shows just how far the system has come to where it is today, where it's just that hard to do business in the US. Which shouldn't be the case.
01:01:29.068 - 01:02:19.740, Speaker B: Yeah, there is a lot of gray area and the problem is that the regulators have largely taken the approach that anything gray is black and they want to kind of capture as much control as possible. And for the businesses, we've disagreed with regulators at times. We might think a product is completely okay and legal to offer and they will have a different interpretation because the fines available to them are so high. If we took them to court to try to prove our case, first of all, it might take years, but if they won, the fines available to them are just obscene. It could be something like $5,000 per transaction, which is counted as a trade or something like that. Which would they're like millions a day? So they potentially could be awarded some fine against us. It's like a trillion dollars.
01:02:19.740 - 01:02:36.640, Speaker B: So even fighting over just being able to offer a specific product could be existential for the whole business. The fine could blow up the whole business. And so what ends up happening is the companies will just not offer that product because it's not worth risking the whole business.
01:02:38.850 - 01:03:16.634, Speaker C: And I do particularly think that in spite of what happened at FTX, I do think having a loan book within an exchange is a good idea. In the sense that you can allow users to choose whether or not they want to take that risk and fully disclose all the risk to them and say that okay, we can do one of two things. We'll just keep your money, not rehypothecated, not loan it out. It just sits there and does nothing. Right, but you just take on absolutely no risk, completely segregated, or you can take a bit of risk, get that 3% yield, but if something catastrophic happens, we may or may not cover that loss. We may still just cover the loss, we still might just make you whole, but we may not. And these are some very weird tail situations that are possible.
01:03:16.634 - 01:03:48.942, Speaker C: Right, so I think as long as I think all these risks are kind of disclosed, then people can kind of choose for themselves what their risk appetite is, whether they want to be like, ultra conservative or try and get some yield out of their think. I don't think there's anything wrong with that kind of product. It's more just that, well, there was kind of like malfeasance at FTX, and then on top of that, that product wasn't well designed. If you can accept as collateral things that are just extremely illiquid, and when it comes time to liquidate certain loans, the borrowers post as collateral, then you're not able to do so without taking account equity values.
01:03:49.086 - 01:04:38.702, Speaker A: Yeah, actually it's funny because I was going to ask you what you thought was going to happen of crypto lending. I'll kind of throw out a few topics. You can sort of pick where you want to go with this, but we touched on the media a little bit. We have now touched on regulators, although I do think we could actually talk about that even more. One thing I also noticed was that, Jesse, you had a tweet thread about VCs missing red flags. And in general, I feel like there's this kind of constant tension we see in crypto, which started with these cyberpunk ideals, and then now these VCs have been very influential in the space, and we kind of see this tension just constantly play out. There was that whole phase a few years ago with the fair launch coins versus the VC coins, and obviously a lot of VCs right now are being reprimanded for their role here in what happened with FTX.
01:04:38.702 - 01:04:48.150, Speaker A: So all those things or crypto lending, you can take any topic that you want, but we'll maybe just have each one of you say a few last words, and it can be about any of those topics.
01:04:48.650 - 01:05:36.642, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So what I would say is that I don't quite believe the VCs on what they say on their word, because the VCs tend to benefit a lot from what happened, at least earlier on with FTX and the sam coins. Right. Like, if you're a VC and you're buddy buddy with SBF and you get allocation into all these different sam coins, then you yourself as a fund now get to mark up the book extremely high because the float is so low, FDV is so high. And then if you were to do distributions based on mark to market profits to investors in the token itself, right, so you issue out these distributions in the token itself, then you get to mark your carry at an extremely high overvalued price. Right. And this would be very different if they had to sell the token back down into dollars and then distribute the dollar profits to their limited partners.
01:05:36.642 - 01:06:12.242, Speaker C: Right. So there's a lot of this kind of synergistic, kind of symbiotic relationship between the VCs and sam just on the sam coins and then kind of on the FTX side. I think a lot of the VCs honestly are willing to overlook a lot of things because if you look at the Web Two playbook way back in the day with the.com bubble. A lot of these. There are these VCs that surely didn't think that there were some businesses that were good, but they still invested into them because they thought that the growth would be good enough that they could get it to the Soft Bank Round, that they could then get it to the public and then finally dump on the public. Right.
01:06:12.242 - 01:07:27.690, Speaker C: So it's not like crypto is unique in that sense of these games of people buying illiquid stuff and then with enough momentum, flipping it high enough to then dump it onto the public's head. Right? This has been the playbook for a lot of Web Two VCs for a long time already and now we're just seeing the crypto variation of that. Right, so like all these VCs, I don't really take them on their word because I think that there's a lot of mixed incentives as well as with the exchanges themselves too, right? Not just FTX, but exchanges in general. There's all these kind of dealings between the token market makers, so not like the principal market makers, but the ones that contract with the token projects and the exchanges who get listing fees. I mean, this is more like 2017, right, where it's just like it's literally in everybody's incentive that everybody makes money except for retail. And they all not even in a collusive or conspiratorial way, but just out of their own incentives, cooperate with each other to dump on retail as the inadvertent action, even though it's none of their goals to dump on retail. That is kind of national equilibrium outcome if they're all following their own interests and they all take a little piece of the pie.
01:07:27.690 - 01:07:42.426, Speaker C: Right, so I think you have a lot of this kind of behavior. It's not that they're outright colluding. It just so happens that their interests are aligned to dump on retail and then some people just don't say anything. It's not that they think it's right, it's just that, well, it benefits them so they don't say anything.
01:07:42.548 - 01:08:21.706, Speaker B: Yeah, there were some investors that passed on the FTX round and said that they saw some crazy things. Not all the investors share all this information, I think. Obviously they don't generally come out publicly when they spot something that looks like a fraud because they might be wrong. They don't want to get in trouble for disparaging somebody and get a lawsuit against them or something. And they don't want to burn the relationship with the founder. VCs try to preserve the relationship even if they pass, because they could always be wrong and they want another opportunity to come back later. And so maybe they weren't as critical as they should have been.
01:08:21.706 - 01:09:24.910, Speaker B: Maybe the worst case, they just didn't invest. But many investors took a look and I think were just either maybe they got some incentives in tokens that tipped the scales for them or maybe they were just FOMOing at the time and they saw this hockey stick. Growth from FTX, and they were used to investing in growth companies like Instagrams and social networks and chat apps and stuff like that. Where all that mattered was, like, your user growth and revenue. And there was not really any concern put toward the actual infrastructure of the business, like how secure it was or anything like that. Because worst case scenario for a photo sharing app is like, people get to steal the photos, which obviously has been pretty bad in some cases, but it's not like at the level of losing $10 billion, which was probably even more than the company was worth at the time, right? So that possibility exists in crypto for custodians that you can lose more money than your company is worth. I think VCs maybe didn't really appreciate that at the time.
01:09:24.910 - 01:10:25.746, Speaker B: I do want to touch on one other topic, which was the regulation. And I think we all have to come together as an industry right now and stop fighting about proof of work versus proof of stake, because politicians have just been like, salivating for an opportunity like this to attack crypto. And I think we need to just be totally clear that we're not willing to give up any ground in DFI and that this is 100% just a basic Bernie Madoff style fraud. And just as Bernie Madoff was not an indictment of the stock market or Wall Street, no one was calling for more controls on the stock market or Nasdaq after Bernie Madoff. We shouldn't be hearing that kind of stuff about crypto either. And if we are hearing that either someone's being intellectually dishonest or they're using this as just a fake reason to attack crypto. So we need to clear up anytime it's mentioned, we need to just clear that up and make sure that everyone understands this is a fraud on the crypto community.
01:10:25.746 - 01:10:46.860, Speaker B: It's not a fraud of crypto or by crypto. And so I'm very concerned about the political blowback that's coming here and it's going to land on the victims. Unfortunately, it's not going to be targeted in the right place, which is how do we actually help consumers get access to safer products.
01:10:48.110 - 01:11:31.286, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, if anything, this was a guy from TradFi coming into crypto, wrecking all the crypto people. So if anything, we're the ones who got attacked here by FTX and completely agree. Laura, actually, just I had one question for you, if you don't mind, which is, having had a career in media, what are your thoughts about why it's the case that SBF gets all these puff pieces in the media? But then the media goes out and just slams all the mainstream media goes out and slams Jesse and Brian at Coinbase and doesn't look upon them very favorably. Why do you think that that is the case from your own experiences in So?
01:11:31.308 - 01:12:13.730, Speaker A: So first of all, I consider myself to still be in media. Now I just have my own little media company. But the other thing that I would say is to not paint the media. It's not a monolithic thing. Obviously there are good reporters, bad reporters, just as know there's fraudulent exchanges, know, above board exchanges. What I would say is that I think in this particular case, I think probably you're talking about the New York Times piece that came out on SPF earlier this know, the main reporter on that, he's like three years out of college. And another big piece that he wrote on Sam was if he wants to go after the Salt Conference in the Bahamas in April.
01:12:13.730 - 01:13:20.762, Speaker A: And I think maybe at that time he had really kind know who didn't. I didn't read it again recently now, but my sense is like he probably spent a fair amount of time with him and had some sort of impression of him at that time and then maybe was just, like, a little bit slow on the uptake of just how much of a fraud this was. And maybe that's why the piece just seemed a lot more sympathetic than it probably should have know. I just maybe want to explain that one particular think, you know, for some of the other critical coverage. So Jesse probably knows when you underwent that, it sort of seemed like a bit of a what's words, like there was internal fighting at Kraken basically is what the story know that story probably like in general when people do stories and you probably even hear like comedians will say this, you don't punch down, you punch up. Which isn't to say that every reporter goes in being like, oh, I'm going to take down the people in charge. But it's more like you want to try to give voice to people who maybe are the ones who have less power.
01:13:20.762 - 01:13:55.894, Speaker A: So maybe in any kind of conflict, that is what will happen. And so maybe that's why those pieces might have come across as like, oh, the Times is like attacking Jesse or attacking Brian or whatever. That's probably maybe another way to look at it. Obviously I don't work at the Times. I don't even know a ton about what happened in those situations other than what I read there. But maybe that is one way that I would look at it. One thing that I do want to say because obviously the media, like Forbes, who I used to work, put SPF on the COVID fortune did as well.
01:13:55.894 - 01:14:48.598, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I don't remember if I read both of those pieces. Sometimes one of those things like you see one of those pieces, you're like, I'll save it for later and know you don't get to finish it. When you are doing this kind of work, there are certain markers that you look at of legitimacy. And the VC backing that Sam had would probably check that box off for you, like Sequoia being very closely affiliated with you, that's like, oh, this is one of the best. It's a VC firm that does its due diligence or whatever. There are certain shortcuts that you take, or I shouldn't even call it a shortcut, but it's more like when you see so many stamps of approval, it kind of gives you a sense of what the quality of this person or their enterprise is. So that's another way maybe that I could explain all of that that happened.
01:14:48.598 - 01:15:29.126, Speaker A: But when it comes down to it, I really think the situation, frankly, was that at least so far, we know that only four people knew about like I have talked to know, high ranking people at FTX. They were just completely blindsided. They did not know. So I think when you just have that kind of secret, that's something that it's going to be hard for that to come out. And the last bit I'll say is that I can't remember if I said this on the show previously, so for listeners who maybe heard know, you could skip ahead. But I had been tipped off to a few things about Sam previously. Nothing related to this, just other things.
01:15:29.126 - 01:15:54.030, Speaker A: And when I had tried to get people to talk to me about it, nobody wanted to talk to me. Because Sam was a gazillionaire. He was very powerful in the industry. They were worried about their careers. They would worry that he could bury them in the ground with a tiny little lawsuit that would be super difficult for them to defend, but easy for him to just spend a bunch of money on. People just weren't willing to talk. And so it's just fascinating to me.
01:15:54.030 - 01:16:40.346, Speaker A: And granted, like I said, the tips that I got were not related to this. But still, it's like what happened with Harvey Weinstein, that story took decades to come out, even though apparently that whole time it was an open secret in Hollywood that he would prey on young actresses. This right. So at that time, again, because he was so powerful, people did not want to speak to the media, even though everybody knew this was happening. And when you have that kind of threat from someone, it's hard for everyday people to be the ones to step forward and talk to the media. So that's another reason why I do see a lot of blame going to the media. And yet I feel like there's just a lack of awareness of all the hurdles that you need to go through as a reporter to be able to publish that kind of thing.
01:16:40.346 - 01:17:15.554, Speaker A: And not only does it start with sources being unwilling to talk to you, but it ends with the publisher maybe not wanting to publish it or the lawyer at the publication being know, we can't do this reason. Like, I can't remember for the Harvey Weinstein one, there was a previous reporter, I think it was ken alletta at The New Yorker, and he just couldn't get across the finish line. He had done a ton of reporting, he couldn't get across the finish line. He ended up giving his notes to Ronan Farrow, which, that's crazy. If I spent a bunch of time, I definitely wouldn't want to give my notes to another reporter. That's like, competing with me. That's terrible.
01:17:15.554 - 01:17:41.374, Speaker A: But at that point, Ken Aletta was just like, wow, I have been trying to get this guy for years. Like, a lot of people have been trying to get this guy for years. You're closer, like, we should get this over the finish line. I'm going to give you some help. And so even when the Dow attacker thing, people have asked me, why didn't you name the Dow attacker in your book? Like, you eventually publish it, but it's not in the book. And if you read my book, it's twelve chapters. Four of them are all about the Dow attack.
01:17:41.374 - 01:18:55.000, Speaker A: And yet I knew who it was. I'm not going to give too much information what happened there, but that just goes to show, even though I had great evidence, the thought was, let's put this in a publication that is used to dealing with this kind of situation, because book publishers, they just pretty much never have that kind of thing on their hands. And yet, yes, I published in Forbes, but you don't know how many publications I pitched before then. And I had people coming back to me saying things like, oh, well, how do we know that this isn't a case? Like one Newsweek named Doria Nakamoto, Satoshi Nakamoto. And I didn't want to give all my information away either, because what if they steal? But like, I knew how good my evidence was and it's know, thankfully, just because of how much my Forbes editors and I, we trust each we like, have worked together for a long time and so know were we'll, we'll do, we, we trust you. And they verified all the evidence and then they were like, yeah, this is strong, doing that kind of work, it takes so much. And like I said, just all these people will put up little roadblocks or little hurdles for you to pass along the way.
01:18:55.000 - 01:19:25.230, Speaker A: When I see all these tweets being like, the media should have figured this out, I'm like, okay, you guys, you just should understand what it takes to do this kind of work and actually get it into print. That is the really hard part. Which is not to say the media was perfect in any regard, but the media never is. I mean, it's one of the hardest jobs. You're publicly performing all the time and people just will criticize you the moment that you publish your work.
01:19:25.380 - 01:19:26.286, Speaker B: No, I appreciate that.
01:19:26.308 - 01:19:28.420, Speaker C: No, I totally understand. Makes sense.
01:19:29.590 - 01:19:42.614, Speaker A: Okay, well, anyway, this has been so amazing. I know we're like way over time, but you guys, this has been awesome. Why don't you each tell people where they can learn more about you and your work?
01:19:42.732 - 01:19:51.066, Speaker B: All right. I'm Jesse Powell. You can learn more about me on Twitter. My handle is at. Jess Powell. J-E-S-P-O-W. Yeah.
