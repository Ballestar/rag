00:00:00.170 - 00:00:53.770, Speaker A: At the entire market for art in aggregate, 99% of its absolute hot garbage. That's worth zero, right? And almost there's like 500,000 struggling artists in America who are all making crap art and like, one or two that are really successful and famous at any given time. And I think NFPs are just going to play out like that in that people are going to realize that most of this is absolute garbage and that most people are not good artists and almost all of this is not enjoyable. And there will be things that stand the test of time and are amazing and people really, genuinely love and have a lot going for it. But I think we're at the phase of NFTs where we're still increasing the saturation and quantity of it, where every single, single day there's more and more projects, most of which are just hot garbage and worthless.
