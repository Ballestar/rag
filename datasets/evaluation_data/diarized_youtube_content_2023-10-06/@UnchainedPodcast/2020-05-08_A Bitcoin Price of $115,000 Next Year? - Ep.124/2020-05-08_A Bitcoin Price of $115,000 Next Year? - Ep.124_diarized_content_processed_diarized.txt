00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.734, Speaker A: You.
00:00:00.852 - 00:01:04.930, Speaker B: Hey guys, this is a personal note from me. I was in a documentary that I think might be of interest to you all. It's called cryptopia, bitcoin blockchains and the future of the internet. And it was finally released after the cinema world tour was canceled due to COVID-19. Join the award winning filmmaker Torsten Hoffman, who made bitcoin the end of money as we know it in 2014 as he dives deep into the crypto ecosystem and blockchain technology and discovers the good, the bad and the ugly of this movement and the people behind it. Can we really trust them to build this trustless cyber utopia? Or are their projects just as unfairly distributed and easily manipulated as our current financial systems and tech platforms? Cryptopia film was filmed on four continents over two years and features many of the big brains and big egos of this controversial industry, including Andreas Antonopoulos, myself, Laura shin, Wences casaris, charlie lee, vitalik Buterin, Prithi cassaretti, dr. Robert khan, roger ver, samson moe, and many others.
00:01:04.930 - 00:01:14.740, Speaker B: Be sure to check it out at WW cryptopiafilm.com. Again, that's WW cryptopiafilm.com.

00:01:44.106 - 00:01:45.290, Speaker C: Welcome, dan.
00:01:45.450 - 00:01:47.214, Speaker A: Laura, thanks for having me back.
00:01:47.412 - 00:01:59.454, Speaker C: Your april 30 newsletter was a sobering read. It went into detail about the economic impact of the coronavirus and talked about some of these big macroeconomic trends.
00:01:59.582 - 00:02:00.866, Speaker B: You said that you thought it was.
00:02:00.888 - 00:02:03.154, Speaker C: Clear that this recession wouldn't be v.
00:02:03.192 - 00:02:06.094, Speaker B: Shaped and Kathy wood of arkinfest actually.
00:02:06.152 - 00:02:08.086, Speaker C: Came on unchained recently and said she.
00:02:08.108 - 00:02:09.046, Speaker B: Thought it would be.
00:02:09.148 - 00:02:10.354, Speaker C: So why do you think we won't.
00:02:10.402 - 00:02:13.426, Speaker B: See a v shaped recovery?
00:02:13.618 - 00:03:26.570, Speaker A: So v shaped recessions and recoveries happen when there's some kind of exogenous shock and everything returns to normal right after it. And we've seen that with either massive natural disasters or september 11 where everything stopped for a very short period of time and then life as it resumed very quickly thereafter. And in this case, we have this physical and invisible barrier to commerce which we're still trying to contain and fight and that is going to probably persist for quite some time. And it prohibits people from going out and doing the usual commerce that they would typically do. And so unfortunately, I don't see it bouncing quickly back. And then secondly, that virus has created essentially a psychological dimension to this. And so even if a panel of experts said this thing is contained and gave everyone the thumbs up, go back out and resume your life as normal, I think it's going to take a while for people to get the confidence to want to get in a crowded airplane or go into a movie theater.
00:03:26.570 - 00:04:05.900, Speaker A: And then one of the silver linings of this is people may have learned new positive attributes to life and they'll realize, hey, maybe I really just don't need to travel for these business meetings and I can doing them on Zoom. Or maybe I don't need to consume as much as I used to consume because actually it's nice just kind of hanging out with the kids. I think it's going to be a very slow bounce back. And we even saw in the 2008 nine recession, it took three years to achieve the same level of absolute GDP as before the recession. And I think this one, unfortunately, is going to be somewhat similar.
00:04:06.670 - 00:04:26.580, Speaker C: And so you mentioned also in the newsletter that you expect the recovery will resemble an L. So what does that look like in practice? Like, what businesses do you think will be able to open or won't be affected as much? What will people be doing? How do you expect things to look kind of maybe a year or two out?
00:04:27.110 - 00:05:08.702, Speaker A: Yeah. So one of the things we profiled in our letter is the dynamics of school. And with so many, with basically almost I think there's one school in rural California that's open right now, but with the other 5000 schools in the United States closed, all those kids are at home. And so parents are responsible for their children. And according to the BLS, 40% of American families have a child under 18 at home. So almost half of American families have a youngster at home. And then the surprising thing is, even when both parents work, even when in married households, 64%, both parents work.
00:05:08.702 - 00:05:49.980, Speaker A: So that there's no kind of flexibility there. And 93% of men with kids under 18 are in the workforce, and even 72% of women are in the workforce. So basically it means everybody with a kid is in the workforce. And so it's going to be very difficult to restart the economy before you restart the schools. And that's one of the impediments. There's several like that. So I think with the psychological impacts and with these kind of practical impacts that it's hard for parents to get back to work if the schools and daycare centers aren't open yet, it's going to mean a very slow recovery coming out of this.
00:05:50.510 - 00:05:56.270, Speaker C: How do you think the government's response in terms of monetary and fiscal policy will affect the recovery?
00:05:56.690 - 00:06:22.966, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is a global exam. Every country is trying their own mix of policies. And so you're seeing some countries, like before the show, we were chatting about Korea, which has done an amazing job containing the virus and essentially eliminating new cases. And then there's 200 other different policy mixes out there. I'm citizen of the US. And I work in the US. So I know the most about the US.
00:06:22.966 - 00:07:38.058, Speaker A: And in the US, the policy mix is much more centered on fiscal stimulus. And that impacts my job as a cryptocurrency trader because as you create enormous amounts of new paper money, it essentially devalues the paper money relative to fixed asset things like gold or stocks or cryptocurrency. And the scale really is such an extent that I don't have adjectives for it. The deficit in the United States is about twelve and a half percent of GDP of fiscal stimulus on top of what was already a very large structural deficit. And so firms like JPMorgan are forecasting the deficit for this year will be 19.5%. And everyone out there trying to throw adjectives like unprecedented or whatever, it's really hard to get your head around that. To my mind, the easiest way to get a sense of how staggering it is is that deficit is larger than the widest deficits during the Great Depression, and it's even larger than the average deficits the US incurred fighting World War II.
00:07:38.058 - 00:07:42.510, Speaker A: So these are really staggering size to deficits.
00:07:43.250 - 00:08:14.060, Speaker C: You lived and traded in Japan in the early 1990s as they entered what became their lost decade. And you wrote in your newsletter, I've watched with professional fascination as the bank of Japan invented QE ZIRP and buying equities with printed money. Lots of interesting stories and a few current thoughts, but TLDR not a pretty picture for their currency. And then you wrote hashtag buy Bitcoin. Can you elaborate on what you saw there and what you think that means for today?
00:08:14.590 - 00:09:01.062, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a great example. They have led the rest of the developed world into what is now ubiquitous quantitative easing, essentially printing now unlimited amounts of money, the zero interest rate policy that they enacted in 1990. And then they went on to start trying to prop up their equity market. They had a price keeping operation. That's what they called it. I still actually don't know what the policy goal of fixing equity prices is supposed to do for the whole citizenry. Obviously it's great for shareholders, but if the US follows down that path, or other developed countries follow down that path, I really think it has lots of policy implications.
00:09:01.062 - 00:09:53.414, Speaker A: And you could talk about the fact that in the United States there's three Americans that have more wealth than half of Americans combined. So the distribution of wealth is very inequitable. And so there's all kinds of very interesting policy questions about whether it's a correct objective to set equity prices as a policy objective. But if you do do that, the impact it has on my world as a currency trader is it takes trillions of dollars to do that. And that has already had its effect. We've seen that with the US stock market is now up on where it was May 31 of last year. So this massive inflow of money is supporting equities, but it also has to support other fixed quantity things like gold or Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
00:09:53.414 - 00:10:32.578, Speaker A: And what we saw in the Japan case, in the currency specifically, is as they keep printing more and more Japanese yen, the value of each one of those yen, relative to other things, like other countries, currencies, has to debase or devalue. And the graph that we put in our investor letter shows the price of the Japanese yen adjusted for inflation and weighted against all of their trading partners. So it's kind of a single price of the yen going down from 140 units on an index down to about 75. And so they lost almost 50% of the value of their currency over that time period.
00:10:32.754 - 00:10:52.880, Speaker C: Wow. So obviously I can see how that would fuel your buy Bitcoin hashtag. But one other thing I saw in your March newsletter is you at that time said that you thought Tokens would outperform Venture, and I was curious, why did you think that? And then how has that thesis borne out?
00:10:53.570 - 00:11:35.946, Speaker A: Sure. So when we wrote our investor letter in kind of the week after the crisis started in mid March, we made a short term forecast that Tokens would outperform Venture. And that has actually happened, and we think it'll probably continue for the next few months. And the reason being, tokens have the unique characteristic amongst all software protocols in having a real time price feed. That's sometimes a really good thing, sometimes a bad thing that everyone focuses on the price of Bitcoin or the price of ETH or the price of XRP when they really are multidecade projects. And maybe we shouldn't obsess about the short term movements, but we do have that. And so they reset very quickly.
00:11:35.946 - 00:12:44.000, Speaker A: On March twelveTH, cryptocurrencies went down almost 50%. So you get an instantaneous price reset, whereas Venture is kind of asynchronous that you have a whole bunch of sellers of Venture, the developers or entrepreneurs who are building companies who don't reset in their valuations as quickly as the buyers. And so when you have a crisis like this, you essentially get a period where very few transactions actually happen. And it's very analogous to the residential housing market that when you have a bubble in housing and the bubble pops and the buyers bids all go, say, down 20 or 30%, you basically have a period of several months while the sellers are kind of getting their heads around the new lower prices. And so you have a very low transaction amount for a couple of months and then everything resets and gets going. And we think that's basically happening in Venture, that with the financial markets in turmoil, prices will probably reset much lower, but it's going to take two or three or four months for that all to kind of work its way through the system.
00:12:44.690 - 00:13:11.510, Speaker C: In a moment, we'll further dive into Crypto during the time of Coronavirus. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. In response to the challenging times, crypto.com is introducing three measures to help the community. First, the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months. Second, you can now get up to 10% back by using the MCO visa card on food and grocery shopping.
00:13:11.670 - 00:13:13.498, Speaker B: Lastly, you could buy gift cards on.
00:13:13.504 - 00:13:28.990, Speaker C: The crypto.com app from merchants like whole foods, safeway, burger king, and more, and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries. Download the crypto.com app today. Back to my conversation with dan moorhead.
00:13:29.330 - 00:13:30.526, Speaker B: There was a time when it was.
00:13:30.548 - 00:13:39.554, Speaker C: Thought that crypto assets were an uncorrelated asset, but obviously, as we saw on march twelveTH, now dubbed black thursday, that.
00:13:39.592 - 00:13:41.234, Speaker B: Seemed no longer to be the case.
00:13:41.352 - 00:13:50.310, Speaker C: So do you think that since then crypto has been uncorrelated, or has it been correlated? And why do you think that at least on that day it was correlated?
00:13:50.890 - 00:14:51.686, Speaker A: Laura that's a super important question, and one of our main arguments for advocating crypto as a new and important asset class is that it does have essentially zero, and this is the important adjective, long term correlation with all other asset classes. Historical correlation between bitcoin and equities gold, commodities, bonds is 0.8, so very close to zero. The important caveat, though, is in times of very stressed, risk aversion markets, bitcoin does become correlated. And there have been five examples of this since bitcoin was first traded, where the s p's had a very large down move, and bitcoin has been correlated for a short period of time. And that's the key here. According to our analysis, it's averaged 31 days, where it's been highly correlated.
00:14:51.686 - 00:15:24.514, Speaker A: And then over a period of 70 days, that correlation kind of tapers back down to essentially zero. And then after that, they start to trade independently. And that was our view in our march investor letter. And that's still our view, that bitcoin was highly correlated for about a month, and that's true. Its correlation was about 0.8 over the first 30 days after march twelveTH. But that that correlation will slowly dissipate, and it's supposed to happen over 71 days on average, and that's actually happening right now.
00:15:24.514 - 00:15:56.574, Speaker A: We're almost at that period. And so we can see a regime going forward where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not very well correlated with the s and p. And you're actually seeing that now. Bitcoin is up 23% year to date, and the equity markets are still way down, and all the other asset classes like oil, are getting crushed. So bitcoin is decoupling from the s and p, and then we think over the next couple of years, you could see an environment where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies go up a ton, and maybe equities go down over the next couple of years.
00:15:56.772 - 00:16:14.820, Speaker C: And during your answer just now, you were occasionally singling out bitcoin, and I wondered if bitcoin in particular has behaved differently even from the broader crypto market. And I was curious to know what your view was on that and how the rest of the crypto market would perform.
00:16:15.510 - 00:16:55.326, Speaker A: Yeah, that as well is a really important distinction. Bitcoin has typically performed better in crises than the rest of the market. And the measure of bitcoin's market share, called bitcoin dominance, has on average gone up 7.8 percentage points in a crisis. So in those five big S and P crises before, bitcoin dominance has gone up, and that typically has lasted an average of four months. And then it kind of dissipates again. And we believe that's going to be a smaller impact this time for a handful of reasons.
00:16:55.326 - 00:17:35.040, Speaker A: But we think bitcoin will go up, and it started this crisis at about 62.5% bitcoin dominance, and it's now around 68%. So it has gone up 5.5%. And it's been about two months since the crisis really started. It might persist for another month or two and then at that point, we think the essentially non bitcoin tokens will start regaining market share. So in our own trading, we did overweight bitcoin in the middle of March, and we still hold that position, but we are certainly very conscious that at some point in the next month or two, we're going to reverse that.
00:17:35.970 - 00:17:51.380, Speaker C: And there's a more short term event that everybody's looking forward to, which is the having next week. What do you expect to happen? Both kind of like immediately after the having as well as further into the future.
00:17:52.070 - 00:18:31.342, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a fun one. Everyone gets super excited about it. And then the having in 2012 and 16, everybody got really excited. And in those cases, they were right. It caused a huge change in the markets. And so you can have people that would say, theoretically, if efficient markets theory holds, and we all know this is going to happen, and we've known this having is going to happen for ten years because bitcoin's money supply is fixed and known, it should all be priced into the market. But there's this great line attributed, Warren Buffett, that goes against that dogma saying that the markets are almost always efficient, but the difference between almost and always is worth 80 billion to me.
00:18:31.342 - 00:19:12.190, Speaker A: And that's my view, is that some things that we all know are going to happen still do actually impact the markets. And in this case, I think it's really easy to visualize how this would happen. All the money supply of bitcoin is issued to the miners who provide the security and transaction processing and they sell all their bitcoins to buy faster chips and more electricity and more rack space. Right. So they're in this constant arms race to keep growing. So every bitcoin that comes in, they sell. If that number, which is the supply of bitcoins, gets cut in half and demand is constant, if we go back to our Econ 101, it's going to drive the price up.
00:19:12.190 - 00:19:49.320, Speaker A: And that has actually happened. And the past doesn't guarantee the future. So we only have two data points. So with that caveat, the past two havings have had a really large impact on the price, but it's diminishing, and I think it will diminish again this time. And we published some interesting stats in our investor letter, where in the previous two havings, the market for bitcoin bottomed on average 459 days before the having. So a year and a bit before the having. And then it kind of ground up into the having.
00:19:49.320 - 00:20:43.622, Speaker A: And that's done at this time, the market bottomed about a year and a bit ago, 514 days exactly ago, and the market's up 168% since it bottomed as we come into this having. And that's roughly in line with the past havings. The interesting bit, though, is what happens after the having. And in the previous two, the markets exploded to the upside after the having. And we put a new type of analysis where we're analyzing the stock to flow ratio in bitcoin in our letter, and I think it actually explains a lot of what happened in the past and might give us some insight what's going to happen in the future. And all the data is in our letter, but just the summary is in the first having, we were going from 50 bitcoins every ten minutes to 25. And at the time we didn't really have that many bitcoins outstanding, so it was a really big impact.
00:20:43.622 - 00:21:23.910, Speaker A: There were only 10 million bitcoins outstanding at the time, and we were cutting the supply over the next 446 days, which is the typical period of the rally, by over 1.6 million bitcoins. So that was over 15% of the outstanding supply was being reduced or cut in the having. So the market exploded up in the second having in 2016. Obviously, we're only cutting half as many out because that's the whole point of a having. So we're only cutting out twelve and a half bitcoins every ten minutes. And at the time, we had 15 million bitcoins outstanding, so there's 50% more bitcoins and 50% less being cut.
00:21:23.910 - 00:21:53.934, Speaker A: So it impacted the outstanding supply by only 5%. So it was one third of the impact. And then this having, of course, is half as big as the last one. And now we have 18 million bitcoins, so there's even more outstanding bitcoins, so it'll only be a 2.2% impact on the supply of bitcoins. And those ratios actually match the ratios in the rallies. The first rally was 3.2
00:21:53.934 - 00:22:32.320, Speaker A: times bigger than the second one. And so if all this holds, and again, obviously there's huge caveats on whether the past does predict the future, but if those relationships hold, the rally here would be about 40% as big as the previous one in 2016, and that would imply bitcoin going to $115,000 per bitcoin. And I recognize that sounds absolutely ludicrous to most people today, but our first price estimate of 5000 sounded ludicrous when we were at 65. And I think all I'm saying is it's way more than a 50 50 chance that bitcoin goes up over the next year and a half.
00:22:32.930 - 00:23:11.210, Speaker C: Wow. Yeah, I mean, that is a huge number. And yet at the same time, the graph, when you look at this kind of stock to flow ratio and then also map it onto the history, it is true that it does seem to fit, at least broadly, roughly. So who knows? We'll see what happens. So one other thing I wanted to ask about was you also did mention in your newsletter that venture investing in crypto during the crisis. Well, I just want to ask you, how has that been affected during this crisis?
00:23:12.190 - 00:23:41.170, Speaker A: So it'll be fascinating to see how it plays out. We're only seven weeks into this. I would think the number of transactions go down very steeply. So there's a lot of investors that are pulling back and not wanting to invest until essentially all the dust settles and they see where it is. We're actually much more kind of constructive or engaged. And so we've done four transactions since the crisis began, a couple directly with companies. We're going to announce one tomorrow.
00:23:41.170 - 00:24:37.910, Speaker A: And then we are also adding to positions we already have in the secondary market from early investors that need some liquidity for other reasons. And we have featured a table in our investor letter from Cambridge Associates, one of the largest advisors in the space, in the endowment space. That confirms the intuition that venture investing after a crisis is actually the very best time. And it goes through the ten years of venture prior to the last crisis. So 1999 to 2008, those had an average IRR of 6.28. And then the years directly after the crisis, the ones that could buy assets at much cheaper prices, those are the ones that had very high teens and sometimes 20 plus IRRs. And the average return of the post crisis vintages was 18.21.
00:24:37.910 - 00:24:54.714, Speaker A: And I think that's going to repeat itself within venture generally. But then we're obviously only interested in the blockchain sector and so we're very excited about investing in venture now because we think prices will be cheaper and returns will be higher over the next four or five years.
00:24:54.912 - 00:25:04.800, Speaker C: And last quick question before we go. Stablecoins have seen a lot of growth during this crisis, but how would you say that business model will do with interest rates at or near zero?
00:25:05.330 - 00:26:17.006, Speaker A: Yeah, so stablecoins really have finally come into their own and we follow our portfolio company circles. Stablecoin USDC, and that increased 60% after the crisis began. So the outstanding issuance of USDC has exploded because people want to use it either to store their wealth or to have a very instantaneous transactional currency. And I think their usage will really grow throughout this because if you think back to the last crisis, would you rather have your savings in the Lehman Brothers of 2020 or a token you control which is fully backed by US Treasuries. And I think more and more people will realize that a stablecoin backed by US Treasuries is going to be way more safe than any kind of levered finance firm. The business model such as it is for things like Libra or USDC is to retain essentially the float off of the government debt securities that they own. And I'm a firm believer that the zero interest rate policy is going to be with us for at least a long time, if not forever.
00:26:17.006 - 00:26:33.530, Speaker A: And so it will reduce the income, basically, of these stablecoin projects. That doesn't make them any less likely to happen. They're certainly going to happen because they have a ton of utility, but the companies that sponsor these stablecoin projects will probably earn less revenue.
00:26:34.830 - 00:26:50.640, Speaker C: All right, well, we'll see how this all plays out. And I have to say, after listening to you, I definitely would say this probably does sound bullish for bitcoin, but it sounds like also we'll have to wait at least, I don't know, what do you think, 18 months before we'll know?
00:26:52.210 - 00:27:11.800, Speaker A: I've been fascinated by this for nine years. This is the time, right? Over the next two years, I think we're really going to see Blockchain prove itself. So for all of us that have been in a community like you and for all these years, I'm really excited we're really going to see this stuff play out over the next couple of years.
00:27:12.890 - 00:27:21.334, Speaker C: All right, great. Well, I hope the listeners stick around for the ride. Thank you so much for coming on the show. It's been great having you on, unconfirmed.
00:27:21.462 - 00:27:22.780, Speaker A: Laura, thanks so much.
00:27:23.230 - 00:28:15.962, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, time for your favorite crypto news recap ahead of the bitcoin having. There was a lot of bitcoin news. First up, hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones buys bitcoin futures. Billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones published a Macro Outlook newsletter about the Coronavirus and what he calls the Great Monetary Inflation GMI, and he defines it as, quote, an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen. In the newsletter, he writes about how, while wondering which assets would become more prominent due to the Great Monetary Inflation, he thought of bitcoin. Quote, it falls into the category of a store of value, and it has the added bonus of being semitransactional in nature. The average bitcoin transaction takes around 60 minutes to complete, which makes it near money.
00:28:15.962 - 00:29:18.986, Speaker B: It must compete with other stores of value, such as financial assets, gold and fiat currency, and less liquid ones such as art, precious stones and land. The question facing every investor is what will be the winner in ten years time? At the end of the day, the best profit maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse, just own the best performer, and not get wed to an intellectual side that might leave you weeping into performance dust because you thought you were smarter than the market.
