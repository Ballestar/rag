00:00:00.970 - 00:00:55.850, Speaker A: Vitalik. Buterin's book Proof of Stake comes out today. Although Vitalik is most well known for being the creator of Ethereum, he started out in crypto as a Bitcoin writer, a really good one at that. It's funny, because as I wrote about in my book The Cryptopians, even though Vitalik is thought of as a technical person today, one of his friends told me that when he first met Vitalik, vitalik was manning the Bitcoin magazine booth at a conference. And so even when Vitalik told this person that he was also interested in technical matters, this friend thought, yeah, right, and pegged him as just a magazine person. Most people now would say that Vitalik's writing shows the depth of his understanding of crypto, as he wouldn't be able to explain so many concepts clearly otherwise. For all these reasons, this compendium of the Talek's writing over the years shows the development of one of its most respected minds.
