00:00:00.090 - 00:00:06.878, Speaker A: This is a classic bank run, and when the bank run starts, you don't want to be the last guy there and wondering what happened.
00:00:06.964 - 00:00:21.450, Speaker B: This has been a doozy of a week for banks with a significant crypto customer base. Silvergate Capital, its massive bet on crypto continues to unravel, and the other one is Silicon Valley Bank after Silvergate's fall on Wednesday. Now, Silicon Valley Bank has been closed by regulators.
00:00:21.530 - 00:00:28.182, Speaker A: Unfortunately, this is the way banks work. They rely on trust. When they lose that trust, bad things really will happen.
00:00:28.316 - 00:01:13.858, Speaker B: On Friday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that regulators have taken control of the bank's deposits. In short, depositors will be able to access their deposits no later than Monday morning, at which time the bank's branch offices will reopen. The crisis at SVB began after its parent company announced the sale of $21 billion in securities from its portfolio and said it was conducting a $2.25 billion stock sale to bolster its finances. SVB's shares plummeted 60% on Thursday, and its bonds saw record declines. SVB's CEO Greg Becker held a conference call with bank clients, including venture capital investors, urging them to, quote, stay calm in an attempt to avoid a run on the bank. Clearly, that didn't happen.
00:01:13.858 - 00:01:20.434, Speaker B: Friday morning, CNBC reported that the bank was in talks to sell itself after its attempt to raise capital had failed.
00:01:20.482 - 00:01:31.226, Speaker C: There are large financial institutions who've looked at this bank for some time who are at least considering taking a look. Does it mean that anything will happen? Absolutely not.
00:01:31.328 - 00:01:59.170, Speaker B: Nick Carter of Castle Island Ventures tweeted if SVB does fail, it would be the second largest bank failure in history, not far behind Washington Mutual, which collapsed in 2008 with around $307,000,000,000 in assets. It would be a titanic event, not just limited to startups or VC. What's next? Startups withdrawing funds are looking for other banks, while investors and financial companies will be closely monitoring other banks that may also be affected by the turmoil.
00:01:59.590 - 00:02:15.462, Speaker D: Circle announced that SVB was one of the six banks it used to store the 25% of USDC reserves held in cash. Late Friday, the block reported that the total held there was $3.3 billion of the $40 billion of USDC reserves after.
00:02:15.516 - 00:02:17.746, Speaker B: Hitting a low of $0.88 overnight.
00:02:17.858 - 00:02:23.234, Speaker D: By early Saturday morning, the price of USDC was just shy of $0.92.
00:02:23.362 - 00:02:31.680, Speaker B: How will this affect the struggling crypto ecosystem? It's still too early to draw conclusions, but one thing is certain the short term outlook is not good.
