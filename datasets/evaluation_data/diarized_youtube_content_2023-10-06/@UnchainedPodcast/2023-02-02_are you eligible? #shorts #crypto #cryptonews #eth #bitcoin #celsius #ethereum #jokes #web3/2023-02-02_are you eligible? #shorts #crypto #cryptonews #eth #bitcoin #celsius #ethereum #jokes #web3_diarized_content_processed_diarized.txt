00:00:00.250 - 00:00:30.642, Speaker A: Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius. Not to be confused with the energy drink Celsius, which, unlike the crypto lender, will at least temporarily boost your mood, filed a 1419 page court filing on Tuesday stating that eligible users will soon be allowed to withdraw about 94% of their assets. That's like the length of two Lord of the Rings books said way too many of Celsius's creditors. You guys know, they they make books for adults now. This should be good news. I mean, 94% also sounds like a lot. Unless, of course, it's your assets.
00:00:30.642 - 00:00:59.450, Speaker A: For what it's worth, I think it's possible that we share, like, 94% of our DNA with the toaster oven for just a couple of tiny catches. Transfers need to be less than $7,575 when they were first made. You also need enough money on the platform to cover your gas and transaction fees. You need to update your customer information, and you need to be at least five eight oh, wait, sorry. I'm thinking in my Inch, users will find out whether or not they're ready to start the withdrawal process on February 15. That's right. Some single Celsius users are about to have two very dark days in a row.
