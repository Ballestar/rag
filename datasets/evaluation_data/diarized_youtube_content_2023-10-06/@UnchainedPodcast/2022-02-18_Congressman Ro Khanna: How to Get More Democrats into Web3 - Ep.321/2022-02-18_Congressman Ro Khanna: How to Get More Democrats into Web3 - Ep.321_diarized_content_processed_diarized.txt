Today's guest is California Congressman Ro Khana from Silicon Valley. An author of Dignity in a Digital Age making tech work for all of us.
00:03:21.808 - 00:03:22.122, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:03:22.176 - 00:03:23.530, Speaker A: Congressman Kana.
00:03:24.050 - 00:03:26.800, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Laura, for having me on.
00:03:27.650 - 00:03:39.410, Speaker A: You're one of the congressmen who has introduced numerous crypto bills in the house and you're also a member of the blockchain caucus. How did you become interested in crypto and why are you a supporter?
00:03:40.790 - 00:04:16.490, Speaker B: First of all, a lot of the innovators in the crypto space are in silicon valley in my district. So I've seen the impact on job creation. I've seen the utility that crypto has in terms of expediting transactions in terms of decentralization. Web 3.0 to me is actually beyond crypto. It's about this philosophy of decentralizing people's participation in the economy. I've seen the prospect of what it can mean for the unbanked.
00:04:16.490 - 00:04:20.000, Speaker B: So that's why it's something that I support.
00:04:20.770 - 00:04:37.860, Speaker A: And that thesis actually comes out in your recently published book dignity in a digital age. You talk about spreading out jobs, digital jobs, in a way. Can you just talk a little bit more about that theme of decentralization and also how it relates to the thesis of your book?
00:04:38.470 - 00:05:13.706, Speaker B: Absolutely. The thesis of the book is there's $11 trillion of market cap in Silicon Valley in the surrounding areas, 25 million digital jobs in a few big cities expected to be in a few big cities, and that we have to decentralize it. That we need communities that are left out to participate in modern wealth generation. That we need black and brown communities to participate in modern wealth generation. So decentralization will allow people not to have to leave their hometown, will allow more people to participate, will reduce some of the tensions. And web 3.0 is all about decentralization.
00:05:13.706 - 00:05:54.350, Speaker B: It's saying you don't have to have the concentration of economic power in just a few places, new York or silicon valley. And that's why, as a progressive in the argument I make in the book, we should before moves towards web 3.0 and crypto because of the prospect it has of decentralizing power. And I give a specific example of the book about crypto's use for artists or authors and how this could cut out middleman and the prospects that actually could get more people access to a market without the barriers of entry.
00:05:55.490 - 00:06:25.750, Speaker A: And while you're talking about this trend and also kind of pushing for more of it, at the same time we are seeing this new breed of crypto mayors who are coming into office. Obviously, there are some really prominent examples, like Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami, mayor Eric Adams in New York, or Mayor Scott Conger of Jackson, Tennessee. How do you see the crypto industry playing a role in bringing tech to more cities beyond just those usual suspects?
00:06:27.210 - 00:07:30.838, Speaker B: Well, they are, of course, passionate advocates and they see it firsthand in their cities. The job creation, the amount of people who are participating, the fact that there are so many people, black and brown communities, young folks who are active in the crypto space. But what crypto does is it doesn't just require a passionate mayor. You could be a small business person and now you may have more access to a global market, especially as we get people who are unbanked to have the ability to use crypto. And so it may increase your ability to thrive. You could use tokens to participate in the governance of a company and more companies will be set up in that way you can have much easier transmittance of payments across the world. So I think the technology itself will allow for some degree of decentralization.
00:07:30.838 - 00:08:01.190, Speaker B: Now, there's more that needs to be done as I write in the book about policies that can encourage decentralization and technology jobs to move to rural America and black and brown communities. But Web 3.0 should be part of that solution. And that's again, why I think that it shouldn't be something that progressives, fair. We need well regulated space with predictability and certainty, but we shouldn't just be reflexively against a technology that has decentralizing potential.
00:08:02.890 - 00:08:24.480, Speaker A: Well, so that's the perfect segue to my next question, because as you probably know, in the crypto community, there is a perception that Democrats are more anti crypto than Republicans. First of all, do you agree with that perception? And know, regardless of whether you agree, since the crypto community does have that perception, what is your response to them about that?
00:08:24.930 - 00:09:02.166, Speaker B: Well, there have been louder critics, I acknowledge, on the Democratic side. But there are champions. People like Senator Wyden and I Darren Soto in Florida. We're working on a fix to the bipartisan infrastructure bill which would define software engineers as brokers. It just doesn't make any sense which would define some of the miners as brokers in the Howie test is important in terms of what is a security. But just because something may be a security doesn't mean that you should be necessarily filing ten K and ten Q forms if it's decentralized enough. And what we may need is a new regulatory regime for digital assets.
00:09:02.166 - 00:09:33.246, Speaker B: So there are places where regulation is absolutely necessary. Let's consider stablecoins. I want to make sure that stablecoins have enough dollar backing, just like we have reserve requirements in banks. Fine, let's have that regulation. But let's understand what stablecoins allow. First of all, they've had a higher rate of return than people who just have money in the banks, and they make it easier to transmit money with large sums of money fast and without large fees, right? This isn't rocket science. They're just lowering significant transaction costs.
00:09:33.246 - 00:10:04.186, Speaker B: So when people say it's just digital gold, no, it actually has transactional values. Or let's have regulatory disclosure on what the blockchain is, but you're not going to have full control over the blockchain, especially in a case like Ethereum, which has basically become a commodity, so you don't have one company controlling it. So I think a lot of the criticism stems from a lack of awareness. I mean, I don't know how many. I don't have much crypto. I have less than $50. But I have a wallet on coinbase.
00:10:04.186 - 00:10:15.250, Speaker B: I have a meta wallet. I know that you have to go with what you need to do to buy an NFT. I just think more members of congress need to just experience the basics.
00:10:16.310 - 00:10:29.000, Speaker A: So let's say that later today you were to have a meeting with some of those very vocal crypto opponents such as congressman Brad Sherman or senator Elizabeth Warren. What would you say to them about this technology?
00:10:29.930 - 00:11:07.550, Speaker B: I tell you, if you're opposed to the power of the banks and if you're opposed to too much power of companies in my district, you should be for decentralization. Now, I understand that there have been scams, let's be clear. And we need to make sure that we have basic protections against scams. We need to make sure that we have protection against the abuse of crypto for illegal activity. But the irony is that the blockchain is the most traceable source. And so you could actually help law enforcement figure out illicit activity. And there's some concerns of privacy that every transaction.
00:11:07.550 - 00:11:32.780, Speaker B: The government may not know what you're doing, but let's understand though, that this is a technology that could actually decentralize. It could help a lot of people who are unbanked have access to markets. It could help small businesses avoid costly middlemen, and then let's have thoughtful, smart regulation about it. But don't just be reflexively against the technology.
00:11:34.350 - 00:11:57.060, Speaker A: So a line that I've been hearing more frequently about crypto from either liberals such as economist Paul Crookman or democratic politicians is that non whites are more likely than whites to own crypto. And then their conclusion is that therefore crypto is either preying upon or could harm the most vulnerable. What do you think of that take?
00:11:57.670 - 00:12:52.942, Speaker B: Well, first I think what it shows is that a lot of times nonwhites don't have access to the opportunities for wealth generation that many people do have access. I mean, how many people get to invest in pre IPO friends and family rounds, how many people get to invest in venture capital? How many people get stock options? Only 50% of Americans are even in the stock market. So the aspiration that a lot of young folks, that a lot of people in the black and brown community have is to build wealth, to build assets, to participate in building their companies. And we ought to recognize that now. We ought to make sure that there are regulations to protect them. But it should be a wake up call for us that there's so many people who are viewing this as their way to build wealth and to have a shot at a flourishing, prosperous life. And then I don't think that that's a negative.
00:12:52.942 - 00:12:58.390, Speaker B: I think what we ought to do is think about good regulations that protect them but allow them to participate.
00:12:59.530 - 00:13:38.078, Speaker A: So in a moment, we will discuss more about Congressman Khana's book as well as some of the more specific areas of crypto. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. It's time to bring Wall Street to Main Street. Coinchange is democratizing access to wealth management with low risk, high return, passive income through DeFi. It's simple just deposit your crypto into a cochange high yield account to earn more over time. Your yield is paid out daily and can be withdrawn anytime. Coinchange's Yield Farming doesn't utilize lending or other risky strategies.
00:13:38.078 - 00:14:15.310, Speaker A: No minimums, no obligations, just high yield. It's time for a change. Create an account today at trydfi CC UNC to receive 40 USDC. That's tri. CC UNC Web Three means freedom from big tech and Wall Street with more control and better privacy. But your crypto wallet is a weak point. Most wallets are browser extensions, a Web Two technology that means the same old risks app, spoofing, phishing, scams, and theft.
00:14:15.310 - 00:15:00.406, Speaker A: Bravewallet is different. Bravewallet is the first secure wallet built natively in a Web Three crypto browser with no extension required. With Brave wallet, you can buy, store, send, and swap assets, manage your portfolio and NFTs. You can see real time Coin Gecko data built right into your dashboard and connect other wallets and other Web Three DApps, all from the security of one of the most popular privacy browsers on the market. Whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions and switch to Bravewallet. Get started@brave.com slash Unchained back to my conversation with Congressman Kana.
00:15:00.406 - 00:15:32.306, Speaker A: In your book, you talk about the need to regulate big tech. And in the book, you also talk about an Internet Bill of Rights that you drafted. And the principles actually seem in line with what many crypto entrepreneurs say they're building these decentralized competitors to big tech. Do you think that that vision of these decentralized crypto networks that compete with big tech and give users a piece of ownership does align with your Internet Bill of Rights? And if so, how well it aligns.
00:15:32.338 - 00:16:20.440, Speaker B: If we could see alternative platforms emerging for social media conversations, if we can see alternative platforms emerging that facilitate business, because then that means we have more competition, more discursive spaces. You don't just have a few actors controlling a lot. But the other thing is, in terms of data, right now, you have so much data flowing to a few companies, and what I say is you need to have affirmative consent before having your data go to these companies. So that protection, in my view, needs to be regulatory. Now, if there are alternative companies emerging that have a better protection of privacy and data, that's a positive thing.
00:16:21.290 - 00:16:52.910, Speaker A: And so earlier, you alluded to some of the, I guess, kind of pending decisions around how tokens will be regulated. And SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made it clear that he views that tokens that are parts of these networks are basically Finley Veiled securities and they need to be regulated under a securities regime. What's your take on that? And in general, your take on how a team that is launching a coin can start centralized but go to decentralized overtime?
00:16:53.490 - 00:17:51.086, Speaker B: Well, there are two different issues. One is that something is security and then two is how do you regulate it under the Howie test, which has done us a lot of good over time, anything that has central control and that appreciates is a security. So you could say, okay, these are digital assets, digital securities, but then they can't be regulated in the same way as something that's completely centralized. I mean, Bitcoin is totally decentralized, but there are places that are hybrids. I mean, ethereum is now largely decentralized. What do you do if something has 1020 percent centralization and 70 80% non centralization? And I think what the important thing is, is for us to come up with clear, predictable rules of how we regulate digital assets, even if we think there is security. That means that there may be new ways of regulating it that protect consumers, but acknowledge that you don't have centralized control over the price and that you don't have centralized control over all the disclosure requirements.
00:17:51.086 - 00:18:31.662, Speaker B: I am working with the White House, the NSC, the Leap Singh, who's very thoughtful about this, to do two things. One, to get input from the crypto community. I'm calling for the White House to have a crypto roundtable on these policies. Two, to have predictability in whatever we do so that we can keep the crypto industry in the United States. One other point I often hear is on the energy costs and the issue of coal mines being used to power mining for blockchain. I'd say a few things. First, Bitcoin is about a trillion dollars.
00:18:31.662 - 00:19:12.014, Speaker B: As I understand it, anything that has a trillion dollars of value is going to use energy. That's just obvious. So then the question is, how do we make Bitcoin more green? And there are things we can do. For example, we could incentivize mining companies to institute demand response where they use the energy at times that are non peak and provide tax incentives or credits for doing that. We could incentivize them to use renewable energy. We could incentivize them to use the wind in Texas that isn't being fully used, or the hydro that isn't being used. So we've got to get past the boilerplate, oh, it's not green or is green.
00:19:12.014 - 00:19:20.560, Speaker B: And think about innovative solutions to something that's not going away. If you talk to all the young folks, they'll tell you that.
00:19:21.890 - 00:19:59.530, Speaker A: So another aspect of crypto that is taking off is decentralized finance or DeFi. And it's basically a parallel world of finance to Wall Street. However, it does not have the typical know your customer or anti money laundering controls. And there's definitely been hints that not only the US government but maybe other world governments would like to push that kind of system that has intermediaries that can do those kinds of KYC checks, even though DeFi builders would say the whole point is to remove intermediaries. So what do you think is the best way to handle that issue in DeFi?
00:19:59.950 - 00:20:46.614, Speaker B: Well, that's a very difficult question, and there honestly, I support a balanced approach. I mean, I know coinbase, for example, when you sign up for a wallet, they have a basic background check on you and they have to do a know your customer. You don't want certain platforms to be basically money laundering sites. That's why the know your customer requirements were there. You don't want them to be facilitating terrorism. And that some of these requirements came up after 911 where we wanted to make sure transactions of a large size were ones that we could follow. So I think there has to be a balance there of making sure that you don't have conduit for large transfers of money for illicit activity or terrorism, but you aren't being overly burdensome.
00:20:46.614 - 00:20:57.310, Speaker B: But I am not for sort of a libertarian, let's not have regulation, because that I do think would be too dangerous.
00:20:58.290 - 00:21:46.800, Speaker A: So, a similar issue is that the way the internal revenue service runs its tax system is through what's considered an account based system. And what we mean by that is that consumers have their accounts at different financial institutions, and then those financial institutions will report the financial activity to the government. And then when the taxpayer submits their tax return, the government can match that up against what was reported. But if crypto gains adoption and there's kind of more wallet based transactions where there isn't that third party that can do that reporting, then the IRS won't have that same visibility into people's financial transactions. So how do you think the IRS should handle those types of transactions in terms of taxing them?
00:21:47.330 - 00:22:32.910, Speaker B: Well, if you have capital gains, they ought to be taxed. There's no question that if you have capital gains, whether it's in tech, whether it's in crypto, whether it's in agriculture, manufacturing, you ought to pay tax. If a school teacher has to pay tax on her w. Two, if an amazon worker has to pay tax, someone who makes money off crypto ought to be paying tax. Now, how we enforce that if it's self reporting and what the IRS needs to do to enforce that, we need to figure that out and have a rational regulatory regime. But when people say you need regulatory regimes to make sure people pay tax, I say yes. I mean, just because you're doing something online doesn't mean you don't have to pay tax for appreciation.
00:22:34.450 - 00:22:56.470, Speaker A: So, central bank digital currencies are on the mind of the fed, and they're already being pushed by other countries. The US. At this moment has numerous private stablecoins, or at least private stablecoins that are pegged to the US. Dollar are you in favor of a central bank digital currency for the US. And also what is your stance on these private stablecoins?
00:22:56.890 - 00:23:57.410, Speaker B: So I think the private stablecoins right now are an important place so where you can have basically the dollar transferred and used for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and they make that process faster and they make that process less painful. And it allows for you to move money around much faster in a way that is with less fees and it also is appreciating more right now than in traditional bank accounts. But I want to make sure that there isn't a run on these stablecoins, that they have some capital reserve so that they have the dollars to back it up. And that seems prudent given what happened in the Wall Street crash. You want to make sure that there's some reserve requirements. I'm for the US. Government having a digital currency in terms of just the efficiencies it brings, and they should be experimenting with being innovative.
00:23:57.410 - 00:24:25.540, Speaker B: I don't think that anything will displace the US. Dollar. We're 51% of reserves. I wouldn't want to bet against America. We have a lot going for the country. And so I'm not concerned from that perspective, but I think we ought to be as innovative as possible and looking at the values of a digital US. Dollar that would allow people to have some of the benefits that cryptocurrencies bring.
00:24:26.550 - 00:24:41.320, Speaker A: I asked crypto Twitter what they wanted me to ask you, and one question by Ryan Selkis, the founder of Masari, was what can they do to help you bring more democrats and progressives to the crypto side?
00:24:42.250 - 00:25:08.366, Speaker B: Tell the stories of what crypto actually means. Tell the use cases. How is it benefiting people right now? There's still a lot of work to be done going on coinbase. It still charges you fees. It's so complicated to have to use meta wallet for some things and you can't buy NFTs on some things. It's a lot of gobbly gook. So you need to simplify it.
00:25:08.366 - 00:25:58.240, Speaker B: You need to show the clear use cases. You need to show clear people, real people, who are benefiting from this technology, not just in the hypothetical. Don't just say, well, it helps the young bank. Tell me the story of someone who a small business owner, a person who's using crypto to remit money or to get paid and make that clear in how it's helping. And then tell the story about young folks who have crypto investments and are doing well, or where it has gone down, how they weren't hurt by the recent downturn because maybe they already had bought the crypto earlier and the large downturn was for hedge funds. But you have to just be clear about how this is impacting real people.
00:25:59.570 - 00:26:24.120, Speaker A: So obviously we're in a midterm election year and this question was suggested by Twitter user Bricks Bounty Farm, although I'm going to tweak it a little bit. They asked, does crypto legislation such as what you have done with Congressman Tom Emmer offer an opportunity for bipartisanship in this Congress both in this midterm and for 2024.
00:26:25.370 - 00:26:54.990, Speaker B: It does. It should. That's such an obvious fix to what was wrong in the infrastructure bill. We should make sure that we're fixing it. But we have a lot of education to do still with our colleagues about why crypto has use cases, why this is important. One of the interesting things is I've been told there are about 40 million people in America who have crypto that that could go up to eventually almost 100 million. But those numbers need to be better broadcast.
00:26:54.990 - 00:27:14.520, Speaker B: People should be talking to their representatives about crypto. But I am optimistic that we can have this fixed. We need some of these fixes or we'll see the industry go to Britain, to Singapore, and we don't want to lose an industry that's going to be critical to Web 3.0.
00:27:15.210 - 00:27:33.214, Speaker A: And so going forward, when you think about everything that you put forward in your book and what's coming ahead for this year in terms of the election and also all these developments in crypto, what do you hope will transpire over the next year and speak partially to the crypto audience here?
00:27:33.412 - 00:28:31.326, Speaker B: I hope we will have predictability in the regulatory regime. That is the first point and a point that I have advocated. I hope we will have clear use cases like I demonstrate in the book about what artists and authors can use crypto for to reduce transaction costs and help protect a person's intellectual property while providing access to things like college textbooks at a much lower price. And finally, I hope we will embrace the fundamental philosophical principle that animates my book and I think animates a lot of people in the crypto space. And that's one word decentralization. That is what we want ultimately in this country, for every individual to feel empowered, to have the freedom to participate and contribute and flourish. And at its best, that's what crypto does.
00:28:31.326 - 00:28:47.650, Speaker B: It takes power from a few centers and it says, no, we want to get other people participating in the modern economy. That was the promise of the Internet that it would allow for that kind of democratization of participation.
00:28:48.230 - 00:29:10.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I will say, reading the book, that it definitely feels like even though you're a Democrat, there is so much in there that would appeal to Republicans because a lot of it just seems more common sense rather than something that's obviously political. So I do recommend it to listeners. All right, well, it's been so wonderful having you on Unchained. Thank you so much for coming on the show.
00:29:11.550 - 00:29:19.662, Speaker B: I'm a fan of the show. I appreciate it. Good luck with your book and thank you for having me on. I look forward to being back maybe with a Republican at some point.
00:29:19.796 - 00:29:43.062, Speaker A: Yes, we will do that because I think that would be super fun. All right, don't forget. Next up is the weekly news recap.

00:30:06.850 - 00:31:01.482, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. The SEC goes after Blockfly for $100 million BlockFi, a popular crypto lender, is paying $50 million to the US. Securities and Exchange Commission and $50 million across 32 states to settle investigations into whether Blockfly's interest earning accounts in which customers lend digital assets to Blockfly in return for yield are a securities offering. Current customers will remain unaffected by the settlement, though they will not be able to deposit more crypto into their accounts, and Blockfly will discontinue offering it to new US. Customers. As part of the settlement, Blockfly will be filing an S one for a Blockfly yield product, which would allow the lender to offer interest earning accounts to US. Customers as the security registered with the SEC, said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a press release.
00:31:01.482 - 00:32:12.646, Speaker A: This is the first case of its kind with respect to crypto lending platforms. Today's settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time tested securities laws.
