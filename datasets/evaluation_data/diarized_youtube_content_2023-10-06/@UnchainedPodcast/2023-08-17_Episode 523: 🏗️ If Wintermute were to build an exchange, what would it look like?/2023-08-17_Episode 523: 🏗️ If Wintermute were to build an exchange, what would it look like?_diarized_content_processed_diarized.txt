00:00:00.090 - 00:00:53.900, Speaker A: If you were to build an exchange, it would be much more similar to CME than to Binance coinbase like I think it would be focused much more on the matching engine and basically like the central clearing part. Basically stripping away all kycml for retail people. Stripping away managing leverage, stripping away all the horrible things about running your own centralized exchange in crypto and just making it much more CME like. And basically focusing on one hand kind of like what does BF tried to do with FTX? Like making this central clearing run a very efficient cross margining, kind of like engine, and on the other hand, kind of like improving on CME side. It would be basically running on a stable coins instead of fiat, so that you can do settlement cycles faster. And if you can do settlement cycles faster, you effectively can extend more leverage to the clearing members as a result.
