00:02:08.178 - 00:02:09.026, Speaker A: Hi, Laura.
00:02:09.058 - 00:02:10.120, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:10.570 - 00:02:25.590, Speaker A: Lightning is having quite a moment with mainstream services like Twitter and Substack adopting it, and Paxful, the Bitcoin peer to peer service, has also brought on Lightning. Give us an overview of the ways in which Lightning is bringing bitcoin to the masses.
00:02:25.750 - 00:03:27.566, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So what Elizabeth Stark, our founder, has been saying for years is that the Lightning Labs mission is to bring bitcoin to billions. And that the way that we're doing that is by building developer tools and infrastructure to let companies like Twitter, whose Lightning integration is powered by strike from Jack Mahler's, Substack, whose Lightning integration is powered by OpenNode, who know both of those companies are Lightning OGS. And then Paxful has come online. They're the ones bringing the end users to the protocol, right? And we're building infrastructure. And so this is just a result of many, many years of hard work, of building up this protocol, of sharpening these developer tools, documentation, et cetera, et cetera, getting it to the point where the protocol was mature enough that these early adopter companies are coming on board and adopting it. And I think we're going to talk about it here in a little bit.
00:03:27.566 - 00:03:57.270, Speaker B: But I loved this one chart. Arcane Research posted the State of the Lightning report, state of the Lightning network report this week. And they had this one chart that was showing the public network capacity. And it's two spikes, with the first spike being kind of the innovators and the second spike being the early adopters. And we are firmly in the early adopter stage of this new technology. And it's just like, incredible that our early adopters include Twitter and the country of El Salvador.
00:03:58.990 - 00:04:16.110, Speaker A: Yeah. So speaking of El Salvador, I would say that that probably is the biggest development for Lightning recently. El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender, and they've also onboarded people to the Chiva wallet there. So what is the significance of this milestone?
00:04:18.130 - 00:05:37.030, Speaker B: It's an amazing vote of confidence in the stability of the protocol and of the network. And I think it's really important. Just briefly, depending on your estimate and how you measure the numbers, there's somewhere between 15,020, 5000 public routing nodes on the Lightning network. And this is like a real, truly decentralized network, right? Lightning Labs does write the dominant implementation in LND, but Lightning Labs proper, the company only runs like, five nodes, right? All of the vast, vast majority of the network are run by hobbyists, businesses, entrepreneurs, developers, et cetera, et cetera, who have all independently figured out how to get these things running, how to manage your channels, how to manage liquidity, how to provide a good experience on the network. And so I think, again, years of all this hard work culminating in a nation state adopting it. And I got to tell you, from the Bitcoin 2021 announcement until September 7, our team was just we had big plans for what we wanted to do this summer. And instead it was like, oh man, we got to be ready for 6 million people to adopt this right away.
00:05:37.030 - 00:06:10.702, Speaker B: We got to focus on a bunch of the back end scaling the database and making sure that the nodes were secure and all this kind of back end engineering work that goes underappreciated. And we were nervous, to be frank with you. This is a big deal, right? It's a big deal not just for Lightning, but for Bitcoin in general. This had to work. And it hasn't been a perfect launch by any stretch. No launch really is, but by all accounts, it mostly works. People are able to buy food at McDonald's.
00:06:10.702 - 00:06:59.682, Speaker B: We've heard through the grapevine that the most popular restaurant accepting Bitcoin in San Salvador is Pizza Hut, which, go figure, I guess. Bitcoiners just love pizza. That seems to be a thing. And it's incredible that this country has decided to go on a Bitcoin standard and that we were ready for them. I think it's a testament again to, of course, my colleagues at Lightning Labs who are doing a lot of the heavy lifting. But again, open Node EBEX Mercado out of Guatemala, the Galoy team who built the Bitcoin beach wallet. There's so many players in our ecosystem who all went hands on bit refill, who've gone hands on deck to make sure that this worked.
00:06:59.682 - 00:07:40.750, Speaker B: And this is the power of a decentralized ecosystem really working. And the other thing that I think is incredible is obviously I do business development, so I talk to companies all the time about onboarding to the Lightning network and integrating and giving their users the experience of global payments. And now I have this great line that I can use where it's like, look, you may think that this is hard or some difficult thing, the country of El Salvador figured it on, your engineers can make this happen, right? We can get this to work. So it's just a great testament to all the underlying work that has gone in over years and that we were ready to rise to the occasion.
00:07:41.250 - 00:08:01.458, Speaker A: And so you kind of referenced this earlier, but as we've seen, the capacity on the network has grown by more than five times in dollar terms and by about three times in bitcoin terms year to date. And so is that due to what you were talking about, just all these different businesses trying to get ready for what they knew was going to be a new influx?
00:08:01.634 - 00:08:29.818, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a really good question. It's a difficult one because there isn't like one specific reason why. But in general, what we've noticed is there is this trend that happens where developers build new applications, and Chiva Wallet would be kind of an instance of this. Twitter onboarding would be an instance, et cetera. Strike. Developers build new applications, they bring new users. Users produce more volume on the network.
00:08:29.818 - 00:08:53.762, Speaker B: More volume on the network means more routing fees for the nodes on the network. And as they start earning more funds, they allocate more capital. And that as they allocate more capital. Of course, as we all know, the thing that makes the most news in the crypto space is a chart that's going vertically up and to the right. And that gets more developer interest. More developers build new applications. And this flywheel just spins.
00:08:53.762 - 00:09:36.040, Speaker B: We're again heavily in the early adopter stage now of the Lightning network as a technology. And this flywheel is spinning, right. We are now in the steps where the capacity is going up. And I can tell you we're getting new developers, new people interested. This next wave of application developers are here in earnest and I'm really excited to see what they produce because now volume is now very consistent and more nodes coming online means kind of margins for these routing node operators start to depress a little bit and they need to find new sources of volume and new users to keep their business going.
00:09:37.050 - 00:10:05.822, Speaker A: And so I recognize that you don't work for OpenNode or Strike, but you do work for Lightning Labs, which has helped Paxful bring on lightning. So just in general, I was curious for these more mainstream services that are bringing lightning on, how has that happened? Has it just been general interest in Bitcoin or is this Lightning companies reaching out or how is that adoption happening?
00:10:05.956 - 00:10:37.734, Speaker B: That's a great question. I don't know if I could say this definitively. I would bet, though, that in the spring of this year, a lot of that was outbound BD. It was like, hey, it's time, we're ready. There are all these benefits to you as a company by turning this on. But I can tell you from this, starting this summer, post Bitcoin 2021, the amount of inbound interest has been huge. It's been really exciting to see that switch kind of flip a little bit.
00:10:37.734 - 00:11:34.970, Speaker B: And now people and this is again, what happens with open networks and network technologies in general is in the early stages. The benefits to joining a network are not great. They're not huge because there's nobody else on the network. But as the network goes, at some point you reach a tipping point where the benefits to joining the network are enormous, right? Like if you can plug in a node, open up a couple channels, and pay to thousands of merchants all across the globe, people in El Salvador, Tip, people on Twitter, you can do all these sort of things. Like the benefits to joining this network are very large. And I think that's what we're starting to see now is that switches kind of flipped. I write our monthly newsletter, and our last newsletter was titled are We Reaching the Tipping Point? Are we there? Has critical mass been achieved? I don't know if I can say for sure that we're there yet, but we are certainly significantly closer than we were in the spring.
00:11:34.970 - 00:12:18.600, Speaker B: So a lot of outbound BD now there's significant inbound interest. And the other important thing is, yes, there are experts, companies like Lightning Labs and other members of the community that will help onboard these companies. But this is all open source software, right? You can do it on your own if you'd like. And there are tons and tons of people in our scores that I talk to every day that are reaching out and like, hey, by the way, we got our nodes up and running and we just wanted to reach out to hear if there's anything we should know before we announce to the world that this is what we're doing. And that's like a pretty cool thing to have happen.
00:12:19.690 - 00:12:44.602, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we'll discuss more about adoption and the future of lightning. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. With over 10 million users, crypto.com is the easiest place to buy and sell over 90 cryptocurrencies. Grow your crypto with crypto.com Earn, which pays up to 8.5% interest on your bitcoin and 14% interest on your stablecoins when it's time to spend your crypto.

There's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by downloading the Nodal Cash app. It's free, easy to use, and there's no hardware to buy.
00:13:11.654 - 00:13:28.270, Speaker A: The Nodal Cash app allows you to earn crypto whether you're on the go, stuck in traffic or even while you're sleeping. Nodal Cash is the crypto. You earn 24/7. Go to Nodal.com. No, d l E.com to get started today or go directly to Nodal. IO cash.
00:13:28.270 - 00:13:53.282, Speaker A: That's? No. D-L-E IO cash. Back to my conversation with Ryan. So the total value locked in bitcoin in Lightning is $165,000,000, and that gives it a ranking of 35 on DFI Pulse. And for comparison, the biggest ethereum based D Five protocols have billions locked in them. Like in the teens, like Ave at 16 billion.
00:13:53.346 - 00:13:53.958, Speaker B: True.
00:13:54.124 - 00:14:01.302, Speaker A: Why do you think total value locked in Lightning is still far less than in some of these ethereum based D Five protocols?
00:14:01.366 - 00:14:29.598, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's very much an apples to oranges comparison because for one in bitcoin and in Lightning in particular, this is a full reserve system. Like, there is no notion of debt. It is all bitcoin. There's no money multiple, there's no additional tokens that are locked in. It is all 100% full reserve. Whereas some of these other DeFi, like the whole point of DFI is over collateralized lending.
00:14:29.598 - 00:15:03.594, Speaker B: Right. So you are able to kind of multiply your money and increase the total value of that. I think one thing that's been really interesting for me, because I pay attention to the broader crypto space, is it seems like DeFi has clearly found product market fit. I don't think there's any denying that. But all the things that the DeFi people are interested in doing are very orthogonal to what we're interested in doing. Right. Lightning has always been very focused on transferring bitcoin from peer to peer.
00:15:03.594 - 00:15:32.950, Speaker B: It's fulfilling the vision of bitcoin as peer to peer electronic cash. And so there is no trading is not like a really big use case on the Lightning network. There is no notion of debt. So we're not doing lending, we're doing payments. Right. And value transfer and remittances and micro payments and tips, et cetera, et cetera. So they are just different, I think.
00:15:32.950 - 00:16:04.590, Speaker B: And I think it's fine in the Lightning ecosystem, we're not necessarily trying to say, oh, we're DeFi too. Right. It's payments. It's always been about payments. And I think the very last thing that I would say is the whole point of Lightning is capital efficiency. Like, you have bitcoin that you want to earn a return on. You're putting it in the Lightning network because it's able to make you, you think, more money than putting it in blockfire or whatever.
00:16:04.590 - 00:16:54.858, Speaker B: The decentralized protocol is to earn a yield on your bitcoin. Right. And so it is all about how many times can I turn over my capital very efficiently? It's been very interesting to me watching the DeFi conversation happen, especially, like, I know Hayden Adams at Uniswap talks about this a lot, where he's like, we're focused on volume as a metric, not total value locked, right? Like, the total value locked being small and the volume being high is actually the goal. And I think that's been an interesting thing to watch because that's kind of always what we've said about Lightning is like, well, it's really like, we shouldn't have just, like, a bunch of bitcoin sitting in hot wallets and Lightning network, it should be used. It should be earning a return. And so the goal is to have the volume number be high. But of course, the problem is we can't publish a volume chart because it's all recorded locally and it's private.
00:16:54.858 - 00:17:10.680, Speaker B: So that's just something we don't have. Although I think the Arcane research report did a nice job. Like, one of the first ones, I think, to kind of aggregate some volume numbers from different players and try and show at least a picture of what the volume looked like.
00:17:11.930 - 00:17:19.106, Speaker A: And what did that show? That there was a high volume compared to the amount locked in Lightning.
00:17:19.218 - 00:18:16.140, Speaker B: I don't think they made that exact comparison. I remember what was specifically in the report was that the volume numbers they'd seen had doubled from July to August and then doubled again from August to September. And that I think there was another report from an analyst, Kevin Rook from Midsummer or something, where he did a kind of top down estimation and bottom up estimation and arrived at maybe for this year. The total volume and the lighting network would be like, between 100 mil and $500 million transacted, which is the themes about right. I don't really know. But what's interesting is, in 2020, Visa and Mastercard combined did $16 trillion worth of payments. So we got a lot of zeros to add before we're in the conversation in a big way.
00:18:17.550 - 00:18:38.660, Speaker A: So, speaking of Arcane research, their report also showed that payments for online services like trading and gambling have tended to dominate payment volume and Lightning, but that in September, personal transfers and payments for more everyday transactions, like merchant payments, grew at double the rate of those other services. What do you think is behind that?
00:18:40.550 - 00:19:31.458, Speaker B: I think I think El Salvador, for sure. But also and one thing so I was at earlier this week, I was at the Oslo Freedom Forum put on by the Human Rights Foundation, and we talked to mike Peterson, who was at Bitcoin Beach specifically about he was presenting on what he's seen in, you know, in the years coming, but especially this past month. And again, it's kind of like what I was talking about earlier. It's like this technology has been ready and has been battle tested and it was just kind of waiting for its moment. And so people that pick up Lightning wallets today, maybe they tried in early 2018 and were like severely disappointed because it was too early. They pick them up today and they're like, oh man, this actually works really great. This is a nice experience.
00:19:31.458 - 00:20:13.034, Speaker B: And especially for people that aren't in Western countries or in China where there are very good payment systems, the Lightning network now is significantly better than the payment Rails in. Like it is already a better user experience than payment Rails for a large majority of the world. And so I think we were just waiting on a moment, right? Waiting on a spark to get a bunch of people to download wallets and start using it. But that moment is like, firmly know. So a lot of that volume is probably happening in El Salvador itself. But I think it's also inspired a bunch of people all around the world to be like, well, if they can do it, so can we. What are we waiting for? Right? This is all open source software.
00:20:13.034 - 00:20:17.730, Speaker B: It just requires spinning up a node and getting some liquidity.
00:20:18.710 - 00:20:29.140, Speaker A: So where do you think Lightning is going next? There has been talk about streaming money. Can you explain what that means and how likely it is that you think it'll become a common thing soon?
00:20:32.010 - 00:20:47.580, Speaker B: I don't know. Is it bad form to recommend other podcasts on your show? Because there was a great answer to this from BTC Sessions on, I guess, a podcast that should not be named. He had a great answer.
00:20:48.270 - 00:20:49.930, Speaker A: You can name another podcast.
00:20:50.530 - 00:21:59.300, Speaker B: He was on Preston Pish's show, and I heard it this morning. And so BTC Sessions is a YouTuber who produces tutorials and different videos for using Bitcoin products. And he was talking about how on YouTube, he barely makes enough money to get by, right? They nickel and dime him out of ad money on everything. But there is already this pretty vibrant ecosystem in the Lightning space that will while you're listening to a podcast, you will stream money to the podcaster. And he was like and it's generally the way it's set up is you just send them something on the order of 100 SATS, like under a dollar or on the order of pennies per minute while you're listening. And so he was like, if I have 10,000 people watch my YouTube video, I can't buy a piece of bread with that. But if I have 10,000 people listening to my podcast and each of them maybe pays me a dollar in Bitcoin for the duration of the entire podcast, that's $10,000 for an episode, right? And so it is happening already.
00:21:59.300 - 00:22:38.186, Speaker B: And podcasting is like kind of the first medium through which it's really taking off. And what I think is amazing about this is this Podcasting 2.0 movement is not only are the podcasters really interested in the money that they're earning, of course, right, and they're pushing their listeners, they're like marketing the Lightning network to their listeners, saying like, hey, don't listen to me through Spotify or whatever. Listen to me through one of these independent podcast developer apps because then you can pay me while you're listening. And it's working. I don't think it's quite had its moment like El Salvador had yet. It hasn't really exploded.
00:22:38.186 - 00:23:35.582, Speaker B: But there's hundreds, if not thousands of podcasts now that are enabled with these kind of Lightning tips. And so we're starting to see and this is sorry, the second thing that's really interesting about podcasting is, as a podcaster, I'm sure, you know, it's really hard to get data on what your listeners are doing while they're, like, when they drop off of the episode, et cetera, et cetera. Unless they're on one of these walled garden platforms like Spotify. But if they're paying you every minute, you know, through the data, through the payments that you get, at what point in the episode they drop off you know, at what point in the episode did they really like something? And they can send you a boost, which is like sending you a full dollar in one payment if they really agree with something that was said. Right. So there's all this side industry that's popping up now of on top of just users paying podcasters for listening. Additionally, like the data that the podcasters are getting, the analytics they're getting about their listeners.
00:23:35.582 - 00:24:29.890, Speaker B: So it is happening. I think we just need more wallets, more integrations. We need to make the user experience much nicer. But the cool thing about this is that it's the content creators who are incentivized to market this technology to their consumers, right, which is just something that I certainly didn't see coming a year ago, but is really amazed. And it's first step, podcasting. Next up YouTube. There's a Brazilian YouTube group, Bitcoin Hieros, which is Heroes, who they just released a new website, which I'm blanking on the name right now, but in order to make a comment on their live stream, you just have to pay 100 sat invoice in order to get included as, like, a spam filter so people don't make nasty comments.
00:24:29.890 - 00:24:53.100, Speaker B: And it's like a very user friendly, like, you just have to bring your own mobile wallet to make the tip. I think we're going to see a lot more stuff like that pop up. And it's just in the way that this always goes is we just have iteration, development attempts, attempts, attempts, and then somebody hits it big and then all of a sudden it goes mainstream. And so I think we're going to see that again here in just a matter of time.
00:24:54.030 - 00:24:58.874, Speaker A: Yeah, just from what you were talking about, I was like, oh, I need to look into this.
00:24:59.072 - 00:25:02.700, Speaker B: We can get you set up. We can get you set up. Laura, I know all the people.

Bitcoin's price Surges amidst bullish Sentiment bitcoin hit a trillion dollar market cap for the first time in nearly 150 days on Wednesday. As of publishing time Thursday afternoon, the price of one bitcoin was up roughly 25% for the week, increasing from 43 $450 to slightly above $54,000.01. Explanation for the rising price is rumors swirling around the approval of a bitcoin futures ETF. Nate Garachi, president of the ETF store, said he thinks the first bitcoin futures ETF could be approved in less than two weeks. Eric Beltunas, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, agreed tweeting that he gives such an approval a 75% chance pointus reports that CME BTC based futures contracts were trading at a 12.8%
00:26:43.502 - 00:27:36.574, Speaker A: premium to the spot price on Wednesday, the largest premium since mid April. Many analysts consider CME bitcoin futures a proxy for institutional sentiment on crypto. CME is currently the only crypto derivatives exchange for institutional and traditional investors with federal oversight. Mike Bocella, a general partner at BlockTower, believes the premium suggests that institutions could be front running the news of a futures based bitcoin ETF being approved. Notably, SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently lent his support to a bitcoin futures ETF twice, mentioning that he would, quote, look forward to staff's review of such filings. In addition to speculation surrounding the approval of a bitcoin ETF, here are a few other reasons for BTC's bullish price action. Based on analysis from Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, it appears that a whale purchased $1.6
00:27:36.574 - 00:28:15.210, Speaker A: billion worth of spot bitcoin in just under five minutes on Wednesday, coinciding with bitcoin's push up to $55,000. Both SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Fed Chair Jerome Powell explicitly stated their respective regulatory bodies do not plan to ban crypto. US bank, the fifth largest retail bank in the US. Announced that Crypto custody for BTC bitcoin Cash and Litecoin is now available to fund managers thanks to a partnership with NYDIG. The CEO of the $27 billion family office of George Soros confirmed that the fund invests in Bitcoin. The CEO, Don Fitzpatrick, told Bloomberg. Quote from our perspective, we own some coins.
00:28:15.210 - 00:29:33.170, Speaker A: The Compound Bugs Compounding Bug Last Thursday, a bug was found in a recently implemented upgrade to a smart contract powering compound, the fifth largest DFI protocol by total value locked, which put roughly 280,000 of the protocol's native token comp at risk of being erroneously claimed. On Sunday, compound's bug intensified after an ethereum user called the protocol's drip function, adding 202,000 comp, or $66 million to the rewards contract, almost doubling the number of outsized awards available to be scooped up. This brings the total comp at risk to approximately four hundred and ninety K, of which one hundred and thirty six k is still in the controller, said Robert Leschner, CEO of Compound Labs, on Twitter at the time.
