However, one of the conditions of his bail is that his parents'phone is supposed to be able to photograph its users every five minutes. Lawyers say that his parents are having trouble installing the monitoring software on the phone. It's not like there's anyone in that house who's good with technology. However, if they need someone to convince millions of people that the software is actually capable of doing something it can't do, I don't think that they should have even considered this order until they confirmed that both SBF and his parents can shower in under five minutes. The legal workaround right now is that every keystroke on his parents'phone gets monitored. So basically, it's like a regular smartphone.

Her rejection must have gotten to SBF, though. There's apparently parole footage of him in a dark corner of his parents base. Man sitting alone, eating Pad Thai and whispering to himself over and over again. It's me. Hi, I'm the problem. It's me.
