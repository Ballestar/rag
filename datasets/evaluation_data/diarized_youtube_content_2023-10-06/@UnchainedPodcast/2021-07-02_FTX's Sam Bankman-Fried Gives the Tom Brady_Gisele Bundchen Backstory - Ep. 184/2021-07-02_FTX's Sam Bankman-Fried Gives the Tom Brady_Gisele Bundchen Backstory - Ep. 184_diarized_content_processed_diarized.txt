00:01:29.366 - 00:01:30.570, Speaker A: Welcome, Sam.
00:01:30.910 - 00:01:32.460, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:32.830 - 00:01:38.490, Speaker B: FTX had some interesting news this week. Well, actually, it's not so different from other weeks.
00:01:38.640 - 00:01:43.774, Speaker A: Tom Brady and Chisel Bunchen became part owners of FTX. How did that happen?
00:01:43.972 - 00:01:51.038, Speaker D: Yeah, and we've been talking to them for a little while about working together, and we've obviously been spending a lot.
00:01:51.044 - 00:01:53.070, Speaker C: Of time over the last six months.
00:01:53.140 - 00:01:57.698, Speaker D: Trying to find ways to get our name out there more. And so that was sort of one.
00:01:57.704 - 00:02:00.242, Speaker C: Of the big pieces of context here.
00:02:00.296 - 00:02:12.390, Speaker D: Just given that we were pretty proud of our product. But as one of the latest entrants to the game on the exchange side, we're definitely lagging in terms of raw user base number.
00:02:12.460 - 00:02:15.046, Speaker C: But I think the other thing is.
00:02:15.148 - 00:02:27.466, Speaker D: That they're just excited to work with us and we're excited to work with them, and that just goes a really long way. I mean, I know know Giselle's really excited on the charity side know, work with the foundation on giving.
00:02:27.568 - 00:02:29.334, Speaker C: I think, you know, Tom's been excited.
00:02:29.382 - 00:02:31.660, Speaker D: About crypto for a while and so.
00:02:32.110 - 00:02:34.160, Speaker C: It was just a really good fit.
00:02:34.610 - 00:02:37.226, Speaker B: And so Tom also tweeted his excitement.
00:02:37.258 - 00:02:43.114, Speaker A: About the partnership with a video of himself showing a Bitcoin logo that hits and shatters the moon.
00:02:43.242 - 00:02:46.734, Speaker B: Did FTX come up with that with him? And if so, how does your team.
00:02:46.772 - 00:02:48.094, Speaker A: Come up with that idea?
00:02:48.292 - 00:02:49.554, Speaker C: I think that was him and his.
00:02:49.592 - 00:02:55.620, Speaker D: Team honestly coming up with that. At least I was not involved in coming up with that and did not know it was going to happen until it did.
00:02:55.930 - 00:02:57.030, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:02:57.180 - 00:03:12.874, Speaker B: Okay, well, that's clearly a sign of his enthusiasm and FTX also recently inked a sponsorship deal with Major League Baseball to have FTX patches on all umpire uniforms starting next month, and another one with TSM, which is a professional esports team.
00:03:12.992 - 00:03:16.326, Speaker A: And they even renamed themselves TSM FTX.
00:03:16.518 - 00:03:21.510, Speaker B: And of course, everyone knows you also became a sponsor of the Miami Heats Arena.
00:03:21.670 - 00:03:23.806, Speaker A: So in general, how does FTX think.
00:03:23.828 - 00:03:25.614, Speaker B: About sponsorships and about getting the word.
00:03:25.652 - 00:03:28.686, Speaker C: Out about so, you know, there's a.
00:03:28.708 - 00:03:43.154, Speaker D: Ton of things you can do, obviously, and many of them are somewhat know, sort of the blander ones are not that different than just running Facebook ads. And that's not to say anything against Facebook ads. We haven't really done them, but maybe they're right.
00:03:43.192 - 00:03:44.340, Speaker C: Maybe we'll start.
00:03:44.790 - 00:03:56.774, Speaker D: But what they don't do is they don't do that much for your image or your brand, and they're sort of dilutive, if anything. I think when we think about these.
00:03:56.892 - 00:03:57.986, Speaker C: There are a few things that we're.
00:03:58.018 - 00:04:27.458, Speaker D: Thinking about, but the biggest things are what are the people, the organizations that really a lot of people pay attention to, that a lot of people listen to, and what are the ways to partner with them that people will see? And then the second piece of this is, what's a way to do it that feels sort of exciting and authentic and new and fresh rather than just dilutive. And I sort of go back to just so many of the advertisements that you see on TV, so many of.
00:04:27.464 - 00:04:36.386, Speaker C: The brand endorsements you see where you watch them. And I sort of feel like I don't think that person's family was convinced.
00:04:36.418 - 00:04:48.614, Speaker D: To use that product. You see this endorsement. I literally think that their kids and their mom have no interest in the product after having seen they're like closest.
00:04:48.662 - 00:04:50.858, Speaker C: Person in the world to them, just.
00:04:51.024 - 00:04:58.154, Speaker D: Film endorsement for it. And I think that's the biggest thing we're trying to avoid is just this.
00:04:58.192 - 00:05:09.098, Speaker C: Sense of completely commercial, completely bland, and completely replaceable fluff, which I think it's.
00:05:09.114 - 00:05:12.702, Speaker D: Not who we are, and I think it doesn't do that much.
00:05:12.836 - 00:05:20.050, Speaker C: And so the biggest things that we're thinking is, what's something here that's going to seem cool and authentic and and.
00:05:20.120 - 00:05:24.146, Speaker B: So FTX has two presences, one in Asia and one in the US.
00:05:24.248 - 00:05:26.898, Speaker A: But a lot of these sponsorships that.
00:05:26.904 - 00:05:29.102, Speaker B: You'Re doing do target a US audience.
00:05:29.166 - 00:05:32.086, Speaker C: So why is I mean, I think.
00:05:32.108 - 00:05:45.942, Speaker D: There are a few pieces to it, and certainly look, one thing you could say is, I grew up in America. Maybe that's just what I have the ear for, right? And I do think that there's some truth there in that. It's taken me a lot longer to figure out what would even be meaningful.
00:05:46.006 - 00:05:48.534, Speaker C: Things in other countries, because I didn't.
00:05:48.582 - 00:05:57.454, Speaker D: Have 26 years steeped in their cultures to be able to tell. And it's so easy to mess these.
00:05:57.492 - 00:06:02.366, Speaker C: Up, and it's so easy to think you got a great deal, and then.
00:06:02.388 - 00:06:04.418, Speaker D: It'S a dud and you can never figure out why.
00:06:04.504 - 00:06:06.258, Speaker C: And I think we see this and.
00:06:06.424 - 00:06:08.146, Speaker D: I'm kind of honestly, one thing we.
00:06:08.168 - 00:06:10.820, Speaker C: See this with is there are these.
00:06:11.590 - 00:06:20.246, Speaker D: US sports team sleeve patches that are going around right now, about two thirds the price of an arena naming rate.
00:06:20.428 - 00:06:24.038, Speaker C: And they're just like, no one cares about them.
00:06:24.124 - 00:06:27.350, Speaker D: It's just like super consistently. Like no one can name a single one of them.
00:06:27.420 - 00:06:29.080, Speaker C: They don't stand out at all.
00:06:30.330 - 00:06:33.810, Speaker D: And what incentives sort of looks like is money grab is probably being a.
00:06:33.820 - 00:06:35.514, Speaker C: Little bit too strong here, but this.
00:06:35.552 - 00:07:03.170, Speaker D: Sort of sense of a team being like, man, how many times can we sell something? Like, what if we take every inch of square space and separately try and market that as our whole brand that we're sharing with you type thing? And I think when it comes to things that I have an ear for, I can kind of tell quickly, like, no one cares about that versus like, okay, no, that's something that really is meaningful. Whereas in other countries I just don't know as much. But we do have people on staff who do. And so I think that's not the full answer.
00:07:03.240 - 00:07:07.646, Speaker C: And I think a big piece of this is frankly, the US is where.
00:07:07.768 - 00:07:10.760, Speaker D: Our name recognition is probably lagging the most.
00:07:11.210 - 00:07:12.326, Speaker C: And a lot of this is because.
00:07:12.348 - 00:07:24.106, Speaker D: FTX US didn't open up until a year ago, at which point ftx.com was already like 10th or 15th biggest venue globally. I think it's just like it's only.
00:07:24.128 - 00:07:26.506, Speaker C: Been around half as long and so.
00:07:26.528 - 00:07:27.754, Speaker D: We have even more ground to make.
00:07:27.792 - 00:07:29.850, Speaker C: Up in the states than we do globally.
00:07:30.190 - 00:07:32.960, Speaker B: And why the emphasis on sports in particular?
00:07:33.730 - 00:07:34.830, Speaker C: It's a good question.
00:07:34.900 - 00:07:40.202, Speaker D: And we are looking at some other things as well. I think that there's a heavily overlapping.
00:07:40.346 - 00:07:47.780, Speaker C: User base and dynamic, which is one piece of this. I think they're just among the most.
00:07:49.030 - 00:07:56.718, Speaker D: Recognizable people and recognizable organizations. You don't have the equivalent of sort.
00:07:56.744 - 00:08:00.294, Speaker C: Of like the premier clubs, things like.
00:08:00.332 - 00:08:03.318, Speaker D: That in other industries. That's not to say there's nothing to.
00:08:03.324 - 00:08:06.258, Speaker C: Do there, but I think that it's.
00:08:06.274 - 00:08:19.066, Speaker D: Quite a bit more finicky and difficult to figure out what it would even mean. And again, not to say we shouldn't be doing it even, and it is something we're kicking around. I think that a number of these.
00:08:19.088 - 00:08:21.994, Speaker C: Things fit really cleanly in the sports paradigm.
00:08:22.042 - 00:08:33.566, Speaker D: And if you thought about a musician, for instance, what would be the equivalent of an arena naming rights? Unless something tells me that we're not.
00:08:33.588 - 00:08:38.114, Speaker C: Going to see Beyonce renaming her act.
00:08:38.152 - 00:08:41.474, Speaker D: To FTX Beyonce or any and I would not do that if I were.
00:08:41.512 - 00:08:44.100, Speaker C: Like, that would be a big mistake on her part.
00:08:46.410 - 00:08:52.520, Speaker B: I was thinking maybe just Madison Square Garden or the Barclays Center or something like that.
00:08:52.970 - 00:09:00.950, Speaker D: Yeah, totally agree. Most venues don't come up most years. Most of these deals are like 20 year deals.
00:09:01.110 - 00:09:10.826, Speaker C: And so each year there's maybe five or ten that are opening up. We actually got a little bit lucky. There were way more openings when we.
00:09:10.848 - 00:09:27.618, Speaker D: Ended up getting the Miami Heat Arena than in most years, or at least more effective openings because of COVID I mean, it was formerly American Airlines arena and I don't know why American Airlines didn't renew. Like, I don't have any privileged information.
00:09:27.704 - 00:09:32.914, Speaker C: There, but if I had to know it's an airline company, COVID they had.
00:09:32.952 - 00:09:35.310, Speaker D: Three stadiums, I think they've now cut down to two.
00:09:35.400 - 00:09:38.950, Speaker C: Doesn't seem like a shocking yeah, yeah.
00:09:39.020 - 00:09:43.958, Speaker B: And you mentioned about Giselle being head of environmental and social initiatives and obviously.
00:09:44.044 - 00:09:47.142, Speaker A: You yourself are very active politically, being.
00:09:47.196 - 00:10:25.380, Speaker B: One of the biggest donors to Joe Biden's campaign. And I just feel like crypto is kind of at this interesting crossroads right now where it's kind of intersecting more with mainstream movements such as the environmental movement in the NFT space in particular, or it's also doing things. Like gaining adoption in places like El Salvador, which some people and parts of The Crypto community feel know, kind of is, I Guess, opposite some of the values of Crypto. But I just wondered, how do you think FTX can push these values oriented goals amongst these different groups that sometimes are at ODS with each?
00:10:26.390 - 00:10:28.754, Speaker C: And you know, I think that's a good point.
00:10:28.792 - 00:10:35.400, Speaker D: And the biggest thing I'd say is we don't want to push this on people, we don't want to prescribe for people what they do.
00:10:35.850 - 00:10:42.602, Speaker C: I think the way we think about this is we can set an example and it's up to other people what they do.
00:10:42.736 - 00:10:47.626, Speaker D: There are things that I'm super passionate about, things Giselle is, and things that.
00:10:47.648 - 00:10:56.446, Speaker C: Frankly a lot of our team care about a lot. And we're really honored whenever we see.
00:10:56.468 - 00:10:58.878, Speaker D: People in the community sort of joining in on it.
00:10:58.964 - 00:11:02.974, Speaker C: And I think that's sort of one of the most impactful parts of doing.
00:11:03.012 - 00:11:11.038, Speaker D: This from our perspective, is being able to reach out to the community. But on the other hand, if it's.
00:11:11.054 - 00:11:16.566, Speaker C: Not for you, that's totally fine. And so I think that one thing.
00:11:16.588 - 00:11:20.642, Speaker D: That we're doing is we're going green, so we're going to be buying offsets.
00:11:20.706 - 00:11:24.710, Speaker C: For all of the carbon produced by.
00:11:24.860 - 00:11:41.242, Speaker D: Crypto deposits and withdrawals through FTX. And I think we're probably going to do more than that as well and look at what we can do to try to fund some sort of more cutting edge research or development into ways to mitigate climate change.
00:11:41.296 - 00:11:44.778, Speaker C: But I think that's something which hopefully.
00:11:44.874 - 00:11:49.310, Speaker D: Giselle has thoughts on or is excited about. I know that she has expressed a lot.
00:11:49.460 - 00:11:52.014, Speaker C: I think it's something internally a number.
00:11:52.052 - 00:11:58.034, Speaker D: Of us do, a number of people in the industry do, and really excited to the extent this helps other people.
00:11:58.072 - 00:12:05.380, Speaker C: Think about how they can help the world. But if you don't care about this, that's totally up to you.
00:12:06.150 - 00:12:13.160, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment we're going to discuss some of the other recent news involving FTX. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:13:31.258 - 00:13:41.380, Speaker B: Thank. Also just enabled tokenized stock trading. What's your goal with that offering? Like, who do you think you can attract as a user that you're not attracting now?
00:13:41.830 - 00:13:44.066, Speaker D: Totally there's a few different pieces to it.
00:13:44.088 - 00:13:46.466, Speaker C: So one of it is just look.
00:13:46.488 - 00:13:54.022, Speaker D: At existing users and giving them anytime that they have to tab out to another app in order to trade another asset class.
00:13:54.076 - 00:13:56.246, Speaker C: We sort of feel like, man, is.
00:13:56.268 - 00:13:58.054, Speaker D: That app doing a better job than we are?
00:13:58.172 - 00:14:01.786, Speaker C: And if so, what can we do there? I think that's one piece of it.
00:14:01.808 - 00:14:03.690, Speaker D: Another piece of it is just looking.
00:14:03.760 - 00:14:06.378, Speaker C: At there are tons and tons of.
00:14:06.384 - 00:14:34.206, Speaker D: People who have interest in trading crypto and also have interest in trading stocks. I think one of the most poignant moments for me in this, and I apologize if I said this before to you, but it just really sticks with me is the moment that a bunch of brokers, including Robinhood, restricted buying of GameStop. Like literally that hour hundreds of millions of dollars flowed into. So it's just a really strong signal.
00:14:34.238 - 00:14:36.434, Speaker C: Of like it's the same people like.
00:14:36.472 - 00:14:38.962, Speaker D: These same people who are buying GameStop are buying dogecoin.
00:14:39.026 - 00:14:42.726, Speaker C: And I think frankly, the same people who are buying Tesla and Facebook are.
00:14:42.748 - 00:14:49.346, Speaker D: Probably buying bitcoin and seeing and you sort of hinted at this, like we're.
00:14:49.378 - 00:14:52.434, Speaker C: Seeing more and more convergence between as.
00:14:52.492 - 00:14:56.426, Speaker D: Crypto gets closer and closer to mainstream. Mainstream is getting closer and closer to.
00:14:56.448 - 00:14:58.202, Speaker C: Crypto because of this.
00:14:58.256 - 00:15:04.762, Speaker D: There are just a lot of people who want to trade both stocks and crypto who want to invest in both and we want to provide a platform where they can do that.
00:15:04.816 - 00:15:05.758, Speaker C: And so I think that's sort of.
00:15:05.764 - 00:15:15.666, Speaker D: One piece of it. It's just the generic, like why not both philosophy. But I think there's a few other things. One thing is FTX is now basically the only venue in the world that.
00:15:15.688 - 00:15:19.278, Speaker C: Offers real liquid 24/7 equities trading.
00:15:19.454 - 00:15:21.666, Speaker D: Traditionally equities exchanges are only open like.
00:15:21.688 - 00:15:24.178, Speaker C: 35 hours a week, which made a.
00:15:24.184 - 00:15:28.070, Speaker D: Lot of sense when you had to be physically in a pit with everyone else physically there at the same time.
00:15:28.140 - 00:15:38.342, Speaker C: To do a trade. Now it's all online, it's all global, there's no need to have that restriction, but basically no other exchanges have lifted it.
00:15:38.476 - 00:15:50.214, Speaker D: We saw an opening to be one of the few venues open in the middle of the night US time. That's sort of another opportunity that we saw there. We can cross margin it with everything else on the platform internationally.
00:15:50.262 - 00:15:52.074, Speaker C: And so that's sort of another really.
00:15:52.112 - 00:16:08.462, Speaker D: Cool thing, which again, there's no reason other people haven't done it other than that's a little bit complex if you haven't built out this system. But you can use your Apple stock as collateral to buy Bitcoin or you can use your Ethereum as collateral to short Facebook. And what this allows is one integrated.
00:16:08.526 - 00:16:13.186, Speaker C: Seamless trading experience where you can do whatever trades you want as long as.
00:16:13.208 - 00:16:17.106, Speaker D: You have enough total collateral to support it. So that's sort of the background on.
00:16:17.128 - 00:16:31.290, Speaker C: Offering equities in think at this point, I think it's basically public domain that we are in the process of activating a broker dealer license in the United States as well. And so, so far this has been.
00:16:31.360 - 00:16:37.146, Speaker D: Offshore, but that might not be true for long. The other thing though, and the thing.
00:16:37.168 - 00:16:40.158, Speaker C: That we just did is I mean.
00:16:40.164 - 00:16:41.278, Speaker D: I say we did it, but we.
00:16:41.284 - 00:16:42.670, Speaker C: Didn'T do the heavy lifting.
00:16:43.490 - 00:16:49.946, Speaker D: Know, Dag and CME worked with Boffin in Germany to create basically a regulatory.
00:16:49.978 - 00:17:07.254, Speaker C: Regime for actually truly tokenizing these equities. And what that means is that for the first time, there will be fully backed stock tokens that you can transfer on the blockchain, that you can move.
00:17:07.292 - 00:17:09.240, Speaker D: To your private wallet if you want.
00:17:09.610 - 00:17:12.326, Speaker C: That you can have control over, and.
00:17:12.348 - 00:17:14.738, Speaker D: That are redeemable for the underlying equity.
00:17:14.914 - 00:17:17.570, Speaker C: And they'll be trading on FTX, and.
00:17:17.660 - 00:17:19.754, Speaker D: They'Ll be creatable and redeemable, as always.
00:17:19.872 - 00:17:25.350, Speaker C: But there's also now the green light to make these movable.
00:17:25.510 - 00:17:30.462, Speaker D: And I think that is really exciting because it is basically for the first.
00:17:30.516 - 00:17:36.430, Speaker C: Time really actually bridging the gap between equities and blockchain.
00:17:37.650 - 00:17:39.806, Speaker A: This is all very fascinating and I.
00:17:39.828 - 00:17:54.014, Speaker B: Think some of the description that you gave there of the tokenized stock offering is meant to differentiate FTX's offering from the one by binance. Is that like because Binance, I believe they follow the market hours, et cetera, et cetera.
00:17:54.062 - 00:17:58.820, Speaker D: Yes, there's this much more like sort of the traditional Robin hood type.
00:17:59.910 - 00:18:11.222, Speaker B: So you know, FTX and Binance are similar in a few different know with having a US venue and one based in Asia. And obviously we're seeing now Binance's approach.
00:18:11.286 - 00:18:12.698, Speaker A: Of playing it a little bit on.
00:18:12.704 - 00:18:21.920, Speaker B: The looser side with regulation is starting to see blowback and they're even kind of being booted from some companies countries. So how does FTX avoid the same?
00:18:22.930 - 00:18:37.762, Speaker D: Totally. And obviously I can't speak to what's happening with them and I will say they've done absolutely phenomenally over the last year as a company. They're the only exchange that's been growing at the same rate that FTX has.
00:18:37.896 - 00:18:51.046, Speaker C: Over the last couple of years. But it's super impressive because they started from a high point and then kept growing and growing rapidly. So kudos to them for that growth. I think when it comes to the.
00:18:51.068 - 00:18:54.066, Speaker D: Regulatory side, obviously there's been some differences in our approach.
00:18:54.098 - 00:18:56.086, Speaker C: I've been certainly happy to have been.
00:18:56.108 - 00:18:59.126, Speaker D: Doing things the way we are. I think the biggest thing that I.
00:18:59.148 - 00:19:02.186, Speaker C: Would say here is it's easy to.
00:19:02.208 - 00:19:03.546, Speaker D: Run a business that will never run.
00:19:03.568 - 00:19:07.100, Speaker C: Afoul of regulators if you just don't do anything right.
00:19:07.710 - 00:19:15.930, Speaker D: It may serve trivial, but it was like worth noting, right, if your business literally is just a company with no business and no activities, you're not breaking any laws.
00:19:16.010 - 00:19:17.246, Speaker C: And the reason I say this is.
00:19:17.268 - 00:19:27.014, Speaker D: This is how I think a lot of people think about crypto regulation. They just have a single dimension of do more versus do less. If you have do more it's more illegal and if you do less it's more illegal.
00:19:27.162 - 00:19:30.446, Speaker C: And I totally get why you would have that prior.
00:19:30.558 - 00:19:43.750, Speaker D: And to be clear, if you're just like acting without any regards for the law, then that is correct. If you're just taking random actions without thinking about the legal consequences, then yeah, the more you do probably the more laws you're breaking. But the key thing which I think.
00:19:43.820 - 00:19:45.746, Speaker C: And again, this sounds sort of silly.
00:19:45.778 - 00:19:48.294, Speaker D: And obvious to point out, but I really do think it's the thing people.
00:19:48.332 - 00:20:04.446, Speaker C: Miss is that hopoch randomly, right, and in particular regulators goals aren't to kill industry and this is really really deeply true in most jurisdictions that you talk to them.
00:20:04.468 - 00:20:23.730, Speaker D: And this isn't just a line. They'll say they have a mandate from up high. The actual country cares about fostering industry regulars aren't trying to just create a perfect bliss of no activity because in the country it implodes. They're trying to work with businesses if they can.
00:20:23.880 - 00:20:25.026, Speaker C: And so I think the right way.
00:20:25.048 - 00:20:32.262, Speaker D: To think about regulators and obviously, look, it is different in each case, but the right general prior here isn't that they're trying to fuck you over.
00:20:32.316 - 00:20:44.810, Speaker C: The right prior is they're trying to find a way to let businesses grow while also having whichever protections they think are important for users, for the country.
00:20:44.960 - 00:20:51.580, Speaker D: Whether you're talking about anti money laundering, whether you're talking about sort of retail customer protection or anything else.
00:20:52.350 - 00:20:54.766, Speaker C: And what this means is that I.
00:20:54.788 - 00:20:56.046, Speaker D: Do think that there are ways to.
00:20:56.068 - 00:20:58.606, Speaker C: Have an ambitious business that does a.
00:20:58.628 - 00:21:03.418, Speaker D: Ton and maybe does even more than others while also being extremely compliant.
00:21:03.594 - 00:21:06.400, Speaker C: And the big thing there is basically.
00:21:06.710 - 00:21:26.854, Speaker D: Just thinking hard about what is it that regulators do or don't want. Looking at the legislation that's on the book, but looking beyond that, looking at the comments made by them, looking at the history of actions, talking to them, getting a sense of what they consider to be a good actor, especially when you're looking at gray area industries or.
00:21:26.892 - 00:21:30.502, Speaker C: Industries where regulations just haven't been written yet, right?
00:21:30.556 - 00:21:37.318, Speaker D: You can't just say, oh, there's statute 17, this is the answer. It's more nuanced than that. And it's understanding like do the regulators.
00:21:37.334 - 00:21:42.090, Speaker C: In this jurisdiction see their existing commodities.
00:21:43.890 - 00:21:48.746, Speaker D: Regulations as extending to cryptocurrencies or do they see crypto as a new asset.
00:21:48.778 - 00:21:51.274, Speaker C: Class pending a new set of legislation?
00:21:51.322 - 00:21:52.670, Speaker D: Like, that's sort of a classic question.
00:21:52.740 - 00:21:56.926, Speaker C: Which when the commodities legislation was written, crypto didn't exist.
00:21:56.958 - 00:21:57.986, Speaker D: So they're not going to say whether.
00:21:58.008 - 00:22:01.490, Speaker C: Or not ripple falls under that category.
00:22:02.390 - 00:22:04.834, Speaker D: And so really trying to work with.
00:22:04.872 - 00:22:08.342, Speaker C: Regulators and our general philosophy is we.
00:22:08.396 - 00:22:09.366, Speaker D: Want to be able to build the.
00:22:09.388 - 00:22:13.638, Speaker C: Products that our users want, but we.
00:22:13.804 - 00:22:26.266, Speaker D: Want to do that in a compliant way. And sometimes that means applying for licenses. And so anywhere that we can get licensed, we will. And we have a bunch of licenses, we're applying for a bunch more.
00:22:26.448 - 00:22:27.798, Speaker C: And we're reaching out to a bunch.
00:22:27.814 - 00:22:30.246, Speaker D: Of countries that don't have licensing regimes.
00:22:30.278 - 00:22:32.538, Speaker C: Yet and saying, hey, we'd love to.
00:22:32.544 - 00:22:33.590, Speaker D: Be a guinea pig here.
00:22:33.680 - 00:22:40.618, Speaker C: We'd love to work with you on building out a regime for whatever it is for curvative derivatives and so applying.
00:22:40.634 - 00:22:52.820, Speaker D: For licenses when we can get them so that we can do it in the most straightforward manner from a regulatory perspective and when there is no relevant license for a business understanding. Is this something that the regulators are comfortable with?
00:22:54.390 - 00:22:56.018, Speaker C: Usually we read that right.
00:22:56.184 - 00:23:05.094, Speaker D: No one always gets it right. Everyone will sometimes misjudge that and then being extremely responsive to regulators when they reach out and say, hey, we actually are not comfortable with what you're doing.
00:23:05.132 - 00:23:13.658, Speaker C: Here, saying like, oh, sorry about that, didn't realize that. Super appreciate that, super happy to shut this off.
00:23:13.824 - 00:23:15.066, Speaker D: But we also want to talk with.
00:23:15.088 - 00:23:20.618, Speaker C: You about is there a path forward to doing this? Is there a license that we should be applying for?
00:23:20.784 - 00:23:29.226, Speaker D: Should we be talking to you about what that might mean in the future? Rather than seeing licensing and regulation as just an attempt to kill the industry.
00:23:29.258 - 00:23:39.380, Speaker C: See it as like an attempt to have an industry that is pro social and good faith and working with that as best we can.
00:23:39.830 - 00:23:41.346, Speaker A: And do you have anything that you.
00:23:41.368 - 00:23:43.026, Speaker B: Would kind of name as like at.
00:23:43.048 - 00:23:46.678, Speaker A: The top of your regulatory wish list right now?
00:23:46.764 - 00:23:50.742, Speaker D: Totally, absolutely. Biggest thing by far always for us.
00:23:50.796 - 00:23:53.030, Speaker C: Is clarity on derivatives.
00:23:53.930 - 00:24:05.500, Speaker D: This is no competition for us in terms of what's the most important when it comes to AML KYC, which is probably the most important part of regulation when it comes to financial services.
00:24:05.950 - 00:24:08.010, Speaker C: There is more or less clarity.
00:24:09.550 - 00:24:19.806, Speaker D: There's lots and lots of case law on what duties financial businesses have to know their customer and prevent money laundering. Now there are some open questions there.
00:24:19.828 - 00:24:25.546, Speaker C: Which I do think matter, one of which the world is going to have to grapple with is to what extent.
00:24:25.738 - 00:24:35.250, Speaker D: Is it a meaningful statement to try and think about whether an autonomous smart contract has a duty to know its like, what does that even mean? So okay, there are some open questions.
00:24:35.320 - 00:24:36.738, Speaker C: There, but by and large it's like.
00:24:36.744 - 00:24:38.414, Speaker D: Yeah, we have an AML KYC policy.
00:24:38.472 - 00:24:39.814, Speaker C: You have to when it comes to.
00:24:39.852 - 00:24:46.166, Speaker D: Securities regulations in most countries, it's not a big problem for crypto. The United States is definitely on the.
00:24:46.188 - 00:24:48.246, Speaker C: More strict end there and we would.
00:24:48.268 - 00:24:55.254, Speaker D: Definitely appreciate more clarity from the SEC. I think we're not alone in that, in thinking that there's a whole swath.
00:24:55.302 - 00:24:59.418, Speaker C: Of tokens where it's just like no one knows whether they're going to be.
00:24:59.424 - 00:25:06.810, Speaker D: Considered unregistered securities or commodities or utility tokens or some new designation. And so I do think that matters.
00:25:06.890 - 00:25:08.446, Speaker C: But the truth of the matter is.
00:25:08.548 - 00:25:14.734, Speaker D: Three quarters of volume globally goes up in tokens that the SEC has signaled are not securities.
00:25:14.862 - 00:25:15.394, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:15.512 - 00:25:19.746, Speaker D: Like between bitcoin ethereum and then sort.
00:25:19.768 - 00:25:22.258, Speaker C: Of most of the older tokens you.
00:25:22.264 - 00:25:30.566, Speaker D: Can add up to a lot of volume. Pretty. So on that side we would appreciate more clarity, but it's not the most important thing. The most important thing for us by.
00:25:30.588 - 00:25:33.078, Speaker C: Far is almost no jurisdictions in the.
00:25:33.084 - 00:25:35.986, Speaker D: World have come out with comprehensive frameworks.
00:25:36.018 - 00:25:40.986, Speaker C: For derivatives, for crypto derivatives. And I think they're sort of aware of this.
00:25:41.008 - 00:25:41.946, Speaker D: This is sort of like on the.
00:25:41.968 - 00:25:44.378, Speaker C: Tenure roadmap for each of them.
00:25:44.544 - 00:25:47.046, Speaker D: But the problem is that two thirds.
00:25:47.078 - 00:25:49.862, Speaker C: Of volume trades in derivatives, in crypto.
00:25:49.926 - 00:25:51.342, Speaker D: This is the majority of the space.
00:25:51.396 - 00:26:00.400, Speaker C: Is happening in futures. I think that's just by far the biggest thing that we would love regulatory clarity on.
00:26:01.170 - 00:26:10.494, Speaker B: All right, yeah. And actually earlier when you were saying for some of the other coins where you're not sure if it's a security or commodity, I was thinking that probably applies to FTT.
00:26:10.542 - 00:26:13.538, Speaker C: Am I right about know, I think.
00:26:13.624 - 00:26:33.766, Speaker D: In many, many jurisdictions we have gotten clarity that it is a utility token, but not in all of them. And I think that is absolutely an example where obviously we haven't listed that on FTX us and that's an intentional decision. And I think that is certainly something where we would love SEC clarity. And I think there's a whole host.
00:26:33.798 - 00:26:36.346, Speaker C: Of tokens where frankly, these are things.
00:26:36.368 - 00:26:48.490, Speaker D: That don't have direct analogs where they don't quite necessarily obviously fit into it's not like an edible commodity or like a precious gem.
00:26:48.650 - 00:26:52.270, Speaker C: It's not like a voting equity.
00:26:53.830 - 00:27:05.454, Speaker D: Is it a currency? I don't know, really. The answer is what is a cryptocurrency? I mean, it's a new type of thing, and the sort of utility token.
00:27:05.502 - 00:27:08.306, Speaker C: Space in crypto is one where I.
00:27:08.328 - 00:27:14.134, Speaker D: Think, long run, we're not going to see them classified as existing objects. Long run, we're going to see new.
00:27:14.172 - 00:27:16.406, Speaker C: Regulations coming out that define them as.
00:27:16.428 - 00:27:21.210, Speaker D: A new asset class and come up with some set of rules around them.
00:27:21.360 - 00:27:22.940, Speaker C: But that hasn't happened.
00:27:25.150 - 00:27:34.880, Speaker B: I mean, in the US. We're really going to have to see because I just feel like I'm seeing kind of a huge range from some of the different lawmakers. So we'll see what happens.
00:27:35.490 - 00:27:39.470, Speaker D: You listen to the hearing today, and there's just a really wide range of opinions.
00:27:40.370 - 00:27:55.570, Speaker B: Yeah, almost disturbingly wide. And when I say that, I mean for all the education that I think the industry has done, there's some views that maybe seem a little bit less informed.
00:27:56.630 - 00:28:03.000, Speaker D: Some of them were certainly out there, but I think a lot of them were also yeah, I know that's reasonable. You'd also reasonably think something very different.
00:28:04.010 - 00:28:06.358, Speaker C: And whatever the regime is, it is.
00:28:06.524 - 00:28:09.526, Speaker D: And the biggest thing is preventing scenarios.
00:28:09.558 - 00:28:13.114, Speaker C: Where there's no reasonable path forward.
00:28:13.232 - 00:28:17.626, Speaker D: That's the thing that's most frustrating. If you tell us, just go for.
00:28:17.648 - 00:28:19.210, Speaker C: It, but don't be a dick and.
00:28:19.280 - 00:28:22.954, Speaker D: Don'T do anything scammy. Don't do anything that takes advantage of.
00:28:22.992 - 00:28:26.014, Speaker C: Users, don't do anything that helps money.
00:28:26.052 - 00:28:27.438, Speaker D: Laundering and don't do anything you obviously.
00:28:27.524 - 00:28:29.646, Speaker C: Think you shouldn't do, and we'll give.
00:28:29.668 - 00:28:31.230, Speaker D: Feedback as it goes along.
00:28:31.380 - 00:28:32.800, Speaker C: We can work with that.
00:28:33.170 - 00:28:36.946, Speaker D: And if instead you say, look, you can't do anything till you have a license and here's a license, here's the.
00:28:36.968 - 00:28:40.050, Speaker C: Application process, super happy to work with that.
00:28:40.120 - 00:28:42.206, Speaker D: The most frustrating thing is you need a license.
00:28:42.318 - 00:28:44.706, Speaker C: But also we haven't come up with one yet.
00:28:44.888 - 00:28:53.206, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. Right now it's a little bit slow moving here in the US. All right, well, I had a ton.
00:28:53.228 - 00:28:55.558, Speaker A: Of other things I also want to ask you about, but maybe we'll just.
00:28:55.564 - 00:29:08.262, Speaker B: Have you on for the longer show sometime soon, because I truly think there's so much that your various firms are doing in the space. And frankly, for any given one of them, we could spend an hour discussing some of the topics.
00:29:08.326 - 00:29:10.826, Speaker D: There's so much going on. Always happy to come on.
00:29:10.928 - 00:29:11.386, Speaker A: Okay.
00:29:11.488 - 00:29:14.014, Speaker B: All right, well, thank you so much for coming on the show this week.
00:29:14.052 - 00:29:15.470, Speaker A: It's been such a pleasure.
