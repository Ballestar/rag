00:00:00.170 - 00:00:44.294, Speaker A: I think WorldCoin solves just an absolutely key problem in decentralization technology. That problem is, of course, civil resistance or in plain language, being able to assign to one address the certification that that address belongs to a single human and just to take us through a few use cases of what that implies. Well, first of all, it has profound implications for decentralized governance and voting systems. Most voting systems in blockchain have been token weighted systems. They've been plutocratic. They've not always been fair. They've been kind of compromised by whales at times.
00:00:44.294 - 00:00:54.170, Speaker A: And having a proof of humanity will guarantee a one person, one vote voting systems. You'll enable systems that are, like, very, very democratic.
