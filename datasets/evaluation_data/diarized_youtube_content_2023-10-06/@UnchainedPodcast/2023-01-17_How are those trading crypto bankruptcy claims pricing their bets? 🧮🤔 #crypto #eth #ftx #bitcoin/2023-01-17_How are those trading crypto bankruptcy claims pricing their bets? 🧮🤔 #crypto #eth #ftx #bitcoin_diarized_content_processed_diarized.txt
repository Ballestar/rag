00:00:00.330 - 00:00:27.126, Speaker A: And then going further down. I mean, FDX other than today's big announcement, people were scratching their head. What does the numerator look like? What does the denominator look like? I have no clue. Is it 10 billion of claims? Is it 12 billion of claims? Is it 15 billion of claims? And also on the numerator, like, who's owning what? What is in the liquid portfolio? What about the venture stuff? Isn't that a lot of salana projects? Like? Isn't Solana dead? Now, I'm not saying it is.
00:00:27.148 - 00:00:28.166, Speaker UNK: I'm just saying these.
00:00:28.188 - 00:00:50.380, Speaker A: Are the questions that get asked within distress firms and they start saying, okay, we need an even bigger discount. And then there's wallets moving around. You hear about stuff on Twitter, about wallets moving around. And so again, now, not only we don't know what's going to happen, but the numerator and denominator are very fuzzy. And so you need bigger differences between what you pay and what you have the opportunity of making.
