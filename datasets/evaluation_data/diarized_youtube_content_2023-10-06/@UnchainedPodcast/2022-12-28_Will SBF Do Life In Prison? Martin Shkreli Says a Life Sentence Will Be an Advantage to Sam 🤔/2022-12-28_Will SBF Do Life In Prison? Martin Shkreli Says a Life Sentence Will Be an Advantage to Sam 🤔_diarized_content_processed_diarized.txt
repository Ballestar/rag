00:00:00.170 - 00:00:29.334, Speaker A: Has to be careful. Inmates can be very sensitive about, especially with respect to things like power or respect or notoriety or things like that. The one thing he has going for him, which is extremely interesting is that he's facing the life sentence. Many other prisoners are not. So my advice to Sam is if he gets into a bit of a TIFF, one of the things he can throw out there that will win the respect of his fellow prisoners is, I'm facing life. I'm not facing what you're facing. You're probably facing five years or ten years I'm looking at.
00:00:29.334 - 00:00:52.810, Speaker A: You can even use hyperbole here. But it's true. They could calculate his guideline sentence as 100 years or 200 years or 300 years, and he could throw that out there. And that will turn a lot of even the most surly prisoners stone faced. When you say something like that, they will realize that maybe he's right. And I think that that is the one thing in that prison environment for now that he kind of does have going for him is that he is kind of a financial gangster.
