00:00:00.250 - 00:00:34.500, Speaker A: I don't think it's the role of government to protect people from themselves, to ban investments that might be sensible investments, even if the government or a particular official doesn't like them. I think we do too much of that already. For instance, the way we limit all kinds of investment opportunities in things like private equity and hedge funds and venture capital only to wealthy individuals. Because the assumption is if you're not wealthy, you're not sophisticated, hated, you don't understand this, and so you're going to be forbidden. That's a terrible idea in my view, and I don't want to impose that in the crypto space.
