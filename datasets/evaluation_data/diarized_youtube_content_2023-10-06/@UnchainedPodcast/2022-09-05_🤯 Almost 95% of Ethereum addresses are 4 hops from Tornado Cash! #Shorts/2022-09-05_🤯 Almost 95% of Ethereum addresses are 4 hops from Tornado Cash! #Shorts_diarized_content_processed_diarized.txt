00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.966, Speaker A: There has been sort of a storm around that of hey, I get that. You know, maybe I can't, you know, if I've recently used tornado, maybe use your thing. But if I'm even if I'm one hop, which is, I think, like, 30% of all ethereum addresses or one hop from a tornado address or two hops from a tornado address, they can't use that. Really? Yes. Three hops is, like, 90%, and I think four hops is, like 95% or something like that. Someone had a chart. So it's like, if it's just like, what are we doing here? How reasonable can you sort of expect people to sort of comply? And this is all voluntary as well.
00:00:32.966 - 00:00:54.780, Speaker A: Right. No one is making them do these things. They're just thinking about, hey, how can I sort of minimize my potential risk? How can I sort of protect myself? Which I empathize with, I think, running a front end. You're still taking active service, you're hosting this thing. But it does feel like, you know what you're looking at three hops out from a tornado interaction. It feels very far.
