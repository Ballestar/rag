00:01:24.466 - 00:01:30.002, Speaker A: Today's guest is Ben Mezrick, author of the book bitcoin billionaires. Welcome, Ben.
00:01:30.146 - 00:01:32.010, Speaker C: Hey, thanks so much for having me.
00:01:32.160 - 00:01:35.338, Speaker A: Tell us what your book is about and how you came to write it.
00:01:35.504 - 00:02:00.210, Speaker C: Sure. Bitcoin billionaires is the true story of the winklevoss twins and their rise in bitcoin. It begins with the settlement they received from mark Zuckerberg. So it starts where the social network ended and then it goes all the way to bitcoin 10,000 or the first time bitcoin reached 10,000. So it's really the story of their journey through this new revolution having already been part of one other revolution.
00:02:00.870 - 00:02:17.590, Speaker A: And when you reference the social network, you are also the author of the book that that movie was based on. Since you previously wrote that book, how did you then decide to sort of do this quasiquel right?
00:02:17.660 - 00:03:09.518, Speaker C: Well, when I wrote accidental billionaires, which became the movie the social network, the winklevoss twins were the bad guys in that know, they were the alpha males, they were the jocks, they were the cool kids on campus who claimed that mark Zuckerberg had stolen the idea of Facebook from them. And when I wrote that book, they were kind of one note characters, I didn't know get to know them that deeply. And about a year and a half ago, I read in the New York times that the winklevoss twins were the first real bitcoin billionaires. And this kind of blew my mind. I didn't really know what bitcoin was. People had been pitching me stories about bitcoin for years, but I had kind of avoided it. And just seeing that the twins were suddenly back in this new story, it really intrigued me because you don't usually see second acts like that, and I got to know them again and realized I had gotten them wrong in the first telling.
00:03:09.518 - 00:03:16.678, Speaker C: And so I think the social network was unfair to them. And I think I'm kind of readdressing that with bitcoin billionaires.
00:03:16.854 - 00:03:19.020, Speaker A: And what exactly did you get wrong?
00:03:19.550 - 00:03:44.386, Speaker C: Well, those guys, when they walk into a room, there's like something out of Greek mythology. You meet them for the first time and they remind you of every 80s movie you've ever seen. They're the guys I hid from in high school. I was in a locker hiding from guys who looked like Tyler and Cameron, and I judged them. And when I wrote accidental billionaires, there was something really respectable about know. They were men of honor. They believed in right and wrong.
00:03:44.386 - 00:04:26.962, Speaker C: They believed that Mark Zuckerberg was screwing them over, and that was what drove them. So all of that I think, was correct. But I also painted them, I think, as know, one sided. So I think that's where I got them wrong. The reality mean these guys are very smart. They speak multiple languages, they're Latin scholars, and how they dove into bitcoin and sort of the new economy of cryptocurrency, it sheds an entirely new light on who they are. And then you go back to look at them in zuckerberg and you start to wonder, well, what was really going on there? I mean, were they really these guys that didn't know what they were doing and zuckerberg then built facebook? Or did they have some interesting ideas that mark ended up taking from them?
00:04:27.096 - 00:04:37.046, Speaker A: And there was some information I believe that you didn't have access to when you wrote accidental billionaires, which came out later. Can you talk about that a little bit and how that also changed your view?
00:04:37.228 - 00:05:06.974, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So these instant messages that were on Mark Zuckerberg's computer at college, they didn't come out till after the winklevoss twins ended up getting their settlement and pretty much after we did the social network. And these instant messages are pretty damning. They're Mark Zuckerberg strategizing about how to screw over the winklevoss twins. There's some quotes in there that are about how he calls all of us dumb. F's, I don't know what you can say on this.
00:05:07.092 - 00:05:08.542, Speaker A: No, let's not do that.
00:05:08.676 - 00:05:50.778, Speaker C: Right? But he basically talks about how people are foolish to give them all their information, how he feels like it's okay to be unethical as long as you don't do something illegal. All of these quotes make him look really bad. But they also frame his battle with the winklevoss twins differently because he admits in these instant messages to stringing them along with their idea and then launching facebook at the last minute so they can't do anything about it. And so this shows this strategy to destroy them. So I think this is very new information. He also, it turns out, had hacked into their website. They had created something called Theharvardconnection.com,
00:05:50.778 - 00:06:12.770, Speaker C: which was later renamed ConnectU. And he made a fake profile of Cameron Winklevoss with all of this kind of racist, sexist, horrible stuff in it and put it online. Now, if you were to do that today, in the environment of today, I mean, Zuckerberg would never have recovered from that. So this was something that didn't come out when we did the social network, and I think it colors him very badly.
00:06:13.270 - 00:06:32.120, Speaker A: So let's pan out a little bit, because obviously to write the two books, you had to research both social media or Internet 2.0. And then obviously now for the new book, bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies pretty extensively. So what's your assessment of the two types of technology and which are you more excited by?
00:06:32.570 - 00:06:55.502, Speaker C: Well, I will say they are both revolutionary. I think when Facebook first happened, it was this revolution in the social order. It changed how we all live. It made the whole world go online in a way that we hadn't before, and it changed everything. And now I feel like bitcoin is the same thing. I only choose stories where I think there's going to be some massive world change because of it. And bitcoin is one of these things.
00:06:55.502 - 00:07:48.946, Speaker C: And I came to this as someone who didn't know anything about it, who my parents generation called it a scam, and I believed it was a bubble or a scam. But as I looked into it, and as I sort of dove into this story, I came to believe that this is really a revolution in money, but it's also a way of freeing ourselves from all of these sort of shackles of an old world banking system of borders. It's something, if done correctly, can really be peer to peer, really doesn't need someone in between it. And I thought that was a really cool sort of concept. And so I do see in bitcoin some of the same things I saw in Facebook and which I'm more excited by now, is definitely bitcoin, because Facebook has taken a real turn. It's become this monster, which I believe it was always intended to be. I think Zuckerberg's plan was always to dominate the know.
00:07:48.946 - 00:08:10.220, Speaker C: He says so himself in his instant messages. I think he always wanted us all to live on Facebook without power over our own data, because he thinks a world where we can share our data completely is a better world. So I think Facebook is actually going the other way, where people are starting to see it as this bad, dangerous thing, while digital money is just getting started.
00:08:10.750 - 00:08:25.550, Speaker A: And do you feel that there's a reason for why we're seeing this interest in bitcoin and in decentralization broadly? Do you think that's part of this backlash that we're seeing against Facebook? Or are they not really related?
00:08:25.890 - 00:09:09.114, Speaker C: Oh, I think they're definitely related. I think we're seeing a revolution going on and people know, feeling the weight of companies like Facebook and not just facebook. Let's be fair. Google, all of these major companies, they feel know they're taking advantage of us in a way that they've created something out of the internet that it wasn't intended to be. I mean, the internet was supposed to be free and open, an exchange of ideas without anybody sort of harnessing all of that and siloing it. And what facebook and these major companies did was found a way to make money off of our data by controlling it and by capturing it. And I do think this trend well, you have to admit bitcoin started as this libertarian, almost anarchistic thing.
00:09:09.114 - 00:09:37.490, Speaker C: It was a form of philosophy in a way. It was a way of being free, not having anything in between, not as secret as it could be. And I think these still feed into it even as it becomes more regulated and part of the system. So I do think what's going on in money is a response to things like facebook, but also overarching government as a whole, or the feeling that more and more we're being controlled by other people. I do think bitcoin is sort of a freeing mechanism.
00:09:38.070 - 00:09:47.394, Speaker A: So we're going to discuss the swing in the opposite direction. And what I mean by that is facebook's. Libra in a moment. But first, a quick word from our fabulous sponsors.
00:09:47.522 - 00:10:40.790, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

Back to my conversation with Ben Mezrick, author of Bitcoin Billionaires. So as you mentioned initially, Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg maybe had the intention to have a centralized platform that the world would be on and you talked about how bitcoin or decentralization might be a response to that. But now Facebook is trying to kind of get on that train as well. What's your take on Facebook's, Libra?
00:12:28.054 - 00:13:22.406, Speaker C: I mean, how incredibly insane is it that the Winklevoss twins rise up in bitcoin and create Gemini and launch a Gemini dollar and all of a sudden Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg respond, launching Libra? I ended Bitcoin Billionaires on the last chapter with Zuckerberg contemplating a cryptocurrency. And I wrote this a year ago and for me I believe it was all personal. I think Zuckerberg sees the Winklevoss twins rising in this new form of money that Silicon Valley missed entirely. Facebook, all of these companies are so late in the game in digital, but it makes perfect sense that he would launch one because Facebook's goal is to dominate everything and I think this is another mechanism for that, an even bigger one. So it is fascinating that they're launching Libra. I think Libra is both exciting and terrifying. It's exciting in that everyone and their mom is going to suddenly have an electronic wallet.
00:13:22.406 - 00:14:04.330, Speaker C: Everyone is going to get comfortable with using digital money with peer to peer, but not really peer to peer because Libra isn't really that way. But the idea of crypto, this is a big on ramp, but at the same time this is still Facebook and not just Facebook now ebay and Uber and all of these people who signed up to be the center of this decentralized thing. So what you're seeing is Facebook finding a way to create a crypto that keeps them in the middle. So it is terrifying. I mean, suddenly Facebook is going to have access to an enormous amount of data and information is going to be taking your money, holding it, earning money on it, but it's also allowing you to get used to electronic.
00:14:07.630 - 00:14:35.410, Speaker A: Mean. You said that basically you think this is personal, which is kind of interesting. And so in that light, if Libra is basically going to roll cryptocurrency or digital currency out to a larger user base than any previous company has so far, to a user base that's larger than any country even on earth, do you think that Tyler and Cameron could be sort of eclipsed on their own turf?
00:14:35.830 - 00:15:03.610, Speaker C: I mean it's know and people, when I say this is all know, I get pushback obviously. People are like oh, it's just a coincidence. I really don't think this is a coincidence. How does he call it Libra? He's fully aware of the twins in Gemini. He also have to remember that Zuckerberg was a know. He started off as a computer hacker. He launched Facebook after hacking all of the computers at Harvard and making a website where you could compare girls and choose who was the hottest girl at Harvard.
00:15:03.610 - 00:15:31.650, Speaker C: This is a guy who has a strange sense of humor, who definitely was the epitome of an internet troll. I mean, he hacked the website of Cameron and Tyler and made a webpage making fun of Cameron. So I do not put it past him to do this on purpose. And yes, it could eclipse Gemini, it could eclipse the twins. On the other hand, they made this huge investment in Bitcoin. They own 1% of all Bitcoin, which they bought between seven and $10 a coin.
00:15:31.810 - 00:15:33.270, Speaker A: 1% at that time.
00:15:33.420 - 00:16:05.474, Speaker C: At that time, right. So they've made billions on this, or at least close to 2 billion at this point. More, if you believe that they've bought more on the dips. Nobody knows for sure, I don't think, how much they have. But if this bolsters the entire thing, and I think it will, because you have to remember Libra, it's not a store of value like gold. Libra is tied to fiat. Right? So Libra isn't something that you invest in, it's something that you use while Bitcoin is trending more and more to something you invest in rather than something that you use.
00:16:05.474 - 00:16:16.050, Speaker C: So if Libra succeeds, you could foresee Bitcoin succeeding similarly, like know, like rising and rising and rising as more and more people use Libra.
00:16:16.410 - 00:16:30.330, Speaker A: So, as somebody who has been following the Facebook story, what do you think Mark or Facebook can do, or should do with Libra? Given what the public perceives is a poor track record around privacy?
00:16:30.670 - 00:16:59.794, Speaker C: I mean, that's a great and I would say, listen, Facebook has a lot of problems and I think one of them is they're built around harvesting data and using it to make money. And that's a horrible look. It's very hard to get past that. It makes them all look very bad. They are offering themselves up to regulation. They keep saying, Regulate us, we want to be regulated. Which is really their way of saying let us regulate ourselves or let's find a way to look better in front of everybody.
00:16:59.794 - 00:17:43.198, Speaker C: I think they need to find a way to change their business model. I think that Libra has to be perceived as something that is really not giving them data that they're not taking and using that data for any other reason, that it's merely a mechanism for paying for something which they enable, but they take nothing else from it. I'm not certain what the actual steps are you could take to do that and you might know better than me. I just think that they have a real perception problem because of the way their business is built. You really should be able to use facebook and not have your data used to target things at you. Mark zuckerberg liked to know. It enhances our experience.
00:17:43.198 - 00:18:01.590, Speaker C: Nobody's experience is enhanced by advertising. Advertising is never enhancing your experience. It's just part of the process to pay for something. So I think that that's not true. So I think they need to find a way to get past that use of data. And libra is something that shouldn't be used for data gathering.
00:18:02.170 - 00:19:01.914, Speaker A: Yeah, well, facebook has launched this subsidiary, calibra, which will be the wallet, and supposedly there will be a wall between calibra and facebook. But I think the issue still is that calibra, simply by virtue of being embedded in WhatsApp and messenger, will just amass vast amounts of data, financial data, on know, then calibra is the one to worry about. So one other thing I wanted to ask about the kind of rivalry that you discussed between mark and the twins. In my understanding of things, it sort of seems like mark kind of screwed the twins over. So in that regard, he won. Right. So then what would motivate him to keep up this kind of personal rivalry or animus, right? I could understand if from their side they felt that way, but then I don't understand why from his side he would.
00:19:02.032 - 00:19:40.770, Speaker C: Well, you go back to the story, and this is recounted in bitcoin billionaires, but he won in a way. He settled with them for $65 million, which they then took in stock, which ended up being worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the IPO. But they didn't stop there. They really believed that they deserved more and that he had screwed them over. And as these IMS came out later, they attempted to reopen the case multiple times. It was shot down by judges who had their own issues, and so they didn't give up. At that point, I framed the whole book, like the count of Monte cristo, where they disappeared to a cave and come back riding into town with their billions of dollars in bitcoin.
00:19:40.770 - 00:20:23.906, Speaker C: But the reality is they maintained this whole of animosity essentially because they felt that they had been wronged and wronged again and it hadn't recovered. It was definitely true that when they went out to silicon valley after the settlement and tried to become investors, nobody would take their money because everyone's endgame was to sell to facebook. And everyone knew zuckerberg harbored this animosity towards them. So his animosity didn't go away. Then you have the movie right, the social network, and all of the resulting publicity, which continued this personal psycho drama in the public eye for many, many years afterwards. And I don't think zuckerberg ever really went away from know. He's the kind of guy who is difficult to get along with.
00:20:23.906 - 00:20:51.260, Speaker C: You've seen person after person leave the company and then say bad things about it, or if they have a non disclosure, not say anything at all. Because of the way he treats people who are partners of his, I don't believe that he walks away from this and just forgets about that's. Listen, someone needs to ask him, and no one does, about what he thinks of the Winklevoss twins now. And I'd be curious to hear the answer, but I don't believe he's completely forgotten about them.
00:20:52.430 - 00:21:26.882, Speaker A: All right, well, my last question for you is more about your writing and reporting process, because as I was reading the book, I could not help but notice that there were a lot of details where I just thought, how does Ben know that? For instance, there, you know, maybe was a detail where you said, like, oh, Charlie's rolling suitcase snagged on the floor as he walked in the airport, or the person in front of Cameron in the airport security line was wearing argyle socks, or there were just numerous details like that. So how did you find those details? And also, how did you recreate so much dialogue?
00:21:27.026 - 00:22:03.394, Speaker C: Yeah, so the way I do my process is I spend a lot of time with the characters. So the Winklevoss twins with know spoke to Roger Vere? As much as I could to Eric Voorhees. I talked to all of these people. I get all of the court documents that I can. Charlie's arrest scene is a really fascinating scene, and I built that scene off of talking to him for a very long time. And he's read the book and said that that scene felt absolutely real, like it was yesterday. And so my goal in creating those scenes, essentially recreating those scenes, is to take all of the information I've been given by the people who were there and then paint the picture as much as I can.
00:22:03.394 - 00:22:39.402, Speaker C: So details like his suitcase snagging on the ground, well, he describes to me, going through the airport, the arrest process, what's going through his head, and the fumbling along in that scene is recreated from that. So I'm painting the picture. Now, I write differently than some journalists do. If I were writing for The New York Times, you wouldn't get that level of detail. Know, the color of his suitcase would be something that you couldn't definitely know. Right. But the way I write narrative nonfiction and I'm very open about this, is I'm recreating the scene based on the memories of the people who were there and the information that I can gather about that scene.
00:22:39.402 - 00:23:07.458, Speaker C: And then I draw the scene. So it is like watching a movie about that scene. It would be very hard to film a movie scene showing Charlie getting arrested in the airport without describing the airport. Right. So you look at the airport and you describe it. You can't possibly know what the color of the wall was ten years ago, but, you know, there was a color on that wall. And so for me, painting a nonfiction picture is really similar to what a movie does, which is you frame the shot.
00:23:07.458 - 00:23:29.198, Speaker C: This is what that shot would look like. This is how Charlie remembers that shot. Dialogue is similar. You interview the people who were there, they tell you what was spoken about. You don't get the exact words. And then again, if you were writing for the New York times, you might need the exact words. But if you're painting the picture for a movie or a form of narrative nonfiction, it's not the exact words that matter as much as what was said.
00:23:29.198 - 00:23:43.886, Speaker C: So that's a choice I make. I understand that there are going to be journalists out there who don't like that form of nonfiction, but at the same time, I think it's a very valid form of nonfiction and a good way to tell a story to a mass audience.
00:23:44.078 - 00:23:51.714, Speaker A: And you keep talking about how you try to frame it like a movie. And as far as I understand, is this also being optioned for a film?
00:23:51.842 - 00:24:12.990, Speaker C: This is an already bought film. This is a movie. We haven't announced who or where or what yet. Columbia is planning to distribute it. They're the ones who did the social network, but we're already looking into writing, directing, and actors. I would love to see Armie Hammer come back as the twins. I think he is the perfect winklevoss twins.
00:24:12.990 - 00:24:26.580, Speaker C: We've joked around on the internet about who should play Charlie someone, but there's lots of great possibilities. But, yeah, this will definitely be a movie, and soon we will announce details about that.
00:24:27.270 - 00:24:33.214, Speaker A: Great. Well, that's something that we can all look forward to. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
