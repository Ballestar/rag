They only teach the gospel. Whereas we used to have normal people that were very into the technology and into the they weren't trying to push a gospel on you. They were trying to educate you on how this logi works, what the drawbacks are. And the community was more like I don't know if I would say the community chooses its leaders or the leaders changes the community. I don't know which one of those it is, but it is a symptom of where we are today with the community that we don't have leaders that speak about the quirks and sort of the negative sides and the things that we need to fix.
