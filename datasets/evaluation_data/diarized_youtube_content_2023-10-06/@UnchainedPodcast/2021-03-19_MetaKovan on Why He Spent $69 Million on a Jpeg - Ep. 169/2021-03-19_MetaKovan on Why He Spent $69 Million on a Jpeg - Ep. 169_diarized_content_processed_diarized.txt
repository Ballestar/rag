00:01:47.870 - 00:01:54.574, Speaker A: Today's guest is Metacovin founder and financier of Metapurse. Welcome, Medicovin.
00:01:54.702 - 00:01:56.980, Speaker B: Thank you, Laura. Thank you for having me.
00:01:57.910 - 00:02:09.000, Speaker A: So you purchased a collection of 5000 pieces of digital art that anyone can easily see online for $69 million. Why did you do that?
00:02:10.410 - 00:03:40.110, Speaker B: I get this a lot these days, definitely. So actually this trend of NFDS is something that's very new, but NFDS itself is not. And I've been in NFD since 2017, we've been focused on understanding and seeing what these NFDS mean in the larger context. And so we developed various thesis around how we look at this and what is this going to do to the world. And so we've been doing several purchases over now, two, three years, right? And we've been into our collectibles virtual land art from various artists. And so by December last year, what really caught my attention was the fact that art coming into crypto and creating this cultural moment is causing a new set of people to come into the space, right? Like artists need not be technical. It's almost like you take your skill in 20, 14, 15 maybe you should have your tech skill or your computer skill and then that's how you mine for ethereum, right? Like or bitcoin.
00:03:40.110 - 00:04:21.578, Speaker B: And now if you are skilled in some other way, you're good in say, Adobe Illustrator or something, you get your chance to mine your ethereum. Right. That's something of how I see it. And it's very nice because we are allowing so many new people to enter. And what happened was we had a greater thesis on understanding what these NFTs mean and how these artists will become more valuable in the future. So Beeple was one of them who we thought is going to be the artist of our generation. He has all the parameters which make him one of the most precious artists.
00:04:21.578 - 00:04:37.906, Speaker B: And it's a bet, right? Like, I'm not saying we paid the right amount or we know exactly what we were doing. Right. But what I'm trying to say is it's a bet on the fact that Beeple is going to be the artist of our generation.
00:04:38.098 - 00:04:51.020, Speaker A: So can you fill out that thesis around NFTs and this virtual world a little bit more and also explain why it is that Beeple you felt really fit all these parameters that you're looking for?
00:04:52.190 - 00:05:20.670, Speaker B: Sure. So NFTs are if you take art, digital art, and that's backed by an NFT, I would say it's ten X better than the physical counterpart. Again, physical counterpart have history. Right. I'm not taking that away from them. But think about something that's done today. Right? What I'm saying is, if you take it for cost, a lot of people compare.
00:05:20.670 - 00:05:45.370, Speaker B: Like, oh yeah, Mona Lisa is worth so much. Yeah, it is worth so much. But it's not the paint that's worth so much. Right. It's the skill, it's the story, it's the painter itself. There are a lot of other parameters that is not just what tools or the paint, the cost of the paint that went into something. So there is a lot of subjective value here.
00:05:45.370 - 00:06:39.370, Speaker B: So that same subjective value can carry to the digital realm. I don't think that's going to be the question. The harder question is, is this not replicable? Right? Like, can we not copy paste, et cetera? But in the case of people, the beauty is that there is a story, right? He's an artist, a digital artist who has been very I would say I want to use the word honorable because that's where we are going in terms of artists and NFTs because that's how you if you are an artist and you want to make sure you are relevant into the future, I think you need to be a honorable person. Right. Like, you need to understand scarcity. You need to understand your collectors. You need to make sure that you're not here to grab some cash from people.
00:06:39.370 - 00:06:51.550, Speaker B: So what people did was he has worked over 5000 years every day, right? Like, he worked on the day he was getting married. He worked on the day he had a child. Right?
00:06:51.620 - 00:06:52.670, Speaker A: 5000 days.
00:06:52.820 - 00:07:32.126, Speaker B: Yeah, 5000 days, yeah. Sorry if I said something else. 5000 days every day, and that's very inspiring to me. And if you look at this Christie's piece, the first picture is so amateurish. It's something I can draw, right? Like a ten year old can draw. And the latest one is something that's so complex. And if you take the whole thing together, it's an inspiration to tell people, to tell the world that the only thing that's unhackable is time.
00:07:32.126 - 00:07:38.510, Speaker B: And if you put in effort every day, you would be successful.
00:07:39.410 - 00:08:26.240, Speaker A: And just out of curiosity, how would this be different if there was an artist who worked on one piece of art for 13 years and then presented it? And even by that I mean, it doesn't have to be a visual art. It could be like a book or a movie or whatever. Do you understand what I'm saying? In a way, it's almost like similar to when you go to a museum and you see that the artist has done a bunch of sketches before they did the final painting. In a way, it's almost like these are I don't even know how to describe them, but I don't want to call them exercises. But what you can do in a day versus what you can do in a year, that's quite a different thing. Right. So I just wonder, how would you value a piece of art like that.
00:08:30.690 - 00:09:01.562, Speaker B: Speaking to people and understanding his ideology and his kind of work? What inspired me, really, is like he sets a very low bar for every day, right? Like each day, what he wants to put out there, it's not his master work. You have to put out something. And that's very inspiring to me. It's like going to the gym every day. Right. We all say we want to, but we never do. Right.
00:09:01.562 - 00:09:26.030, Speaker B: We have to show up. And that's all it matters if you think about it. So, yeah, someone working over 13 years is still very awesome to create one piece of art. But what is the proof of work that they worked every day on it, right? Maybe they skipped a weekend, we don't know. Right. And what's beautiful about people is he put out all of these pieces over time. Right.
00:09:26.030 - 00:09:40.600, Speaker B: And we are from the crypto industry and we understand proof of work that way. And so there is some evidence on the internet which says that people actually did what he's saying he did. So that's very important too.
00:09:41.210 - 00:09:56.620, Speaker A: Then. I also do want to ask, though, I know that I kind of asked this before, but since people can still see these online and they don't need to have spent $69 million to do so so what do you think that you actually bought with that money?
00:09:57.390 - 00:10:25.246, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's the thesis of NFTs itself. So when I was saying NFTs are ten x better than the physical counterpart. One of the things which I really like about NFTs is the fact that it's composable. We should understand that it's very similar to another. Defy protocols are awesome because they are composable. Right. And in the same way NFT is just on the ethereum blockchain.
00:10:25.246 - 00:11:13.234, Speaker B: If you think about it now we can do hundreds of things about them. Like for example, a physical art is maybe owned by one person or say three, four people. I don't know if three, four people will want to own physical art. It has that feeling of being owned by one person and kept in one location. Right. So what happens is we recognize a few historical physical art which through how relevant they are, like Mona Lisa. Most of the world's population has not seen Mona Lisa in person but they recognize it, right? Like how did that happen? That's because of a picture and most people don't believe that they own it.
00:11:13.234 - 00:11:50.240, Speaker B: Right. It does not destroy the value of the physical piece itself just because I have a copy of Monolith in my computer or it's pasted all over the internet. Right. In the same way, what the NFT does is that it packs the whole story into it. If it's this piece, it packs the fact that people worked on it for 13 years, it packs the fact that people actually minted this on this time and it packs the fact that we actually bought it at this time. And all of this goes to the NFT and the blockchain. Right.
00:11:50.240 - 00:12:48.994, Speaker B: And all this provenance and everything which was historically the auction house's major job and what they used to take the maximum cost for is all gone because they are all very simply recorded. And now using that because we can pull them into various composable stuff, maybe there could be fractionalization that can just be done, right? Like you can take a NFT and then divide them into say 100 million tokens and then sell them, right? I'm not planning to do that with this particular piece at least yet. But that's an option I have. Right, and that's not an easy option if it's a physical art. Right. We have to make sure in the physical world that becomes a security if you think about it. Because you have to trust the person to store it properly, right.
00:12:48.994 - 00:13:06.280, Speaker B: And in the case of NFTs, it's on chain, it'd be on the smart contract. The only risk is the smart contract getting hacked. But that's always going to be know like you don't have to trust the issuer of the token that the NFT is actually backing the token, right.
00:13:06.890 - 00:13:35.930, Speaker A: So we're going to dive a little bit more into what gives these NFTs value and how people are creating value from them. But first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. With over 10 million users, crypto.com is the easiest place to buy and sell.

Download the Crypto.com app now and get $25 by using the code Laura. The link is in the description. Back to my conversation with Metacovin. So I also just wanted to flesh out a little bit more of what your vision of the Metaverse will look like in the future and even just describe Metaverse and then describe what you expect that will look like.
00:14:13.810 - 00:15:19.054, Speaker B: So Metaverse is not very different from what crypto like, people in crypto. We've been experiencing something of this global community for a while now, right. I feel like the Ethereum conferences itself is a very inspiring one, where it never happens in one place, it never happens in one country. And that's very inspiring because if you are part of the Ethereum community, what you know is that if you attend all DevCons, probably you also get to go around the world, right, and probably with the money you made with Ethereum. So that's very interesting, right, as an experience and being part of the community. Now, what I feel about MetaWars is that we are just like that word might feel like very futuristic and a little bit very confusing. But think about there is this 3D Metawers also, which is being created in the virtual worlds and that's where we are building museums, et cetera.
00:15:19.054 - 00:16:26.582, Speaker B: But there is this 2D world also, like Discard for example, is where there are new communities that's not purely technical. So with the crypto and up to the defy, the growth, I think we had a lot of technical people move into crypto, but right now we have other kinds of people, artists, singers, performance artists, like different kinds of people with different talent. They are all moving in and forming their own communities. Right? And that's very interesting if you think about what it implies. And that means that we are creating this online community, allowing the creation of online communities of like minded people and then this will translate into physical things. So instead of going to the boring I don't know, I'm just kidding, but going to the boring technical DevCons, maybe at some point there'll be more entertaining ones, right? That all was created online. Right.
00:16:26.582 - 00:16:59.458, Speaker B: So I feel like the Metaverse is just going to complement what's happening in the physical world. And I don't imagine too much of a Dystopian world where we just start living in Metaverse like a ready player, one at least yet. And I don't want to live in that world either. Yeah, exactly. In a sense that I like the MetaWars, but you get to use only two or three of your senses and that's not very cool. Right, so the physical world still times the Metawers. Definitely.
00:16:59.458 - 00:17:09.654, Speaker B: At least we're not there yet. So I guess MetaWars is just a way for you to meet like minded people and get them onto the physical world.
00:17:09.852 - 00:17:23.210, Speaker A: So for you, you go by a pseudonymous name and for the people who are watching the video, they'll see that you're using an avatar and not showing your face. Why not just be open about your identity?
00:17:24.990 - 00:19:12.830, Speaker B: Actually, this is a very deep question. Also, it's not like people who work with me or people in the community, a lot of them actually know me, right? Because end of the day, if I go to a conference, we are going to meet each other in person, right? So a lot of us who meet each other are like, okay, yeah, this is who we are in real life and this is what I did before I became Metacovan. And I'm also quite comfortable and probably with all this media attention, it's harder to keep this under wraps because there is always some kind of leakage, right? So it gets out. But the fact is that this specific character over time creates this very interesting connection for me with the know the real person in me feels very differently than this character. Now where Metacovan, how he's received and the other guy who how he's received, right? Like I could be the same guy inside, but I'm very different to people and if I come on another podcast and be the other guy, I don't know if you would ask the same questions also, right? Like it'll be a very different podcast. And I told this to someone, maybe the real guy would not have bought the $69 million pick, but Metacovan did, right? And that's very important because he's already living in the Metawers. And I feel like right now I'm operating that character, right? In the future it could be someone else or a team who could operate it too.
00:19:12.980 - 00:19:37.960, Speaker A: This is becoming such an interesting conversation. One thing I've heard is in another interview you said that you came to Crypto with nothing. And so I was curious to hear how did you make so much money in Crypto? Like, what was it that you did in such a short period of time? And then what made you feel comfortable spending so much of it on something that many other people don't even think has value?
00:19:39.050 - 00:21:43.406, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the question for the real guy, right? Because Metacode came in rich and he's just spending the other guy's money. Now, the thing is that when I started in Crypto 2013, I had no money and this community was so open, right? Now, maybe we feel after especially after the ICO thing, there is lot of suspect we are thinking about other people and thinking what's their intention, right? But back in 2013, people are like, yeah, come on, come on. Because there was no one building anything on Bitcoin, right? So I started back then when people were wanting to create that community very welcoming and that's what got me started. I started on forums. I used to create some kind of service so that I can make a little bit of money and that grew with the industry and my life also slowly grew and I became part of the larger bitcoin community. And when Ethereum came up, I was lucky enough to have the knowledge that there's going to be a crowd sale and why that crowd sale was important and I got to invest in that, right? So a little bit of the money, it's not a lot meaning in the larger context, but that was my starting point where I invested a little bit of money into Ethereum. That taught me that this was a huge opportunity where it's like investing in a startup, right? A lot of people who think about Ethereum's growth as something that's very unnatural, but Uber was $100 billion.
00:21:43.406 - 00:22:01.438, Speaker B: Square is $100 billion. Right. It's just that it allowed lot of people to make money and not like fight ten people. That's good. Right. And I think I carried the same attitude in terms of investments into the other trends. So I always understood trends.
00:22:01.438 - 00:23:09.242, Speaker B: I worked on crypto every day and I understood trends and I saw new projects for what they are researched. I did take my Ethereum and start snowballing them into the other important protocols polkadot up to flow till now. So it's been a continuous process for me. So that takes 33% of my time, right? I read and I talk to people and make sure I'm up to date because it's very hard to do that too. So that's one of the guys behind it. Right, but what I like and the other question you asked of what gave me the strength to spend this money? Right? That's a very different question because for a guy who had no money in 2013, what gives him the strength? Because I could be doing 100 other things. I don't know if I'd be doing 100 other things.
00:23:09.242 - 00:24:06.380, Speaker B: Actually the money that came to me came from crypto and I feel like it's great that I'm able to do the same thing, change someone's life in a very inspiring way. And that inspiration could touch millions of people now, right? Like it's in the mainstream. It's going to bring lot of artists into NFDS and they are going to make their first $1,000 just like I did in 2013. And we'd be there too. We are not just buying beeples, we are buying every artist. And we've spent a lot of money not just on the big names, the stars, but we are using stars for the headlines. And we've been supporting all new artists that are interesting and they understand what this system is and they are from different parts of the world.
00:24:06.380 - 00:24:10.074, Speaker B: This is their first leg up and that's what I enjoy.
00:24:10.192 - 00:24:12.650, Speaker A: And when you say we, are you talking about metapers?
00:24:13.170 - 00:24:14.282, Speaker B: Yeah, metaphors.
00:24:14.346 - 00:24:20.480, Speaker A: And just quickly, like a yes or no, did you have any background in art before you started doing this?
00:24:22.050 - 00:24:29.682, Speaker B: I didn't have any background in finance, economics, art before I started crypto, everything. Crypto teaches us everything.
00:24:29.816 - 00:24:40.520, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. So can you briefly describe your vision for metapers and also tell us about the B 20 token? We're running out of time, but I obviously want to be sure to touch on these things.
00:24:41.050 - 00:25:19.220, Speaker B: Sure. So, like metaphors itself, again, I just started it on my own, right? Okay. So I started collecting NFDS on my own, and it was just a hobby. I didn't think too much about it. But then when Tubadur, who's the steward of metabolism, who actually is the art collector in our team, I saw him very interested in all these things, and he built his own name. He's a good writer, and he had his own social network with the artists. I was like, yeah, this is very interesting.
00:25:19.220 - 00:25:47.546, Speaker B: I'm deploying capital. Why don't you do that? Right. And we thought, okay, let's have a name for this. And that became metaphors, right. So I consolidated all my NFTs into it, and instead of slowing down, we really pushed the gas. And we've been doing this since, I think, July last year, and it's been going very well. Right.
00:25:47.546 - 00:26:42.070, Speaker B: So what now happens with metaphors is that we collect various artists that's on one side. But once in a while, I also try to think about the thesis of MetaWars and see how I can push it forward. So one of them were when people second drop came out, when he had 20 pieces, right? And we were thinking the first drop went for $66,000. And I was thinking, okay, it'll be very interesting if we could buy all the pieces, right. And we could create a museum out of it, and so that it'll be interesting because it will attract that kind of attention and curiosity from a lot of people. So we tried doing that. It was hard, the stories in multiple other podcasts, but it created this news cycle where it was Tubado's conviction in me, which also made it happen.
00:26:42.070 - 00:27:33.920, Speaker B: But we bought the 20 pieces, built the museum, and what we did was we took the land, the museum designs, the art, the soundscape in the museum all together, and put it in a smart contract, bundled them together, and then created tokens, 10 million tokens, and then sold around 40% of it. Right. So the whole experience was very interesting because it didn't involve any accountants, right? Like, if I did it in the real world, imagine it's very similar to creating a mall, right. I would have spent 30% of the funds on just that. But this was very interesting because it was an experiment. We didn't even price it, like ten X or something, which we price it at 30% premium so that we can cover our costs. But that's it.
00:27:33.920 - 00:27:49.778, Speaker B: To be transparent, I've not sold any of my b 20 tokens that I kept, and that's been a question that's going rounds also. So it's not like I sold my B 20 in order to purchase this vehicle. It's all new money.
00:27:49.864 - 00:27:50.820, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:27:51.350 - 00:27:53.650, Speaker B: We are going to hold on to the B 20s for a while.
00:27:53.720 - 00:28:36.100, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Because obviously, I'm sure you saw the criticism that the Christie sale brought positive press to people and NFTs, and then that boosted your stake in the B 20 token. Okay, well, obviously this is just such a fascinating conversation because I really feel like, in a way, what you're talking about is so new that a lot of people can't grasp it, and yet at the same time, I'm not quite sure if the reason is because it's not going to go anywhere. I think we're going to have to have you on in the future and we will see what happens between now and then.
00:28:39.190 - 00:28:48.550, Speaker B: I'm a fan of your podcast and I really like how you're very frank. Right. Like you're to the point. So yeah, I would ever enjoy being in the podcast again.
00:28:48.620 - 00:28:52.754, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. Well, this was super fun. Thank you so much for coming on, unconfirmed.
00:28:52.882 - 00:28:54.774, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
00:28:54.892 - 00:29:48.694, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Thanks for tuning in to this week's News recap. First headline crypto exchanges race to go public coinbase filed an amended S One with the US. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Disclosing the exchange has registered roughly 115,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock. In preparation for the public listing, which does not yet have a date, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong hosted a virtual AMA or ask me anything on Reddit over the last three days with the hope that, quote investors, regardless of affiliation or size, have access to information and have the opportunity to engage with us. Etoro is set to go public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, with a valuation of approximately $10.4
00:29:48.694 - 00:30:34.680, Speaker A: billion. Betsy Cohen, chair of Fintech Acquisition Corp. Five, the company behind the SPAC deal, praised Etoro as, quote, a social network platform that will be very helpful for younger investors. Etoro has more than 20 million users, projects $1 billion in revenue for 2021, and currently offers 93 cryptocurrencies to its customers. Kraken, which disclosure is a previous sponsor of my shows, is also considering going public, though there are conflicting reports on how exactly it would do so. The bloc reported that Kraken could go public in the next year via a direct listing. Fox Business News reporter Charles Gasparino tweeted that Kraken execs are considering going public through a SPAC or IPO sometime in 2022.
00:30:34.680 - 00:31:28.834, Speaker A: Kraken CEO Jesse Powell recently showed interest in going public, saying in a February Bloomberg interview, quote, we are certainly on track. Though $10 billion is a low valuation. I wouldn't be interested in issuing shares at that price. Meanwhile, if you're wondering how well the crypto exchange business is doing onchain market analyst willie Wu published a chart estimating that 35,000 new bitcoin users a day are arriving on chain.
