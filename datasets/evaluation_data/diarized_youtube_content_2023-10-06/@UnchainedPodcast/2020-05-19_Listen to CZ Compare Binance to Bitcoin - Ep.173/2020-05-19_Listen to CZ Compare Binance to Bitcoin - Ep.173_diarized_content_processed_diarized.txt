00:03:06.652 - 00:03:12.220, Speaker D: Yes, I think last time we talked was just over the phone. We didn't get to see each other. Sort of.
00:03:12.750 - 00:03:55.720, Speaker A: No, we didn't. So before we keep chatting, I just want to say to everyone, welcome to the kickoff talk for Ethereal, which will be this Fireside chat that I'm conducting with Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, who's the CEO of Binance. And if you don't know who I am, I am the host of a couple crypto podcasts, Unchained and Unconfirmed. Welcome CZ thank you for having me here. So in your tweet yesterday about our chat, you said that last time I interviewed you, I asked you tough, bordering misleading questions. And I wondered what questions in particular did you take issue with?
00:03:57.390 - 00:04:01.100, Speaker D: Well, you asked me if I was worried about going to jail. I mean, who asked that?
00:04:05.150 - 00:05:03.594, Speaker A: Well, but I do mean my questions about US regulations, I think at least were on point because since the time of our interview, now Binance has changed its approach to the US. And I remember last time when I was asking you all about the US regulations, you said that my line of questioning was like telling somebody who didn't like hot weather that they had to live in the US. Or live in Florida. And you said that was ridiculous. But apparently now you've decided that even though you don't like hot weather, you will come to Florida. So now you have Binance US, which is specific to the US market and obviously its unique regulations, I guess we could call them. And even within that, there's Binance USD, which is approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, which is easily one of the toughest crypto regulators.
00:05:03.594 - 00:05:15.220, Speaker A: So it seems that I was right, that the way Binance was operating was not really in line with US regulation. Would you agree with that? And that's why you launched Binance US.
00:05:16.790 - 00:05:46.250, Speaker D: So again, I think I would have to disagree with the guideline of questioning, but I think the question is worded in a misleading way. It's just that okay, because not every company starts in the US. And we didn't start in the US. We wasn't targeting the US customers specifically. But we got to a big point where big enough? Getting regulated in the US is really expensive. That's like, I don't know, 48 states you have to get licenses with. I think our partner is still going through that process.
00:05:46.250 - 00:06:19.042, Speaker D: It's very time consuming, but at a certain size. We said, well, the US market is an important market and we want to be able to service our market. So we partner with Spam Trading Services, and as far as I understand, they are still very much going through the licensing state by state process. So they're able to service, I believe, 37 states. And there's a few big states they're not able to service just yet. So we're still waiting for them to get the license go through that. But the narrative is not so much we were targeting the US illegally before, and now we're doing it properly.
00:06:19.042 - 00:06:21.560, Speaker D: It's not quite like that, at least from my.
00:06:23.370 - 00:07:26.250, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, well, I guess now I'm two for two in asking you bordering misleading. Uh, but speaking of BUSD, which I mentioned earlier, that's part of Venus, which is your stablecoin initiative, and that will create kind of many different types of stablecoins for different fiat currencies. And in the Chinese version of your announcement, you referenced Libra when you talked about Venus, and your co founder, Ha Yi, I think is her name, said that Venus was, quote, the One Belt, one Road initiative version of. So, you know, when you guys made this announcement, at that time, it looked like Libra was just going to be this single global currency and Venus was going to take a different strategy, know, being different stablecoins of different central bank currencies. But now, obviously, Libra is actually going in the direction that Venus was supposed to go. So is that changing your strategy with Venus?
00:07:26.990 - 00:08:12.358, Speaker D: Okay, so I think there's some misinformation there as well. Venus was never meant to be a stable coin on its own. It's a basket project encompassing several or many stablecoins in different parts of the world. And our approach is always to work with local governments, local corporations, or other regulatory bodies to issue different stablecoins for different regions. We did not have the thought of issuing a basket backed stablecoin as a single stablecoin. I haven't really figured out how the economics of that would work. So we took a very much simpler approach, say, look, US is a big market, and also we found a very strong partner there, Paxos.
00:08:12.358 - 00:08:40.834, Speaker D: They're actually the issuer of the Binance USD stablecoin. So even though it's called Binance USD, the issuer is actually not US. So it's issued by Paxos, which is fully regulated by NYDFS, one of the strictest regulators in the world. And their bank account, I assume, is audited by the auditing firms. I actually don't see the bank account, but it is transparent. There's a peace of mind to it. So that's one part of it.
00:08:40.834 - 00:09:18.462, Speaker D: And I think very recently I heard that the government of Bermuda is even accepting BUSD for tax payments. So among a few other stable coins that's also issued from the US. So that's quite good. We also issued BGBP, so that's a British pound one. We also issued a Bkrw, which is a Korean Wong one. So there's more in the works. So our approach to stablecoin is that I think the simplest approach is basically, look, take some fiat, put it in escrow, make sure it's totally transparent audited regulated, and then issue a stable coin on that.
00:09:18.462 - 00:09:37.846, Speaker D: That's the simplest way. There are other more fancier ways, like algorithmic, I can't pronounce that word, those different type of stable coins which are fancier, but that's fine. So we just provide a very simple option for our users, and we want to do this in more and more regions through the Venice project, which is.
00:09:37.948 - 00:09:49.980, Speaker A: Kind of an encompassing but actually so maybe you misunderstood my question, because I was saying that now that Libra is essentially doing what you had planned to do, does that change that strategy at all?
00:09:50.590 - 00:10:44.010, Speaker D: No, not necessarily. I think based on common perception, they're very much focused on the US. They have a very strong presence in the US, it's a US company and they're dealing with US regulators very heavily and they do have a lot of reach globally in terms of user base. So that's, I mean, our philosophy is always one more option doesn't hurt users. So we're going to throw wherever it makes sense, we're going to provide our option. So we don't see ourselves as competition to Libra, we don't see ourselves as competition to other stablecoins, so we support other stablecoin initiatives, so we support anything that users want, really. So if a coin has a lot of users, we'll likely support it and hopefully we will be able to provide usability to a lot of users with our own stablecoin.
00:10:44.010 - 00:10:50.170, Speaker D: If a lot of people use it, then it's great. If nobody uses it, then we're going to shut it down. So that's kind of our philosophy.
00:10:50.670 - 00:11:01.440, Speaker A: China now is in the early stages of rolling out its central bank digital currency, DCEP. Does Binance ever see itself launching a Chinese yuan stablecoin as part of the Venus Project?
00:11:02.290 - 00:11:44.650, Speaker D: So right now, to be honest, we have no plans. And there's two versions of Chinese yuan. There's the onshore RMB, there's the offshore RMB, and they're not supposed to mix because China do have very strict flight capital controls. So right now I don't think you can get a bank to support you to issue a stablecoin. In China, there has been attempts to issue a stablecoin based on the sort of overseas RMB, but very little adoption. I think basically today, US dollar is still the dominant fiat currency and we see that much of the volume is in US dollar based stablecoins. So this is actually like the stable coins actually in this sense is very good for US dollar.
00:11:44.650 - 00:12:11.000, Speaker D: It actually improves US dollar's dominance, but we'll see things may change. But basically, if there's a way to issue a stablecoin properly, with banking support, with approvals, fully transparent auditing, if there's those things, then we are more than happy to do that. So we're talking with a few different initiatives or different projects, but nothing's too early stages, nothing's very concrete right now.
00:12:11.530 - 00:12:16.710, Speaker A: And what impact think DCEP will have generally on the adoption of crypto?
00:12:17.210 - 00:13:07.000, Speaker D: To be honest, based on my limited understanding, right now, it feels very much like a digital version of RMB, which probably plus a blockchain architecture somewhere in there. So it's still very much controlled. Access to it is still very much limited to a number of large banks. So how easy it is for a sort of a crypto player to integrate that into the ecosystem, I'm not sure. So, so far we do not have access to it. So my understanding is they're testing it among a few big banks initially. So hopefully if it gets really wide adoption, if everyone in China is using it, and if there's a blockchain interface that we can interface directly onto binance and let people deposit and withdraw, that'd be great.
00:13:07.000 - 00:13:42.980, Speaker D: If we can't do that, then the usage will be somewhat limited. It's still useful in the sense of educating everybody about blockchain and stable coins, cryptocurrencies, et cetera. And I think today if you learn about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, you cannot not learn about bitcoin. So I think that exposure helps a lot. Even if we can't use it, so it's still early stages, we can't use it today because it's still being very limited testing, but hopefully very soon we will be able to use it and if we can, then that'll be fantastic. That provides a much better onramp for RMB we'll have to see.
00:13:43.670 - 00:14:08.810, Speaker A: Yeah. And another thing that I find interesting that's happening right now as we're seeing this race amongst these central bank digital currencies taking place, is that obviously at the same time we have this pandemic. So I was curious to know what impact do you think the coronavirus and the economic fallout from that will have on the adoption of crypto. And also I wondered if you're already noticing any trends in terms of the activity on binance.
00:14:09.230 - 00:14:54.570, Speaker D: Sure, absolutely. So I think there's definitely a lot of trends that we're already noticing. The most obvious one on binance right now is there's higher trading volumes. There are far higher trading volumes ever since about two months ago. So there could be a variety of different reasons contributing to that. It could be that people are just bored at home and they just trade more because there's less other distractions or other interesting things for them to do. It's also possible that given that the governments are printing money at record speed to sort of support the economy or to try to recover the economy, and now those money is starting to flow into cryptocurrencies and we're seeing the price recovering.
00:14:54.570 - 00:15:52.990, Speaker D: But all of those things I think, have a very fundamental impact. And also the coronavirus has a huge impact in the sense that traditional industries are very much stopped. Right? So production, basically, we can print a lot of money to sort of hand out money to everybody, but the fundamental fact is production in a lot of sectors have completely stopped. There's a few essential sectors that's still going strong and online virtual businesses are going strong, which is good for us as well. But then with the government printing so much money right now and everyone being bored at home, so all of those factors contribute to the growth so far. I think as many KOLs or like OGS say in the space, we're kind of witnessing a perfect storm for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. So I think if cryptocurrency does not shine in this environment, then I'm in the wrong industry.
00:15:52.990 - 00:15:57.214, Speaker D: But I'm very confident about it during.
00:15:57.252 - 00:16:03.920, Speaker A: This time you also became the number one crypto futures trading venue. Why do you think that shift happened?
00:16:04.690 - 00:16:49.006, Speaker D: To be honest, I think we got lucky there. So I think the futures platform actually have grown very quickly as well. Again, I thought it would take multiple years to grow to the number one platform for futures because we only started in late September last year. So really only just over half a year and they were existing established players with very large volumes and we thought it was going to take a while. We deliberately engineered the product to be a little bit different, even though it's still features. Yes, we copied a lot of other features, other people's features, but the fee structure is very different. Our fees are about one 7th of the existing players for fees that they charge for the taker side.
00:16:49.006 - 00:17:18.258, Speaker D: So we have very aggressive takers. So we are very attractive to the sort of smaller retail guys. We don't have a high maker rebate. So it was deliberately engineered to be slightly different from the existing platforms and we were growing slowly. And to be honest, on March twelveTH, the biggest futures exchange experienced some issues. And that's the day when the bitcoin price was moving really widely. The bitcoin price was dropping and everyone wants to trade.
00:17:18.258 - 00:17:49.806, Speaker D: Luckily our system stayed up. That moved a lot of liquidity to us. And actually, unbeknownst to most retail people, binance Futures has the fastest API and most stable API. So we average somewhere around five to seven milliseconds, which is about somewhere between one third to one 10th of the latency on other platforms. So those kind of things, over time they kick in. But honestly, we didn't expect it to be that quick. And we still offer a very limited product in terms of futures.
00:17:49.806 - 00:18:13.290, Speaker D: We only have the perpetual futures, so we're actually looking to add settlement futures. Our futures is settled in USD or USD stablecoin, and we were looking to provide a cryptocurrency settled futures contract. So all of those things are going on, but I think we got lucky on the futures growth.
00:18:13.870 - 00:18:47.400, Speaker A: I would say that somehow your career in crypto seems to have been born under a lucky star. One other thing I wanted to ask about was just like what you're seeing kind of initially. Now, in these early months after the coronavirus pandemic, do you think that you have a sense of how long term this will affect the adoption of crypto or how you'll see crypto trading or who gets involved in crypto, how all those things will change?
00:18:47.930 - 00:19:42.498, Speaker D: Yes, I think my feeling I could be very wrong on this, just my personal opinion is the impact is going to be on the level of month. So I think it took a couple of months for the impact to kick in. So you didn't kick in like on the second day when we felt there was a financial crisis, when the stock market crashed, bitcoin actually crashed with it. So you actually didn't have that sort of a safe, heavy effect on a day to day basis. But I think we're seeing that there's a strong recovery right now. And so it's been a couple of months, and I think over the next few months, maybe six months, twelve months, 18 months, ish we're going to see very significant impact. I think more and more people are going to realize, okay, well, there's just unlimited cash flowing around and the minute they get their cash, they will want to put that into something that's of limited supply.
00:19:42.498 - 00:20:30.840, Speaker D: And the easiest thing to put that into is actually cryptocurrencies. Before ten years ago, that option wasn't available, but now this option is available. People can buy gold, but other than a few really old timers, nobody really wants to buy gold anymore. And also people are becoming more and more aware of the different economic impacts of different actions government take. So I think over the next twelve to 18 months we're going to see some really significant changes in the crypto space. And right now we're in a situation where there's a having going on, right? So it's a perfect storm. So after the having, the supply for bitcoin is actually going to be decreased, or the new supply for Bitcoin is going to be decreased by half again.
00:20:30.840 - 00:21:09.300, Speaker D: So the supply is very limited and people will just have to, I think more and more people come in. The data we see on our platforms right now in terms of new users and also as well as old users whose account has been dormant, has been like, they're really coming back alive really quickly. So our customer support has been really busy helping people with the password resets, et cetera, because there's a lot of guys who just forget their password after a while. Right? So we're seeing all of those things happening. So I think in the next to twelve to 18 months we're going to see some really significant increase in adoption in the crypto space.
00:21:09.830 - 00:21:31.690, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see what happens. It's true that historically that has been the case after having so let's switch from talking about Bitcoin to Ethereum. Your proposed finance smart chain, which is a smart contract platform, will be compatible with Ethereum. But what do you say to the people who think that Binance smart chain is attempting to compete with Ethereum?
00:21:32.750 - 00:22:12.550, Speaker D: Well, I think basically that depends on the definition of competing because it's really a very personal, subjective view for each individual. You can say Ethereum is competing with Bitcoin. I'm not sure if that's or you can also say BNB is competing with Bitcoin. At a broader level, maybe you can also say we're kind of complementing each other. Initially. When binance chain first started, our goal was to just provide a very fast chain that solves a performance issue with many of the existing blockchains so that we can run a decentralized exchange on it. And so that goal has been achieved.
00:22:12.550 - 00:22:54.418, Speaker D: But given the popularity of centralized exchanges and the ease of use for centralized exchanges, I think most people still doesn't know how to hold their coin themselves. To be honest. If you grab 100 guys on the street, only 99 of them will now know, or at least are not confident holding a bitcoin on their own. So until that changes, I think the decentralized exchanges will be relatively small. But it could change very quickly, we don't know. One of the most requested features for binance chain was a smart contract and everyone wants a EVM Ethereum virtual machine compatible smart contract chain. So we said, well, if users want it, let's provide it.
00:22:54.418 - 00:23:28.702, Speaker D: So we view ourselves as complementary to Ethereum not competing. I think Ethereum does a lot of things very well. Ethereum did fulfill their vision in the sense that they did build an unstoppable machine. The 1.0 version is still a little bit like they have performance bottlenecks, which everyone's experiencing, so hopefully 2.0 will solve that. But from our perspective, look, if something's already working and there's a very large community is already familiar with solidity programming, then we should just go along with it instead of fight it.
00:23:28.702 - 00:23:58.120, Speaker D: So we never really view ourselves as competing with Ethereum. We support Ethereum, we list it on binance.com, we have a very large number of pairing for it. So I think we support the initiatives that they're pushing forward and I think some of the technical problems they're trying to solve are very meaningful. If Ethereum 2.0 solves the performance scalability problems using Sharding, that's super useful, so we hope that they do well.
00:23:58.750 - 00:24:09.450, Speaker A: And so if I'm a developer or user, why would I either create or choose to use an Ethereum DAP on the binance smart chain as opposed to on Ethereum?
00:24:10.350 - 00:25:02.230, Speaker D: Well, number one on the binance chain, if you issue a token on the binance chain and use the smart contract there, you can just port over your Ethereum contract. You will work on both chains and then when you have it on your binance chain, there's a decentralized exchange, the binance Dex that works out of the gate. I think the Dex on binance chains is very well done to the extent possible, a very user friendly interface and very fast matching engine and it just works. And then you're also in the binance ecosystem. To be honest, most developers, you can be in both ecosystems. There are a lot of coins which are dual chain or multi chain right now, so that's just another option. And then if you're on binance dex and if your trading volume is high enough, you get a slightly higher chance of listing on binance.com.
00:25:02.230 - 00:25:41.690, Speaker D: So you're kind of more visible to the binance ecosystem. The Ethereum ecosystem has a very high number of users. The binance ecosystem also has a large number of users and they're two slightly different user groups, to be honest. The binance ecosystem has more heavier traders and centralized exchange users, whereas the ethereum ecosystem has more developers and more sort of the tech heavy, pure, decentralization type of guys. So even though we're kind of within the same industry, there's some differentiations between the different players. So it's just another choice that we provide for developers and users.
00:25:42.030 - 00:26:06.980, Speaker A: So it sounds like if there's more traders in the binance ecosystem, then maybe it would make sense for some of the DeFi projects to know, to move over there, or to wonder if I wonder if there will be ethereum people who will say, you're stealing our DeFi users and developers, what would you say to them?
00:26:07.990 - 00:26:41.286, Speaker D: So, to be honest, I think there's always two sides. We can view anybody else on this planet, we can always view them as a collaborator, or we can view them as a competitor for any person on this planet because they're breathing my air. So I think basically the fundamental situation we're in in this industry is that the market is not nowhere near saturated, right? So only one in 1000 people have some kind of crypto right now. So only 0.1% of the population have crypto. That's 99.9% of the expansion.
00:26:41.286 - 00:27:15.590, Speaker D: That can be possible in a saturated market. If you introduce a new player, yes, you're going to take market share from other players. In a nascent market, one more player come in will make the ecosystem bigger. That's much better for the ecosystem. So we would want to invite Libra to come in, we would want to invite IBM, Microsoft, other guys, Google to come in. So I think having more players in a small and not saturated market, but nowhere near saturated market makes this industry bigger. So now we should be all collaborating to make this industry bigger.
00:27:15.590 - 00:27:50.386, Speaker D: Once you achieve, say, look, if you want to do another, I don't know, search engine, you're probably competing with somebody else. If you do another browser, you're probably competing with somebody else. But if you do another blockchain or another blockchain application or even another exchange, chances are you're not competing directly with us. There are so many users who are not using binance right now, so only 0.1% of the population are in crypto. Only a small portion of that are using finance. So if you launch an exchange in somewhere else, you can get more users into this industry that helps all of us.
00:27:50.386 - 00:28:02.070, Speaker D: So there's two ways to view it. I think that's really depending on how a person likes to view that depends on their worldview. We don't view anybody as competition right now, so we just want to grow the space bigger.
00:28:02.570 - 00:28:19.020, Speaker A: Yeah, that reminds me, I asked a similar question to years ago, and he was talking about a different industry that he had launched a startup in. But he basically said what you were saying, that competition just grows the pie.

00:30:44.830 - 00:31:10.100, Speaker A: All right, well, one other thing I wanted to ask you about was some of your big news this year, which was that Binance recently acquired CoinMarketCap. And because Binance is an exchange and is also at least one of the largest holders of BNB, if not the largest, some people say that Binance could have an incentive to sway the rankings and the reported volume on CoinMarketCap. So what do you say to people who are concerned about.
00:31:13.350 - 00:31:50.186, Speaker D: Then? If we do that in a negative way, just for the benefit of Binance, then CoinMarketCap loses a lot of the value that it provides. So I think neutrality is a very key value for CoinMarketCap, and I recognize very well myself and the Coin market cap team recognized that. And did we ask the CoinMarketCap to fix some of the fake volumes on CoinMarketCap? Yes, we. Did. And I think all the community agrees that there's a lot of exchanges reporting fake volumes there. Will we have our influence in that discussion? I think also, yes. But all the business units, what I call business units.
00:31:50.186 - 00:32:14.950, Speaker D: So I view Binance.com the exchange as one business unit, CMC as one business unit, Trustwallet as another business unit. We have like, I don't know, 30, 50 different business units. Each business unit operates relatively independently. If Binance wants to put an ad on CMC, they will pay for it. So the Binance.com exchange business will pay the CMC business for that ad, and they will pay market rates.
00:32:14.950 - 00:32:41.262, Speaker D: They'll get the lower tier of the market rate, so they will not be ripped off because Fox is really left pocket, right pocket. But I think from my perspective, the best thing to maintain value overall for CMC and Binance.com together is CMC being the CMC, and Binance.com the Exchange being the exchange. I think both are strong enough to compete on their own. We don't need to sabotage one business for the benefit of another business. Binance.com
00:32:41.262 - 00:33:09.100, Speaker D: can compete. It's already the number one exchange by most metrics. And CMC is the largest traffic website because it's useful to a lot of users. And also Binance.com will not unnecessarily give some benefit to CMC just to move CMC up. So I think both businesses will compete independently and they should build value independently, and that does not involve CMC directing all the traffic to Binance.com, so people don't have to worry too much about that.
00:33:09.470 - 00:33:20.620, Speaker A: And you did reference, obviously the fake volumes or at least the inaccurate figures on CoinMarketCap. What can you do, or what can CoinMarketCap do to make the numbers more.
00:33:22.190 - 00:33:58.946, Speaker D: So what I did was basically I posted a tweet asking for feedback, and that was probably the number one feedback that people want to fix. So I just asked the team, just fix it somehow. I don't care how you guys fix it. The team has what they call a liquidity metrics. So they look at the order book depth, they look at a bunch of other matrices to try to fix it. After that, I mostly use coin market cap for the coin market cap. So when I look at a specific coin, I look at that I did used to use the coin market cap for exchange rankings, but it's so inaccurate right now, it's kind of less useful.
00:33:58.946 - 00:34:39.910, Speaker D: And then I look at the adjusted volumes that they had, I was like, well that's even less accurate than the reported volume. So I did give those feedback, but other than that, I didn't tell them how to fix it. So I said, look, there's a bunch of metrics you can use. You can tie it together with web visits, or you can tie it together. They also have data on outbound clicks, how many people click on the link for each exchanges to go to the exchanges and Binance is number one, even though binance is mostly ranked like 15 or 20 or 25th spot, because there's a bunch of other guys with fake volumes in front of that. So we look at those data, even historically, binance is number one. And actually, if you look at the outbound data, it's actually very accurate.
00:34:39.910 - 00:34:53.786, Speaker D: That gives a very accurate so they have a lot of data that they can use to sort of fix the ranking. I didn't tell them specifically how to fix it, but just say, look, that's the number one user requested feature. You guys fix it.
00:34:53.968 - 00:35:14.450, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we'll see how that goes. Good luck to you guys on that. One other thing I wanted to ask about was you guys launched this leverage trading in October, and you did it with 125 x leverage. When high leverage can so easily cause many traders to get wiped out. Why did you offer such high leverage?
00:35:14.950 - 00:35:58.410, Speaker D: Okay, so I'll make a confession. The high leverage is more of a PR gimmick. So the 125 x is only available for small amounts. So if you want to trade like, I don't know, a couple of $100, yes, you can go 125 x. And at larger amounts, if you want to trade $10 million, no, you don't get 125 x leverage because if you get liquidated, the current liquidity in the industry is not strong enough to support that kind of liquidation. So it's a tiered system where for smaller amounts, you get to that kind of leverage. And we have a deleveraging system that if you approach your margin and then you get deleveraged.
00:35:58.410 - 00:36:21.622, Speaker D: Most of people actually only use like 1020 max. Most people don't really use above 30, 50 x. So the high leverage is really sort of just well, there was 100 x and there was 101 x. We said, well, 101 doesn't really divide very well. 125 divides much better. If you divide it by eight, you get a nice number. If you divide by seven, you get a nice number.
00:36:21.622 - 00:36:26.630, Speaker D: So we just said, well, let's go with that. So most people don't use that high leverage.
00:36:27.450 - 00:37:07.278, Speaker A: Okay, well, we got a nice admission there. So this is going to be something else that a lot of people are going to be curious about. In early April, 11 class action lawsuits were filed against a number of crypto companies and token projects, and finance was one of them. The suit named you and your co founders, ha Yi and Roger Wang, as defendants. The lawsuit noted that in 2019, finance averaged more than $2.8 billion in daily trading volume, had more than 15 million users worldwide, and listed 184 tokens. And it also talked about how in 2018, finance brought in $446,000,000 in profit.
00:37:07.278 - 00:37:22.940, Speaker A: And then the lawsuit said, quote, how did a company that was barely a year old generate such extraordinary profits? By building a platform that solicited the buying and selling of unregistered securities on a historically unprecedented scale. What is your response to that?
00:37:23.630 - 00:37:46.746, Speaker D: So on that point, our lawyers told me not to say anything, so I will not comment on that. But we have lawyers handling it. So it is what it is. I think every company well, we were not without lawsuits from the very beginning. We had Sequoia suing us at one point. So that's resolved. Again, I cannot comment on that outcome, on the details, but that's completely resolved.
00:37:46.746 - 00:38:13.674, Speaker D: No issues anymore. So we just have lawyers handle it. One of the tricky things in this world is that in the world I was brought up in, at least the values I was taught, you're innocent until proven guilty. Having somebody suing you is a standard. Well, not a standard is a normal part of a business process. But today, many people think that as soon as there's a lawsuit, you're guilty, which is not the right I don't think that's the right perception. So we'll let the lawyers figure it out.
00:38:13.674 - 00:38:21.660, Speaker D: Unfortunately, in this kind of situations, all the lawyers tell you to not comment on it. So I can't comment on the specifics, but we'll see.
00:38:22.350 - 00:39:27.426, Speaker A: Yeah, I think what's interesting is that this sort of goes back to our first interview where I was asking you these questions. But yeah, we'll see how this plays out because I think these were things that a lot of people were wondering about, and now we'll finally get our answer. So another kind of controversial issue recently was that obviously so we're seeing now that more and more blockchains are using delegated proof of stake. And because of that, some people are concerned about the power that exchanges might have in those systems because of the coins that they hold for their users. And a good example is what happened with the Steam blockchain when Binance initially helped the Steam tokens on the exchange, or used the tokens on the exchange to help Justin Sun as he took control of Steam. And then Binance later reversed course and helped a fork of steam called Hive to basically remove some of the control that Justin Sun had. So why did Binance change directions with Steam? And how do you think exchanges should handle the power that they have in these delegated proof of stake systems with the coins they have?
00:39:27.608 - 00:40:17.520, Speaker D: Yeah, so to be very frank, and I said this openly a few times already, which is we didn't know, it was like a contentious fork. So we go through many wallet upgrades, right? So blockchain upgrades, whenever there's a blockchain upgrade, it's very often a soft or even a hard fork. And typically the core developers will contact us, say, look, there's a hard fork coming, you guys need to upgrade your wallet and support it. We just follow the instructions. Really? So they give us a detailed level of instructions, we look at it, we just follow it. The fork was presented to me as an upgrade, and I was asked just let's go for it. I did approve it.
00:40:17.520 - 00:40:50.106, Speaker D: My team, my own team, my own team talked actually, I didn't talk to Justin before this. So their team was talking to our team on the wallet upgrade. And my team asked me, hey, it was a standard, like, rubber stamp process where they say, oh look, there's a wallet upgrade. Are we going to support it or not? Say yes. So that was the extent. Afterwards, the Steam community went ballistic and I was like, oh, okay, well, that's not very good. So I made a mistake of not realizing that, which I fully admit and take responsibility for.
00:40:50.106 - 00:41:33.142, Speaker D: And we do not want to get involved in governance, blockchain governances, weighing our opinions, et cetera. Especially we don't want to use our users coins to do that. So if we want to weigh in, then the only way we would do that is to make a vote feature on Binance.com, so that the guys, we have awaited a vote according to their balances, and then we use that to vote. But we don't even have that feature today because we don't really want to get into that after the fact. And Steam works in a very strict way. Once you vote, like what they call power up, which I learned afterwards, then when you power down, it takes 13 weeks to unlock.
00:41:33.142 - 00:42:09.202, Speaker D: I think we're still probably in that process, or maybe we're probably near the end of that process. As soon as we discovered we reverse course, we said, look, this is not something we want to get involved with. We did what the community asked. The community still have some resentment on the actions that we took. They think we course the fork. But the fundamental fact is, after we reverse the actions, justin Sum probably has a lot of financial, what do you call it, ability to influence that. Anyway, I didn't look at the data, but for a while the Steam coin price was going up because both sides were trying to buy more Steam to vote.
00:42:09.202 - 00:42:35.370, Speaker D: So we've seen that happening. I didn't really look into the details of that, but from our perspective, our principles are very simple. If it's not a contentious fork, if it's a regular upgrade, we definitely support it. We support the blockchain ecosystem to grow. So we have a standard process. Now, we added a check to see if there's a contentious hard fork, but normally we'll just support an upgrade. But our principles is we do not get involved in other people's blockchain governance.
00:42:35.370 - 00:43:33.886, Speaker D: That's for their community, that's for whoever holds those coins. So we want to stay neutral in terms of other blockchains governance, we're not interested in that. So one of the interesting thing is right now there is somewhere, I would say, for any coins between like 10% to 30% of the coins on exchange on finance specifically. So for any delegated proof of stake consensus mechanisms, they have to design with this in mind. So ideally, you design in such a way that it's either easy for people to withdraw coins from the exchange vote and not have those coins locked for 13 weeks before they can redeposit and trade, or have a way for exchanges to be able to vote on the user's behalf. So we will never vote on our behalf using the user's coins. Those kind of questions which are being considered, and someday we may want to support it.
00:43:33.886 - 00:44:02.220, Speaker D: But it does raise the question that of some of the blockchain designs, where when they design it, some of them have very simplistic designs where they just assume everyone holds their coins in their own wallet and they never trade. They just buy and spend it. But the world is not that kind of not that naive. So we just have to take that into I just hope that other designers of blockchains take that into consideration. But our principles are very clear, very simple.
00:44:02.910 - 00:44:25.090, Speaker A: In November, the bloc reported that Binance had two Shanghai offices that closed after being visited by local authorities. And then in February, after some media outlets described Binance as being Malta based, the Malta Financial Services Authority issued a statement saying that you were not authorized by the MFSA to operate in the cryptocurrency sphere there. So where is Binance headquartered?
00:44:26.070 - 00:45:04.522, Speaker D: Well, I think well, this is the beauty of the blockchain, right? So you don't have to like, where where's the Bitcoin office? Bitcoin doesn't have an office. So we have people around 50 places in the world, and actually, just to make the record correct, just to set the record, they block articles saying that we had a police rate that did not exist, police rate on a Binance office. So that was pure fake. And within 12 hours of that post, the BNB market cap dropped from 2.6 billion to 2.2 billion. So that fake article actually had a very material impact on the BNB holders.
00:45:04.522 - 00:45:07.440, Speaker D: So they actually really wiped out $400 million.
00:45:08.850 - 00:45:21.186, Speaker A: But just to clarify, so the block did admit that police raid maybe wasn't the term, but to say that you guys were visited by local authorities, checked out, in their opinion, are you going to dispute that?
00:45:21.208 - 00:45:35.880, Speaker D: I don't even know. I think the story carries a very much different weight. If you say, well, a government official visited Coinbase versus the police rated Coinbase, I think those two things are very different. So you kind of really are.
00:45:37.390 - 00:45:44.682, Speaker A: But to say that the office closed after the visit from local authorities, are you going to dispute am?
00:45:44.736 - 00:46:19.654, Speaker D: So, again, basically, again, also at that same time, there was a Chinese CCTV visit of an office in Shanghai where they reported it was a customer support office. It's an outsourced customer support office. It's not even office. So, again, yes, I openly disputed that. I think people have all this traditional mentalities they have. They're trying to classify what kind of horse is a car. So you have to have an office.
00:46:19.654 - 00:46:33.580, Speaker D: Wherever I sit, it's going to be in a binance office. Wherever I meet somebody, it's going to be in a binance office. And you have to have an entity. You have to have a headquarter, you have to have a bank account. All of those things doesn't have to exist for blockchain companies.
00:46:34.110 - 00:46:51.520, Speaker A: Well, but even to do things like to handle taxes for your employees, I think you need a registered business entity. So why are you obfuscating it? Why not just be open about it? Like the headquarters is registered in this place. Why not just say that?
00:46:52.470 - 00:47:14.694, Speaker D: Well, it's the same thing as why don't you admit you're some kind of horse? We're not a horse. We're a car. So it's not that we don't want to admit it. It's not that we want to obfuscate it or we want to try to hide. I'm not hiding. We're in the open. I'm on Twitter every day.
00:47:14.694 - 00:47:23.900, Speaker D: I go to fiscal conferences. So we're not hiding, but it's just like, why don't you go back to this old way of being? We're not that.
00:47:24.750 - 00:47:42.160, Speaker A: What are you saying, that you're already some kind of Tao or I mean, what are you saying? Because it's not the old way. It is actually the current way. And until you can say we're officially a dow, I actually don't know what you are or what you're claiming to be.
00:47:43.010 - 00:48:05.302, Speaker D: Let me put it this way. So I don't think we're a dow in most of the definitions of a dow. Again, I think that's kind of a binary definition. You're either a traditional company or you are a dow. I think we're just a team working together really well, and we build a platform that works, and we have multiple places. We work most of it. We mostly work from home.
00:48:05.302 - 00:48:24.640, Speaker D: Even before the Coronavirus quarantine, we work in 50 different countries now. We have a large team that works together to a common goal. It's just a new type of organization. I wouldn't classify, to be honest, if we classified as a dow, there's going to be a lot of debates why we're not a dow. So I don't want to go there either.
00:48:25.170 - 00:48:31.406, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, nobody would call you guys a dow. And can I ask where you are right now, where you're doing stay at home?
00:48:31.588 - 00:48:36.100, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm in Asia, so it's 07:00 P.m. Here. So it's 07:00 a.m Your time.
00:48:37.270 - 00:48:38.690, Speaker A: Where? In Asia.
00:48:39.590 - 00:48:43.170, Speaker D: I prefer not to disclose that. I think that's my own privacy.
00:48:44.310 - 00:48:59.270, Speaker A: All right, well, that's going to have to be where we're going to end because it's now 08:00 A.m. And that's it. Thank you so much, CZ, for making this fireside chat happen, especially last minute, and I hope everybody enjoys the rest of ethereal. And did you want to say any last words?
