00:00:00.090 - 00:00:29.490, Speaker A: An update on Do Kwon, who continues his year of world travel. Kwon has been on the run from an Inter Paul Red notice for months, which does explain his outfit. It's exercise chic. He recently got arrested in Montenegro, and South Korea has requested he be extradited from there. However, South Korea faces competition, as the United States has recently requested that Kwan be extradited to America first. And while all of this was going on, he started a new company in Serbia, which means maybe there owed a piece of him, too. So many countries involved, I literally feel like I'm at a Model UN tournament.
00:00:29.490 - 00:00:59.500, Speaker A: They're going to have to figure it out, because Doe Kwan obviously can't be in two places at once. It's not possible for him to just instantaneously jump all over the map. He's not the value of the terrace table coin Montenegrin justice minister who has honestly never had so much attention in his life. This is truly like a sweet 16, a bar mitzvah and a wedding all in one. Has said that for now, Kwan is being held in COVID quarantine in Montenegro. Personally, I doubt he has a contagious COVID infection. Though if his business record is any indication, he's not known for his capacity to successfully grow things.
