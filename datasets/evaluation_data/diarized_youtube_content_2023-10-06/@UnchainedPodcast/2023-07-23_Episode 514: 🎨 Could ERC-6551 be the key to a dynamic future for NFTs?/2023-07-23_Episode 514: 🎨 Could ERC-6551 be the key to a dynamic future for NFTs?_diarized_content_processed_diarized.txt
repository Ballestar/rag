00:00:00.410 - 00:00:50.230, Speaker A: The hard problem is when you want to add state to an NFT or you want to have a dynamic NFT, you want the aesthetic to change. You start to ask yourself a few questions. Do you pursue the off chain way where you build a database and you have all this kind of centralization where you could render the NFT, or you go the on chain way, which is like everything that you put on every item is an NFT T, and it can be equippable on chain as a transaction. So through this kind of journey, as we were feeling in the dark in the last eight or nine months, we realized that there was a potential solution. And the solution is, if we link every single NFT with its own account or wallet, if it had that, then the NFT itself can actually own other tokens. It could own ETH USDC could own ERC. 721 NFTs.
00:00:50.230 - 00:00:54.060, Speaker A: And so that was the Sapiens project that came out of this.
