With me today to discuss the upcoming events of this asset, this digital goal that has started all this cryptomania, are eric Lombroso, a bitcoin core developer, and Brian Hoffman, CEO of obi wan, which runs the project open bazaar, the ebay of the decentralized web. Welcome, Eric and Brian.
00:01:21.762 - 00:01:23.138, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, Laura.
00:01:23.234 - 00:01:25.126, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you. Thank you for having me on.
00:01:25.228 - 00:02:27.018, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to start this discussion with a little framing for our listeners, particularly those who are new to the space, so that we can dive into the meat of the discussion. About three years ago, the bitcoin community began to face the question of how to scale the network. Some of the early core developers that had been deeply involved in the project wanted to lift a cap of 1 limits the amount of transactions that can be processed at any given moment. They wanted to lift that from 1 different caps, such as some of the different proposals were like eight megabytes, 20 megabytes, a flexible cap. But that cap at the moment, or the new proposal that seems to have the most support from people is two megabytes. However, that framing of big blocks versus small blocks is only one way of looking at this question. Another big issue that the question raises is whether or not to conduct a hard fork in order to scale the network, since that is what would be required in order to change that cap.
00:02:27.018 - 00:03:33.326, Speaker A: The core developers say that doing so runs the risk of splitting the chain, which could result in two versions of bitcoin, and that would have a deleterious effect on bitcoin's reputation as digital gold. A couple years ago, they began working on another scaling solution called segregated witness that would essentially enable more data to be processed in blocks without requiring a hard fork. It also included a fix for a problem called transaction malleability. SegWit, as it became known, was also greatly anticipated because pushing it through would enable something called the Lightning network, and that would bring many more transactions to Bitcoin, not necessarily all on the Bitcoin blockchain, but to be settled on it. At some point, the devs and the miners had a meeting in Hong Kong, where the attendees signed a document agreeing to implement both SegWit and hard fork to two megabytes. But what actually happened in this meeting is in dispute because the attendees had different conceptions about how much authority this agreement had. Regardless, once the work was done to begin implementing SegWit, only about 30% to 40% of miners actually gave it support.
00:03:33.326 - 00:04:17.338, Speaker A: But the threshold necessary to implement it was 95%. One miner in particular who owned the largest mining pool as well is a company called Bitmain, headed up by a man named Jihan Wu. And Bitmain is also the largest mining chip manufacturer, and they opposed Sequit unless a block size increase came along with it. So a Steelmate occurred. Sequit was sort of held hostage by Bitmain's desire to see this 1 MB block size increased. And as the divide deepened, each side began, essentially threatening to cut the other side out of Bitcoin. And I did write a few articles on this which I can link to in the show notes.
00:04:17.338 - 00:05:33.190, Speaker A: However, in May, Barry Silbert, who's the head of Digital Currency Group, which is the biggest blockchain VC firm, brokered an agreement among the biggest economic actors in Bitcoin to push through something that they're calling SegWit Two X or it's often called the New York agreement as well, which basically says that SegWit will be implemented with 80% of mining power, and then after that, the network will upgrade to a two megabyte block size limit through a hard fork. It's essentially the Hong Kong agreement from a year and a half ago, just with some details that are different. And the companies that signed this agreement include some of the biggest economic actors in the space, such as Coinbase, Blockchain, Zappo, Shapeshift, and of course, Bitmain, which is this company that is most reviled and blamed for holding SegWit hostage. So in response, there was more support began to build for something called a user activated soft fork, or UASF. And that actually also risks causing a chain split. So the deadlines for both SegWit two X and for the UASF are nearing. At the moment of recording it's actually Thursday afternoon.
00:05:33.190 - 00:06:23.560, Speaker A: We're very close for SegWit two X to be locked in BIP 91. Okay, it's called BIP 91 for those of you who maybe don't follow all the technical details. And if it does go through, then that should prevent the chain split that could have been caused by the UASF. But it doesn't resolve the question of whether or not we will see a chain split in November, which is when the hard fork to move to the two megabyte block size will actually take place. So that's everything it's a very long summary, but we needed to get through that backstory in order to have a media discussion. So I actually want to start our talk with Brian. Brian Obi Wan signed the why?
00:06:24.730 - 00:07:26.940, Speaker C: So, you know, I think that was a pretty good summary of what's happened at a pretty high level. I mean, it's been several years now, and obviously there's a lot of details left out between this, but from our perspective, I'm not a core dev as Eric is, or even work with the Bitcoin core code directly, but we've built a business and an open source project on top of the protocol and our success, as well as a lot of other groups that are building on top of the Bitcoin's network effect understand that the project has to scale in order to be able to support what these groups want to do. And I think that there's this disagreement about how that happens. But ultimately the most important thing for us is that we try to move forward in some way that all parties that are pertinent to the discussion are not fighting with each other.
00:07:28.510 - 00:07:45.758, Speaker A: But I'm wondering when you were saying it's necessary to scale. As we mentioned earlier, SegWit actually would enable more transactions to occur on the network at any given moment. So why sign the agreement that would not only bring SegWit two X but also increase the block size limit?
00:07:45.854 - 00:08:42.178, Speaker C: Well, I mean, I think first of all, it's important to understand that there was a time before SegWit existed and there were many discussions around how Bitcoin could scale before SegWit was even a thing. And I think a lot of the people that feel this way about scaling that SegWit is not the optimal option are the ones that have been pushing back for the last few years. And I think, fair or not, they feel that giving SegWit now is the compromise that moves the market forward without ruining too many things. But yet a hard fork later on would be the part that they would be most interested in. And I think the conversation has been reframed where, oh, well, everybody agrees that SegWit is awesome and the hard fork is not great is not great, but that's not how these people oh, interesting.
00:08:42.264 - 00:08:47.010, Speaker A: So what is their objection to SegWit? Why do they feel it's not the optimal solution?
00:08:47.450 - 00:09:30.930, Speaker C: I mean, this conversation could probably get in the weeds and Eric could probably talk circles around me in terms of whether it's technically accurate. But my understanding is that SegWit could be enabled through a hard fork method, and there are several other defects in the protocol that we could also kind of package as part of that hard fork and clean up the code instead. Many of them feel that SegWit, in its current implementation as a soft fork, is a little bit hacky and maybe not as clean as it could be. And I think that choice was made in order to sacrifice not having this or to have backwards compatibility with other apps instead of breaking the network, maybe with a chain split.
00:09:31.270 - 00:09:41.720, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. For them, and I'm assuming you why is it that increasing the block size is the better way to go?
00:09:43.050 - 00:10:36.098, Speaker C: I mean, obviously increasing the block size is only a temporary fix. I think everybody pretty much agrees that that's true. And I think there's a lot of potential outcomes here. We could raise the block size and it could immediately be filled up with spam and be a problem once again, which is what some people speculate, and maybe it holds us off for another year. But I think for me, the most important aspect of this is that I don't feel that this change is something that is going to long term harm Bitcoin. And the goodwill and positivity that comes out of actually moving all of the players in Bitcoin forward together is going to allow us to not have to go through these Mexican standoffs every time there's a critical change to be made to the network.
00:10:36.194 - 00:10:46.122, Speaker A: Well, but wait, but do you think it is moving everyone forward together? Because I see that the core devs are not moving forward. They're sort of being forced along.
00:10:46.176 - 00:11:12.180, Speaker B: But they wrote BIP 91, SegWit two X, but BIP 91 and everything that's going on with making sure that the transition is going smooth. I mean, there's a lot of core developers actually working on making sure that SegWit actually activates and it's smooth and there aren't any market disruptions. There are core developers that are actually actively working on trying to make this transition as smooth as possible.
00:11:12.630 - 00:11:13.090, Speaker A: Okay.
00:11:13.160 - 00:11:34.746, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. And I think that does not mean that everybody agrees with what's happening. But I think we're all trying to work together to make sure that this isn't a disaster in some way because ultimately the market is deciding that SegWit is going to happen. Right. We're obviously seeing BIP 91 is probably going to be activated soon, but not.
00:11:34.768 - 00:11:38.522, Speaker A: Just SegWit, but SegWit two X, which is a different thing.
00:11:38.656 - 00:11:49.534, Speaker B: Well, we don't know about that. That's like several months further on. I think right now we're just concerning ourselves with the current activation and then seeing what's going to happen because a lot of things can happen between now and three months.
00:11:49.732 - 00:12:01.538, Speaker A: Okay, so I want to go back to at this point about whether or not the core devs are coming along because they wanted to or sort of because they realized that it's happening anyway and so they need to jump aboard. Which is it?
00:12:01.624 - 00:12:37.322, Speaker B: Well, let me just clear up a few things. When you talk about core devs, you're really talking about a whole bunch of volunteers that work from all over the world. It's not just like this one homogeneous group that agrees on everything. There's a lot of internal disagreements and minor tiffs of different approaches of doing certain things. But for the most part, I think there's a general agreement as to the general roadmap as far as the best way to move things forward. But let me just comment a few things if I can, just to give a little bit of context of my current situation in this. When I first started working on bitcoin, I saw it as a proof of concept.
00:12:37.322 - 00:12:45.962, Speaker B: I did not see it as a completed product. It was only worth like there were barely any markets and it was worth just like a couple of dollars or something like that.
00:12:46.036 - 00:12:46.962, Speaker A: And when was that?
00:12:47.016 - 00:12:48.462, Speaker B: This was like 2011.
00:12:48.606 - 00:12:49.106, Speaker A: Okay?
00:12:49.208 - 00:13:32.622, Speaker B: And I expected it to become obsolete for someone else to come up with a better cryptocurrency that would replace it eventually. That was kind of my expectation. And then I saw the rise of Ripple and Ethereum and several other projects which I participated in in the early stages, hoping that we would be able to fix some of the issues with bitcoin and create a better cryptocurrency. So it's not like I was a bitcoin maximalist that thought that it's got to be bitcoin and everyone's got to do it this way. I always thought that if someone came up with a better idea and wanted to have a better cryptocurrency, that was fine. It'd probably be called something other than bitcoin. So like, you have ethereum or ripple or whatever, right? And eventually maybe users would migrate over to that because it would be a better platform at some point.
00:13:32.622 - 00:14:05.834, Speaker B: But then I quickly saw that other projects made even worse mistakes than I think bitcoin made. And there was a huge breakthrough, which was the discovery of how to be able to change consensus rules in a backwards compatible way. And this was like the really big breakthrough that made me believe called a soft fork. Well, yeah, soft fork plus a whole bunch of other things that go into it. Being a soft fork alone doesn't make it backwards compatible, but it's an important tool in the whole arsenal of making things backwards compatible. So for instance, but just for people.
00:14:05.872 - 00:14:17.582, Speaker A: Who don't know what all this means, the reason that that's significant is because then you can prevent a chain split and therefore prevent two versions of bitcoin being created. Is that it?
00:14:17.716 - 00:14:47.910, Speaker B: That's one of the big points. And the other one is disenfranchising people. For instance, if you change compatibility, then maybe people's preferred programs are no longer going to work on the network anymore or maybe coins or contracts that they had before are no longer going to be honored by the new rules or stuff like that. So that's also an important factor that figures into the backwards compatibility. And the software alone is not enough to ensure that, for instance, the software can be used to blacklist addresses. And that's something that's a big no no. That's something that I don't think anyone, any of the developers would support.
00:14:47.910 - 00:15:37.046, Speaker B: For instance, even if it could be done as a software. So it's really the combination of no chain split plus making it an optional feature in the sense that people that don't want to use the feature are not adversely affected by other people using the feature. So it was discovered that it was possible to extend bitcoin in a lot of different ways by committing to extra data, to hash of an extra data in a block. And I think some people have made a big deal of whether it'd be easier to implement something like SegWit as a hard fork or not. And the truth is, no, actually it's really no different. It's just where the commitment actually is placed, obviously with a hard fork, if we have full ability, if the full ability to change anything we want, and we don't care about compatibility, we could start from scratch. And with the lessons of the past, we could fix a lot of other things if we wanted to.
00:15:37.046 - 00:16:06.354, Speaker B: But one of the big challenges, and I think this is the biggest engineering challenge in bitcoin, it's like when I design a lot of other systems, I usually, especially if I get to start from the early stages, try to design it from the start the way that I want it to be. But bitcoin is how it is right now, and we're bootstrapping this network that already has a lot of value. And the real engineering challenge isn't how would I build it from scratch better, but how can I take what exists right now and modify it in a way that isn't going to break it, that's going to add the functionality that we want.
00:16:06.472 - 00:16:22.502, Speaker A: So for you, it sounds like you feel like the number one priority at any point when you are making decisions about how to develop the protocol is whether or not you can make that change in a backwards compatible manner, which would therefore prevent a chain split. Is that what you're saying?
00:16:22.556 - 00:16:38.166, Speaker B: Huge component? Yes. And if it's not possible to do that, then I would probably consider doing something like ethereum or ripple, which is a separate blockchain. So, I mean, if I wanted to really change bitcoin drastically and do something that was very different, that it was very hard to do in a backwards compatible way, I would probably just start a new blockchain.
00:16:38.278 - 00:17:04.290, Speaker A: So I want to actually just take these thoughts and ship them over to segment two X. Here we are at this moment where it looks really likely that BIP 91, segment two X is going to go through, which means that segment will lock in and then in November there's likely to be this hard fork to a two megabyte limit. So what is your position on that? Do you think that it's a good thing or a bad thing that this is probably going to happen?
00:17:04.440 - 00:17:14.418, Speaker B: Well, first let me clear something up. The whole minor signaling thing is actually an arbitrary mechanism that was added to the software to help coordination and to make the transition smoother.
00:17:14.514 - 00:17:22.610, Speaker A: The first and by minor signaling you mean this is how we come up with these percentages, like 80% threshold and stuff. Okay.
00:17:22.700 - 00:17:30.954, Speaker B: That was actually something that was invented way after Bitcoin actually started. The first few soft forks did not use that mechanism at all.
00:17:31.072 - 00:17:32.186, Speaker A: How did that go through?
00:17:32.288 - 00:18:17.210, Speaker B: They just had a flag date or a block height and basically users would run the updated software and at some point blocks that did not conform to the new rules would just basically be rejected by those nodes. So it was a form of user activated software, even if it wasn't called that. The minor signaling was added later with a mechanism that's called is supermajority, and I believe it was BIP 30 something or other. That was the first one that was deployed this way. And what this allowed was for miners to signal intent to start enforcing the rule, which made it so that it was easier to transition the network more smoothly and give people time to make sure that they don't end up mining orphan blocks or that they don't end up accepting invalid confirmations and stuff like that.
00:18:17.360 - 00:18:20.362, Speaker A: Do you think that it's a good thing that this is the way we do it now?
00:18:20.416 - 00:19:11.580, Speaker B: Well, it was a coordination mechanism that expected cooperation, and as long as there was cooperation between developers, industry, miners, users, et cetera, it was fine. But the problem is when you get this kind of adversarial scenario and in this kind of a situation, it just does not work at all. I believe that it has been abused and it's been given way more importance than it really has. For instance, this whole 95% thing, that was an arbitrary choice that was made in the SegWit deployment. It could have been made as low as probably 60 or even lower and probably still would have been relatively safe. But there probably would have been a few miners that would have mined a few bad blocks, and there might have been a couple small chain splits just a few blocks deep and then other issues like that. 95 just makes it so it's like, almost guaranteed that there's going to be almost no chain split at all.
00:19:11.580 - 00:19:13.414, Speaker B: Safety measure.
00:19:13.542 - 00:19:23.390, Speaker A: But Eric, like you were saying, like, oh, we could have made it 60% and stuff, but I mean, it only ever got 30% to 40% anyway, so it wouldn't have gone through even if the threshold had been lower.
00:19:23.540 - 00:19:56.362, Speaker B: No, but at this point it was all just political posturing. I mean, really, if you think about what happened with the signaling was people were just starting to stick random data into blocks and using it as signaling mechanism that didn't actually trigger anything in the software that people were actually using. So if I'm running a node and someone decides to stick something in their coinbase transaction that says, I support the new York agreement or whatever. Yeah, okay, that's a way to kind of demonstrate support from miners for something like that. But it's not going to change anything of my software. It's not going to make some blocks suddenly become valid that weren't valid before.
00:19:56.496 - 00:20:15.950, Speaker A: Okay, so what you're saying is I guess what I'm trying to get at is I don't know exactly why this point is important to you. Is it because you feel like this is a bad way to go about doing things? Because I actually did want to ask you that later. What is the best way to make decisions like this? But is that why you're telling me all this?
00:20:16.020 - 00:20:55.562, Speaker B: The reason I bring this up is because I think there's been a huge misconception by some of the community that there's this kind of political process that's established in Bitcoin that works by minor voting, and that's actually not the case at all. I know that the Satoshi white paper talks about one CPU, one vote, but I think that it's very confusing in a lot of ways. And people have tended to misinterpret that. Back when the white paper was written, it was still something that was being prototyped. It wasn't even released yet. But if you look at the original implementation of Bitcoin, the software checks to make sure that blocks are valid. So really what miners are choosing is which blockchain to extend and which transactions to include in their blocks.
00:20:55.562 - 00:21:35.962, Speaker B: They're not actually getting to choose which rules the blockchain that they're choosing to follow will enforce. And you see that in all these markets where you have a bunch of different blockchains. Like, for instance, look at poloniax or something, you have all these different blockchains and all these mining pools that actually shift their hashing power depending on what's more profitable to mine at any given point in time. So really, miners are following whatever chain is the most profitable for them to be mining at that particular moment, and they're providing a service to users, which is to secure their transactions by making it expensive for someone to reverse it. That's what proof of work actually does. But it's not actually a voting mechanism. It's not actually a political decision making process at all.
00:21:35.962 - 00:21:59.650, Speaker B: And it was never designed that way. And I think that this signaling mechanism that was used for soft forks kind of played into that whole misunderstanding. So now we have this kind of like theater for all these different signaling of different proposals and this and that, but that actually doesn't change what the software does unless people choose to run software that actually enforces those new rules.
00:22:00.630 - 00:22:35.440, Speaker A: So, Eric, I just want to stop things for a second because I feel like we're getting into the weeds here. I actually probably just really want to talk about this later. What is the best way to do this? Because I just need to give listeners a framework to also talk about for the rest of this podcast. I actually just want to hear from both of you what deadlines and events are you most worried about over the next few months? What are some of the deadlines that are coming up? What is going to happen at those moments? What should users be aware of and what are the risks that happen at each of those points?
00:22:35.810 - 00:22:58.930, Speaker B: Okay, so right now we're waiting for BIP 91 to activate. What BIP 91 does is it requires signaling of the currently deployed version of SegWit, which is running on over 80% of nodes right now, has a particular trigger for it to activate. And once it triggers, then at that point, all blocks are going to have to enforce or blocks that use SegWit are going to have to enforce the SegWit rules.
00:22:59.010 - 00:23:06.882, Speaker A: So does that mean that immediately the chain has the segregated witness feature, which means that Lightning can be implemented?
00:23:07.026 - 00:23:25.790, Speaker B: Not immediately. Not immediately. This is just a trigger for the next trigger. It's kind of like a Rube Goldberg device. It triggers the next trigger, which is going to be a two week lock in period and then a two week activation period. So we're probably looking at activation of actual SegWit activation sometime probably mid to late August.
00:23:26.130 - 00:23:45.542, Speaker A: Okay, so basically if we reach that 80% threshold, which it looks like it'll be today, I think that means that it kicks off like a two week period of what, because doesn't it have to do with when that difficulty actually okay, so can you explain that?
00:23:45.676 - 00:24:17.578, Speaker B: Yes. So the way that SegWit is currently deployed is using what's called BIP Nine, which is a signaling mechanism that operates on every retargeting interval, which is every 2016 blocks. Every 2016 blocks. If 90% of those blocks signal for SegWit, then at that point it locks in and then people are given two weeks to upgrade. And then after two weeks at the next retargeting interval, after another 2016 blocks, at that point people can start using SegWit transactions.
00:24:17.674 - 00:24:24.122, Speaker A: Okay, and this retargeting interval, that has to do with the difficulty, the hashing difficulty on the network?
00:24:24.266 - 00:24:36.302, Speaker B: Yes. And it was just chosen because it was a convenient interval that already existed as part of the protocol. So it was decided that that interval was going to also be used for the BIP Nine activation mechanism.
00:24:36.446 - 00:24:44.200, Speaker A: Okay, but then you were saying so then after that first two weeks, then what has to happen after that in the next two weeks?
00:24:44.650 - 00:25:11.230, Speaker B: So after it's locked in, then two weeks after that, all the nodes out there are going to start enforcing SegWit. So if miners mine blocks that do not enforce it, that include transactions that are invalid according to the SegWit rules, they're going to get rejected by these nodes. So that means that miners have to, if they include SegWit transactions, they have to enforce the SegWit rules at that point. So that's when you can consider the activation to actually have been completed.
00:25:11.650 - 00:25:17.934, Speaker A: Okay, so if I'm a miner and I don't enforce that rule and I mine a block, then I don't get the block reward.
00:25:18.062 - 00:25:18.740, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:25:19.190 - 00:25:22.370, Speaker A: Okay, so there's an economic incentive for them to do this.
00:25:22.520 - 00:25:23.170, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:25:23.320 - 00:25:34.738, Speaker A: Okay. And then at which point can the different actors in Bitcoin use the feature of segregated witness as soon as it's.
00:25:34.754 - 00:25:48.700, Speaker B: Activated, which is going to be one retargeting interval after it's locked in. So it's probably going to be somewhere in late August, like a month from now or something like that, where people can actually start to use it.
00:25:49.150 - 00:25:55.374, Speaker A: But that sounds like okay, so it's like two intervals away.
00:25:55.572 - 00:25:56.126, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:56.228 - 00:25:56.830, Speaker B: Yes.
00:25:56.980 - 00:26:07.778, Speaker A: Okay, and if that happens, then that means that the user activated software will not go through, which then means that the risk of a chain split from that will also not happen. Is that correct?
00:26:07.944 - 00:26:37.830, Speaker B: That's true, yeah. Basically what happens is if BIP 91 activates and miners are actually start enforcing it, then that kind of makes BIP 148 moot, assuming that they do follow through with it. However, a lot of users still are running BIP 148 just to make sure that miners follow through on that, because most users are actually not running BIP 91. BIP 91 is for miners to enforce among each other. BIP 148 is for users to check the miners. It's kind of like checks and balances to make sure that the miners are actually following the rules.
00:26:37.990 - 00:27:02.980, Speaker A: Okay, so then it sounds like the next big deadline for people to focus on and in particular, to worry about whether or not the value of their bitcoins will drop or whether or not they'll suddenly have two different versions of bitcoin or even more, will take place in November. So can you describe what's going to happen then? And actually, Brian, do you want to do that, since Eric's been talking a lot?
00:27:03.510 - 00:28:01.350, Speaker C: I mean, the principle behind SegWit two X is that it's roughly three months or 90 days past the activation of SegWit then would be the attempted hard fork. I think it's important to realize that it's not necessarily like a sure thing. Right. Like, this is clearly going to be a massive contentious time period, I think. I don't know if Eric agrees with that, but I think there is speculation that a lot of these people that just want to get SegWit out are going to go along with this, and then once SegWit activates, the landscape could change in terms of support for a hard fork or any other perceived outcome. And so I don't know. I mean, I'm holding my tongue for what will happen, but certainly that's the most important data, I think, in the near future is what happens within that 90 day period.
00:28:02.090 - 00:28:18.300, Speaker A: Okay, so actually, earlier in this conversation, I kind of had you both argue your own side, but one question that I got from Twitter, which I think is a great. One is I want to hear you guys describe for me what you think is the best argument for the other side.
00:28:19.550 - 00:29:03.034, Speaker B: Well, I don't really think that there are sides the way that people are painting it. I think that it's kind of like people have kind of created these straw men and tried to kind of pitch one side against the other. From the very beginning, I've been a very strong supporter of increasing block size. If there's a way to do it safely and a way to do it that doesn't cause a lot of other problems. And a lot of other core developers have also been very supportive of this, including Peter Willie, who's one of the main authors of SegWit and actually was one of the big motivations to actually try to merge this into bitcoin core was the fact that we could get a block size increase without all of the other issues, including chain split risks and compatibility issues.
00:29:03.232 - 00:29:06.474, Speaker A: Peter. Willie is a supporter of SegWit Two X.
00:29:06.592 - 00:30:07.390, Speaker B: No, he's a supporter of bigger blocks also if done in a safe way and if done in a way that has peer review and that is not going to split the network or is not going to coerce people. And I think that a lot of at least several of the major core developers, core contributors since this whole issue was brought up in 2015, at least in the discussion forums that we generally use for our communications, such as the mailing lists and the IRC chat channels and other places like that. On GitHub, the general idea was, okay, let's see if we can find a way to increase block size that's safe, that's not going to cause a chain split that avoids a lot of the political contentious issues, et cetera. And SegWit was kind of the solution to all these things that we found for the moment. And so I want to just make it clear, first of all, that I'm fully in favor of being able to increase block size if it's possible to do it in a safe way. I don't think that we currently have a way to do it that's safe given the current political circumstances.
00:30:08.770 - 00:30:19.570, Speaker A: So I asked you to argue what you think is the best argument for the other side, but it seems like you're going back to saying like, a hard fork, no matter when or how you do it, is a bad idea.
00:30:19.640 - 00:30:32.006, Speaker B: No, I'm not saying that at all. I think a hard fork would be fine under different circumstances if we had better research under for it and if we actually were able to get market support for it. And right now it just doesn't look.
00:30:32.028 - 00:30:35.560, Speaker A: Like and you don't feel like there's market support for this when we have.
00:30:36.170 - 00:30:53.660, Speaker B: Every single time that any hard fork threat has been pushed hard, the markets have dropped significantly. Every single time that SegWit has been pushed hard with signaling the markets have gone up. So the market signal almost unambiguously shows that hard forks are not popular in the market and SegWit is.
00:30:55.150 - 00:31:46.586, Speaker C: But Eric, would you argue that we're getting SegWit activated right now because of both the combination of the UASF threat and the SegWit two X threat? They're both coming together and creating a scenario where people would rather not have to deal with whatever's worse, and they're going to do it. And we're seeing the market get pushed up. And that New York agreement is SegWit plus a two megabyte hard fork. Now, I don't know if people are just bluffing and saying, oh, we want the SegWit and we don't want the two megabyte, we'll just take this for now or not. But it certainly seems like the market is saying we want both of those things and we want to move forward and the price is going up. I mean, we're getting close to $2,800 now from last week when we were under 2000 because we're about to activate bit 91. So I don't necessarily buy that the market is rejecting the hard fork.
00:31:46.586 - 00:32:19.894, Speaker C: I think hard fork has certainly gotten the connotation that it's just this horrible, awful thing that could possibly ever happen. I mean, at some point in time, bitcoin is going to have to hard fork. Like you said, we'd like to do it in the most safe and responsible way and give everybody enough time to prepare for it. But we've been discussing this stuff for three years now and we keep saying that. And there's a hard fork research website you can go to and see about Spoonnet and all these other options. But at some point, there has to be some progress made. And I think you're seeing frustration within core devs as well.
00:32:19.894 - 00:32:30.662, Speaker C: I mean, you see Luke Jr. And Greg Maxwell arguing around whether bit 148 is responsible or not, whether it's too fast or this or that. I don't think everybody agrees.
00:32:30.806 - 00:32:59.974, Speaker B: It's hard to get people to agree, period. And that's a political problem. That's something that bitcoin does not solve. And I think people I wish more people understood that bitcoin is not a political system. It's just a protocol which defines a set of rules that if everyone follows it's predictable that it's going to behave a certain way, assuming that it works correctly. Changing the rules now gets into the realm of politics. And Satoshi unfortunately, did not give us a system for really being able to do that in a way that's spelled out for us.
00:32:59.974 - 00:33:57.462, Speaker B: So we're kind of trying to create a way of doing that. But just as someone that's been that's had a lot of experience working with the protocol and trying to make changes, I can tell you that it's extremely difficult. Like once there's a certain momentum and a certain amount of market value and stakeholders and all this involved in it, it's very hard to realign people and to steer the ship and to get people able to accept changes to it. So those issues are way beyond just programming and coding or engineering. We're talking politics here. And I think that people can write up all this code for hard forks and all these different scaling approaches, but in the end, it's like people need to run the actual software. You need to convince people to run it, and people need to make sure that you don't get any kind of divergent interests that want to see any kind of situations where they can kind of exploit weaknesses, because there's a lot of things that can go wrong.
00:33:57.462 - 00:34:02.778, Speaker B: If there is a divergence of interests and you don't get the right checks and balances, there could be a lot.
00:34:02.784 - 00:34:37.442, Speaker C: Of potential hacks in the this is the whole issue that I have with the UASF movement is know, we're trying to get people to run the software like you're saying. People have to use it. People have to put it out there into production. Right? A couple of thousand users running UASF is not going to do it necessarily either. We need the miners as well, and this whole demonization of what they're doing is the wrong way to go about. That's why we're so supportive of trying to do something with SegWit two X. Now, we didn't know at the time we signed the agreement whether it would be accepted by core devs or not or any of these other people.
00:34:37.442 - 00:35:04.010, Speaker C: We just thought that this was the most pragmatic approach to get everybody on board. The problem is, now we have the situation where the miners kind of work out. It works out for them whether we get SegWit or not. I mean, let's be blunt. If SegWit doesn't go through and the block stays small and the fees go up, they make money off the fees. And if the blocks get bigger and everything works out and it scales up and they get more fees, that like, they can play games with both sides.
00:35:04.090 - 00:35:45.242, Speaker B: And then that's actually what's really kind of like it upsets me a little bit that I feel that maybe interests between a lot of people, especially in the DCG portfolio, and say, like, Bitcoin core developers are more aligned than a lot of minor interests. And I'm not saying all miners. I think there's a lot of great miners out there that are doing a great service for the network, and they're definitely doing their job of making sure that the network is hard to attack. But there's also interests there that, as you point out, conflict with other companies. Obviously, miners want to collect as much in fees as possible. Businesses that use Bitcoin want to pay as little in fees as possible. Right.
00:35:45.242 - 00:36:11.794, Speaker B: And so there's a negotiation that occurs here. I think that definitely none of those fees are going to the developers. We're not getting paid any. Miners are getting all this money. So it just feels to me like you know, industry maybe, like, picked the wrong allies when it comes to, like, actually figuring out, like, where their interests lie. I understand. I'm not trying to demonize anyone in particular.
00:36:11.794 - 00:36:22.870, Speaker B: I think that everyone has their own interests and whatever. It's like, obviously, you have to expect people to be selfish, and if you expect people to not be selfish and for this to work, then obviously it's not going to work.
00:36:23.020 - 00:36:55.546, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's hold that thought right there. We're going to break now for an important word from our sponsor, Onramp, and then we'll go back to this really interesting topic.

So we were talking about the politics of this whole thing and about governance in general, and I wanted to ask you guys what you think is the best way for Bitcoin to make big decisions like this going forward.
00:37:30.910 - 00:37:54.178, Speaker B: Well, I mean, there isn't a process right now. I think a lot of people might not be very familiar with all the intricacies of it. I think that there's a big kind of clash of cultures, maybe, between free open source software development and more corporate software development. But there is a process for submitting proposals, for getting them reviewed. There's a big open community out there for doing this stuff.
00:37:54.344 - 00:37:57.810, Speaker A: But what's the process then, for deciding between those different proposals?
00:37:58.310 - 00:38:32.746, Speaker B: Well, I mean, right now yeah, that's a good question. Right now, basically, people can run whatever software they want, I believe is a fundamental right. And this is one of the things that actually, I believe was one of my biggest bones of contention with the Hong Kong agreement and also a problem with the New York agreement is that I do not believe in telling people that they need to run specific code. I believe that people should be able to run whatever code they want. If it happens to be code that's buggy or that has problems or that splits them off the network or they end up losing money. Well, I mean, caveat empty. I think that that's just part of crypto.
00:38:32.746 - 00:38:43.266, Speaker B: If you want to really have control over your own funds, then you're also responsible for making sure that you're running stuff that works so you support more.
00:38:43.288 - 00:38:50.470, Speaker A: Like a laissez faire style where it's not really making decisions. It's sort of like let anybody do what they want.
00:38:50.620 - 00:39:04.138, Speaker B: I believe that miners should be able to mine whatever blockchain they want to mine and users should be able to use whatever blockchain they want to use. And merchants should be able to support whatever blockchains they want to support. And exchanges should be able to list whatever blockchains they want to list.
00:39:04.224 - 00:39:31.150, Speaker A: But then in this case, where there's this issue with a network where there's more demand for transactions than the network is able to process, how do we I totally get your philosophy here. Maybe for other things in life, but when it comes to this kind of network, where kind of everybody needs to be on board in order for the whole thing to stay together, what is the best way to make these decisions?
00:39:31.230 - 00:39:46.210, Speaker B: But do they I mean, for instance, Ethereum has been going on without the need for obviously Bitcoin is used as a reserve currency for all of crypto. But besides that, you have other blockchains that are chugging along if people want to create a cryptocurrency.
00:39:46.370 - 00:39:54.058, Speaker A: I don't know what you mean by that. I don't know what you mean by that. Are you talking about the fact that Ethereum had a fork and so the people who disagree are not no, I'm.
00:39:54.064 - 00:40:09.200, Speaker B: Just saying that if you want to create a blockchain that has features that are above and beyond Bitcoin, nobody's stopping you. You can create a blockchain. It won't be called Bitcoin, but you can brand it and make it something big. And if you do a better job than Bitcoin, you should be able to win on the markets, I believe.
00:40:10.930 - 00:40:17.074, Speaker A: But people that have already invested in Bitcoin, they want to retain that investment or the value of it.
00:40:17.272 - 00:40:34.054, Speaker B: But that works both ways, though, because people that invested in Bitcoin also subscribe to a particular set of rules, a lot of users. And if you break compatibility with that, then it becomes a question of whether or not you can really still call that Bitcoin, because as soon as you start to break rules that some people accepted as part of the rules of.
00:40:34.172 - 00:40:41.110, Speaker A: So, Eric, I feel like you still haven't answered this question. What is the best way to make decisions about how to change the network?
00:40:41.550 - 00:41:21.750, Speaker B: Well, first of all, anything that's technical requires technical review requires a lot of peer review and making sure that I mean, this is a lot of cutting edge stuff that hasn't been really fully field tested yet, and we're talking about a bounty of tens of billions of dollars. So there's very little margin of error here. It needs to be really carefully reviewed and tested and made sure that it actually makes sense scientifically and technically. But then once we have a proposal that actually makes sense on all that. Getting everyone to actually agree to use it really is a matter of aligning incentives. That's one of the things about Bitcoin is that there's no formal governance structure in it. And I think a lot of people want to keep it that way.
00:41:21.750 - 00:41:39.418, Speaker B: There's incentive structures and if you can get the incentives to align correctly with a particular idea that you have, then the network might take you up on that. And I think that certain things make it much more likely for the incentives to align. For instance, not disenfranchising people or making features optional or supporting back.
00:41:39.504 - 00:42:24.858, Speaker A: So from what you're saying though, then it sounds like what Bitmain and Jihan did was rational because their incentive is for the long term to have more fees come to them and to have more transactions processed on chain rather than off chain. And Jihan fully told me he's not opposed to SegWit. What he's opposed to is SegWit without also a block size increase. And so then it sounds like what you're saying here is if incentives are the way that this should be run, then what he did was completely rational. Because therefore, now he's getting well, hopefully, if this goes through, he's going to get what he wants, which is the block size to be bigger and for more transactions to be processed on chain. And so then it worked.
00:42:25.024 - 00:43:19.302, Speaker C: But I think that there's a little bit more to it here that I think Eric alluded to in the beginning of this podcast, which was that there's some control issues here that are getting glossed over, I think for Jihan to say, I support segway but I want a hard fork. I mean, this is a temporary fix. Let's not fool ourselves. Even if we move to twelve megabyte blocks, at some point that's going to get surpassed and we're going to be back to the same issue, right? Unless Lightning Network or something solves everybody's problems, but once again still requires on chain transactions. And so this is still a think, you know, that it wouldn't be developing the UAHF and these other Bu and Bitcoin, ABC and all these other things that change the governance model of Bitcoin if there wasn't more of a power grab also here at Play. And that's something that we shouldn't ignore.
00:43:19.446 - 00:43:34.254, Speaker A: So you think that Jihan or Bitmain was basically doing this as a power grab against the core developers to be like, hey, I know you guys want this thing, but you can't have it unless you kind of go along with what I want? Is that what you're saying?
00:43:34.372 - 00:44:05.866, Speaker C: My hunch is that I think they felt like they had a lot of control when Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited came out. They thought they had enough power as miners to kind of force some of this governance stuff through and they realized that wasn't going to happen. So now this is somewhat of a little bit of, I think a gracious capitulation to the market because users were rejecting them as well and not adopting unlimited or these others and they're going to maybe make another run at it. I don't know. This is my speculation, but obviously I.
00:44:05.888 - 00:44:14.254, Speaker A: Also want to ask you though, the same question about so what do you think is the best way for the Bitcoin community to decide on big decisions like this?
00:44:14.452 - 00:45:17.330, Speaker C: Well, I mean I certainly think that we need to reevaluate how much weight we put on minor signaling and mean I think it's clear that they have too much control. We have to always fly to Hong Kong and talk with them every time there's like a problem or we want something done. And I think that that kind of is not a tenable long term solution. I don't necessarily know what the problem mean, what the solution? I mean, I think we're in this weird transition period where we had this very like Eric said, a proof of concept blockchain with a consensus model and a process for trying to figure out how we get new rules into the protocol. The Bit process was created after the know all this stuff was kind of added on and we're getting to the point where maybe it's almost better that the protocol it's like TCP IP, it's not changing all the time, it's not dramatically, we're not adding new rules to TCP IP every six months, right. Everything is done another level up.
00:45:17.480 - 00:45:26.100, Speaker A: So then making it a settlement layer which would happen if we kept the block size low.
00:45:26.710 - 00:45:43.366, Speaker C: I don't know if that's certainly the best solution, but I think at least if that was the plan and then everybody understood that, that we could kind of use that as a foundation to build off of and then maybe more people would put effort into the next level up. I think right now interesting that you're.
00:45:43.398 - 00:45:59.120, Speaker A: Saying that because since you signed the New York agreement which know something that was kind of against that philosophy of keeping Bitcoin more like a settlement layer. But it's weird that now it feels like you're sort of arguing against yourself.
00:45:59.490 - 00:46:04.960, Speaker C: I'm not arguing against myself because I don't personally consider myself on a side.
00:46:06.230 - 00:46:07.346, Speaker B: I don't think either of us two.
00:46:07.368 - 00:46:42.806, Speaker C: Guys that don't necessarily disagree as much as it seems like, right. I think we're all very pragmatic about what we should do and I think most of the disagreements are around just petty political arguments. I think what we agree that we need to be safe about our scaling enhancements. Like I said before, the reason that we support the New York agreement is because we feel like this is the best chance that we can get. SegWit, which I think most people agree is better than what we have right now. And at least solves some of the problems for now. And sets up Lightning Network and helps.
00:46:42.838 - 00:46:52.880, Speaker A: Us just like a pragmatic choice. It's like this isn't the best thing, but it's like the highest chance of ending this debate and just moving things forward.
00:46:53.810 - 00:47:35.518, Speaker C: I think so. And a lot of people would argue that's not a great reason to support something because you should always do what's technically the best thing. But you know what? That's not the way the world works often. Sometimes you just have to accept it and move on and we build off of it because ultimately, I think Bitcoin is stronger if we have miners, big businesses, small businesses, users, core devs, everybody moving in the right direction together, I don't think that we're ever going to really do much. What we're going to do is we're going to encourage people to go off and do altcoin development and start these other projects. I mean, we're already seeing that. And it's sad that a lot of other garbage comes along with that.
00:47:35.518 - 00:48:00.310, Speaker C: And the people that are true bitcoin believers have been here for many years before all that stuff kind of existed. They understand that the cordes that work on Bitcoin are probably some of the most devoted and most dedicated people in the space. They're some of the brightest and they don't give up on their principles. And that's why we're seeing this battle, because these guys are the guys who want behind that.
00:48:00.460 - 00:48:44.914, Speaker A: So I want to ask about something that Eric brought up earlier, which is such an interesting question to me, but one of the because I tweeted something like, hey, I'm going to have a big blocker and a small blocker on my podcast, which I asked them. And all these people took issue with the way I framed it. And one that I loved was like it's more like corporations versus cipher punks. So what do you think? Because I feel like there is this tension know, bitcoin started the early community largely consisted of libertarians and then the people who more brought it to the masses were these corporate entities like Coinbase, zappo block, BTCC. So what do you think about that idea that this is what's really going on here, that that is what really the battle is?
00:48:44.952 - 00:49:15.150, Speaker C: Right mean, personally, I think it's kind of a sad argument know? First of all, I think the core devs and developers in general and a lot of the I mean, call me out, please if I'm getting too incendiary here, but I think they're very vocal and they try to explain their positions. And I think a lot of the companies don't say anything. I've talked to many of the people that are leading these companies and they just kind of like, oh, we don't ignore that noise and they don't defend themselves or their positions.
00:49:15.570 - 00:49:43.106, Speaker A: Well, I think some of them, they for them, it's like too risky. Like Coinbase tried to do that Bitcoin classic thing. It failed miserably for them. And I have personally asked some of the other CEOs in this space about this issue and they just will not touch it. They won't say anything publicly. They definitely have opinions, but they know that if they say anything publicly, that will be the death of them. They'll get embroiled in these debates on Twitter and blah, blah, blah.
00:49:43.106 - 00:49:46.520, Speaker A: But I do feel like that is kind of what we're seeing happening.
00:49:47.930 - 00:50:29.286, Speaker B: They kind of burned themselves, I think, or some of these CEOs, I think, kind of burned themselves in the whole block size debate because I think that they took very vocal positions when the environment might not have been very conducive towards that being successful. And that's not to say that CEOs should never go out on a limb. I mean, I also have a company and I also am interested in making a successful business and I also want to see Bitcoin scale. And definitely I'm trying to be as pragmatic as possible. It's not just about being ideological. I definitely did not come into this space just thinking in terms of libertarianism or anarchy or anything like that. For me, it was really a practical way to kind of build a career and do something that I like.
00:50:29.286 - 00:50:36.070, Speaker B: And over time, it kind of grew on me and I'm like, wow, this whole concept of self sovereignty is actually very powerful.
00:50:37.130 - 00:50:42.950, Speaker A: And by that, do you feel like what's important to make that happen is decentralized network?
00:50:43.110 - 00:51:00.906, Speaker B: Well, what's important to make that happen is to make sure that people are able to continue to validate things and to make sure that people don't change rules from under them and to make sure that people cannot easily counterfeit stuff or create money out of thin air. That is not part of the rules.
00:51:01.018 - 00:51:48.362, Speaker A: Wait, but Eric, what I really wanted to ask when I asked that, was one of the concerns that I've heard about increasing the block size is that it will make it more difficult for small miners to support the network, which will then increase miner centralization. And so I feel like there's this tension where a lot of the people that advocate keeping the block size small, it's because they want to keep Bitcoin as decentralized as possible. And then you've got these startups and other companies running on the Bitcoin network who are like, oh my God, these transactions aren't going through. It's like causing us all these problems. We've got these users who are really annoyed at us. And so for them, it's kind of like this headache. And then for you guys, it's this philosophical thing of like, hey, we need to keep the network decentralized because already it's so centralized.
00:51:48.362 - 00:51:50.190, Speaker A: Am I wrong in thinking that that's.
00:51:51.170 - 00:51:52.254, Speaker C: Not black and white?
00:51:52.372 - 00:52:26.870, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not black and white, but there's three points I want to address here. I think there's like three issues that you're kind of combining there. One is this backlog part of it just has to do with Wallet software and fee calculation software that was just not prepared for full blocks obviously if blocks are full, I mean, it's just an economics thing. If supply is low and demand is high, obviously fees are going to get higher. But better fee calculation heuristics in wallet software will make it so that you don't have to wait as long. And I think a lot of the earlier situations with that were just wallets that were not calculating fees correctly.
00:52:26.950 - 00:52:32.654, Speaker A: Right, but that's only going to take us so far, like five or ten years from now when hopefully there's a lot more activity on the network than.
00:52:32.692 - 00:53:34.778, Speaker B: What even if you have correct or better pricing, some applications are going to get priced out given a certain level of supply, no doubt. So the second issue is regarding validation costs. How expensive is it to make sure for you to check on your computer that the transactions that you received are actually valid? And that's where we get into issues of bigger blocks requiring more download, a bigger download and more computational effort, more CPU to actually validate the transactions and blocks, et cetera. Right now the blockchain is growing pretty quickly and it takes longer and longer to synchronize a node and to be able to actually fully validate for yourself. Now, with better crypto, it's possible that we might be able to reduce this significantly. It's possible that with better technology we'd be actually able to support much larger blocks without requiring as much computational effort in verification of the blocks. And with things like the Lightning network or off chain protocols, most people do not need to actually be validating most of other people's transactions.
00:53:34.778 - 00:54:25.418, Speaker B: So you only validate a very small percentage of the total transactions that occur on the network. So those are really good ways to avoid increasing validation costs, which makes it easier for you to actually make sure that Bitcoin hasn't been co opted or someone isn't just suddenly creating counterfeit Bitcoins out of nowhere or some state isn't deciding to just suddenly blacklist transactions or stuff like that. Right, but the third issue, which I think is the most critical issue, which I think also kind of received the least amount of attention at first, is really how do you actually guide the markets to adopt a particular incompatible change. And if you're going to introduce any kind of incompatible change to a blockchain, you have to get all the markets to agree that now what we used to call Bitcoin is now no longer Bitcoin. This is the new Bitcoin, which is basically a protocol replacement.
00:54:25.514 - 00:54:31.138, Speaker A: And isn't that sort of what SegWit two X is? I mean, all these companies that signed are like the big companies.
00:54:31.304 - 00:54:43.942, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what any hard work would essentially entail. And I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying it's very difficult to do. And it's more than just writing code. I mean, I've been writing code forever and I can tell you that writing code is definitely not enough to make that happen.
00:54:43.996 - 00:54:44.118, Speaker A: I.
00:54:44.124 - 00:54:46.840, Speaker B: Mean, you need to get people to agree to run that code.
00:54:47.530 - 00:54:50.374, Speaker A: But it looks like that's what this agreement did, right?
00:54:50.572 - 00:55:16.160, Speaker C: Yes. The thing is it's forcing the issue. Right? It's forcing the issue. We all agree that the hard fork is probably possible whether it's smooth or not. That's debatable, but it needs all this preparation. But the Segwa two X is saying, look, this is not like a super crazy leap to go from 1 MB block size to a two megabyte block size. Let's do this, we can do this.
00:55:16.470 - 00:55:26.270, Speaker A: Since this is actually such a small increase really that we're getting, I am wondering kind of like long term, what do you guys think is the best plan for scaling?
00:55:26.350 - 00:55:49.702, Speaker B: Yeah, see, so that's the thing. It's interesting what Brian just mentioned, like just going from one to two. I mean, even if we were going from one to 1.1, the same exact issues with chain splits and incompatibility issues would arise. So it's not a matter of how much bigger we make it, right? And if we make it bigger, then what are we getting for that? Is it really worth the disruptions and all the potential havoc that can be wreaked on the network?
00:55:49.766 - 00:55:55.866, Speaker A: Just should we hard fork to like four megabytes or eight or do bitcoin unlimited?
00:55:55.978 - 00:56:06.094, Speaker B: I think we should be working on better technologies, better crypto, better ways to compress proofs to make it compact proofs. There's a lot of really interesting research that's being done in cryptography right now.
00:56:06.132 - 00:56:09.566, Speaker A: Wait, but how long is all that going to take? Like the congestion on the network has.
00:56:09.668 - 00:56:18.086, Speaker B: But going two X isn't going to take us anywhere either really, other than just maybe like kicking the can down the road and getting a lot of people upset, it'll take the can down.
00:56:18.108 - 00:56:30.002, Speaker A: The road and maybe during that time we can do all this research on the better cryptography and stuff. Is that kind of what you think? Again, going back to my question, what's your idea of the best way to scale long term?
00:56:30.066 - 00:57:19.898, Speaker B: Well, first of all, if we're going to do a block size increase, I don't believe we should just bump it up twice and then just leave it at that because then that sets a precedent that every single time blocks fill up, we're going to do another hard fork for that. That just seems totally silly. So first of all, if we're going to do a hard fork in the worst of cases, I would like to see at least like an X percent increase per year or something of the block size so we don't need to hard fork every single time, first of all. And second of all, I would love to see a more dynamic or more adaptive kind of system that responds to actual market dynamics and to have more a protocol that can support other functions besides just paying miners, like paying relay nodes and paying validation, paying for proofs. There's ways for cryptographically generating like Snarks or stuff like that. Maybe. And paying people using payment channels to be able to do that kind of stuff.
00:57:19.898 - 00:57:29.820, Speaker B: Once you start to get those kinds of incentives now you're talking being able to increase the capacity to much higher levels without significantly degrading security.
00:57:31.710 - 00:57:50.882, Speaker A: Those are things, I haven't heard much about them and I don't really know much about them but it does sound to me like they're probably further off. And here we have this network that's been congested for a while and so maybe it is not a bad idea to, as you put it, kick the can down the road and maybe let some of the other technology catch up so it can be implemented later.
00:57:50.936 - 00:58:05.814, Speaker B: Is that but at what price though? I mean, if it splits the network and if it causes a lot of discord in the community and if it affects the markets, if the price is very adversely affected, is it really worth it just for a small tiny like.
00:58:05.852 - 00:58:33.038, Speaker A: What we were saying before already so much? Well I don't know about so much, but a lot of economic activity is moving off Bitcoin. Like how many startups have I talked to where they're moving from Bitcoin to Ethereum or Litecoin or whatever it is already? The fact that there's this much congestion which maybe isn't critical from your perspective it's enough where businesses are making other choices and they're not using the Bitcoin blockchain. So I think that's why but the.
00:58:33.044 - 00:59:11.126, Speaker C: Other chain comes in though, that's where the Pragmatism comes in here and when we're talking about going from a 1 block, I mean let's be honest, it's really effective eight megabyte block, right? I mean with SegWit. So that's a considerable amount. It's not negligible but it's certainly not going to last forever. And I think the thing is it's kind of what you were alluding to Laura is that if this does at least get everybody kind of like okay, well now we're not just dwelling on mean how much time did we waste on the block size debate? Just this silly block size debate right now. I mean really, I know it's more than that but still we can't get past it and people are leaving.
00:59:11.318 - 00:59:37.438, Speaker B: Some people were actually working on code though and working on solutions and working on optimizing a whole bunch of other crap that makes it possible to have bigger blocks though. I mean you can't discount the effect. Like, for instance, peter Willie worked on the SEC p. 256 library. This is a library that increases validation, reduces validation time considerably. It's like a factor of six or something just from the cost of validating signatures for a block. So this kind of stuff and then like the headers for Sync which he did way before that.
00:59:37.438 - 00:59:49.478, Speaker B: Also Peter Willie, all these things. And then Matt Corralo with the fiber network so that the miners are more able to easily relay blocks to each other and then there was compact blocks.
00:59:49.654 - 01:00:06.846, Speaker C: Those are brilliant technical solutions that the perception is not feeding out into the mainstream. Right. All these things are businesses and expanding the ecosystem for Bitcoin that are making it more valuable. They're not catching that. So I don't know, maybe there is some kind of communication issue gap here.
01:00:06.948 - 01:00:07.840, Speaker B: I agree.
01:00:08.610 - 01:00:10.874, Speaker C: All these things are necessary innovations.
01:00:11.002 - 01:00:34.690, Speaker B: They're not just amazing innovations, they're necessary. They're prerequisites. Without this, what will happen is that you'll run a node and you will not be able to keep up with the blockchain. It just will not sync. The blockchain will be advancing more quickly than your computer can keep up with it. Without these advances, if we were to use Bitcoin core from just a couple of years ago, it would not be able to keep up with today's blockchain. So all these advances are going on and all these are necessary in order to be able to do a block size increase.
01:00:34.770 - 01:00:55.146, Speaker A: So we're running out of time. So I'm just going to ask you guys one last question, which is that as we go forward, every single design decision that we make in Bitcoin is going to require some trade offs. So when you think about the different kinds of trade offs that you're willing to make, what would you be willing to do to keep the network growing?
01:00:55.338 - 01:01:13.490, Speaker B: Well, I think that obviously there's risks involved in anything that we're doing right now. It's a huge project with a huge bounty. It's one of the biggest socioeconomic experiments conducted in history, probably. And I think that there's a certain risk tolerance that different people are willing to take.
01:01:13.640 - 01:01:15.006, Speaker A: And what's yours?
01:01:15.198 - 01:01:27.974, Speaker B: Well, I personally would like to see good solutions to scaling. I think there's some really great ideas, but I would like to see more constructive dialogue first without people just jumping to specific solutions that they think are because this is the problem.
01:01:28.012 - 01:01:30.700, Speaker A: Laurie but Eric, what trade off are you willing to make?
01:01:31.550 - 01:01:45.258, Speaker B: What trade mean? There's millions of different trade offs depending on the situation. Right? But definitely for sure, I think the self sovereignty aspect and the ability to validate transactions for myself is a huge part of what I value in Bitcoin.
01:01:45.274 - 01:01:50.202, Speaker A: More than anything, which is more like the decentralization philosophy.
01:01:50.346 - 01:01:57.386, Speaker B: Yes. But I would definitely like to grow the network and make it support way more. I would just like to see better crypto implemented.
01:01:57.578 - 01:02:21.606, Speaker A: So I just want to draw that out. So if that's your priority, then the downside to that the trade off that you're willing to make is maybe for, because essentially if we keep it that way, then one of the ways to do that would be to keep the block size low, which then is something I think that will cause a lot of problem for some of the bigger economic actors and potentially also long term for the miners. Is that?
01:02:21.708 - 01:02:53.458, Speaker B: Not necessarily. I mean, there could be ways to grow the block size that are actually smart, that make sense, that we can get a lot of support for, and boom, we do it. It's just that the ways that have been called for so far are just like really brute force, like blunt things that a lot of people think, well, is it really worth the risk? A lot of people are not going to get behind it. It's probably going to cause a lot of contention and potential market disruptions. And is it really worth it for just like getting a two X increase? For instance, if it was 1000 X, I'd be like, oh yeah, maybe it is worth it, but if my business is just going to increase but if.
01:02:53.464 - 01:02:56.510, Speaker A: It'S 1000 X, then you lose your decentralization priority.
01:02:56.590 - 01:03:03.442, Speaker B: No, you could still do a thousand times the number of transactions without sacrificing decentralization with better crypto and a better protocol.
01:03:03.586 - 01:03:08.694, Speaker A: Okay. And Brian. What about you? What tradeoffs are you willing to think?
01:03:08.812 - 01:03:41.678, Speaker C: You know, I have tremendous respect for the fact that changing a protocol is very difficult and it's not something you should take lightly. And I certainly think that's the case with the hard fork that's looming over us. But I also think that there is some value with trying to get all of the most important actors in the ecosystem together to go at this and be contributing. Because right now what you're seeing is a lot of people that are trying to push against each other. And we've seen several years of this back and forth.
01:03:41.854 - 01:03:49.906, Speaker A: It sounds like for you, you want to move forward at the risk of perhaps having a hard fork, sorry, a chain split.
01:03:50.098 - 01:04:21.374, Speaker C: I think decentralization is this weird term that people throw out there, but it's a gradient, it's not black or white. Like there's different degrees of decentralization. And whether or not this hard fork to a two megabytes is going to dramatically impact true decentralization of Bitcoin, I certainly personally don't think that that's going to impact it that much. There are others that do. They feel like they will kill bitcoin. But I think the most important thing is that we just kind of push through this. We get it and we do what the market is asking for.
01:04:21.374 - 01:04:28.290, Speaker C: And right now we're seeing that people are asking for SegWit and they're asking for an increase in the block.
01:04:28.790 - 01:04:32.994, Speaker B: Actually, we don't know about the second part. We definitely know about SegWit. But the second part, I'm one last.
01:04:33.032 - 01:04:49.830, Speaker A: Question for Eric, which is that this change that's happening was implemented essentially without even though many core developers opposed it. So after this, where does that leave the core developers in terms of their power over the mean?
01:04:49.900 - 01:05:48.614, Speaker B: Let me just clear up a little bit what happened there. I mean, I feel that there's a lot of communication problems that have been communication has been pretty bad for a long time. I mean, like, for instance, most of the DCG portfolio companies I don't think even really realized who most of the core developers were or even met most of us until fairly recently, back in 2015. Basically, they thought that the Bitcoin core had spokespeople and a couple of developers and that they kind of represented Bitcoin Core to the industry. And industry didn't really come to talk to us about any of these concerns at all. We kind of had to pick this up indirectly because other people were complaining, right? And so, first of all, it'd be really nice if people in the industry that actually have concerns about this would actually come and approach us and talk to us about these things before making decisions and doing full on campaigns, trying to push particular agendas. Because if we can kind of work on these things and get more consensus beforehand, it'll go a lot smoother.
01:05:48.742 - 01:05:57.742, Speaker A: So I'm just wondering, and correct me if I'm wrong, the main developers behind SegWit two X are Jeff Garzick and Mike Belshi. Is that correct?
01:05:57.796 - 01:06:03.358, Speaker C: Well, Mike Belshi, I don't think, is a developer. It's mostly Jeff and some other contributors on the team.
01:06:03.444 - 01:06:21.250, Speaker A: So Jeff is with Block BLQ and his co founder Matt Rosek was on the podcast earlier. And then Mike Bilshi is with know. They're they're kind of like shepherding this massive change. And so after that, where does that leave the core developers?
01:06:21.410 - 01:07:18.578, Speaker B: Well, I mean, to be completely honest with you, it was a very small number of core developers that actually were like the ones that got advisory roles in companies a couple of years ago and were kind of like lobbying for this kind of push for the vast majority of the Protocol development community in Bitcoin. And I'm not just talking about core developers. I'm talking about all the people that work on a whole bunch of different other parts of Bitcoin or layers on top of Bitcoin. I think for the most part, we're in agreement that we need to find better, smarter ways to scale. But unfortunately, this particular point of view did not really get represented very well to industry a couple of years ago. It's kind of weird to see what happened with Jeff because I think Jeff Garzick at the beginning of 2015 was actually very much aligned, I think, with what most of the development the protocol development community was looking for. But then towards the middle, there was this very drastic change that occurred.
01:07:18.578 - 01:07:23.162, Speaker B: And unfortunately, I think that he kind of burnt a lot of bridges with a lot of the rest of the.
01:07:23.216 - 01:07:36.918, Speaker A: Coin since he's kind of behind this SegWit two X and yet he's burnt bridges and you guys kind of opposed SegWit two X. I just wonder where that leaves things afterward. Like, do you guys still have as much control over the protocol as well?
01:07:36.944 - 01:07:59.782, Speaker B: It depends on what people are going to use. I mean, it's really up to the users in the end, what they decide Bitcoin is, right, all we can do is release code and see if people want to use it or not. And that's what we're going to continue to do. And if people want to do a two megabyte hard fork, and it seems like that's what the markets want and there's a huge demand for that, I don't think it'll be that hard to make that happen, but I just don't see that right now.
01:07:59.916 - 01:08:27.200, Speaker C: But it doesn't seem like the market wants it. They want it. It's hard to forget that when Blockstream was announced as a company and it had so many of the core devs on there and important people in Bitcoin, everybody was so excited about side chains. They thought that was the future. They thought Blockstream was like this big company was going to come and help us save it. They embraced that. And for the last three years, we just haven't seen the side chains come to fruition and solve any problems.
01:08:28.610 - 01:08:58.920, Speaker B: And I wasn't part of that at all. I thought the side chain concept was interesting, but I thought that it had a lot of logistical complications and there needed to be a whole infrastructure in place in order to support that. And I thought that we were still several years away from that. So when I worked on SegWit, when SegWit was first developed by when Peter Willie was working on that, he was working on it as a side chain. But when I really got excited about SegWit was when we realized that we could actually incorporate it as a soft fork and without needing to use a.
01:08:59.370 - 01:09:25.054, Speaker A: You know, we're really over time and side chains is going to take us down a whole nother path. Side path. So I actually just want to end it on this note about how excited we are that it looks like Sequit's going to go through. I think it will be great. It will bring a lot of innovation with it. We will see what happens in November. It's going to be really interesting to see what happens between now and then and also to see how that sentiment is reflected in the price.
