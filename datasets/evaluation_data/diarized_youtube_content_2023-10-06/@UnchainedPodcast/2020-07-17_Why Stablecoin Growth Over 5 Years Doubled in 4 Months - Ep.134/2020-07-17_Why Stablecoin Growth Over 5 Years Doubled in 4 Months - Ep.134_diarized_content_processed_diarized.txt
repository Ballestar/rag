00:00:58.010 - 00:01:03.070, Speaker B: Today's guest is Nate Madri, senior research analyst at CoinMetrics. Welcome, Nate.
00:01:03.670 - 00:01:05.700, Speaker D: Hey, Laura. Thanks for having me back.
00:01:06.150 - 00:01:08.530, Speaker A: CoinMetrics published a report this week called.
00:01:08.600 - 00:01:12.660, Speaker B: The Rise of Stablecoins. What are the top takeaways from your report?
00:01:14.550 - 00:01:38.730, Speaker D: So the top takeaways are basically so when I started the report, I started by looking at kind of the history of stablecoins over time. But when I started digging into the data, I refocused it around, specifically the rise of tether. So over the last three to four months, the supply of tether specifically has more than doubled, which has pushed the supply of overall stablecoins to new highs.
00:01:39.950 - 00:01:50.606, Speaker A: And why did you decide to look into stablecoins? Now, you did talk a little bit about how tether has risen, and can you put some numbers on that?
00:01:50.708 - 00:02:27.994, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So, to put it in a little context, so it took about five years for stablecoin supply to reach 6 billion overall, and it only took another four months for it to grow from 6 billion to 12 billion. And pretty much all of that growth happened after the March twelveTH crypto crash, when crypto assets, including bitcoin and ethereum, dropped over 50% in a day. So in the report, I really dug into why that happened and why the rise was sparked by this crash in cryptos, which is a little counterintuitive because in the past when we've seen spikes in stablecoins, especially tether, it's kind of coincided with bitcoin price going up.
00:02:28.192 - 00:02:29.740, Speaker A: And what did you find?
00:02:30.290 - 00:03:03.794, Speaker D: Basically what happened is, first of all, there was a big increase in demand for stablecoins and tether specifically following March twelveTH. That happened for a variety of reasons. The first is that there was a rush to safety after March twelveTH, so people started piling into stablecoins. Trading volume also went up. So there was an increased demand for stablecoins, which are also often used as a, quote, currency in trading. But this rise in demand caused tether price to rise above a dollar. So typically when we think of stablecoins, they're pegged to a dollar.
00:03:03.794 - 00:03:44.130, Speaker D: Their whole point is that they should be stable at a dollar. But this large increase in demand after March twelveTH led to this increase in Tether price all the way through the end of May. And that increase in price then led to arbitrage opportunities. So because of stablecoin's nature as a peg currency, anytime it deviates from that one dollars peg, there's opportunity to make money. So when we see this huge increase in supply, billions of stablecoins suddenly being printed, a lot of that is tied to the fact that if whoever is printing these stablecoins or buying them at a dollar can then go and sell them immediately on an exchange and make a lot of money, essentially.
00:03:44.870 - 00:03:48.870, Speaker A: Wait, which stablecoins were veering away from the one dollars peg?
00:03:49.850 - 00:04:26.770, Speaker D: So pretty much all of them went significantly above their peg on March twelveTH specifically. And that was because of the price crash and related to kind of the BitMEX liquidation spiral and crypto prices just crashing. But most of them recovered quickly, except for Tether. Tether is kind of the big outlier here. While the rest of the stablecoins, USDC and PAX, went back close to that $1 peg, tether stayed above that peg for a couple of months. And it's just kind of like fractions of a penny above the peg. But that small amount above the peg has huge consequences and can lead to a lot of arbitrage opportunities.
00:04:29.030 - 00:04:32.878, Speaker A: Why has Tether been far and away the most dominant stablecoin?
00:04:33.054 - 00:05:08.810, Speaker D: Yeah, so if you look back throughout its history, tether has accounted for 90% plus of the overall stablecoin supply. Its past is a little more sorted. So, as most people in crypto are aware, tether has a little bit of a sketchy history. There's questions about whether it's really fully backed and reserved, but for whatever reason, that has never really stopped it from becoming, from being the dominant coin. The big thing that happened is, first of all, it just had a first mover advantage. It was basically the first big stable coin. It started gaining momentum from there and it basically became one of the dominant trading currencies.
00:05:08.810 - 00:05:57.546, Speaker D: And as I show in the report, too, chether has a lot more liquidity than other stablecoins. So since it has more liquidity that kind of begets more liquidity, more people use it, there are questions about what really is driving this demand. It's a little harder to figure that out, especially if you're just looking at on chain and market data. But there have been a lot of reports that Tether is used extensively in Asian trading markets, especially in China. It's used a lot for OTC trading. It's used kind of as a replacement, as a fiat on ramp in places where there's restrictions about trading fiat directly for cryptocurrency. And I think kind of that gray area that Tether lives in which I was just referring to about the regulatory kind of sketchiness that's a lot of what makes Tether attractive in a way to certain traders or OTC.
00:05:57.546 - 00:06:32.540, Speaker D: Desks or whatever who are kind of living in the gray area, need to quickly get access to cryptocurrency and might not be able to if they're playing within the regulations of their jurisdiction. So that's driven a lot of it. And again, it's this kind of even though tether is supposed to be pegged to a dollar, it's almost like a feature of tether in a way that it's not pegged to a dollar rather than a bug. Because since it fluctuates more than other cryptocurrencies. That just leads to this kind of disproportionate explosion in supply of people who are trying to profit off of it, basically.
00:06:32.910 - 00:06:45.280, Speaker A: And can you just walk me through the arbitrage opportunity? So essentially I'm assuming you buy another stablecoin, just yeah, walk me through how that works. How are people making money from this?
00:06:45.730 - 00:07:38.522, Speaker D: Yeah. So the kind of simplest, most base, straightforward way. So tether on paper, the way it's supposed to work is you put a dollar into the tether reserve, then you can get a dollar out, USDT out. So whoever has access to printing more tether, to putting more money into the reserve, which is we actually don't really know exactly who has it, but it's a handful of kind of traders and exchanges and stuff. They can then go in and essentially print more tether for a dollar each, sell it on exchanges right away, where it's trading for more a dollar and make quick money. So that's kind of the most basic example. But anyone who has access to buying tether at a dollar, which even if the price on most exchanges is over a dollar, there's still opportunities to buy it for a dollar either on other exchanges or the kind of best way is just going straight to the source, putting more money into tether reserve and printing new tether.
00:07:38.522 - 00:07:57.350, Speaker D: Anyone who's able to buy it for a dollar can then go and sell it for the higher price. And there are kind of markets on different exchanges too for trading tether directly to USD or even other stable coins. But I think a majority of it happened from people printing new tether and then selling that new tether immediately for a profit.
00:07:58.170 - 00:08:07.170, Speaker A: But normally when there are arbitrage opportunities, they kind of get evened out because why didn't that happen? Why did it stay above the peg?
00:08:07.250 - 00:08:47.670, Speaker D: Yeah, that's kind of one of the mysteries of this. Why did it stay above the peg for so long? Because, yeah, exactly like you said, kind of arbitrage it naturally will pull the price back to a dollar as people are selling it. So that's one of the mysteries here is how did it stay so far above the peg for a couple of months? And I'm not sure. I wish I had a better answer about that. It's a little opaque just with the nature of tether. It's a little opaque how this entire process works of printing new tether, who gets it? We're not really sure. Past research has shown that when new tether is printed, a lot of it goes directly to a certain set of exchanges, Bifinex being the biggest one OTC desks as well, which are hard to track.
00:08:47.670 - 00:09:35.620, Speaker D: So, yeah, it's confusing exactly how this process is working, but this appears to be what happening. I have an interesting graph in the report that shows the days where tether's price is above the peg, above a dollar on one axis, and then the other axis is the new tether supply that's being issued. And we use a metric at Coimetric called free float supply, which shows the amount of supply that's actually getting out there into the public as opposed to the supply that just is being held by the treasury. So if you look at these two together, the free float supply, the increase in free float supply just perfectly lines up with the days that tether's price is above a dollar. And then as soon as it goes below a dollar, the supply flow stops and then kind of picks back up when it's above again.
00:09:36.630 - 00:09:37.842, Speaker B: But what do you think that means?
00:09:37.896 - 00:09:38.930, Speaker A: That correlation.
00:09:39.350 - 00:10:10.634, Speaker D: Yeah. So that's kind of the missing piece of the puzzle that I would love to figure out next. But I think it means that someone is essentially whoever has access to printing this tether is printing it at large quantities when they have the opportunity to do so. And then when there's not the money making opportunity, there's just not as much incentive to print this tether, so they stop printing it, which is a little confusing because there is some sort of demand in the first place that's causing the price to go above a dollar. Right. There's increased demand coming from somewhere. There's someone on the other side who's buying the tether.
00:10:10.634 - 00:10:25.250, Speaker D: Right. But we don't know exactly who they are or who the people are selling. And we don't know why demand has stayed high for so long. But there's something happening, there connection between the two that's driving this supply growth.
00:10:25.750 - 00:10:38.280, Speaker A: All right, in a moment, we're going to discuss how stablecoins work, why it is that traditionally the supply has risen with the price of bitcoin, what happened on Black Friday, et cetera. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:11:35.950 - 00:11:39.414, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Nate Madrid.
00:11:39.462 - 00:11:48.560, Speaker A: Traditionally, stablecoin supply has risen with the price of bitcoin. And obviously that changed this year. But why do you think that shift happened?
00:11:49.090 - 00:12:32.666, Speaker D: As I mentioned, when I kind of initially started do this report, I looked at the history. I should mention too, that this report was partnership with Bitstamp. And Bitstamp had kind of asked us to go back and look, starting at the history of stablecoins, what was happening. So I think throughout a lot of tether's history, its early history, so 2017, 2018, when tether was rising with the price of bitcoin, that was more intertwined to bitcoin's rise. And there's a lot of theories about what happened first, whether tether was being printed first and then sold for bitcoin and vice versa. But I think this situation in 2020 is different. I think the arbitrage opportunities have really come to the forefront here a lot because the market infrastructure in general has just improved so much since then.
00:12:32.666 - 00:12:48.340, Speaker D: There are more opportunities to do this. Tether has a lot more liquidity than ever before. And because those billions of dollars of tether got printed in 2018 2019, there's now just so much tether out there which makes these other opportunities possible, basically.
00:12:49.430 - 00:13:06.642, Speaker A: All right, so let's now just dive a little bit more into the stablecoins. So why is it that you think that some of the stablecoins remained truer to the one dollars price than others? Like in general, how is it that these different types of stablecoins and I recognize there are different categories.
00:13:06.786 - 00:13:09.480, Speaker B: How do they typically remain stable in price?
00:13:09.930 - 00:13:53.080, Speaker D: Most other stablecoins stayed more stable. USTC is probably the biggest example. It's the second biggest. I mean, normally the process is pretty simple. As long as they have kind of a dollar in reserve for each of these stablecoins, it kind of goes by supply and demand, right? Like if demand goes up faster than supply, then price is going to go up. But for the most part, these stablecoins operate relatively transparently. I think USDC and Paxos and others have done a better job of doing this and they're just more freely available on Coinbase and other yeah, there's some, I think just the nature of tether, of it being a little more through back channels where a lot of this trading happens.
00:13:53.080 - 00:14:26.446, Speaker D: USDC is mostly on Coinbase and other exchanges, but these are spread out everywhere. No one really knows what's going on. But I think that's part of what leads to the price fluctuations. We did see fluctuations of a couple of other stablecoins too. Dai in particular went way above its peg that's more related just to its decentralized nature. Since Dai is backed by cryptocurrency and it's backed by a bunch of different people or entities instead of one company that's holding it all. When the price crashed, the crypto price crashed on March twelveTH.
00:14:26.446 - 00:14:59.980, Speaker D: That essentially caused a lot of the collateral backing Dai to be liquidated and that caused an extreme shortage of Dai in the system. So that's again, the supply and demand at work, all of a sudden there was much less dye supply. Dai price shot up and it's still up as well. So the mechanics are a little bit different there. And then another one that we saw off its peg was Gemini coin GUSD and that's more related to a really low supply. There's only like 10 million or less actually that has been printed. So there's just no liquidity there, I think, and no real demand for it.
00:15:04.050 - 00:15:07.630, Speaker A: What types of crypto users tend to be holding stablecoins?
00:15:08.370 - 00:16:13.060, Speaker D: A majority of it is used for trading. There's another chart I have in the report which shows if you actually look at the addresses that are holding tether, especially the ethereum version of tether, because tether has been printed on multiple blockchains. But if you look at the addresses that are holding it so I actually broke it down by basically whale addresses. So if you look at addresses that are holding at least a million dollars worth of tether or more, those addresses are holding, I think it's close to 4 billion tether out of the total supply. So a huge amount of tether is being held by these very large addresses. Most of these addresses are exchanges and there was a big uptick in the amount that these addresses were holding after March twelveTH. So to me that shows that a lot of the stablecoins are just held on exchanges essentially parked on the sideline as kind of a safe haven asset either just so people can just have kind of a crypto form of safe steady asset ready to reinvest if the market goes back up.
00:16:13.060 - 00:16:56.126, Speaker D: Or it might be the exchanges themselves. A lot of exchanges might be changing some of their fiat into tether or stablecoins to take advantage of kind of portability and liquidity and kind of inter exchange settlement. So I think that's the big first chunk and of course the exchanges are holding those, but it's individual investors who have it on the exchanges which complicates a little bit. But then the other interesting thing we saw is that if you look at also smaller addresses, those addresses are holding $1,000 or less worth of tether. Those also skyrocketed after March twelveTH. So it looks like there are kind of two different things probably happening. There's money being held on exchanges, there's money being held on the sideline again, there's demand just for trading itself, we're using as a quote, currency.
00:16:56.126 - 00:17:26.486, Speaker D: But then there also appears to be individuals outside of exchanges just holding smaller amounts and it's a little harder to figure out what exactly they're doing with it. It could be potentially that people are using it more as a medium of exchange, like, for example, global remittances, cross border payments, tether and stablecoins in general. It's kind of a perfect use case for them, especially now with everything that's happening in the world. So I suspect that's probably happening as well. But it's a little harder to kind of find the evidence for that directly.
00:17:26.678 - 00:17:36.720, Speaker A: And maybe for some of those people who live in economies with currencies that are undergoing inflation, they might be simply using it for savings too.
00:17:37.170 - 00:17:57.590, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. I think that's a big part of it too. I would love to kind of look through economies, especially where their fiat currency is decreasing compared to the dollar. They can just kind of park it in tether stablecoins instead, and it's a way to hold their value while no matter what happens with their regular currency.
00:17:58.170 - 00:18:16.070, Speaker A: And you talked a little bit before about why it is that stablecoins tend to be traded more in other jurisdictions. Why is it that traders in places like the US or North America just maybe aren't as huge users of stablecoins?
00:18:16.230 - 00:18:49.906, Speaker D: We are starting to see more a shift from USD to stablecoins as well, even in the US. But I think we see a disproportionately large amount of users in Asia and China specifically, just because of China effectively bans fiat to crypto trading a couple years ago. So I think that's why you see more there. But we're seeing it in the US. As well. I think you see it all over because it makes more sense for crypto use cases that you get less fees than if you're converting back and forth to fiat. It's easier to essentially have more liquidity.
00:18:49.906 - 00:18:52.710, Speaker D: You can easily send it throughout exchanges.
00:18:53.610 - 00:18:58.710, Speaker A: Do you feel like there are certain segments that use certain stablecoins?
00:18:59.370 - 00:19:33.938, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely there are different use cases for the different stablecoins. And there's another chart in the report that looks at the median transfer value of different stablecoins. And there are a couple kind of BUSD, which is Finance Coin and HUSD, which is Hobi. So two kind of exchange back coins, those have really high medium of exchange values. So it's like $10,000 plus. So that shows that it's either being used for kind of large trades or maybe inter exchange settlement, but then the rest of them kind of range between $1,000 and less. Paxos is at the bottom towards $100.
00:19:33.938 - 00:20:04.160, Speaker D: That shows they're being used for different purposes. Paxos might be used for more kind of medium of exchange type deal, while Tether, which is I think the median transfer value is about 1000. That's probably still being used more for trading, I think though, even that being said, I think we'd probably see it a little lower. The median transfer value is a little lower if it was truly being used as medium of exchange or even for remittances. So it'll be interesting to see how those values change kind of over the upcoming months and years.
00:20:04.690 - 00:20:05.054, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:05.092 - 00:20:18.654, Speaker A: And the other thing that's fascinating about this chart is that the tether one fluctuates a lot more in terms of the median transfer value than some of the other ones, like PAX or HUSD.
00:20:18.782 - 00:20:20.770, Speaker B: Which is that huobies.
00:20:21.190 - 00:20:21.940, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:20:23.750 - 00:20:28.840, Speaker A: So it's interesting, I guess that means maybe whales are moving in and out or something like that.
00:20:29.610 - 00:20:42.490, Speaker D: Yeah, that's probably it. Or larger trades happening. Yeah, it could be related to the exchanges, too, because when the exchanges shift large amounts around, that'll get caught in there as well. Well, I guess not as much of the median.
00:20:43.790 - 00:20:50.540, Speaker A: And then what about stablecoin velocity against bitcoin and ether? What did you find there?
00:20:51.490 - 00:21:22.710, Speaker D: Yeah, so stablecoins have significantly higher velocity than both bitcoin and ether. And velocity is basically just a measure of the amount of times that a unit of supply changes hands throughout the past year. So like, every time it's transferred from one address to another, that gets counted towards velocity. So bitcoin and ethereum are both around six or so. Six or seven. So that means each unit of supply will change hands about six to seven times throughout a year on average. Stablecoins are much higher, 50, 60 plus.
00:21:22.710 - 00:22:06.938, Speaker D: So that shows that they are being exchanged much more frequently. So they're getting passed around. That shows they're being used more like a medium of exchange. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're being used as a medium of exchange, but they have those properties. Again, it's probably somewhat related to trading because they're just used back and forth and trading. But I think it's interesting because it shows that stablecoins are basically starting to take over this kind of medium of exchange narrative that people have talked a lot, even going back to bitcoins, what the bitcoin white paper has talked about potentially being a medium of exchange. I think we're starting to really see stablecoins fill that void as opposed to bitcoin and ethereum, which are more used as a store of value or kind of other purposes.
00:22:07.134 - 00:22:35.130, Speaker A: Yeah. And we see that also in the chart called total adjusted transfer value, where for the first time, and I guess it's just maybe the last month or so, that the total adjusted transfer value in stablecoins has exceeded that. Of bitcoin, which for pretty much all of history, at least till the beginning of your chart, which is in January or the winter of 2019, that it's always been bitcoin.
00:22:35.210 - 00:22:38.880, Speaker B: So what do you think of that? What does that say to you?
00:22:39.250 - 00:23:11.414, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think it's a really interesting flipping. It's interesting that it's happening now. I kind of look at taking a step back. I think stablecoins are basically the first killer app on top of bitcoin and ethereum. Stablecoins are very simple application, but they are an application and mostly built on ethereum. So I think it's interesting that we're starting to kind of see now this first big application built on top of blockchains are starting to move past Bitcoin specifically, and it's been past Ethereum for a while. So I think it's a sign of things to come.
00:23:11.414 - 00:23:31.294, Speaker D: There are going to be more and more of these different applications on blockchains, and it'll be interesting to see the interplay between these different types of tokens and apps and the chains itself. Like, is stablecoin going to start is it going to be beneficial to Ethereum? Is it going to start being parasitic to Ethereum? We'll see. But I think it's going to be really interesting watching over the next couple of years.
00:23:31.492 - 00:23:53.880, Speaker A: Yeah. I saw Camilla Russo tweeted recently that the market cap of all ERC 20 tokens has exceeded that of Ethereum itself. And I wonder if that will change when Ethereum moves to proof of stake or just how there's just so many fluctuating factors at play right now.
00:23:54.410 - 00:23:56.258, Speaker D: Yeah, there's so many variables.
00:23:56.354 - 00:24:04.620, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, well and is there anything that you're looking toward in terms of the future about where stablecoins are going or any metrics you're watching?
00:24:05.390 - 00:24:49.880, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the biggest thing I'm watching right now is just more in the regulation front. There's new regulatory scrutiny on Tether, and I kind of feel even though Tether is so huge, it feels like it's been on this precarious ground for a while now. So I'm watching pretty closely to see whether this new round of regulation is actually going to change things or not. And I think the other interesting thing that I'm watching is the rise of stablecoins within DeFi, within decentralized finance, especially USCC now is being incorporated a lot into decentralized finance. And that could kind of be a transition between these more speculative use cases with know arbitrage and trading, et cetera, to more kind of real crypto native use cases which could really take the adoption to the next.
00:24:50.490 - 00:25:00.060, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And the thing that's interesting about the USDC was that news about how they blacklisted that one address and all the DeFi people were up in arms about that.
00:25:02.670 - 00:25:03.642, Speaker D: It's a real concern.

The corporate accounts of Apple and Uber were compromised, as were the accounts of a host of influential players in the crypto space, including Binance Gemini, Coinbase, CoinDesk, Charlie Lee, and others.

According to reports, the bitcoin wallets promoted in the tweets received over 300 transactions and bitcoin worth more than $100,000, indicating that some Twitter users did fall prey to the scam. A Twitter investigation revealed that the hackers had compromised employee accounts in a coordinated social engineering attack. Security experts have suggested that the blame for the incident squarely rests with Twitter due to security flaws in its service.
00:28:16.794 - 00:29:14.190, Speaker B: However, a new report by Vice even suggests that the hackers may have convinced a Twitter employee to help coordinate these takeovers. Following the hacks, the social media platform is now restricting posts containing crypto addresses.

According to tests conducted by the Block Research Litecoin, XRP, manero, bitcoin and ethereum could not be shared through the Tweets. Next headline.

Next Headline ERC 20 Token market cap now surpasses that of ethereum as ethereum inches closer to east 20, the ERC 20 token ecosystem seems to be having its own big moment.

00:32:14.950 - 00:33:10.970, Speaker B: Coinbase has always had a notoriously difficult set of addresses to cluster. That data is only ever probabilistic unless you are Coinbase. Remember that in 2018, Coinbase served client data of 13,000 users to the IRS. When you combine client data exports with perfect knowledge of the cluster, it creates a new, dangerous dynamic.
