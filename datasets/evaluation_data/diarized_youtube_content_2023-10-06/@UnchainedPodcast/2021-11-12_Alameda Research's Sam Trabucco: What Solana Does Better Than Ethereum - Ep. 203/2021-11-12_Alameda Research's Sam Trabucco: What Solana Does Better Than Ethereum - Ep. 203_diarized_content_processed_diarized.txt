00:01:14.130 - 00:01:15.490, Speaker A: Welcome, Sam.
00:01:16.310 - 00:01:18.100, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, thanks for having me.
00:01:18.870 - 00:01:29.734, Speaker A: This has been quite a week for the crypto markets, which hit a $3 trillion total market cap earlier this week. What would you say is the significance of that milestone and what drivers led us here?
00:01:29.932 - 00:01:56.226, Speaker B: Yeah, the big news was that crypto hit like an all time high. Like bitcoin hit an all time high for a few hours at least. Yeah, there's always a few things that sort of point in various directions. I think there's been a steady stream of good news for crypto and bitcoin. In particular. The news that Tim Cook owns crypto was significant. Obviously a ton of regulatory news that's always coming in.
00:01:56.226 - 00:02:46.850, Speaker B: And I generally think that especially the US regulation, the news coming out of the US has been mostly good for the most part in the past couple months. And the fact that there hasn't been any big negative news is really the most important thing, I think, given that their regulators are talking about crypto. Congress is passing laws related to crypto and nothing bad has happened. There hasn't been a China banning crypto level thing happening in the US. Or really any other jurisdictions besides China. And I think that's, like, in general, that's been the biggest driver of crypto's price increases which culminated recently, and it getting almost 70K. Obviously there's been some pullback that's sort of been the more standard stuff, where in general, leverage is very popular in the crypto trading ecosystem.
00:02:46.850 - 00:03:16.300, Speaker B: These big moves tend to be driven by people trading with high leverage. So if there's a small drawback, if it goes from 69 to 68, there's some potential for there to be a lot of liquidations for people who got really leveraged long near the top, which can drive it back more than it might if it were just people who were deciding to sell. And yeah, so there's all these effects that are pointing in different directions, obviously has led to crypto sort of steadily rising and this week getting quite high.
00:03:16.990 - 00:03:50.200, Speaker A: Yeah. I was surprised what you said about the regulators. So you feel that the crypto provisions in the infrastructure bill, they're not negative enough to affect the market. And what we're talking about is, for instance, the one that defines brokers so broadly as to perhaps encompass miners and validators, which would then require them to report on transactions in excess of $10,000 to the IRS, which they wouldn't have access to that information. But you feel that people kind of recognize that will be resolved and so it's a non issue.
00:03:50.890 - 00:05:06.554, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm not claiming that the thing you're talking about any other news that's come out? I'm not claiming it's the best possible pieces of news that could have come out about crypto, but the US has a pretty consistent history about the kinds of things that it does regulatorily for different kinds of asset classes. Obviously, crypto represents this brand new thing that it has a lot of features that other asset classes just don't have. But the US is like a reasonably aggressive jurisdiction regulatorily for the most part. And I would say that the kinds of things that we've seen come out about how the US plans to regulate crypto have been probably a little better at least than the expected set of things they might have done. It's very much in flux and it's unclear how things are going to keep going, but yeah, I've certainly seen takes that the infrastructure bill represents this betrayal of the system and how it's regulating crypto, but I don't really know what people expect out of the US. You can look at or not what it's done to, but how it regulates various commodities.
00:05:06.554 - 00:05:18.740, Speaker B: It's obviously very aggressive in terms of defining things as securities and restricting people from trading securities. They're certainly going to do something and it hasn't represented anything too bad as of yet.
00:05:19.110 - 00:05:24.222, Speaker A: And how have you seen the bitcoin futures ETFs affect the bitcoin markets?
00:05:24.366 - 00:06:11.614, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's another thing. The fact that multiple ETFs at this point have gotten approval to get off the ground also represents a decently big update in my opinion. For years there have been various parties trying to get a bitcoin ETF passed and the fact that it actually happened is a pretty big update. And I think the markets sort of agreed with that. Last week or a few weeks ago, whenever the first ETF started trading, bitcoin hit a different all time high. Hit a new all time high this week, but that week it also hit an all time high. Yeah, the market obviously agreed that this was a decently positive update to the point where it represented a big price increase and it didn't even exactly fizzle.
00:06:11.614 - 00:06:45.840, Speaker B: The ETF was either the first or second most traded ETF in US. History, depending on what metrics you're using. And yeah, it was a quite exciting launch, which led to sort of predictable price increases and like I said before, there was these big price increases, especially to local maximums, tend to sort of have always tended to get undone a bit in the days following. And that one did and the one this week did as well. The trend is what's really important to look at, the longer term trend. And obviously the market is seeing these things as good.
00:06:46.530 - 00:06:57.650, Speaker A: And Ether has also been on a tear this week and has also hit an all time high. It was above 4800 earlier. What would you say is pushing up the price of ETH?
00:06:58.230 - 00:07:58.710, Speaker B: Yeah, not even just specific to any one coin. Throughout the history of crypto trading we've seen that every coin has some beta to Bitcoin, meaning that when Bitcoin moves like all the other coins will at least move to some extent in response. That's part of what we're seeing. Certainly basically every altcoin has followed Bitcoin to some extent and I think that's a lot of what we're seeing. But every coin also has various specific features to it as a layer. One, Ether has quite a bit of adoption compared to various other hot chains right now. And the fact that it's continuing to increase with the rest of the crypto ecosystem indicates that people still have a decent amount of faith that Ether will be a part of the future of finance and the future of decentralized finance or whichever specific application people are caring about.
00:07:58.710 - 00:08:03.640, Speaker B: And I think, yeah, the fact that it's continuing to succeed just indicates that's what people think.
00:08:04.650 - 00:08:45.566, Speaker A: And obviously the network did also undergo a change in terms of its monetary policy back in August which more closely ties the usage of the network to the price. But Ether is definitely facing a big question mark in the form of the merge, which is when the applications on Ethereum 1.0 get moved to the proof of stake chain or Ethereum 2.0. And that change is going to take place next year. And meanwhile there are a lot of competitors that are nipping at the heels of Ethereum. So how do you see investors approaching both the opportunity with Ethereum but also the risk in the form of this competition?
00:08:45.758 - 00:09:32.722, Speaker B: Different people are doing different things. Like you mentioned, there are many competitors at this point. Solana has been making a lot of headlines for reaching a pretty extraordinary market cap considering where it was like a year ago and various other chains as well. Something that I've seen a decent amount of chatter about anyway, is the fact that just diversifying into multiple sets of these things tends to be good. Over the past couple of years or whatever, a ton of crypto projects have really succeeded quite a lot and it's never been exactly clear which of these projects were going to succeed. Like a priori, you can find a ton of people who had very different investment, theses operi who have all done quite well over the past few years. And that's because crypto as a whole has done quite well.
00:09:32.722 - 00:10:13.470, Speaker B: And for the most part, I tend to think that all these different projects and specifically what we're talking about right now, all these different chains, or not all of them, but like many of them, have some decent chance of doing quite well, getting some piece of the adoption and being relevant and therefore succeeding price wise as well. Yeah, so for the most part, I think that anyone who claims that this chain is definitely going to be the one that gets all adoption and everything else is terrible, that's just a bad opinion for the most part. And I think that the best investors and the best people who are thinking about these things a lot tend to think that diversifying is smart.
00:10:14.690 - 00:10:40.538, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss more about Solana as well as Luna. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. There's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by downloading the Nodal Cash app. It's free, easy to use, and there's no hardware to buy. The Nodal Cash app allows you to earn crypto whether you're on the go, stuck in traffic, or even while you're sleeping. Nodal Cash is the crypto. You earn 24/7.
00:10:40.538 - 00:11:18.530, Speaker A: Go to Nodal IO unconfirmed to get started today. That's? No D-L-E IO unconfirmed. Did you know that exchanges take up to a 25% cut on your staking rewards? But you don't need an exchange to stake. You can run a validator at home, join thousands of solo stakers, get an Avato device, plug it in, deposit your stake, and earn the full reward. Avato created the best hardware and specific software to stake and keeps your validator on the latest version through auto updates. Onetime investment, 100% profit. Go to Avato.
00:11:18.530 - 00:11:38.650, Speaker A: That's ava do. Back to my conversation with Sam. So, as we were discussing, Salana's sole Token has been on a tear this year, up from less than $50 just three months ago to close to $250 now. So what would you say has accounted for Salana's rise?
00:11:39.070 - 00:12:30.762, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's a lot of factors sort of in Salana's favor, especially as compared to not exactly as compared to some of the other newer chains, but as compared to Ether specifically. Obviously, it's very fast. It can achieve a ton of many more transactions per unit of time than Ether can, and then most of its competitors can, honestly. And the fees are also quite small as compared to many of these other chains. And so, yeah, there's been a lot of excitement about this, and in particular, there's been a lot of exciting projects that are being built using Solana as a backend, which I think that has gotten investors quite excited as well. And, yeah, I think that's the big thing. There's been a Solana conference over the past week in Lisbon, and I wasn't there, but several of our team members have been there.
00:12:30.762 - 00:12:50.690, Speaker B: And the excitement and all the different projects that are composable with each other and can actually represent a future of finance to some extent are legitimately happening on Solana, which I think is an important piece of why it's risen to be in the top five by market cap of all coins at this point and why people are so excited.
00:12:51.030 - 00:12:56.034, Speaker A: And what are some examples of those projects that are being built on Solana that people are excited about?
00:12:56.232 - 00:13:26.270, Speaker B: I don't want to risk not talking about any exciting projects, but if you can name a thing that is important for decentralized finance to be, like a big piece of the ecosystem, there's someone doing it on Solana. There's perpetuals that are being built on Solana. There's all these lending platforms that are being built on Solana. There's DEXs and whatnot, and all these things are really important to have exist in a stable ecosystem. And yeah, they're all being built on Solana.
00:13:27.250 - 00:14:12.622, Speaker A: All right, so one of the interesting comments this week about Solana actually came from Sam Bankman Fried, the former CEO of Alameda Research. And he said at the Yahoo. Finance and Decrypt Crypto goes Mainstream conference, quote, solana is one of the few currently existing public blockchains that has a really plausible roadmap to scale millions of transactions per second at fractions of a penny per transaction, which is the scale that you need for this. And then he said, this is not where a lot of other blockchains have been focusing, including Ethereum. So what's your take on what the future looks like for Ethereum and Solana? Do you think the two will coexist, or do you think that one will come to dominate, or do you think they'll just kind of take different niches, or what will that look like?
00:14:12.756 - 00:14:42.950, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely an interesting question, and I'm not especially confident about certainly any timelines or any exact answers here. Both have advantages right now, I think Solana yeah, we've already mentioned the technological advantages that Solana has, and I basically agree with the things that Sam said. Ethereum does have advantages, though. It's something akin to a first mover. Advantage is really obviously something that Ethereum has going for it. It has a ton of adoption already. It's been around forever.
00:14:42.950 - 00:15:33.462, Speaker B: For all the talking I'm doing about how much is being built on Solana, much more already is built on Ethereum. It's impossible to deny that. I think that it's unlikely that certainly within a year, like a couple of years or whatever, ethereum goes away because it already has so many users, it already has so many people who are using it for applications that don't require anything that Solana is offering that Ethereum isn't. And so, yeah, I do think that it's quite likely that both will exist or specifically that Ethereum will continue being relevant just because it's already so important to the ecosystem in ways that are kind of just unlikely to be completely eroded away. So no matter what chains are the exciting chains going forward, the ones that people are building on going forward, ethereum likely still has a place.
00:15:33.516 - 00:16:11.538, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. And earlier when you were talking about some of the applications on Salana, I did also want to mention that Alexis Ohanian, the co founder of Reddit, is investing $100 million to grow decentralized social media projects on Salana. So that could be another way in which Salana differentiates itself and would be kind of like another application that would be popular on Salana. So last topic this week, Terra began one of the biggest token burnings ever. The community approved the burning of 89 million tokens, which were worth $4.5 billion.
00:16:11.538 - 00:16:17.590, Speaker A: What do you think of this massive burning of Luna? And in general, what do you think is the outlook for Luna?
00:16:17.930 - 00:17:12.440, Speaker B: I'll address the second question first. I think that Luna is sort of just another potentially exciting project, which I don't want to quote any numbers here because I don't know the numbers offhand. That doesn't tend to be my forte exactly, but it certainly represents another competitor to Ethereum given its increased capacity to support various applications. I mentioned before that diversifying tends to be the smart thing with these kinds of investments. And I think that it's certainly a plausible competitor as well, to the point where I wouldn't specifically want to bet for or against it compared to the other possible competitors. Regarding the burn itself. Yeah, I think it's the kind of thing that is very supportive of people who are trying to build projects using Luna, and I think it's probably a good move on their part.
00:17:13.210 - 00:17:24.918, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. In a way, it really is similar to what's happening with east now where the base fee gets burned. All right, well, this has been a great discussion. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:17:25.014 - 00:17:26.586, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for having me.

The infrastructure bill will most likely become law on Monday. On November 5, the United States House of Representatives passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains two provisions that could heavily affect cryptocurrency tax reporting. Socalled crypto brokers must report customer gains via a 1099 and any transactions over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service.
00:18:32.238 - 00:19:36.242, Speaker A: To many in the crypto community, including advocacy groups such as Coin Center and the Blockchain association. The bill defines a broker too broadly and could potentially impose reporting requirements on entities such as crypto, miners and wallet developers for whom it will be impossible to comply. In addition to the broad definition of broker, the bill includes an amendment to tax code 650, which would require entities to report personal data on trading partners like Social Security numbers for digital asset transactions over $10,000. Coins center described the requirements of the bill as unworkable and possibly unconstitutional. Even more striking, not reporting such an event would now be deemed a criminal felony, according to Abe Sutherland. In his appearance on Unchained in October, Jake Trevinsky, the newly hired executive vice president and head of policy at the blockchain association, explained that getting the language changed is most likely a lost cause in the short term. Importantly, nothing will happen right away.
00:19:36.242 - 00:20:22.818, Speaker A: He said the crypto provisions don't go into effect until 2024. We can try to get them repealed or amended before then. He also noted the 2022 midterm elections could reshape Congress's attitude toward crypto. However, if nothing can be done to amend the legislation by 2024, a redefinition could fall to the Treasury Department. It's up to the Treasury Department to decide who is subject to the provisions, said Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management to CNBC. Similar to the broker definition, the Treasury Department will have to provide guidance twitter embraces Web Three via dedicated crypto team Twitter announced a new business unit dedicated solely to crypto. The news was first reported by the Financial Times.
00:20:22.818 - 00:21:12.260, Speaker A: Tess Renearson, formerly of interchain foundation, will be leading a team named simply twitter crypto. Ranierson said the new unit will be focused on supporting the existing crypto community on Twitter. Twitter truly gets crypto hello Bitcoin, tipping and NFTs, but there's so much more to explore here, she said. She went on to cite DApps and crypto communities as areas the team is looking forward to exploring. Twitter crypto will be working closely with Blue Sky, an offshoot of Twitter looking to build a decentralized social network. Twitter was far from the only Web Two social media giant to dip its toes into the Web three waters. This week at the Salana Breakpoint conference, Reddit CEO Alexis Ohanian announced a 100 million dollar investment into the Salana ecosystem through his Seven Seven Six venture company.
00:21:12.260 - 00:22:03.438, Speaker A: Additionally, Discord CEO Jason Citron posted a sneak peek of Discord's future, showing a direct integration with MetaMask into the popular gaming discussion platform. However, after a wave of negative responses to his tweet, Citron walked back the hint, saying, thanks for all the perspectives everyone. We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now, we're focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web Three has lots of good, but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale more soon. A new home for Binance Chengfeng Zhao Cofounder and CEO of Binance, hopes to secure status as a digital asset service provider in France in 2022. France will be a natural choice for a regional and even perhaps global head office, said Zhao in an interview with Les Echoes.
00:22:03.438 - 00:22:35.530, Speaker A: According to a translation from the bloc, zhao went on to add we want to be regulated at this stage of our development. This will allow us to grow faster. 5% of the world's population 400 million people have already adopted crypto. They are pioneers. We now want to convince the remaining 95%. Zhao's words come as finance faces regulatory scrutiny from the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, the United States and other jurisdictions. Q Three was tough for crypto communities, especially Coinbase.
00:22:35.530 - 00:23:18.858, Speaker A: Third quarter earnings reports have slowly begun filtering out, and the numbers for crypto companies have not been pretty. Coinbase, for example, saw a decline in monthly transacting users by 16%, trading volume by 29% and net revenue by 39% between Q Two of 2021 and Q Three in response to the earnings report. Coinbase, or Coin shares fell roughly 10% on Tuesday afternoon in after hours trading. As of press time, Coin is down 4.1% on the week. Other centralized crypto communities saw similar dips between Q Two and Q Three. Square's cash app reported a 23% drop in its bitcoin profits in Q Three.
00:23:18.858 - 00:24:14.090, Speaker A: Robin Hood's numbers were even more drastic as crypto revenue fell 78% between Q Two and Q Three. Accordingly, total revenue shrank from five hundred and sixty five million dollars to three hundred and sixty five million dollars between earnings reports. SEC halted registration of tokens stemming from a Wyoming based Dao The US. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, stopped a Wyoming based Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or Dao, from registering two tokens as securities. The Dao named the American Cryptofed dow LLC was legally recognized in Wyoming as a limited liability. Company or LLC. Back in July, following Wyoming's decision to allow such an action, the SEC alleges that the Dow filed a materially deficient and misleading registration form known as a Form Ten that failed to contain certain required information about the Dow's business or tokens.
00:24:14.090 - 00:24:48.126, Speaker A: The SEC alleges that the Tokens, Ducott and Locke are equity securities rather than utility tokens, as the Dao attempted to describe them. According to Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Digital, it appears American Crypto Fed Dow, LLC was a sham. To be clear, I don't fault the SEC for this, he said. It clearly was a troll, but does show that the come in and register not so easy of a thing, he added. This is getting farcical. We need a better way. ENS rose 100% after AirDrop ethereum.
00:24:48.126 - 00:25:31.298, Speaker A: Name, service or ENS? The company behind ETH domain names, began an AirDrop of its governance. Token ENS to existing name registrants this week, shortly after the AirDrop, which gives users the power to vote on how ENS will function going forward. The ENS token price skyrocketed, shooting up to a high of $85.69 on Wednesday morning. At such high prices, users are reporting their airdrops are now worth upwards of $20,000. Interestingly, to claim a drop, users had to vote on the ENS governance constitution. Furthermore, claimants were required to delegate tokens, aka their voting power to addresses owned by the likes of Coinbase that applied to be delegates.
00:25:31.298 - 00:26:07.298, Speaker A: As of press time, Thursday afternoon, ENS was at $63.57, a 100% increase from its initial trading price of around $30, good for a market cap of approximately $930,000,000. Time for fun bits. CitiCoin is coming to NYC. CitiCoin has the full support of Eric Adams, the next mayor of New York City, to launch its NYC Coin, said Adams, who takes office January 1, 2022. We're glad to welcome you to the global home of Web Three. We're counting on tech and innovation to help drive our city forward.
00:26:07.298 - 00:26:46.890, Speaker A: Anyone can mine NYC Coin and 30% of funds spent mining the Coin goes to a crypto wallet reserved for the municipal government. A similar program in Miami dubbed Miami Coin, which is already live, has already generated $20 million, according to CitiCoin. Speaking of Miami Coin, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced that it will be the first city to give a bitcoin yield directly to residents by using the proceeds of Miami Coin.
