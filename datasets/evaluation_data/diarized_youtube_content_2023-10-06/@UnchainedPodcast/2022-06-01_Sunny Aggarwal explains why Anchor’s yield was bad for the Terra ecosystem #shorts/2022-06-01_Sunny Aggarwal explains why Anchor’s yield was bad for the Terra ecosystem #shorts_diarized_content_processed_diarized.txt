00:00:00.090 - 00:00:34.914, Speaker A: Okay, so now about the question about Anchor. So Anchor was kind of really what it was doing was bootstrapping the stablecoin, right. What happened was there was a lot of stablecoin deposited into it with very little actual amount being borrowed from it, because that's not really what Anchor was really going for. And the yields were a little bit artificial right. Propped up by TfL, because their goal was not really to build a lending market as much as it was to build a supply sink for UST.
00:00:35.042 - 00:00:37.026, Speaker B: Yeah. TerraForm Labs TfL.
00:00:37.138 - 00:01:28.242, Speaker A: TfL. Yeah. TerraForm labs. And the problem is actually, kind of weirdly enough, anchor kind of makes building stuff with UST slightly annoying because we're trying to build this isotonic system, and UST is still a major stable coin in Osmosis. We'll see what happens at end of the week. But to attract UST deposits into isotonic, we sort of have to beat the Anchor rate of return, which is artificially propped up. And so the Anchor artificial yield, I actually think is a little bit harmful to the ecosystem long term because it makes it harder for people to build natural uses of UST.
00:01:28.242 - 00:01:41.130, Speaker A: And I think that was one of the issues that happened in the Terra ecosystem, that all the UST got put into this, chasing this artificial yield instead of being used in more natural adoption.
