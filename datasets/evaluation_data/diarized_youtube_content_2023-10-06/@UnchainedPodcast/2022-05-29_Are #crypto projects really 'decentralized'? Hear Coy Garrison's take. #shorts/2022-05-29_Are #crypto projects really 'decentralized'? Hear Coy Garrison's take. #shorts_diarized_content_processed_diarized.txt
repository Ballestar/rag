00:00:00.490 - 00:00:38.902, Speaker A: A lot of projects use the term decentralization, and there's clear skepticism coming from the SEC of whether decentralized entities are in fact decentralized or is there a central party? Is there an individual, is there an entity behind the scenes that are really calling the shots? And I think projects have to think about that. That's a fair question for the regulators to be asking, and you have to evaluate how are decisions made? Who's controlling the strengths? What are those factors? So I think it's fair that projects should take an honest look and draw a distinction between how they're marketing themselves and how they're actually operating and making sure that's in alignment. That's an important thing to be thinking about.
