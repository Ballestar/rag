00:00:00.170 - 00:00:58.140, Speaker A: Yesterday the financial services committee in the House passed a market structure bill on a bipartisan basis. And the bipartisan support came from younger Democrats like myself who are open to embracing the potentialities of blockchain technology. So I see it as more as a generational divide and as Congress becomes less of a geriatric over time I suspect the institution will become more open in to embracing crypto. Republicans generally are pro business so that's what's driving the Republican position. But to indiscriminately portray all Democrats as anti crypto is to ignore the generational divide within the Democratic caucus. And then setting aside the politics of Congress, I asked myself what is crypto? A blockchain? You know, the combination of crypto and blockchain has the potential to revolutionize finance creating a better, cheaper, faster payment system.
