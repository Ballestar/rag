Today's guest is Gil Lauria, director of research at D.
00:00:57.246 - 00:00:58.986, Speaker A: A. Davidson. Welcome, Gil.
00:00:59.098 - 00:01:00.878, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, good to see you.
00:01:01.044 - 00:01:12.340, Speaker A: Nice to see you on a big week for crypto. As the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin, what would you say is the significance of Coinbase being public?
00:01:13.030 - 00:01:27.202, Speaker B: It happened, it worked. The direct listing worked. I was anxious going in, but here we go. $85 billion company. That all they do is crypto. The listing was successful. They're trading nicely.
00:01:27.202 - 00:01:31.260, Speaker B: It's starting to stabilize. I would call that a great success.
00:01:32.110 - 00:01:46.270, Speaker A: So the reference price was 250. Trading quickly searched the price to around 400. But a Coin did close the day at $328. What were your takeaways from that first day of trading?
00:01:46.690 - 00:02:19.558, Speaker B: The direct listing is a not often used way to start, especially for a company of this size to start listing on an exchange. It is a very high risk way. Coinbase took a really big risk doing it this way. There's benefits, we could talk about those. But what that means is there is not an investment bank or an investment banking syndicate that controls the trading that day, that controls the marketing ahead of time. And that's a really big risk because the firms D. A.
00:02:19.558 - 00:02:50.162, Speaker B: Davidson at our scale, but Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley at a bigger scale. They have refined the craft of the IPO over many decades. And so deciding to not have them lead the process to go to a direct listing was actually pretty risky move. I understand why they did it, but it was a pretty risky move. It's what made me anxious. But it worked because there was so much supply, so much demand, the market found itself. The reference price was a good reference price.
00:02:50.162 - 00:03:17.340, Speaker B: It was the right reference price. Where the stock trades now is pretty close to some of those late private company transactions that happened in the weeks leading into the listing, which is good because it doesn't have to go that way. And what I like the most as a stock analyst that recommends stocks is it didn't go too high. If it closed yesterday, at $800 or $1,000, I wouldn't be able to recommend the stock. And that would be hard.
00:03:18.910 - 00:03:27.998, Speaker A: Yeah. Before your target price for Coin was $440. And so since it didn't quite reach that, what did that say to you?
00:03:28.164 - 00:03:53.666, Speaker B: Well, a few moving parts for me yesterday. So what I did this morning was increase my price target from 440 to 650. And there were a few moving pieces. The first is actually that the eve of the listing they disclosed that their share count they consider as 261,000,000. And maybe we could talk about that a little bit more later. So that's more than I thought. I originally had about 206,000,000 shares.
00:03:53.666 - 00:04:35.002, Speaker B: So that's one moving piece. The second moving piece is that the listing went well. Had the stock traded down or down significantly yesterday, the whole momentum would have been impaired, not just for Coinbase, but I would say for Crypto, that didn't happen. So that was great. That removed a really big risk. That allowed me to treat it more like an established public company as opposed to a not yet listed public company. And the last thing I did was say, well, okay, if these guys have all this growth that I believe they have, they just reported a fantastic quarter and they're listed and all went well, then I can put them in the most exclusive club of stocks.
00:04:35.002 - 00:05:07.406, Speaker B: These are market leading, open ended growth stories. And I would consider there's a handful of stocks in that category zoom, Snowflake, Okta, CrowdStrike and Shopify. Those stocks trade between 25 and 70 times this year's revenue. I put Coinbase pretty much in the middle to lower end of that range at 40 times revenue. And that's how I get to $650 a share. Wow.
00:05:07.508 - 00:05:18.290, Speaker A: And just to go back to your earlier comments when you said that the direct listing did go well even though it was risky, so what does that say to you about the demand for Coin?
00:05:19.430 - 00:06:09.678, Speaker B: Well, it's what we talked about last time, which is there's just a tremendous amount of excitement about being able to own a liquid, established company. That all they do is crypto, a pure play crypto company that's large, established, has a great brand, and people were looking forward to that. And one of the interesting things you saw yesterday was that other public companies that have been a, quote unquote play on crypto, they lost some steam yesterday as people were selling that exposure to gain exposure to Coinbase because it's such a good, pure play investment. And I think that's one of the things we saw yesterday. Again, the supply is substantial. Direct listing means everybody gets to sell their shares. There's no lockup periods, there's no controlled selling, there's no market stabilization.
00:06:09.678 - 00:06:20.840, Speaker B: Everybody could just sell their shares in the open market. And so that's a lot of supply. The demand was there. People wanted exposure to Coinbase and they were able to get it.
00:06:21.530 - 00:06:36.470, Speaker A: And earlier, when you talked about companies that saw their stock prices drop a little bit. Are you talking about kind of like the microstrategies of the world or other companies that are viewed as gaining exposure to the price of bitcoin?
00:06:36.630 - 00:07:11.110, Speaker B: Yeah, even riot marathon, but even companies like square stock was down yesterday. A lot of people invested in Square over the last year or two because of how it made it possible to get exposure to bitcoin. It was a big part of the stock's outperformance over the last year or two was the tremendous amount of revenue they report based on bitcoin, based on crypto. I'd argue their accounting needs to be questioned a little bit, but it's been a big part of that story. And so that stock also underperformed yesterday.
00:07:12.250 - 00:07:23.530, Speaker A: Now let's talk about the coinbase market cap. Shortly before recording, I saw it was at 62 billion. You did mention an $85 billion number. I'm not sure, was that what it was at yesterday?
00:07:25.310 - 00:07:27.450, Speaker B: That goes back to that share count question.
00:07:27.520 - 00:07:27.898, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:27.984 - 00:07:47.554, Speaker B: If you use 261,000,000 shares times 330 or wherever it ends up closing today, then you get the higher number. Right. If you use the 200 million or 206, this is still somewhat subject to interpretation. It won't be for long. Then you get to a lower number. Yeah.
00:07:47.592 - 00:08:13.420, Speaker A: So on twitter, I did ask people why they thought the coinbase market cap wasn't in the 100 billion dollar range that people had been talking about earlier. And Jeff Dormant of Arca tweeted that the media has been using the wrong share count, 261,000,000, where he says that there are actually 198,000,000 class a and class b shares outstanding. So I just wondered, what's your take on kind of what is the better number to use?
00:08:14.190 - 00:08:52.326, Speaker B: Yeah. So let me take you a little bit into the inside baseball of stock research. There's a lot of things that we as analysts try to predict ourselves, and we only consider what the company tells us as input. How much revenue they're going to generate, how much profit they're going to generate. Those are the kinds of things that our job is to predict, and the company's input is just an input. There's things that when the company tells us we don't really question, they put out an eight K an SEC filing the night before the direct listing saying our share count is 261,000,000. Just like if they told me they're going to pay 20% taxes next year, I wouldn't question them.
00:08:52.326 - 00:09:41.480, Speaker B: I'm not going to question them on their share count. That conversation will get refined as they file their next report. So as they start filing ten Q reports and ten K reports, there's going to be even more detail and there's going to be a consensus formed about which share count to use. That consensus is formed by sell side analysts, people such as myself, and the other analysts at DA Davidson and analysts at other firms. We all decide on what share count do we use again, what tax rates we use to settle? And the aggregators, Thompson Reuters Facts at Bloomberg then decide which one to use. So, a lot of detail to say. As long as the company says it's 261 at this point of the game of a newly listed company, we're going to go with that.
00:09:41.480 - 00:10:11.360, Speaker B: But we'll find out more about what the right number to use is as they file more filings. Now, there'll still be multiple numbers. There's a basic share count. There's a diluted share count that they report. Anybody can do their own calculation about which of the warrants to use at what strike price, et cetera. You can always refine that as you go. But the end of the day, there's a consensus number what sell side analysts decide on, and when they said that they're guiding us to using 261, that's the number we're going to use.
00:10:12.130 - 00:10:54.334, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss Coinbase's outlook for the rest of the year. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Meet Interpop, a super team redefining the future of NFTs and fandom.

Visit hellointerpop IO to learn more. Back to my conversation with Gil Lauria. Ellie Frost pointed out in her Frost Byte newsletter that in Coinbase's Q One earnings, the company only gave its total revenue, which was 1.8
00:10:54.334 - 00:11:39.478, Speaker A: billion, as well as trading volume, which was 335,000,000. And she said that this translates into a 54 basis points take rate. But that that doesn't necessarily mean that retail users came out in force, since assets on the platform grew from 90 million to 223,000,000,000 between Q Four and Q One. And then she made the point. People could have bought on Coinbase two quarters ago but kept their assets on the platform. And Coinbase may simply be earning more revenues from those people because the subscription revenue is based on the assets on the platform. So what does all that say to you about Coinbase's ability to smooth out its revenues amidst any of the ups and downs in the crypto markets?
00:11:39.574 - 00:12:11.686, Speaker B: Those are all great points. And we're going to get again over time company just listed yesterday. Over time, we're all going to get much better at utilizing the numbers we have and the numbers they provide to being able to forecast their results going forward, to parse things a little more finely. So I'll make a couple of points on that. One is a majority of their assets and majority of trading volume are already institutional. Those come in at much lower take rates. So the interplay between institutional trading and retail trading is going to be very important.
00:12:11.686 - 00:12:41.722, Speaker B: And hopefully at some point, they start disclosing that they've already given us some hints, and hopefully there's continued disclosure that will allow us to model that. Well, the point about subscription revenue is spot on. Subscription revenue is often going to be based on the level of assets. That's the case for money managers like Fidelity or T. Row Price. Their revenue, even if it's recurring, is still based on the level of assets. So that will be volatile.
00:12:41.722 - 00:13:08.070, Speaker B: Not as volatile as trading volumes, but it will still have ups and downs as crypto goes up and down. And that's a small part of the revenue at this point anyway, right? So as you know, as we spoke with last time, their results will be much more volatile than other companies, but as long as they grow with the crypto economy, they'll grow a lot over time, and that's what is getting people excited.
00:13:08.590 - 00:13:26.400, Speaker A: Among the many eye popping figures in the Q, one earnings coinbase showed that monthly transacting users grew 118% quarter over quarter, whereas verified users only grew 30%. What's your takeaway from that? And what does that say to you about where Coinbase will end up this year?
00:13:27.170 - 00:14:04.010, Speaker B: Well, so those are interesting metrics for them to emphasize. The monthly active users. That's going to be a function of volatility. As we keep saying, Coinbase's results are going to depend on how volatile crypto assets are. One of the reasons is the more volatile they are, the more active traders there are, which is how they generate revenue right on those trading commissions. So you'd expect in a time of great volatility, the number of active traders would grow faster than the number of overall users. And there would be the reverse as volatility goes down.
00:14:04.010 - 00:14:48.680, Speaker B: If volatility goes down, price of crypto assets stabilizes or stabilizes at a lower place. The number of monthly traders has tended in the past to decline, not just grow slower, but actually decline. And that's something to pay attention to. What I found interesting about them guiding to that metric for the balance of the year is that I'm not sure that's a great metric because it doesn't capture that interplay between retail and institutional. Retail is paying a far higher take rate than institutional. That matters to me a lot more than the number of active traders. That number of active traders counts me buying a satoshi here or there, the same as Elon Musk buying a billion and a half dollars all at.
00:14:48.680 - 00:14:53.578, Speaker B: So that's not a great statistic. You shouldn't be counting those two things the same.
00:14:53.744 - 00:14:57.402, Speaker A: All right, so then for you, what numbers kind of will you be looking.
00:14:57.456 - 00:15:32.120, Speaker B: For that mix of trading volume between retail and institutional? And as we get our analysis refined, how are the take rates within those categories changing? Are the consumer take rates being pressured as people are expecting? I'm not sure about that. Are the institutional take rates holding up as more and more offerings come into the market? ETFs grayscale becomes more competitive, et cetera? I think those are? If we're going to focus on three or four metrics, those are the ones that I'm going to be focusing on.
00:15:32.890 - 00:15:46.410, Speaker A: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that over the next five to ten years, he expected 50% of the company's revenues to come from non trading products and services. This was in a CNBC interview. What do you think of that projection?
00:15:47.470 - 00:16:10.222, Speaker B: It's good for him to put that as a stake in the ground. Right. He's starting at 4%, so he's got a ways to go, but he needs more products like custody, like managed staking. There's going to be applications that they provide. They're invested in the crypto economy, they're invested in crypto companies. They're going to incorporate those kinds of products. The goal is for those products to generate more revenue.
00:16:10.222 - 00:16:16.734, Speaker B: But that's a long term goal for the foreseeable future. It's still going to be trading commissions.
00:16:16.862 - 00:16:22.054, Speaker A: But do you think he could achieve that 50% goal within five to? Oh, wow. Okay.
00:16:22.172 - 00:17:00.350, Speaker B: Absolutely. Because, again, the crypto economy is developing at a rate that we haven't seen. And the analogies I like to go back to are the Internet and how the Internet developed. And what was Amazon doing in 1997 when they went public? They were mostly selling books themselves. Right. None of us was expecting them to figure out that it's actually the three P business, the helping other people sell, and the prime business, and increasingly the cloud business that were going to be the most important ones. Jeff Bezos may have imagined it, but we sure didn't.
00:17:00.350 - 00:17:27.100, Speaker B: We just knew that Amazon was way ahead of the pack. They had tremendous leadership, and they were so customer centric, which was the absolute key to their success. And I see a lot of parallels with Coinbase. They're well managed, they understand the game, they're participating in it. They know how to address the crypto community. They know how to address the regulators. They know how to address the investment community.
00:17:27.100 - 00:17:35.742, Speaker B: They're in really good shape to be the ones that help bring to market more and more products in the next several years.
00:17:35.796 - 00:17:44.240, Speaker A: Most likely, there will be some margin compression in trading fees. What do you think is Coinbase's best bet for Navigating? That and when do you think that might happen?
00:17:44.930 - 00:18:07.590, Speaker B: So they have to make sure that they stay focused on their value propositions on both sides. So on the consumer side, their value proposition is ease of use. It's the security. It's the fact that they're the pure play. Right. I have more than ten financial applications on my phone. I have PayPal, I have Venmo, I have this bank, I have that bank.
00:18:07.590 - 00:18:44.482, Speaker B: The fact that they're focused is very important for them. So they need to stay focused, they need to stay safe, and they need to continue to offer more and more tools like Coinbase wallet for those people that prefer my key, MyCoin. On the institutional side, it's the same in terms of security. Again, that's going to be the most common aspect. Compliance is going to be tremendously important to institutional investors visibility. The fact that Coinbase is publicly traded is part of what's going to make them attractive to institutional investors going forward. They're the visible company.
00:18:44.482 - 00:19:24.110, Speaker B: They're the company that has to disclose of all of its financials. They're the company that their hurdle for compliance is so much higher because if anything wrong happened, it would be so much more visible. So if they can stay focused on the consumer side, on some of those elements, on the institutional side, on those elements, they will continue to have some pricing power. But competition always happens, and especially in categories like this that grow so fast and are inherently competitive. Right. In a decentralized economy, a decentralized market, it's inherently more competitive than centralized markets. And they need to understand that and continue to focus on those elements.
00:19:24.770 - 00:19:50.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you. I do think security probably is one of their top ones. And it's just one of the like I noticed in your disclosure, you cited that as a risk. And it's one of those things that's hard to quantify. But Coinbase, obviously, is pretty much the only exchange in the space that hasn't been hacked, which is quite knock on wood. Yeah. Last year, Coinbase notoriously stated that it is an apolitical company.
00:19:50.738 - 00:19:57.786, Speaker A: Do you see that harming it as a public company, especially at a time when more public companies are being more vocal when it comes to issues like.
00:19:57.808 - 00:20:30.994, Speaker B: Voting rights, boy, that's really tricky. All companies, all corporations, public and not public, have to contend with how to deal with this much more complicated political environment in the interplay between politics and corporate life. I'm not sure I agree with how they handled it. I wish they handled it differently. We at D. A davidson sure handed it differently. We're very much internalized the effort to increase diversity and inclusion and make that part of our strategy.
00:20:30.994 - 00:21:02.366, Speaker B: I wish Coinbase did the same, but I don't think of that as being an investment criteria. I think of that as being a civil responsibility and a corporate responsibility. But to me, as a sell side analyst, as a research analyst trying to make a decision about the stock, I'm not going to hold down to that standard. When I covered Etsy, who is the polar opposite? Right. A B Corp super, environmentally friendly. I love that they did that. I didn't give them any credit for that.
00:21:02.366 - 00:21:18.050, Speaker B: As a stock, though, I have to keep those things separate. I can be a citizen and a civilian on one side with an opinion about corporate behavior and corporate responsibility. But as a research analyst that evaluates stocks, I have to keep that separate from my opinion.
00:21:18.470 - 00:21:27.430, Speaker A: How do you think the Coinbase direct listing affected the price of Bitcoin? And going forward, how closely do you expect the Coinbase stock price and the Bitcoin price to be correlated.
00:21:28.330 - 00:22:26.054, Speaker B: So let's talk about causation, right? Because the correlation is one thing, but the causation is going to go the other way, right? Changes in crypto assets are going to drive coinbase results. So coinbase will very much trade like crypto assets, which is primarily trade like bitcoin going forward. What they have to prove, the burden of proof on them and what I believe it makes coinbase unique is that I believe they're a diversified play on crypto. So even if it's not bitcoin that wins, they'll still win, which gives them an advantage. If other assets perform very strongly and at the expense of bitcoin, they'll still really benefit. So what we're going to really have to watch is they're going to be correlated, but is coinbase less volatile or possibly positively leveraged, which is what we saw in the first quarter. We saw this extraordinary profitability number as bitcoin was going up, as crypto assets were going up that showed positive leverage.
00:22:26.054 - 00:22:34.430, Speaker B: If they can show more positive than negative leverage, that's what's going to make coinbase an interesting way to invest in crypto.
00:22:35.010 - 00:22:39.950, Speaker A: Are there any other crypto companies you have your eye on as being good candidates to be publicly?
00:22:41.410 - 00:23:12.730, Speaker B: You know, I have a tremendous amount of respect for grayscale. I've worked with those folks. I think the folks at kraken do a great job at circle, very good, strong companies. The miners are interesting. There's a couple of publicly traded companies there and I'm hoping and expecting more public company formation for no other reason because it's going to give us more information about what's going on, more results, and more ways to invest in this fantastic growth of the crypto economy.
00:23:13.390 - 00:23:19.302, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been so fun discussing all this with you. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.

00:24:08.464 - 00:25:00.058, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline, BTC hits another all time high. Like clockwork, bitcoin surged to a record high of 64 $899 on early Wednesday morning. Amidst the current bull run fueled by institutional investment NFTs and Coinbase's direct listing, it seems a new bitcoin peak is barely even memeworthy. What is noteworthy, however, is that one crypto investment firm projected a year ago that the price of bitcoin would break 62K this month in its April 2020 investor newsletter. At a time when bitcoin traded at roughly 10% of its current price, Pantera Capital correctly projected bitcoin would cross 62K this month. Pantera used projections based on a stock to flow model, which assumes that bitcoin's scarcity drives demand and value.
00:25:00.058 - 00:26:06.370, Speaker A: Pantera CEO Dan Moorehead noted this bitcoin rally is exactly like previous havings bitcoin is likely to reach 115K by August. Pantera also correctly called when bitcoin would break thirty K, forty K, and fifty K in previous months. In a Tweet Plan B, a prominent stock to flow bitcoin analyst estimated, quote BTC Capitalization will continue its straight line historical path, first towards market cap of gold $10 trillion, then real estate at $100 trillion. If stock to flow models aren't convincing enough for you. Michael Del Castillo, someone I consider a Forbes colleague, even though we didn't overlap there. Reported that 24% of Forbes's blockchain 50 symposium attendees say their companies will buy Bitcoin this year, a trend that could provide the institutional capital necessary to continue Bitcoin's path toward a $115,000 price in August. And further down the line, gold's $10 trillion market cap predicted by Pantera and Plan B, respectively.
00:26:06.370 - 00:26:46.782, Speaker A: Next headline. Gary Gensler named SEC chair the US. Senate officially confirmed Gary Gensler as chairman of the securities and Exchange Commission. Previously, he was the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and served on MIT's faculty, where he taught classes on blockchain as SEC chair. Gensler's opinion on crypto will likely affect the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple and the viability of a bitcoin ETF in the US. Two other regulatory stories stood out this week. The IRS commissioner, Charles Reddig, admitted that standard crypto reporting rules would, quote, absolutely help close the tax gap, which is the amount of US.
00:26:46.782 - 00:27:44.100, Speaker A: Taxes owed that have yet to be paid.
