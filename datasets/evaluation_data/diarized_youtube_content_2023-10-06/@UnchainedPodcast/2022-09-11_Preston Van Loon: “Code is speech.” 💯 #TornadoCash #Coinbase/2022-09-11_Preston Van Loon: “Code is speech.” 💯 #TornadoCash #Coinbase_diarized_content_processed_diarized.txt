00:00:00.330 - 00:00:29.238, Speaker A: The code that powers tornado cash is speech. It's been established the code is speech. And we think that the sanctions that OFAC has put on here is effectively putting a sensor on free speech. I think that's wrong. So I've joined in this lawsuit with a few others and with the help of Coinbase, and our goal is here is to try to get that overturned. We're not really seeking any bunny or anything. I do have some ether that's trapped in there.
00:00:29.238 - 00:00:39.780, Speaker A: I can't take it out or be faced for sanctions violations. But really, the goal is to get that reversed and say, code is speech, and free speech is a constitutional right.
