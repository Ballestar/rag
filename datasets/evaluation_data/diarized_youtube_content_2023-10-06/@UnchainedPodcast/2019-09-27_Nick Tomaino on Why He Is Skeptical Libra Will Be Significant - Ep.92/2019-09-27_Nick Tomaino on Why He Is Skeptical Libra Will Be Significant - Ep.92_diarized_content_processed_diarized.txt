00:00:45.526 - 00:01:00.378, Speaker A: For a lot of crypto fans, it's hard to find one place where you can trade, plan and discuss crypto strategy. Get started with Etoro and the world's number one social trading platform. Today's guest is Nick Tameno, general partner of one. Confirmation. Welcome, Nick.
00:01:00.474 - 00:01:01.520, Speaker C: How's it going?
00:01:02.050 - 00:01:17.778, Speaker A: You just raised a $45 million fund, your second with your first fund raising 26 million and launching all the way back in August 2017, which was the year of cryptomania. What was it like trying to raise in this market versus in 2017?
00:01:17.954 - 00:02:29.420, Speaker C: Yeah, it was much more difficult. I'd say in 2017, I think most investors had FOMO, they had seen a massive rise in prices and if you could get in front of family offices or individuals, mostly not institutions in 2017, but there was a lot of demand for people that just wanted exposure to crypto because of FOMO. So I would say it was really easy in 2017 to raise and it was much more difficult this time around, although I did have strong support from my existing LP base, which I really benefited from. So I think if I had to raise from a completely new base of investors, it would have been even more difficult. But I did have a really strong group of initial investors that kind of saw what I've done over the past two years and I basically kind of executed how I said I was going to execute. And I think they were generally happy with my communication and the signs in the portfolio so far. So I got a lot of support there.
00:02:29.420 - 00:02:32.030, Speaker C: But yeah, definitely different environment.
00:02:32.450 - 00:02:38.682, Speaker A: And were the types of LPs different? Like, in terms of kind of the interest of the type of investor?
00:02:38.826 - 00:03:20.010, Speaker C: Yes. Well, I would say fund two is larger LP types of LPs. Right. So for my first fund I had a much lower minimum and a higher number and more individuals and things like that. Fund two is a few fund of funds and some family offices. So yeah, definitely more institutional, although not the big institutions, not many of the big institutions. I think my general take from this fundraise was that it's still very early for most big institutions.
00:03:21.390 - 00:03:25.840, Speaker A: So what have you been investing in so far and what will you focus on in this fund.
00:03:26.450 - 00:04:12.230, Speaker C: So fund one, our general thesis as a fund is invest in products that the crypto community wants and needs. And so I'm a crypto native user. I got involved in the space. I was one of the first 100 or so users of Coinbase and then started working at Coinbase. So I'm just kind of always trying new crypto products and think I have a good feel for the crypto kind of community. And so that's really what I focus on. There's a lot of VCs out there that want to see blockchains applied to supply chains or to bank to bank transfers or things kind of outside of crypto.
00:04:12.230 - 00:04:50.490, Speaker C: And that stuff may work, but I don't have a really good feel for that stuff. It's kind of out of my comfort zone and expertise. And I think what I have a good feel for is kind of this crypto native stuff. So that's very much what we like to invest in, these products that are solving problems for the crypto community. And I think within the crypto community there's two types of users. There's the crypto believer and there's a developer. And so if you look at our existing portfolio, pretty much everything that we've invested in is solving a problem for those two types of end users.
00:04:50.990 - 00:05:40.954, Speaker A: So I totally understand why that's your focus and how that also plays your strength. But one thing I would say is that I feel like what we're seeing at least this year is that the companies and organizations that are interested in crypto have branched out quite a bit since 2017. Here we've got like Facebook trying to launch its own stablecoin and this week backed which has the backing of the Intercontinental Exchange, starbucks, Microsoft's Venture, Arm, et cetera. They launched their futures product and we even had the bank of England governor proposing a global digital currency. So what do you make of those developments? It sounds like it hasn't really affected your investment thesis, but I'm curious to know what impact you think those things will have on the crypto space.
00:05:41.152 - 00:07:16.840, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I love to see that stuff. To be clear, I think that's all very positive for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in kind of gaining more understanding and acceptance from the mainstream. But I would say I'm pretty skeptical of kind of large institutions launching cryptocurrency initiatives that really impact the space in a meaningful way in the long term. And there's a few reasons for that. But generally speaking, I think the public first and foremost and the media also kind of overestimates the importance of institutional projects and kind of underestimates the importance of small teams that are working on completely new ideas so we can get into any of those projects in particular. But generally speaking, I think my belief is that the cryptocurrency movement is very much a grassroots kind of bottoms up movement that's at the end of the day very disruptive to large institutions. And that's why I think innovators dilemma and lack of focus are kind of two major hurdles that any institutional project, whether it's Facebook or backed or things like that, are going to be up against.
00:07:17.290 - 00:07:34.426, Speaker A: Well, so yeah, why don't you dive into a little bit like maybe let's talk about Libra since I feel like that's kind of the one that has the most mind share out in the mainstream world. What's your take on kind of how that will play out and what impact it will have on crypto?
00:07:34.618 - 00:08:36.274, Speaker C: I don't have a strong feeling on how it will play out. I guess other know, I'm skeptical that it's going to be very meaningful in the long run. I guess, look, I understand why people are excited about it. I mean, Facebook has several billion users and the idea of putting crypto in the hands of billions of Facebook users is very exciting. We could get into the tactics of kind of why I think there's a lot of hurdles to what they're doing. But at the end of the day, how I think about this is the best crypto mind are not going to work at Facebook to work on a cryptocurrency initiative. They're doing their own thing and economic incentives have a lot to do with Know.
00:08:36.274 - 00:09:30.130, Speaker C: I think Know Zuckerberg's talking about it and it is top of mind in some sense from the very top at Facebook, but I'm just deeply skeptical that they're going to pull something really meaningful long run. And if you look at most of their materials, a lot of it is kind of very much a derivative of ethereum and kind of existing crypto projects. The whole concept of Libra to me kind of feels like a poor man's maker. Know, happy to dive into specifics, but I guess that's my general sentiment on Libra.
00:09:30.550 - 00:10:05.102, Speaker A: All right, well, why don't we dive into deeper details in a moment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:10:14.344 - 00:11:02.874, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean. And that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors. Privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations. CipherTrace is working on this vision of the future.

00:11:09.560 - 00:11:29.690, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Nick Tamino. So if know not thinking that Libra will end up being super impactful, then what do you think will kind of be maybe the really big way that people end up using this technology, like in a more mainstream fashion?
00:11:30.350 - 00:12:44.370, Speaker C: So I think in 2019 there's one clear use case for crypto, which is speculation and that's arguably now a mainstream use case and I think there's going to be ebbs and flows, but it's likely that we're still in kind of the relatively early innings of that use case. My base assumption is that speculation is going to continue to grow as a use case in crypto. There's a lot of people out there that say, well look, the speculation is all a bubble and there's got to be real use cases beyond speculation underlying it. But I think that's a very kind of US centric view of the world. And if you look at a whole bunch of countries around the world and you spend time in those places, you realize that there are people in those countries that may not have the ability to invest in public market equities like we do in the US. Or may not even have bank accounts. And so crypto very much represents a new investable opportunity for a lot of people in the world and I think that use case is going to grow beyond speculation.
00:12:44.370 - 00:14:06.410, Speaker C: My kind of gut is that the next potentially really interesting mainstream use case could be saving and saving meaning interest bearing accounts in crypto. And if you look at negative interest rates policies around the world and even in the US, if you have $10,000 in a savings account, you can get maybe 2% on that right now. And we're starting to see products on top of ethereum that are giving better savings opportunities to people. And of course it's still very early, it's unclear where the rates will end up long term and there's challenges for people to get into crypto still. But I'm very excited about things like Compound and dYdX and Uniswap that are giving people around the world new savings opportunities and kind of interest bearing savings opportunities. So that's a use case that I think could be the next catalyst to get millions of users into crypto.
00:14:07.230 - 00:14:30.580, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you that all those projects are pretty interesting. I've actually had them all on either Unchained or unconfirmed, so I'll link to those in the show notes. But so that in general sounds like maybe DeFi is what's interesting to so aside from maybe the savings use case, are there any other trends in DeFi that have piqued your interest?
00:14:31.350 - 00:15:09.950, Speaker C: Sure. Savings is in some sense on the back of stablecoins. Right? And for fun one, we made some early bets in stablecoins and that was really a big focus for us. It continues to be I mean, the need for stablecoins just kind of continues to grow and I think if you look at it's, no secret MakerDAO is the most successful in many ways projects on top of Ethereum.
00:15:13.830 - 00:15:16.338, Speaker A: Tether on Ethereum is now taking true.
00:15:16.424 - 00:15:54.270, Speaker C: True though I know tether is technically on Ethereum but no one in DeFi uses tether. I get back to how I think about the world and maybe this is too narrow, but it's kind of way I think it's like do I use the products? And tether is something that I've never used. Tether to me is kind of this stablecoin that's used by traders on different exchanges and things like that. But yeah, tether to me is not really DeFi.
00:15:54.690 - 00:15:57.418, Speaker A: You mean like it's not used on chain?
00:15:57.594 - 00:16:31.450, Speaker C: Is that what you exactly, exactly. Like if you look at decentralized exchanges, tether I think is like the trading pair used on centralized exchanges like Binance and others. But if you look at kind of on chain DeFi decentralized exchanges I could be wrong on this, but I don't think you'll see tether high up the list. It's Dai and it's USDC.
00:16:33.390 - 00:16:40.650, Speaker A: What's your feeling about Ethereum scaling issues? Do you worry that that could drive developers off into other crypto networks?
00:16:42.370 - 00:17:51.778, Speaker C: It's definitely a long term concern, though I think my view is right now Ethereum is working really well for high dollar value, low throughput type transactions. DFI really, right? And there are solutions that come before E 20 that can give you some scaling. Right? Maybe it's five x or ten x and not 1000 X. But to me the fact that transaction fees on Ethereum surpassed bitcoin and people are actually paying higher fees right now for Ethereum transactions is a really good sign. And I think there are a lot of tweaks to be made like increasing the gas limit size and implementing some layer zero solutions such as blocks route that can get you relatively soon without these major protocol changes. Five X or ten X. Right.
00:17:51.944 - 00:18:17.814, Speaker A: Although I did see this week that I guess there were because of a scaling bottleneck, I guess there was some point where the ETH price fell or something and there was a bunch of liquidations in MakerDAO CDPs and they didn't go through kind of at the time that you would expect. And so I feel like that does cause some risk. I saw somebody tweeting about that. I'll put that in the show notes.
00:18:17.942 - 00:19:00.282, Speaker C: Yeah, I actually didn't see that, but that's interesting. It doesn't really surprise me. I think clearly anyone that's used Ethereum in the past week or so recognizes that there's been a bottleneck. And I did an Ethereum transaction the other day and paid $12 for a fee. But what I'm saying is there are ways to get ten x, say, without major changes like E 20. Right. Particularly, I mean, increasing the gas limit, which miners are starting to do, and I think that could continue.
00:19:00.282 - 00:20:14.802, Speaker C: And increasing the gas limit that comes with some trade offs that you need to consider and things like that. So it's not quite that easy. But I guess long winded way of saying my view is that DeFi high dollar value, low throughput stuff on Ethereum is working pretty well right now. But I think clearly for use cases beyond that such as social networking apps or gaming apps or identity stuff or anything that requires kind of low dollar value, but high throughput Ethereum as it currently stands can't support that. Right? And that's obviously a driving force behind why there's been such a big emphasis on E 20, which I would say I'm cautiously optimistic on that. Early 2020, we could start seeing some of the the fruits of all the work that's being done there. But I also think there is an opportunity for other chains to capture some of those use cases that Ethereum isn't right now.
00:20:14.802 - 00:21:12.740, Speaker C: And we've invested in a few of those, I would say. I think that's clearly been next gen blockchains has been kind of this meme that a lot of projects have just kind of way over marketed and there's a lot of really bad projects that raised a lot of money from that meme. But I think there are as is the case with most memes, they tend to get abused. But there is some kind of interesting stuff there too. And that's projects, the two in particular that we've invested in are Cosmos and Polkadot, which I think by my estimation are kind of the best combination of kind of this strong community and ethos combined with strong technology. And I think in order to really capture any of these use cases that we're talking about, I think you need both.
00:21:13.510 - 00:21:29.900, Speaker A: And out of curiosity for both of those, obviously you would have the choice of investing either in the company, such as Parity versus the network Polkadot or the company tendermint versus the network Cosmos. So how do you decide which one to do and which did you do?
00:21:30.750 - 00:22:44.834, Speaker C: Yeah, so in the case of the Cosmos network, we invested both in the company Tendermint behind the project and the Token in the case of Atoms and in the case of Polkadot, we just invested in you know, I think there's a whole variety of considerations there. At the end of the day, though, I think what's most important is, again, like incentive alignment. How we think about it is we don't really care if we're investing in a company or a Token. We want kind of pure incentive alignment with the founders that are building the project. And I think clearly 2017 there was way too much focus on Tokens because it became this really hot thing and you could raise a lot of money with and in many cases, there wasn't pure incentive alignment with the investors and the founders, and that got into trouble. But I think how I think about early stage investing is you're going to have success if you can align yourself from an incentive perspective with great founders. And that's really how I think about it.
00:22:45.032 - 00:22:48.974, Speaker A: All right, well, it's been great having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
00:22:49.102 - 00:22:55.794, Speaker C: Sure. That felt quick, but, yeah, great to be on and, yeah, I'll talk to you soon.
