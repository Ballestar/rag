00:00:00.250 - 00:00:06.110, Speaker A: You should not be arguing against permissionless structures ever. Permissionless will always be better than permission. Period.
00:00:10.290 - 00:00:58.858, Speaker B: Hi all. Today's episode, recorded live at ETH Denver, is about the recent drama in Ethereum over testnet, ETH. In particular, ETH on the girly testnet. These are the test blockchains that developers use to simulate their projects, whether they're the devs working on the main software clients for the blockchain, or if it's the node operators, stakers and miners, or if it's the application developers. As you'll hear, the question of whether or not there should be a monetary value on testnet ETH quickly became an extremely contentious issue, which is why, at the last minute, I was invited to moderate a debate at ETH Denver on the topic. I hadn't been intending to go, but I spontaneously decided to two days in advance, and I'm so glad I did. The debate at ETH Denver was pretty heated, as you'll hear, and I myself am undecided about the best way to proceed.

00:02:15.458 - 00:02:47.380, Speaker C: So the Ethereum community has been up in arms about something that layer Zero did a little over a week ago. And I think that the reason people feel so passionately about it is because it really gets at what the values of the Ethereum community are. Why don't we have brian, just start with your story of the problem that Layer Zero Labs saw and what solution it was that you thought you could offer.
00:02:47.750 - 00:03:12.042, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I mean, basically pretty straightforward. It was like, near impossible to get early e very difficult. We, as we were building, you'd go to the faucets. Faucets are down, faucets are broken, faucets are out. You write scripts to camp the faucets. You have to sit there for multiple hours, days sometimes, to get enough to deploy contracts, to put in a contract, to actually do things to test.
00:03:12.042 - 00:03:13.818, Speaker A: Like, it was just an onerous process.
00:03:13.984 - 00:03:20.230, Speaker C: We ended up having just to set the stage. So girly ETH is for a test net called girly.
00:03:20.310 - 00:03:51.462, Speaker A: Yep. Then we ended up going to Twitter and being like, all right, who's got Girly ETH? Like, how can we get some? And ended up OTC buying from somebody on Twitter to get Girly ETH? Yeah, I mean, basically, that was a base problem. Very hard to get. Basically the most asked for thing. So we service, like, 30,000 contracts on testnet right now are built on layer zero. Like, thousands of unique applications, hundreds of thousands of users, millions of messages. By far the most common thing we get is, like, can you give us some Girly ETH? Right.
00:03:51.462 - 00:04:12.250, Speaker A: Like, universally very annoying to get. For us, it was just, okay, like, why should there not be some permissionless construct? Why do I need to go beg on Twitter and do this? Let's make something that just allows people to just get it on demand when they want. And so for us, it was solving a pain point that we had as developers, and that was the intention behind it, was nothing more than that.
00:04:12.400 - 00:04:24.160, Speaker C: And so basically, at that point, you made it tradable, and so there was a price on it. And what eventually happened is, of course, speculators came in and the price went up, and it became very expensive to obtain this.
00:04:25.810 - 00:04:37.626, Speaker A: Very expensive is debatable. I think it's like so for, like, $0.04, you can get enough to deploy a contract. So there's some excess fees you get in, but very expensive is a spectrum.
00:04:37.678 - 00:04:39.894, Speaker C: Yes. I think at the high, it was like a dollar 60.
00:04:40.012 - 00:04:44.006, Speaker A: Yeah. Which means it would be like, deploy a contract, but yes.
00:04:44.188 - 00:04:52.620, Speaker C: Okay. So Greg feels very strongly that this was a bad move. So, Greg, can you explain?
00:04:54.270 - 00:05:43.562, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think from, like, a historical context, when it comes to testnets, and especially testnets on, like, there's always been a maintained stance that this is a free public good for developers to access. And historically, it's always been a little challenging to get testnet. It's been kind of cyclical. But the core philosophy here is that it should be free, and it should always be free for people, because we don't know to test and to experiment shouldn't have a cost associated to it. To assume that we can just buy testnet ETH is also a bit of a privilege. Right. I don't know what everybody's situation is.
00:05:43.562 - 00:06:42.000, Speaker D: I don't know if you're able to spend money to get ETH. You might not even have ETH on main net, which is, like, already the first problem, right. If you're not even onboarded and you're just trying to experiment as a developer new to the ecosystem, that is a barrier to begin with. The other problem that did arise with and where I was pretty strongly on it was just the negative criticism towards the Gurley team as well. We've been trying to fund people and give it to people who can distribute it for us, as well as the final thing that I made a smaller point on but I didn't address because I'm not in that subject field. But it's do we have tax liabilities that come up and arise due to the fact that we're now putting a market and a price on this ETH? Does it only affect the people that bought? Does it affect everybody that's been holding? It becomes a super tricky situation. And so that's kind of some of the three main points that I stuck with there.
00:06:42.450 - 00:07:18.230, Speaker A: Yeah, we get pretty contentious already. All right, so my main point here, which I think is pretty interesting, is a blockchain in general provides one discrete unit of value. And that unit of value is block space. Right? Block space is inherently both limited in supply and scarce. None of us can change girly to have 1000 X throughput. Like block space is the unit of value and block space is inherently scarce and finite. So there's like three ways you can do in an ideal world, you would have a permissionless construct where anybody can get testnet for free.
00:07:18.230 - 00:07:47.362, Speaker A: But the problem and the reason you can't do that is because if there's a button when anyone can get unlimited testnet ETH for free, then what happens is everybody pushes a button and now it is literally zero cost to spam the networks. Every block is filled, the mempool gets entirely stuffed and basically nothing can happen. Like you cannot have it be permissionless and free because it won't function. It's like a very basic construct of any blockchain. Like block space has value. So there's two things you can do after that. The existing construct that we had was permissioned and free.
00:07:47.362 - 00:08:27.870, Speaker A: Right? Where free is that permissioned is there's a select group of people who get a large amount of girly ETH. These are maintainers, these are whoever, and it's up to them to kind of dole it out to the people that they see fit or set up faucets or do whatever at a rate that arguably keeps the blockchain working right. So that it is not free and unlimited and people aren't doing it. The problem is the faucets get spammed, right? All the faucets were getting drained, they were getting bought. It was almost impossible to use the faucets because it does have value, because the block space has value and then faucets get more and more restrictive. Now, faucets, you have permissioned. Faucets where you need to DOX yourself, you need to DOX your Twitter, you need to DOX your GitHub, whatever it is, to be able to get the ETH out of it.
00:08:27.870 - 00:08:54.066, Speaker A: And at that point you're getting 0.2 girl ETH per day out of this. So that is one construct you could have where it's basically permissioned but free. But there are gatekeepers, and you're gatekeeped on time, access and social circle of the ability to reach the people on Twitter to say, hey, I'm a dev, please give me some of this. The third option is permissionless, but you give it an explicit value. The block space has value no matter what. There is no making block space less finite or less scarce.
00:08:54.066 - 00:09:21.950, Speaker A: It has intrinsic value. And when you make it permissionless and explicit, you just expose what that value is based on the market. And so the argument that there should not be a permissionless construct and it should be permissioned is very contentious to me on my end, because on the base point that you will never be able to make it permissionless and free, it cannot happen. You will not do like you can't do that now. You can't do with Sepolia. You can't do it with any chain.
00:09:22.370 - 00:09:46.134, Speaker D: Yeah. So Matt can probably speak to this a little bit more clear, but we could very well have a function implemented, a custom opcode, built in, pre compile, whatever, to do some sort of drip where anyone could call it that would be very manageable at the protocol layer. It's a question of whether that wants to be implemented as a custom function for testnet specifically, but then it will.
00:09:46.172 - 00:10:10.910, Speaker A: Just get bought it and again the block space will get taken up. There's only so many transactions you can fit into a block. There's demand for filling up the blocks with transactions. The more application developers that build on the network, the more demand there is for that. And so even if you drip, it's like minting money, right? You can mint unlimited money, but the cost of a gallon of milk is not going to stay the same. It just gets more expensive, cost more expensive to insert transactions.
00:10:11.330 - 00:10:41.160, Speaker E: I think you're really over indexing on the value of gurley. And I think that the reason we're having a lot of the problems that we have today is that a lot of people think that girly is not going anywhere. They think, I need to start acquiring gurley while it's possible to acquire gurley, because it's going to become valuable, either somebody's going to create a bridge to mainnet where I can sell this, or this is going to be the only testnet that we have for the next ten years. I think if we create a system where we're actually deprecating these test nets over time, it's like, why would I try to acquire a lot of Girl ETH? Or suppose ETH? Because we're just going to destroy it in three or five years.
00:10:41.530 - 00:11:13.646, Speaker A: So I have another contentious point to this. In that testnets, go back seven years, go back even four years, 2018, there just weren't that many smart contracts written. Testnets were primarily for client devs to basically say, hey, the merge is coming up, let's make sure Geth doesn't break and bork the entire network as we go through these changes. Right? That was the reason we had testnets and those were the primary people using testnets. Now, today we have a huge number of application developers, and it sucks as an application developer to deploy univ three. They spin up pools. You spin up pools.
00:11:13.646 - 00:11:38.426, Speaker A: People compose that start having applications who are testing that and then, like, oh, networks deprecated, shut it all down and migrate to a new network. The application developers need a software cycle that goes alpha beta release, just like we have in normal software. Like, you have to have a production or semi production environment to test this in. And if you need to, especially in a situation, this is why you're struggling now to get, like, chainlink and all the infrastructure to move over to.
00:11:38.608 - 00:11:39.482, Speaker D: I got them on.
00:11:39.536 - 00:11:52.046, Speaker A: You are getting them now because it's a manual movement and all infrastructure needs to move. And that is a horrible experience for devs to have to spin up this environment, strip it all down, and do.
00:11:52.068 - 00:12:24.442, Speaker C: It every time we deploy before we keep going. I think something that would be super helpful for people to understand is there's kind of like, three main constituencies that use the testnets. So why don't we just explain that so we can kind of understand, like, there's competing interests, and that's another reason why people are so mad about what's going on. So who wants to actually, Matt, why don't you do it? And while you're doing that, why don't you also give your take on how layer zero suddenly made Girly Eats Tradable? Because we didn't get to hear your take on it.
00:12:24.496 - 00:12:24.714, Speaker A: Sure.
00:12:24.752 - 00:12:47.374, Speaker E: Okay. So let me say my take on the testnet bridge, and then I'll say my role as a core developer and how we use the testnets. So my take on the layer zero bridge, I think it's hilarious. This is what I think about these systems. These are permissionless systems. Anybody could do whatever they want. I don't know what kind of conversations you guys had over time when you were talking about this, but this is something that we anticipated happening at some point.
00:12:47.374 - 00:13:09.590, Speaker E: I think Dean Eigenman said two years ago, I'm going to build a testnet bridge for Gurley. And I was like, Where is it? I can't wait. It's going to be great. But that I kind of know a little bit of frustration with was, like, announcing it and sort of virtuous signaling that this was a public good for everybody. I didn't really feel like the testnet bridge itself is like this public good. I think it's great for layer zero. I had no idea what layer zero was.
00:13:09.590 - 00:13:26.938, Speaker E: Probably not a fault of yours. Probably a fault of mine. I don't know how bridges work very well. I think it was a great marketing scheme. It's created a lot of interest in layer zero and Girly and all these things. And obviously we're on stage now, it's talking about it, and this is a lot of free marketing. So I think it was, like, an extremely great play, but I don't think that it was like something that's valuable for developers.
00:13:26.938 - 00:13:45.986, Speaker E: Maybe for a handful of developers it is valuable. Okay, you can respond to this. Let me just say how I used testnets as a core developer. You're right. The testnets in the early days were very much like let's make sure that the clients all work on these things. We use this to test syncing, we use this to test client compatibility interoperability between all of these things. And today it's a lot less about that.
00:13:45.986 - 00:14:30.546, Speaker E: It's way more about application developers. And when we think about how to do testnets, how to deprecate testnets, how to add new testnets, we're very much thinking about how do we do this in a way that it's useful for application developers. It's still very important for us as core developers to use as a platform where we get to upgrade these networks before we upgrade main nets. Absolutely. I think that this is pretty much completely orthogonal at this point, though, to how application developers use it. So I don't really feel like as a core developer, how we feel about the testnets is super important. I think we just need to be thinking, how is this useful to application developers? What do we need to do to make this useful for application developers? And I'm happy to talk more about things that we've talked about to try and remove this situation where there's a finite amount of testnet tokens and people are trying to get them.
00:14:30.546 - 00:14:37.490, Speaker E: Because we have talked about a few different ways, adding in an opcode, having different withdrawal mechanisms from the beacon chain. We can get into that later.
00:14:37.560 - 00:14:51.720, Speaker A: And 100% agree with you on the needs being orthogonal and that there is a very real demand for client devs to be able to test. We need to make sure these things are not going to break the network. They're just different audiences in terms of what the developers need.
00:14:52.970 - 00:15:12.190, Speaker C: Does one of you want to then also describe the application developers and then the node operators who are also using these and what they're using it for? Just so we can cover that to explain. Because the other thing is, this wasn't that big of an issue until recently. So we need to explain how that became so yeah, start with the two other groups and then why it became a bigger issue recently.
00:15:12.850 - 00:15:58.958, Speaker D: Yeah, so one of the other groups, obviously, is application developers. Those are people building DApps uniswaps the compounds, the DeFi NFT projects. They need a lot amount of testnet ether to do run simulations and stuff like that. The other main group that is unique now and this is really where the girly strap came and started choking. The supply is from the amount of L, two S and apps and POS. So anything that requires stake and lock, like POS completely locks up a huge swath of girl E, like 600K just to start the beacon chain. I sent that off two three years ago, and that was how we said it.
00:15:58.958 - 00:16:29.286, Speaker D: So there's like, millions locked that we can never recover. Well, we can eventually recover with withdrawals. And then when we have other L, two S and 1559 burning testnet ether constantly, it makes for the environment there to be very difficult. And when we built Gurley, we didn't anticipate it to go on this long. It was a hackathon project. It wasn't supposed to be serious. And there's a lot of ether from 2018 that's missing from that project or 2019.
00:16:29.286 - 00:16:34.620, Speaker D: I can't remember. Yeah, so those are the other two, and kind of where a lot of the supply is.
00:16:35.310 - 00:17:02.260, Speaker C: So one thing that people realized was, okay, this is a thing, and we need to make sure the next testnet kind of addresses this. So Sepolia was supposed to do that. And so when I was talking with some people who maybe just don't love what layer zero did here or oppose it, they were like, why can't they just use Sepolia? That's what people should be doing. So, Brian, do you want to address.
00:17:02.870 - 00:17:30.394, Speaker A: Like, at the end of the day, the problem we had, the immediate problem was getting girly eat. That was a hard thing. That's where all the applications were. That's where our developers were building and interacting with constantly, because that's where most of the infrastructure very, very easily could do it to Sibolia as well. There is no hurdle to doing that. There's no hurdle to doing this to any chain. So I think most likely the reality is moving forward, this sort of thing is out of the box.
00:17:30.394 - 00:17:46.660, Speaker A: This will happen on almost every testnet. Like it or not. There will be permissionless structures. So I think the focus is, as Matt was saying, is how do you build a better testnet? How do you actually build a testnet that functions and serves the needs of application developers, which is a super important conversation to be.
00:17:47.910 - 00:17:56.018, Speaker C: So can somebody explain? I thought Sepolia kind of had built in a better way to distribute the coin so that there was Sepolia has.
00:17:56.024 - 00:18:23.070, Speaker A: A way that validate I believe that validators. Or like a select group. Again, permission structure to basically mint Sepolia on demand, but it doesn't change the amount of block space there is. It doesn't change the amount of what can be done. So you can inflate the supply, but you still need to, one, in some permissioned manner, distribute the supply, and two, ensure that there's still value to the block space. So the same reason there were OTC markets on girly prior.
00:18:23.650 - 00:18:26.400, Speaker E: I mean, how full are girly blocks right now?
00:18:27.170 - 00:18:32.814, Speaker A: Girly blocks are not full. Yeah, Zapoli blocks are definitely not full.
00:18:32.852 - 00:18:34.266, Speaker E: There's a lot of Zapolia blocks.
00:18:34.378 - 00:18:59.660, Speaker A: So Gurley blocks actually one application that we deployed, one single application, which was like the testnet of CTDB, the circle thing basically bricked Gurley for, like, two weeks. Like, every single block we're full, there were like five. We were falling behind in inserting transactions to be able to process them. So there are periods where Gurley is completely full. I actually just ran yesterday the number of transactions per block, but I don't have the exact number. I could pull it up.
00:19:01.710 - 00:19:48.694, Speaker D: That's just how ethereum based blockchains work. They will fill up and they will fall down. It's going to be cyclical. It's always going to be cyclical. I think the bigger problem is that by suggesting that there's and hey, there's free market people can do whatever the hell they want, that's literally the point of why we're doing a lot of this. But the problem I have is if there's going to be bad behavior, and I'm defining bad behavior as putting value to something that should be 100% free, public good, so that we can try and actually onboard developers, get people testing. If we're going to have that because there's like, OTC happening, I don't see why we should be promoting further bad behavior by further enabling it free.
00:19:48.812 - 00:19:54.790, Speaker A: If it's going to be free, make it free to insert into blocks, and every block will be full and spammed. It will be completely unusable.
00:19:54.870 - 00:20:00.666, Speaker E: I mean, if we had 128 testnet chains, I don't think that we'd be having this problem.
00:20:00.768 - 00:20:08.270, Speaker A: Sure, in the value in the open market of those testnet ETH would be effectively zero, right? It might be 100,000,000th of a cent.
00:20:08.340 - 00:20:11.834, Speaker E: So why did we not create another 16 chains? Why did we create a bridge?
00:20:11.882 - 00:20:32.294, Speaker A: I'm very supportive of that. I'm unsupportive of saying having a permissioned structure where we need to dole out and decide who gets testnet ETH, who can participate, everybody needs to come to us to get it is not the correct way. Having a permissionless structure where the value is driven to almost zero because it's abundant and people can test 100% is the right way, and that is what we should be trying to do.
00:20:32.332 - 00:20:33.814, Speaker E: So you would be supportive of having.
00:20:33.852 - 00:21:02.830, Speaker A: Proof of work test Nets 100%? Why not? It doesn't matter. You can spin up right now. You have L two S. You have four different L two S right now, tied to Gurley, like L two in demand. Demand for block space should move everywhere. If you want to spin up 128 testnets, what the problem is for application developers is that, again, you are not going to have this consolidation of composable infrastructure. What they want is to go and test chain link Oracles in their application.
00:21:02.830 - 00:21:04.414, Speaker A: They want to compose univ three pool.
00:21:04.462 - 00:21:06.260, Speaker E: They said MultiChain was the future.
00:21:08.790 - 00:21:15.410, Speaker A: We can make that easier. But it's not there in general. It is not like what people want to test.
00:21:15.560 - 00:21:39.066, Speaker C: So just to go back to the Napoleon question, though, because when I did the pre interviews yesterday, somebody made the point, basically, that there's a lot of demand in Gurley, but really the application developers should be using Sepolia. That testnet is more for that? Is that not a thing or is that a thing?
00:21:39.248 - 00:22:23.610, Speaker D: Yes. So since DevCon in Bogota, we've been trying to tell people that Gurley is meant for staking. It's meant for people to test their infrastructure on Staking infrastructure and for the time being the L two infrastructure and that Sepolia is meant for application development. And we've been saying this even before that simply because we've been watching the supply constraints happen. And it's been an ongoing issue because we haven't been able to get custom code built for a testnet like Gurley implemented to something like Go Ethereum where we can try and solve some of this problem, re top up the faucets indefinitely. So we've been trying to push everybody to Sepolia for that reason.
00:22:23.680 - 00:22:31.898, Speaker C: Okay. And it's my understanding that Brian, you guys weren't doing that because you don't have the network effects on Sepolia that you need to do the kinds of tests you want to do.
00:22:32.064 - 00:22:44.898, Speaker A: Not at all. Again, there's not a problem in getting Sepolia ETH right now because nobody uses Sepolia. There may be a problem getting Sepolia in whatever six months from now, but there was a problem getting Girly ETH. That's the problem. We felt that's the problem most.
00:22:44.984 - 00:22:55.186, Speaker C: But what I'm saying is because what I heard was, oh, they should be using Sepolia because we have this problem with girl ETH and you're saying what.
00:22:55.208 - 00:23:07.074, Speaker A: Is the they should, what is they should. Right. It's not like there's not some dictatorship that says like here's how you use blockchains. Like, yes, Sepolia has attractive features for certain things. I think people should move to Sepolia but people haven't.
00:23:07.202 - 00:23:07.542, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:07.596 - 00:23:10.726, Speaker C: And you were saying you don't want to use it because there is a.
00:23:10.748 - 00:23:12.374, Speaker A: Net we absolutely will use.
00:23:12.412 - 00:23:14.474, Speaker C: No, but I mean, we support like.
00:23:14.512 - 00:23:18.490, Speaker A: 35 testnets right now. We will connect to everything we will use.
00:23:18.640 - 00:23:54.770, Speaker E: Why put the effort into creating the bridge for Girly East rather than putting the effort that you spent on that on, hey guys, we should all be deploying to Zapolia right now. Gurley is kind of broken for us. We did a public deprecation as people who are running Gurley nodes back around DevCon and so this launched well after that, after Gurley was already deprecated. It seems like if the real motivation for doing this is like trying to create a permissionless system, trying to get everybody on board, it's getting the right test, the right people that saying, hey, let's move over to Sepolia, and helping them would have been a more collaborative.
00:23:54.850 - 00:24:01.986, Speaker A: And the real motivation was fixing a problem that was broken. Developers are on Gurley, but you're fixing.
00:24:02.018 - 00:24:03.914, Speaker E: A problem on a deprecated thing that's great.
00:24:03.952 - 00:24:26.826, Speaker A: In a year, maybe it won't be a problem. Right. It's a problem now. I don't disagree with you that there should also be a movement of like move to Sepolia, like great, everybody can encourage that. But there is a problem on Gurley now and developing now. So we can either say, hey, don't do this, or we can say, like, here's a way to make it easy. And yes, this is being deprecated, but everybody should start migrating when they migrate.
00:24:26.826 - 00:24:35.474, Speaker A: But people have applications that are going to mainnet in a week, in two weeks and three weeks, and they don't want to migrate everything to finish up their testing before they move to finish up their test.

00:26:43.970 - 00:27:01.122, Speaker C: Question for you do you feel that once you put a price on the Girl at ETH that you got the result that you wanted? Do you feel like the experiment was successful or do you feel like there are certain things that were bad side effects that in retrospect you would have done something different?
00:27:01.256 - 00:27:28.634, Speaker A: My expectation was that it would open, it would be driven to literally zero. Like we burned our LP, we put everything else, we're going directly back into the Girly pool. Like to put in perspective the Girly faucets prior to this were emitting 0.2 girly per day. There is currently 1.1 million Girly available in the pools that weren't available to devs prior. That's the equivalent of 15,000 years of Girly available for devs to go and buy the number of devs who have hit of us and said thank you.
00:27:28.634 - 00:27:58.982, Speaker A: This is like infinitely go. Look at the Twitter comments of actual application developers, it is significantly easier now for anybody who's testing or deploying on Gurley to do that. And that was the goal. So, yes, successful. What I thought would happen is the price would be some sub fraction of a cent, as everybody who had a ton of gurley would just dump it because it's deprecated. And why are you hoarding it? Why is anybody holding it? Why does anybody care? Just make it open and super easy for people to have and the testnet will be dead in some fixed period of time. So that didn't happen very much.
00:27:58.982 - 00:28:04.680, Speaker A: Not what I expected. But did it have the end result of making Girly more available to developers? Absolutely.
00:28:05.050 - 00:28:43.810, Speaker D: Do you find adding speculation, though, being an end result? Because I personally got spammed, MP got spammed, we all got attacked and basically being told, one we're hoarding, which we weren't. If you look at what we've been doing hold up. And how many people, after I posted this tweet that we're going live today, literally said, I'm scooping up Girly Eats so that I can go and speculate on this? Because that's the point. When you create a market, you then disingenuous why? We have a testnet which is free access to a network. And I'm sorry, the block space argument is a bit loaded. Like, this is a testnet. It's a testnet.
00:28:43.810 - 00:29:24.900, Speaker D: For five years, we have not had this problem. For five years, we have had cyclical up and downs. Unfortunately, a year and a half fortunately, a year and a half ago, we had a two X to three X in developers that came in, which made this incredible became a much bigger problem. We've been talking about the repos, the ethereum GitHub repos and the PM repos and the testnets repos, where you could have contributed to try and actually help us. Instead, we have a speculative market. We have price action put to this. We have people speculating on this token now and who are actively telling us on Twitter they're speculating on this token, which I'm sure there are a lot of developers that have grabbed, I saw you say like 200 contracts deployed or something like that as of yesterday, or something like that since.
00:29:24.900 - 00:29:48.518, Speaker D: Great. But we are still putting price action. I still have ETH Global calling me and saying, hey, my developers don't want to go and buy Girly ETH. Can you go and dump us? And I go and dump them like 10,000 tokens. So the hackathon, they have it, which is what's always been going on, it's like there's resources available. You go to the PM repos, there's discussions about how we can try and solve this.
00:29:48.604 - 00:30:09.822, Speaker A: But a permissionless structure doesn't exclude people from giving it away for free. We would be more than happy to donate 50,000, $100,000 to somebody who's well resourced to vetting giving out grants to disenfranchised developers. Let Gitcoin do that. Let people donate. Like, I'm not for keeping developers who don't have the ability to pay whatever it is.
00:30:09.876 - 00:30:25.170, Speaker D: No, but that's not the problem. The problem is now there's such a large vast of Girly ETH that has a price on it and the circulation circling. People don't know what to do. People actually don't know about tax liability. Genuinely concerned. It's a genuine concern.
00:30:26.230 - 00:30:33.590, Speaker A: Again, you will never convince me that a permission system is better than a permissionless system like, you just won't. That's not an argument I will ever.
00:30:33.660 - 00:30:34.998, Speaker D: How is Girly permission, though?
00:30:35.084 - 00:30:43.834, Speaker A: Permission? Because you and a couple of few people had a ton of Girly ETH and it was your job to fill up certain faucets and make the faucets docks because they were getting bought in and give it out to people.
00:30:43.872 - 00:30:49.334, Speaker D: It's your position dumped over like, 20 million months and we've been broken.
00:30:49.462 - 00:31:05.418, Speaker A: It wasn't enough. I'm not saying you weren't doing it. I'm saying people had to go to you. That shouldn't be the case. Nobody needs to go to somebody in the Ethereum construct to get ETH on Ethereum. You should not be arguing against permissionless structures ever. Permissionless will always be better than permission, period.
00:31:05.418 - 00:31:18.770, Speaker A: And I'm not saying you didn't have the best of intentions, but it was entirely a permission construct. I had to go on Twitter and beg people to give me Girlies. I had to find the right developer who had the girlies and say, okay, you were given it in the pre mine, or you were given it as this spun up.
00:31:18.920 - 00:31:23.030, Speaker D: Welcome to 2018. 2017. This is what we've been doing for Rinkby Robson.
00:31:24.010 - 00:31:37.030, Speaker A: And again, now, back then, how many smart contracts were there? They're actually live in production. Like? Yes. DFI Summer happened. NFTs happened. There are a lot more developers now, which is something we should embrace. That's a good thing. But it means there needs to be a different construct for how this gets distributed.
00:31:37.030 - 00:31:48.302, Speaker A: Not every artist who's spinning up an NFT and wants to test something on testnet and make sure they don't bork things knows everybody in the East Foundation to go to and hit up and be like, hey, I heard you have girly. Can you give it to me?
00:31:48.436 - 00:32:36.240, Speaker C: Okay, so let's do this. So, Ryan, you very clearly articulated the problems with trying to get this scarce resource that developers want to use. So, Greg and Matt, since you don't think it's a good idea to have a price on these things, which, by the way, know at least in other blockchain communities, a perfectly legitimate way to run a testnet, obviously, people probably know about Kusama, which is a testnet for polkadot, and there is a price on Kusama tokens. So, Greg, Matt, since you guys are opposed to this notion, how would you kind of solve this problem while at the same know, furthering Ethereum's values around easy access to developers, like in developing countries or whatever?
00:32:37.410 - 00:33:14.390, Speaker E: I think this is something that we're just still discussing on the right solution. And we need people like you who have a lot of developers that you're working with, who are on the ground, interacting with developers, seeing these types of problems and have your voice in the conversation about how to solve the problem at the protocol level. Ultimately, a testnet is going to be a permission thing unless we use proof of work. But there is still the permission aspect of creating a genesis. And when you create a genesis, you almost always create a genesis allocation with some ETH. And we just need to figure out a better way of doing these things. I think that putting a value on testnet ETH is a dangerous thing for a lot of reasons.
00:33:14.390 - 00:33:46.466, Speaker E: We can't stop anyone from doing it again. I think it's hilarious. It's going to make my taxes so much harder to do. This year I'm teaching a class at Cu Boulder and at the beginning of it, I sent him all one girly. And now I'm like, Fuck, what am I supposed to do? Do I tell them they all have to file taxes now because they took this? So like, it's funny, but it's going to make things much more difficult. And I want to find a way where testnets don't have value because I'm very much against testnets having value in general. The reason I'm against this is because once testnets start to have value, they start to lose the functionality of being a testnet.
00:33:46.466 - 00:34:13.406, Speaker E: I think the ultimate thing is that we want to do things on testnets that we're not ready to do on main yet. So this is me speaking as a core developer. I want to be able to upgrade Girly. I want to be able to update Sepolia and be pretty confident that the changes that we're doing are correct and they're going to work, but they might not. And fortunately, we've been fortunate that we haven't had any kinds of crazy types of rollbacks. But I think this is my problem with Kusama and the Gnosis chain things that are saying that we're Canary Networks. We're going to do things first.
00:34:13.406 - 00:34:47.190, Speaker E: Once there's enough value in the system, people are like, wait a minute, we don't want to be the first one to do it right? Like, let's spin up another thing so they can be the first thing, something that doesn't have any value. And so then it defeats the purpose of being a testnet in the first place. And so maybe Gurley ends up being like a valuable thing. That's a very real possibility and we have to just create more testnets that don't have value. But I think that that's like an unsolved problem. It's like how to do testnets in the right way, where it works with developers. And I'd love more engagement from people who are having these problems because I work at the Ethereum Foundation when I need Girlies, I asked him Beat Baco and he sends me girlies and I'm like, what's the problem? There's so much girlies around.
00:34:47.190 - 00:35:02.238, Speaker E: And then I talk to developers and they're like, oh, this is really difficult to get girlies. So we need more engagement there. I haven't seen a lot of people engage and I think that having more testnets is like a good solution because I do think you're right. I think that testnets have some value but want to dilute it so much where it's like so little that no.
00:35:02.244 - 00:35:07.438, Speaker A: One cares for what it's worth. Completely supportive of that, like 100%.
00:35:07.604 - 00:35:31.880, Speaker D: How about I talk about what we're doing now to try and move forward from here because I think that's Matt covered pretty much most of the points I wanted to talk about right now. Gurley is slated for end of life q three, q four. You're using it. Get off. You're going to lose all your value and your state that's there. It's not worth it. We're moving to Sepolio as of two days ago because I thought people were actually deployed on it.
00:35:31.880 - 00:36:03.762, Speaker D: We've started to migrate everybody. We have people like Chainlink. The graph alchemy chainstack. They're fully live and running right now on Sepolia. Ave Maker and a couple others pulled together are starting to deploy and get going. We should see everybody in the next week to two weeks fully deployed so you can have your composability right now. The big question is what do we do about actually getting ether into the right hands? That's a really good one.
00:36:03.762 - 00:36:25.794, Speaker D: MP starting a so MP Maria Paula, who has been taking the most amount of heat. We love you. You're okay? She's dumped on the layer zero bridge and has amassed enough money to give out grants for people who want to look into faucet design and equitable ways to actually distribute ETH.
00:36:25.922 - 00:36:41.686, Speaker C: Well, I was going to also ask because I think this is it called Holley testnet that's going to be launched later this year, is going to try to address some of those issues. So can some of you talk about the way that that's being designed and throw in other suggestions?
00:36:41.798 - 00:37:23.930, Speaker A: Yeah, I talk about it a little bit because I spoke to Tim a bit on this. It really solves the problem of bootstrapping the network with a premine. And the idea behind it was take everybody who's deployed a contract on the last series of testnets and on main net, take all of those addresses and basically give them testnet ETH. Like that's how you bootstrap the pre mine. Right? So all of them get testnet ETH, which is everybody who's like a verifiable developer. So who you need to catch up from that point are strictly new developers coming in the ecosystem and that's who you need to figure out how to get to rather than here's all the testnet ETH to ten people, please get it to the developers, give it to everybody who's deployed a contract and then they do it. Now, I do think this solves like this is a nice warm start to solving part of that problem.
00:37:23.930 - 00:37:34.000, Speaker A: I do think it will help, I think with longevity of that testnet you will start to run into the same problem over time. But it's significantly better than what we've had over the last couple of series of them.
00:37:34.690 - 00:37:44.266, Speaker D: It's specifically here to replace Gurley so as kind of like the next Staking main chain to use for Staking providers and stuff to test out their systems.
00:37:44.458 - 00:38:18.006, Speaker E: Yeah, this is something we didn't touch on. I mean, you touched on it a little bit, but I just wanted to say that there's like two main types of testnets. The first one is like the permissionless validator sets, which if you think about the testnets before we had the merge, this was like proof of work testnets. Anybody can contribute proof of work at any time and by contributing proof of work you could get validation mining rewards, essentially. And so this was our permissionless testnet and then we also had permission testnets. The permission testnets have always been focused on being stable and robust for application developers. And so Gurley was one of the first really big application developer focused testnet that ran the click protocol.
00:38:18.006 - 00:38:55.042, Speaker E: There were some problems with the click protocol. We occasionally had locks in the click protocol. Now that we've moved into the merge and we have this beacon chain, this proof of stake protocol, we still have these two types of protocols, permissioned and permissionless. But for the permission protocols we have a validator set that's fixed with known entities. People who are running like a handful of validators who are known. We have a Telegram group with them, we can make sure that they're very good uptime so that application developers never have to worry about huge reorgs, never have to worry about the network shutting down. And then we have permissionless testnets, maybe put that in air quotes because there's still like these huge crazy unequal distributions of tokens at the beginning.
00:38:55.042 - 00:39:23.570, Speaker E: So it's not like truly permissionless. People who start the testnet have a lot of these tokens. But the Guerrilli has moved from a permission click testnet to a permission list testnet. And the permissionless testnets are the places where we want people to practice their Staking setups. Anything that has to do with running their own validators, that's where they should be doing things. And on the permission testnets, we want to have people who are building applications there because that's where we are very confident that it's going to be very robust. It's always going to be up and it's always going to be available for them to submit transactions.
00:39:24.550 - 00:39:52.234, Speaker C: So to go back to the values question, because Ethereum does really put a focus on making things accessible. Some of what you mentioned, okay, they seem like somewhat small initiatives, in my opinion at least to addressing that. But I don't know if any of you have bigger ideas around how to get more of this testnet ETH into the hands of more kind of underprivileged people.
00:39:52.432 - 00:40:08.350, Speaker E: I mean, I think one thing that I thought of while we were talking is that if the goal is having a permission and list mechanism to access testnet ether, I would rather see people submit proofs of work on chain to a smart contract that's imbued with a huge amount of value at the beginning than creating a valuable market.
00:40:08.420 - 00:40:11.758, Speaker A: There have been proof of work faucets so like this definitely happens for sure.
00:40:11.924 - 00:40:43.018, Speaker E: There'S proof of work faucets but I would rather see it as a smart contract completely permissionless. In that sense don't need to send messages to people to get testnet ETH. I think know Greg we talked a little bit about this. We could have a split contract that the validators of the set just say I'm going to send all of my validation rewards to the faucets. I think these are all good ideas, but I do really think I would much rather focus on other alternatives to permissionless, access to Tesna ETH than creating a valuable market. Because this just makes it difficult, in my opinion, for a lot of people to figure out, am I going to interact with this chain now that I probably have a tax event?
00:40:43.184 - 00:41:21.346, Speaker D: So basically to boot, like how we're trying to do the initial bootstrap of some of the Sepolia ETH is basically every team that starts as they start redeploying, we're going to just be giving them because most of them have foundations, grants, programs, whatever. They're all going to be getting it to try and distribute it to the teams building on them, so we can try and create a natural tree of distribution. And looking into things like Matt. Said like xerox splits where effectively we can constantly just dump it at everybody everybody because it even splits out and goes through so that we can try and get in the right hands of people so they don't have to pay know? Like problem matt said we've talked about earlier.
00:41:21.538 - 00:41:32.234, Speaker C: Okay last question to close out the panel and it's directed to Brian. Brian, if this becomes an issue on a future testnet, is layer zero going to do the same thing?
00:41:32.432 - 00:42:02.402, Speaker A: Yeah. Again. So it depends on how easy it is to get testnet ETH, right. Like, at the end of the day, if my options are do proof of work, submit to this faucet, get a tiny drip or do that, or pay like three one hundreds of a penny to get the ETH that I need to do it, I or other devs should have the options to do that. They're not mutually exclusive. You can have the ability to have these structures that people who cannot afford the X cents X dollars to do it to be able to do it right. There's a trade off of time.
00:42:02.402 - 00:42:26.602, Speaker A: I don't necessarily want to spend a huge amount of time trying to get the ETH that I need to build stargate pools like test. If stargate is going to break or function on a new feature, there's just like, things that you need to do with certain functions. And so I would gladly pay. This is again what most people did via OTC markets on Girly ETH. And again, I want to be clear. Like girly ETH had value before. There were separate markets that people participated in to buy this for this exact problem.
00:42:26.602 - 00:42:38.990, Speaker A: The trade off is time versus value. And the goal is drive the value to as near zero as humanly possible. But again, it can never be free because the block space is limited.
00:42:39.730 - 00:42:41.854, Speaker C: Go ahead. Because you said that before.
00:42:41.892 - 00:42:42.474, Speaker A: Go ahead, Greg.
00:42:42.522 - 00:42:44.110, Speaker C: You looked like you wanted to respond.
00:42:45.570 - 00:42:49.522, Speaker D: Okay, again, it's a testnet. We're dealing with testnet block space.
00:42:49.576 - 00:42:50.354, Speaker A: It's a public good.
00:42:50.392 - 00:43:12.442, Speaker D: The reason it exists is because we are bootstrapping it for people to use. There are people, like infuria Alchemy who probably spend like hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to just keep this thing up and running so that it's free for people to right. So that block space prom is not going to be a problem as long as you have massive node providers bootstrapping this thing.
00:43:12.576 - 00:43:21.500, Speaker A: But it is no argument with the demand. Like, there is literally blocks being filled up on Gurley, not because of speculators, but because of application developers ready application.
00:43:22.990 - 00:43:27.934, Speaker D: Drops it right back down after because the base fee goes up. No, I'm sorry, but yes.
00:43:27.972 - 00:43:30.142, Speaker A: It just gets more expensive. It doesn't solve the problem.
00:43:30.196 - 00:43:34.442, Speaker D: There's still and the testnet ETH will get more expensive.
00:43:34.586 - 00:43:35.486, Speaker C: Okay, you know what?
00:43:35.508 - 00:43:36.774, Speaker A: You got testnet ETH.
00:43:36.842 - 00:43:53.650, Speaker C: I think it's like a typical debate. Nobody changed their minds, so we're just going to have to call it here. This was a fascinating discussion. I have a feeling we might see an issue like this again in the future. Just my opinion. But thank you for attending and thanks for giving your thoughts.
00:43:53.730 - 00:43:55.174, Speaker E: Can I say one last thing?
00:43:55.292 - 00:43:56.520, Speaker C: Oh, sure.
00:43:57.290 - 00:44:03.020, Speaker E: Not financial advice. Make your own decisions. But withdrawals activate on Gurley very soon.
00:44:03.390 - 00:44:04.300, Speaker D: Two weeks.
00:44:05.310 - 00:44:09.274, Speaker A: Ideal outcome. Price near zero. Accessible to everybody.
00:44:09.472 - 00:44:13.382, Speaker E: I have 180,000 girly Ethan validators I will be dumping into the pool.
00:44:13.446 - 00:44:39.850, Speaker A: For what it's worth, we've already committed. But every dollar from the pools we burned our initial LP, but all the additional LP, we've added everything. Every dollar that is generated from that, we've already said we're granting to ethereum development. So anything that is generated from this will go directly back to grants on ethereum anyways, which is what I think the nature of the change should be. I do think people should have access to those things, but I think the end result should be going to grants and going to furthering the ecosystem with developers.
00:44:40.030 - 00:44:44.806, Speaker C: Okay, it looks like everybody agrees on one thing. That's a good way to end.
00:44:44.988 - 00:44:46.006, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:44:46.188 - 00:44:57.640, Speaker D: And just a special shout out to Laura and Brian. They flew in literally just for this and we managed to make this happen last minute. So just a round of applause for them making the time.
00:45:00.770 - 00:45:02.510, Speaker A: Thank you, Laura, for hosting.
00:45:03.090 - 00:45:23.530, Speaker D: Thank you, guys. That was the spiciest panel of the day, maybe of the weekend.
