00:00:00.410 - 00:00:58.460, Speaker A: Personally, I come from the point of view of somebody who entered the space because of Bitcoin, because of the promise of decentralization, of self sovereign money, of trustlessness. Venture capital firms don't and they can't share those same interests because those interests are not necessarily profitable. They're not billion dollar company. Unicorn startup idea is right, you can't build a unicorn company and have it be completely trustless because then you have no real solid way to make money and to change your product with the times and to keep up with things. So I don't think that VC investments when it comes to blockchain tech are compatible with a lot of the principles that Bitcoiners in general come into the space for. So with that being said, they could be doing a lot better. They could be doing a lot better to actually prove that they're interested in decentralization like.
