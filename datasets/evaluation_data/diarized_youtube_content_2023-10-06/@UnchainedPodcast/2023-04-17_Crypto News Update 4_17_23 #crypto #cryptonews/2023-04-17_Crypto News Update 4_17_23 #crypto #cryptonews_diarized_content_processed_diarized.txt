00:00:00.250 - 00:00:55.530, Speaker A: The US House Committee has published a 73 page stablecoin draft bill, which calls for a moratorium on stablecoin backed by other crypto assets. The Bipartisan bill, which has reportedly been circulating among lawmakers since last fall, was made public on the House committee's hearing page for the first time on Saturday. The House Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the role of stablecoins in payments and the need for appropriate legislation. The bill proposes a two ban on endogenously collateralized stablecoins, referring to those that are backed by other cryptocurrencies as opposed to fiat currency. The treasury would look into the nature of stablecoin reserves, aspects of decentralization in the issuing protocol's, government structure, and the type of algorithms employed by them. The bill's language led to a considerable amount of confusion and debate within the crypto community as to whether the ban was limited to algorithmic stablecoins like the first version of UST. Or implied that all decentralized stablecoins would be considered illegal.
