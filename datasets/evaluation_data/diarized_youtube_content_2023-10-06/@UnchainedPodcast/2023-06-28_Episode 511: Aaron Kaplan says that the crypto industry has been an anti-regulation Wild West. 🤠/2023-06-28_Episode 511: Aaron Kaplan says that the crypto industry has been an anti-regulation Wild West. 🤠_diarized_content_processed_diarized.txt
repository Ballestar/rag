00:00:00.330 - 00:00:59.050, Speaker A: It's interesting how you attack us for choosing the harder route to achieve compliance by actually getting the proper licenses when the shoot first, aim later culture that happened led to billions of dollars of public losses. Essentially, you your company paradigm has supported some of the entities that were basically so anti regulation that promoted the biggest, biggest violations, the biggest frauds in American history. And essentially, instead of reassessing your thesis that maybe regulation should apply because it's the best way to protect the investing public, you double down and saying that regulation doesn't apply and basically are arguing for new legislation which is going to take how long to pass, let's say a year or two. And then how long to implement a few more years, then how long to get it right. And in the meantime, the entities that have essentially violated the law, that have essentially put their customers at risk and essentially victimized their customers, continue to continue to operate. I don't understand what's happening overall is a transition away from the crypto financial services, the wild west ecosystem, to one regulated under the securities laws. It's actually good for the industry.
