00:00:00.730 - 00:00:54.826, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Just wanted to state two quick clarifications about recent shows in this past Tuesday's show with Rom, Alawalia and Sam Andrew about all things Genesis and DCG. Sam and I stated that a loan to Three Arrows Capital accounted for 47% of Genesis's loan book. This was technically true as of June 30, but not true when the loan was originated. Rom explained that the figure was like that high because as Genesis began to call in loans, the good loans got called back, but then the bad loans remained, taking up a huge portion of the loan book. Second in the episode the Tuesday before that with Michael Jordan and Alex Pack, michael said that there was a tweet from Dokwon confirming that the Luna Foundation Guard's selling of UST in a curve pull to purchase bitcoin set off the DPEG. However, I talked to Doe and this was a misinterpretation of his tweet.
00:00:54.826 - 00:01:33.562, Speaker A: He says that the UST sold to buy bitcoin didn't come from a curve pull, but instead from the Luna Foundation Guard's own holdings and actually significantly predated the withdrawal of liquidity from that UST curve pool. Hope that that clarifies things. And now onto the show. Hey, everyone, just a quick note before we begin. Unchained is doing its annual survey head to surveymonkey.com.

00:02:31.462 - 00:02:35.120, Speaker B: Welcome, V. Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:02:35.650 - 00:03:10.460, Speaker A: After the collapse of FTX and the revelation that customer funds were allegedly lent to sister trading firm Alameda and then Lost, founder and former CEO Sam Binkman Fried has been in the hot seat. There are at least six investigations into what happened, with the latest of these being that the Manhattan Prosecutor's office is looking into whether he manipulated the market for Terra and Luna. Can we just do kind of a quick overview of all of these different investigations? And actually, now that I think I think it might even be seven, do you want to just go over which ones are the most important and why.
00:03:10.830 - 00:04:17.322, Speaker B: Yeah, so since you just mentioned this potential like market manipulation with respect to the Terra Luna incident earlier this year, why don't we just cover that real quick? Because I think that one is actually really interesting. I think the article that reported this did not say when this investigation started. I suspect that this has probably been going on for a while simply because the collapse of Terra Luna happened back in April. So the theory that they're allegedly pursuing here is a really interesting one. Right? It's something that you do see from time to time, this idea that it's illegal to engage in trading to artificially increase or decrease the price of some asset, whether it's like a security or a commodity or something like that. So the idea is that instead of reflecting the market based forces of supply and demand, you're tricking other market participants into buying and selling something at an artificial price. So that's fraud, right? And it can be a crime.
00:04:17.322 - 00:05:10.634, Speaker B: So typically when market manipulation is charged, it involves the manipulation of like a security or a commodity, like I said. Right, so there's criminal statutes on commodities fraud, there's a criminal statute on securities fraud. And then of course, these things are often also charged under wire fraud. When it comes to crypto assets, though, I wonder if in this case it involved market manipulation of Terra. So I wonder if in this case they'll run into the same issue that they had in the two cases, the federal prosecutors, that is, the two cases that they brought earlier this year involving the OpenSea employee and the Coinbase employee and the brother and it was the cousin where they charged, quote unquote, insider trading. But didn't allege the involvement of any security or commodity or anything like that. So it was just charged under wire fraud.
00:05:10.634 - 00:06:27.682, Speaker B: So I was looking at some cases involving market manipulation and the only one I was able to find that only charged wire fraud without like a securities fraud charge or a commodities fraud charge involved. I don't know if you remember this, but from a few years back, some Deutsche Bank traders were charged with manipulating the libor rate and they were convicted in that. So that was just charged under wire fraud because the libor rate is not a security or a commodity. But in that case, what's interesting is that the convictions were later thrown out because the judge said that it's basically not possible to manipulate the libor rate because there's no natural market rate for libor in the way that there is for an equity or a commodity future or something like that. So I don't know that that would be an issue here because I think most crypto assets do have a prevailing market price that's determined by natural forces of supply and demand. But it's just something to be aware, know, like how have they brought these market manipulation charges in the past and how could it apply here and then that's the criminal part. So on the SEC and the CFTC side, there are also provisions that prohibit market manipulation.
00:06:27.682 - 00:06:51.920, Speaker B: And it's the same exact idea pretty much. It's just that it does have to involve a security or a commodity. And I think if the SEC was investigating this too and ended up charging it, they would do the same thing that they know that they would have to do in the insider trading cases in the OpenSea and Coinbase. Incidents where they would allege that Terra Luna is a security and that they tried to manipulate the price of it in order to.
00:06:54.130 - 00:07:00.258, Speaker A: Don'T. I don't remember. But OpenSea, I remember that that was charged as insider trading, but it was by the SEC.
00:07:00.424 - 00:07:33.280, Speaker B: Yeah. So in the OpenSea case, the SEC did not bring a parallel case. I'm not sure why, but I think it's know they've never actually brought a case asserting that NFTs were securities, whereas they obviously have brought cases asserting that tokens are securities. Right. And so they did bring a parallel case in the Coinbase insider trading case because that involved tokens. My guess is that in the OpenSea case, it's just less of a settled issue for them whether NFTs are securities or not.
00:07:33.650 - 00:07:48.994, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And one other thing. Just earlier you said Terra Luna happened in April. It was May. But then besides that, there's also a Department of justice investigation. Can you talk about that? Because that's probably going to be criminal as well.
00:07:49.032 - 00:08:08.422, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So you can bring a criminal charge for market manipulation. Right. And so a lot of times these cases involve something called like spoofing, which is when you place a bunch of orders that you never actually intend to fill in order to drive the price up or down.
00:08:08.556 - 00:08:15.850, Speaker A: Right, yeah. But I'm not talking about the Terra Luna potential market manipulation anymore. I'm just talking about the investigation to FDX.
00:08:16.350 - 00:09:03.340, Speaker B: Oh, okay. You want to talk about FTX, the recent events. Yeah. So the recent you know, I think people have a lot of questions about how the process has played out so far and how it's likely going to play out in the coming weeks. And, you know, we know that the DOJ and the SEC and possibly other regulators or other criminal authorities are investigating and we're still learning the facts. And Sam has obviously been speaking out publicly. But I think right now I feel pretty comfortable saying that enough facts have come to light to suggest that there probably was fraud committed and at the very least the misuse or misappropriation of customer.
00:09:03.340 - 00:09:39.174, Speaker B: You know, Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda herself, the Wall Street Journal reported that she told her employees in a video call right. That she, Sam and other executives at FTX were aware that customer funds were being moved to question is, I think a question a lot of people have, including me, are like, why hasn't he been arrested? And will he be arrested? Will others be arrested? And what's taking so long? And what's he doing going on all these podcasts and Twitter spaces and doing all of these interviews? What's up with that?
00:09:39.292 - 00:09:44.006, Speaker A: Yeah, well, can you answer those questions? Like, why hasn't he been so I.
00:09:44.028 - 00:10:48.554, Speaker B: Know he just retained an attorney recently. I don't know if he had legal representation when he was going out and doing all of these interviews. I find it hard to believe that if he did have a lawyer that the lawyer would not have strongly advised him against doing that. It's certainly very unconventional for someone who is being investigated for potential crimes to be speaking out as much as he has, but I think he's trying to shape the narrative and preempt what potential criminal or other charges might be coming down the line. Right, yeah. So I think he's trying to sort of paint this narrative that this was about mistakes or the fact that he wasn't paying close enough attention to what was going on, or maybe taking on a little bit too much risk. Or I think at other times he suggested that this was all due to a downturn in the market that he had no control over, or like a bank run, which he also had no control over.
00:10:48.554 - 00:10:57.770, Speaker B: So I think he's suggesting that it's all of these other things other than just outright fraud and misuse of customer funds.
00:10:57.930 - 00:11:04.400, Speaker A: People are calling this the bad businessman strategy and saying it's not a crime to be a bad business person.
00:11:05.010 - 00:11:05.422, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:05.476 - 00:11:33.334, Speaker A: So we're going to talk about his selection of lawyer in a moment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

So one thing that you mentioned quickly was that he hired Mark Cohen, who was the lawyer for Ghislaine Maxwell, who was affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein. And I wondered what that said to you about what kind of defense he's likely to undertake, that selection of lawyer.
00:12:01.518 - 00:12:29.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, Mark Cohen is a seasoned criminal lawyer. He's done criminal trials, he's done civil trials, he's worked on cases involving securities fraud, he's taken cases to a verdict, including Acquittals. And so, I mean, it makes sense that he would choose someone like that as opposed to, I think for a little bit there, he was represented by some Stanford law professors. Yeah.
00:12:29.872 - 00:12:32.414, Speaker A: David Mills, who I think is still advising him.
00:12:32.452 - 00:12:55.300, Speaker B: But anyway yeah, that's, you know, if you're facing potential criminal charges in the Southern District of New York, no less, like, you want an actual criminal lawyer who has experience trying federal criminal cases. And white collar know, to me, it signals that he wants someone who is able to do that. If it does come to that.
00:12:55.750 - 00:13:02.760, Speaker A: I was curious because he said he's down to $100,000 in one bank account, so I was curious how much a lawyer like that would cost.
00:13:05.610 - 00:13:38.386, Speaker B: Probably a lot more than that, depending on how the investigation proceeds and whether he is eventually charged and whether he decides to go to trial or not. Obviously, if he decides to go to trial, that's going to be a long process, and it's going to involve a lot of work, and that would result in a lot more expenses. But if he's planning to negotiate a plea, then this could be resolved more quickly. Right. So I think it really depends on how this all plays out and the route that he wants to take.
00:13:38.568 - 00:13:46.706, Speaker A: And earlier you mentioned how everybody's wondering why he hasn't already been arrested. So why yeah, so so I think.
00:13:46.728 - 00:14:36.434, Speaker B: It'S important to kind of take a step back. I know there's a lot happening and just to sort of go through how these criminal investigations and if there's an SEC enforcement matter going on, how they typically work, just so people have a realistic idea of how things are likely to play out. So on the criminal side, this is very basic, but in order to arrest someone in a situation like this, you need an arrest warrant, right? So you can get that through either an indictment returned by a grand jury or a criminal complaint. But either of those have to be based on probable cause. And if the person is overseas in a country like the Bahamas, which the US. Does have an extradition treaty with, the DOJ would then work with the Office of International Affairs to have the person extradited. And so if the person submits to being extradited, then the process should be pretty quick.
00:14:36.434 - 00:15:12.382, Speaker B: Like, you'll be back in the US. Pretty soon, but some countries allow you to challenge your extradition. Right? So, like, Julian Assange, for instance, challenged his extradition, and that took a long time to play out. So that could prolong the process. I don't know what the process is in the Bahamas for someone to challenge an extradition request, but if Sam avails himself of that, that could prolong the process. So the DOJ is either in the process of investigating the facts in order to establish probable cause to get an arrest warrant here, or it's possible that they've already obtained one. Like, we don't know, right.
00:15:12.382 - 00:15:47.482, Speaker B: If they had an arrest warrant and are actively working towards extradition, that wouldn't necessarily be public. Right. Arrest warrants are typically kept under seal for obvious reasons. Like, if the person you're planning to arrest gets wind of it, then they could be a flight risk. So it's totally possible also that they already have an arrest warrant and are just working on that and that's not public. But assuming that they're still investigating, that can take a lot of time, right? Like they have to get search warrants to get access to documents and data. Potentially they have to sift through all of the documents and data they might want to interview, right.
00:15:47.482 - 00:17:02.094, Speaker B: All of this stuff is really complicated. In addition, when a lot of this stuff is located overseas, hopefully they're getting access to what they need because the criminal authorities in the Bahamas are willing to cooperate. And then of course, FTX has a new CEO and lawyers and they're presumably cooperating and doing what they need to preserve documents and turnover evidence to the government and things like that. I do think one potential wrinkle here, though, is that the government is probably also investigating the role that government officials in the Bahamas may have played in all of so, you know, there were reports, right, that after the accounts were frozen and no one could withdraw their money. There were reports that some of the accounts belonging to officials in the Bahamas and their family members they were allowed to withdraw their money when everyone else's accounts were frozen. And then of course, that happened the same week after the accounts were frozen. And I think there are still questions there about whether some of that money was transferred to government accounts in the Bahamas or whether they directed some of that or were somehow involved.
00:17:02.094 - 00:18:15.082, Speaker B: Right. So to the extent that the US is also investigating potential involvement by any government officials there, that could also complicate the cooperation between the two countries and that could also prolong things, right? And then with criminal investigations like this, there's always the possibility that there are people who are cooperating. Caroline Ellison was reportedly spotted in New York City recently, and it's also been reported that she's hired the law firm Wilmer Hale, which, as a lot of people know, they have, like, a star roster of former federal prosecutors, including the former SBNY US. Attorney. Barara yes, exactly. Pre so, you know cooperating witnesses, if that's something that's happening here cooperating witnesses can speed up an investigation, right. If they're providing evidence that can be corroborated, that could really help the federal prosecutors here establish probable cause that they need to get the arrest of Sam or potentially so, you know, I don't think it's rocket science here that there are probably individuals involved that have an incentive to cooperate sooner rather than later.
00:18:15.082 - 00:19:11.114, Speaker B: So that can also affect the timing of the investigation and when an arrest could you know, I know people have been like Bernie Madoff's situation and I think he was arrested within like a week or something of his crimes coming to light. But I would just caution that situation was really different because, know, he basically confessed his crimes to his sons, and then they called the FBI, who showed up at his house soon after that, and he basically admitted to all of it. Right. And this all happened over the course of, like, a week. So that's obviously not the situation here, which is why it's probably just going to take longer. Sam hasn't openly admitted to criminal conduct. And in fact, like we were saying earlier, he's been pushing a very different narrative of, just know, maybe he made mistakes or wasn't paying attention or just made bad business decisions or something.
00:19:11.114 - 00:19:22.702, Speaker B: Right. Like everything but criminal fraud. And so I think it's just for that reason, too. It's very different than something like Madoff, where you did see an arrest right away. I think this is going to take more time. Yeah.
00:19:22.756 - 00:20:00.838, Speaker A: And just to understand, earlier, when you were saying that there might already be an arrest warrant and leaving this situation with the Bahamian government aside, since so many journalists are going and meeting Sam right now and even setting up film crews in either his apartment or some of the other FTX apartments and interviewing him and all that. It's very easy to or not know. There's security at the place where he lives. But I'm just trying to say that it seems like maybe it's these other factors, not that they haven't tried or something. It's like they're probably waiting for various reasons.
00:20:01.014 - 00:20:05.798, Speaker B: Yeah. You're saying, like, in the case that they actually do have an arrest warrant.
00:20:05.974 - 00:20:12.398, Speaker A: Yeah. I wouldn't imagine that. It's actually hard, considering all the other people that are going to meet him in person.
00:20:12.564 - 00:20:35.398, Speaker B: So there is the extradition process that they would have to undergo. Right. They have to work through that process. I don't think that the FBI could just show up in the Bahamas. They would have to work with the government, law enforcement in the Bahamas to get him extradited, and then when he's here, that process would take over.
00:20:35.564 - 00:21:19.942, Speaker A: Okay. And then I wanted to ask when you mentioned that most likely there will be some kind of fraud charge, obviously the word fraud has been thrown around a lot, just kind of in, I think, a non legal way. But I imagine that in a legal way, there would need to be a certain bar for evidence. And like, for instance, I just think when you're a journalist, sometimes, whether or not you use the word lie to describe what somebody, a statement somebody has made, it kind of requires having a sense of their intention or being in their brain. And so it can be a little bit difficult. And I imagine that that's a similar case here. I don't know.
00:21:19.942 - 00:21:27.554, Speaker A: But can you just explain to me sort of what the legal bar would need to be for fraud to be proven? Yeah.
00:21:27.612 - 00:22:28.726, Speaker B: So if the federal prosecutors bring a criminal fraud charge here would likely be brought under the wire fraud statute, which is very broad. It can cover all kinds of fraud, which involves things like stealing customer funds and lying to customers about what's happening with their funds and lying to investors about how the money that they're investing is going to be used, right? So something like that could be brought under a wire fraud charge. It's pretty broad. And fraud people use it, like you said, in the colloquial sense. But actually when it's used in a criminal context, it's pretty straightforward. It's like what an average person would consider fraud. And so if it turns out that customer funds here were misappropriated in light especially of the terms of use that prohibited the customer funds from being used that way, I mean, that's just outright deception.
00:22:28.726 - 00:22:46.210, Speaker B: That's fraud, right? You're telling customers that you're not going to use their money for any purpose like that, and then you take the money in order to plug in holes and cover up losses in your affiliated hedge fund. That's going to qualify as criminal wire fraud.
00:22:46.630 - 00:23:10.106, Speaker A: Got it. And then, as you said earlier, this really could go anywhere in terms of it ending up in a plea deal or maybe even going to trial. I don't know if you have an opinion on which of those is more likely, but I was also curious, regardless of that question, what kind of punishment do you think he's likely to face both under a plea deal and if.
00:23:10.128 - 00:24:34.802, Speaker B: It goes to mean so? There are so many factors that go into plea negotiations, and that's even assuming that if the DOJ decides to charge him, it's not a given that they're even going to offer him a plea deal, right? They have no obligation to that's totally up to the federal prosecutors whether they want to do that or not. And then if they like his potential sentence, which would ultimately be decided by a judge, like the federal prosecutors don't decide what the sentence is going to be, but they do decide what criminal charges to bring. And then there are sentencing ranges that are associated with those charges, right. So they do have some discretion as to what charges they decide to bring, how many charges they decide to bring, and what sentencing ranges are associated with those charges. And then that is ultimately what the judge would work with if he's convicted, to decide what his sentence is going to be. But if he's charged with wire fraud, which is the most obvious outcome, if the facts support it, then I think he's facing something like 20 plus years in jail. And if there are multiple charges, there's flexibility as to how they can charge one count with respect to different conduct that happened.
00:24:34.802 - 00:25:03.654, Speaker B: And that's something that if they offer him a plea, they can always negotiate that, right? That happens all the time where if the defendant is willing to plead and to cooperate or something like that, then they might work with the person to decide what the charges are going to be and what the ultimate sentencing range is going to be. So that's all a part of the negotiation. I mean, who knows what he's going to do? I think he's going to decide based on what the charges are and what's on the table.
00:25:03.782 - 00:25:21.314, Speaker A: But do you feel that the fact that the strategy so far seems to be this bad businessman strategy means that he's less likely to take a plea deal? Like in the sense that if so far he hasn't been willing to admit that there was fraud, then do you think it means that maybe he's less likely to accept a plea deal?
00:25:21.432 - 00:25:54.830, Speaker B: I don't think necessarily. I mean, he's doing all of this right now, but his mindset could totally change once he's actually faced with an indictment right. Or like a complaint, and he sees what charges are on the table and how much time he could be facing. I mean, he could be singing a very different tune once he's faced with all of that. So I don't necessarily think that what he's doing now is any indication of how he would react or respond once he's actually facing charges.
00:25:55.250 - 00:26:22.614, Speaker A: Okay. And then the only kind of somewhat recent comparison I could make, maybe would be what happened with theranos where the initial fraud was revealed in the Wall Street Journal in the fall of 2015. And it's only in the last month that the top executives there, elizabeth Holmes and Sonny Balwani, were sentenced. So how long do you expect some kind of conclusion like that to occur for the FTX story?
00:26:22.812 - 00:27:08.974, Speaker B: Yeah. So when the reporter there broke that story, I think even then, I think it took something like a year, right, for her to even be indicted. So that investigation took a long time. I mean, who knows? The investigation here could take something like months, up to a year or longer. And if I recall, the reporting there was actually pretty comprehensive. It was a pretty thorough job, and yet it still took them that much time to get their case together in order to charge her. And then, of course, once it went to trial, you have to go through the discovery process, and there could be, like, a lot of witnesses involved that the government wants to talk to to prepare their case.
00:27:08.974 - 00:27:42.800, Speaker B: And there's like a motion to dismiss stage. There's summary judgment, so there's all sorts of stages that you have to go through before it even gets to a trial. And then the trial itself has to occur. So it can take years, like, things that could make it take longer, as if the defense brings a lot of motions to challenge the admission of certain evidence or things like that. And so there are all sorts of things that can happen in a criminal proceeding to really draw out the process. So I think it's really hard to say, but if Sam does choose, if he is charged and he chooses to take it to trial, it could be years.
00:27:43.110 - 00:27:49.122, Speaker A: And if he chooses a plea deal, then how quickly could that wrap up?
00:27:49.256 - 00:28:14.746, Speaker B: That could wrap up quickly, assuming they offer him some kind of deal right. Which I said is not a given, but if they do and he is willing to plead and accept responsibility and they can agree on what the charges are going to be and things that would affect the sentencing ranges, then it could happen very quickly. So it all depends on how he wants to proceed, if it comes to that.
00:28:14.928 - 00:28:28.910, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been just very insightful and kind of just interesting to learn more of the legal process about how all this works. Is there anything that I didn't ask you that you would want to add?
00:28:29.060 - 00:29:38.020, Speaker B: Yeah. So I just wanted to mention, you know, the SEC is also reportedly investigating not just this situation involving, like, FTX and Alameda and the potential misuse of customer funds, but I think the SEC is also involving this potential market manipulation with respect to you know, I don't know if people know this, but when the SEC and the DOJ are doing parallel investigations like this, which is not at all uncommon I spent about six years at the SEC. Five of that was as an attorney in the enforcement division. And we did a lot of cases in parallel with the criminal authorities. So if the SEC is also investigating, like all of those things that I described earlier, that the DOJ is likely doing as a part of its investigation, I mean, I expect the SEC and maybe the other regulators that are looking into this. I expect them to be just right there alongside the DOJ, looking at the evidence, interviewing witnesses together and that sort of thing. It's not at all uncommon for them to do know if the SEC is also investigating that in parallel or this recent FTX Alameda situation.
00:29:38.020 - 00:30:29.686, Speaker B: It's not at all uncommon for them to conduct those investigations in parallel and share information and things like that. And a lot of times, if they decide to bring charges, like the SEC decides to bring a civil enforcement action and the criminal authorities decide to bring a criminal charge, they'll often even announce it at the same time. Not always, they didn't do that with Elizabeth Holmes, but usually they'll try to time it so that the charges are announced at the same time. But the thing there is that typically, if the cases are brought in parallel, the SEC case and any other civil case will be stayed. Meaning the judge will basically put a pause on it and allow the criminal process to come to a resolution before allowing the SEC and civil cases to proceed. So that's what I would expect if that happens here.
00:30:29.868 - 00:30:58.240, Speaker A: Okay. One thing actually that makes me think about is the fact that in the Coinbase insider trading case, the SEC basically just. Stated these certain tokens are securities without providing the rationale for that. So if that were to happen, it sounds like they would do the same for perhaps Terra and Luna, which would cause another whole interesting wrinkle and everything yeah.
00:30:58.690 - 00:31:25.202, Speaker B: In the SEC by he case. The coinbase case. Yeah. So they actually did include some analysis. Not a lot, but they did do sort of like kind of a short Howie analysis for each of the I think it was like nine tokens that they alleged were securities. So I would expect them to do that here. They haven't done that in every enforcement action that they've brought that involved alleged securities.
00:31:25.202 - 00:32:00.750, Speaker B: Right. So, like, there was a case, I believe it was from last year, where they charged a crypto exchange called Poloniax for operating an unregistered securities exchange, but in their order, they didn't actually say which securities or which tokens were allegedly have been. There's been at least one instance where they have just declined to allege what tokens were securities. But they did do it in SEC v. Wahi, the Coinbase case. And they did do, like, a short Howie analysis.
00:32:00.910 - 00:32:21.002, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. But I think also people took issue with the fact that then those token teams couldn't kind of, like, defend. But anyway okay, well, this has been just super interesting and also really informative. Thank you so much for explaining it all on Unchained. Of course.
00:32:21.056 - 00:32:22.794, Speaker B: Thanks, Laura, for having me on.
00:32:22.992 - 00:32:58.450, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this Week in Crypto after this short break. Thanks for tuning into this week's news recap.
