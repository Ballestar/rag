00:00:00.490 - 00:00:40.054, Speaker A: He says that, yes, this is how bitcoin was built. I didn't do this. This is the nature of the system. It is the most transparent system of finance ever created. And he kind of describes it almost as if satoshi intended it that way. But I don't think that that's actually that part I don't agree with, because Satoshi wrote in that first email to a cryptography mailing list that participants can be anonymous, and turns out that specifically only satoshi has remained anonymous. He's like he or she or they are the only person who has pulled that off in the whole universe of crypto whales? I would think so, yeah.
00:00:40.054 - 00:00:55.770, Speaker A: I don't know. I think that regardless, though, this idea that cryptocurrency could offer that world of untraceability or our kind of crypto anarchy, as some people wanted to see it, is just a pipe dream.
