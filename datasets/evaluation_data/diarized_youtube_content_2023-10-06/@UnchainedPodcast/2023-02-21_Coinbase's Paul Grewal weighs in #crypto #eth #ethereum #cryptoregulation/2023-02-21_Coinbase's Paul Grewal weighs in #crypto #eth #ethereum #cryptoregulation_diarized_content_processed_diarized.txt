But the notion that somehow the right way to constrain activities that give rise to concerns is to cut off their oxygen or slowly deplete them of oxygen, which of course, in the financial world there's no more important source of oxygen than bank making services. I think that's something that is as much as anything explaining the strong reaction we're seeing not just inside of the crypto community, but in the broader financial services community as well. That's a dangerous precedent. And it may be that crypto is currently the object of that particular approach. But if the government gets away with that, with crypto, what what's to say and what's to stop them from getting away with it? A whole host of other.
