00:00:00.170 - 00:00:14.320, Speaker A: Lightning is pretty complicated right now. It's hard to set up a node. It's hard to connect a node really, really well with other peers. It's hard to manage channels and liquidity in channels. So what we're trying to do is really make Lightning really, really easy.
00:00:15.650 - 00:00:40.426, Speaker B: This is Jeff Benson for Unchained. David Marcus is the former head of Novi at Meta and the current CEO and co founder of Lightspark, which builds infrastructure for Bitcoin Lightning network. After announcing Lightspark eleven months ago, the company is going live with three products Lightspark Connect, Lightspark Predict, and the Lightspark API and software development kits. So, David, what is Lightspark Connect?
00:00:40.528 - 00:00:55.418, Speaker A: So, in a nutshell, what we're trying to do here is basically take Lightning, which is amazing. It enables anyone to send and receive money in near real time and settle in near real time at a very low cost and almost infinitely scalable.
00:00:55.514 - 00:01:00.282, Speaker B: What's been the interaction between Lightspark and Lightning Labs in this endeavor?
00:01:00.426 - 00:01:59.950, Speaker A: Lightning Labs is building the most successful Lightning distribution out there, and so we're building on top of what they've built over the years. And basically, our software is built around LND to make it really easy to use. And so that's what we've been focused on. It's really taking the best that is out there and making it really easy to use, not only to set up, but also to manage. So if this is the first time that you're actually operating on Lightning, the concept around channels and liquidity that's locked up in channels, and the fact that you need to rebalance that liquidity all the time is something pretty foreign if you're used to traditional payment networks or blockchains. And so in this first drop, so to speak, of our product, we're really taking care of all of that in the background in an automated way. And so you don't even need to know channels exist.
00:01:59.950 - 00:02:03.470, Speaker A: We actually, as a matter of fact, never talk about channels in our interface.
00:02:03.550 - 00:02:06.002, Speaker B: So tell me a little bit more about Lightspark Predict.
00:02:06.066 - 00:02:38.906, Speaker A: Lightspark Predict is the part of the product that actually helps you find the best routes to route transactions depending on transaction size and destination. But it's also a way to dynamically and automatically assign liquidity to the right channel just in time for the transaction, so that your capital efficiency is just much better than it currently is. If you deploy Bitcoin on Lightning as a way to enable transactions to flow through the network.
00:02:39.018 - 00:02:52.450, Speaker B: Now, in the past few weeks, bitcoin ordinals and Stamps, they've sort of rejuvenated interest in Bitcoin for other things. So if development continues to broaden beyond payments, what role might Lightspark play?
00:02:52.520 - 00:03:27.840, Speaker A: So, look, I think that the more things you can do with Bitcoin in terms of using that immense amount of liquidity that's out there for other applications, the better for us, because you'll need to move value around really quickly to buy these things or to interact with these new products. So we think it's all really good. And it's kind of a reflection of the era we're in where listing a token is not a thing anymore. So people flock back to bitcoin just to build really amazing things. And it's very exciting to actually be building a site by side with that community.
