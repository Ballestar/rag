00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.362, Speaker A: Things are really heating up between Genesis and Winklebots owned Crypto exchange Gemini. Genesis is a crypto broker, and Gemini made them alone. But then, in November, genesis halted all trading on its platform. So now there are $900 million of Gemini funds trapped in Genesis. $900 million is a lot of money. Like, the Winklebots would have to sue Mark Zuckerberg 15 times to get that back. Cameron winkleboss has now posted two open letters, which are my absolute favorite kind of letter.
00:00:24.362 - 00:00:50.314, Speaker A: Everyone is so worried about getting hacked, but all the good stuff is just out in the open. These letters he's accused Genesis and its parent company of fraud and called for the CEO of its parent company to step down. Gemini also ended their interest bearing product earn, which did not live up to its name, and they terminated their relationship with Genesis. Genesis'parent company has fired back at the Winklevoss, calling this an unproductive and desperate publicity stunt. I don't buy it. The Winklevoss don't need more attention. They get plenty of good publicity as it is from their rock sand.
00:00:50.314 - 00:00:59.690, Speaker A: Genesis has also claimed that part of this is because the crypto markets are still all messed up from FTX, which definitely rings true to me. Statistically speaking, most things are the fall of sandbankman. Fried.
