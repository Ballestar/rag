00:00:00.170 - 00:00:56.506, Speaker A: Let's just assume there's $5 billion that's owing from Alameda to FTX, right? And what needs to happen is that that position needs to be unwound and that Alameda needs to pay $5 billion back to FTX. Now the question is whether Alameda has $5 billion paid back to FTX. If it did, we wouldn't be in this spot of border because Alameda would just hand over $5 billion of cash and FTX would hand it back to its customers. The thing is, Alameda is stuck in some very questionable and very illiquid assets, which is making it very difficult to pay back on. That mean. Personally, my thinking, as I've sort of shared a couple of times, is that at some point a voyager like deal sort of makes sense. Makes sense for someone to come and take out FTX and then sort of seek to liquidate Alameda, because I think Alameda is dead.
00:00:56.506 - 00:00:57.660, Speaker A: It's gone. It's not coming back.
