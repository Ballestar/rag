00:00:00.250 - 00:00:39.906, Speaker A: Oftentimes I feel like the crypto community, they get really kind of up in arms because they all view something as being one way, but then you all get surprised when you find out, oh, the regulators don't view it that way, and you're like, mad and blah, blah, blah. And it's like this thing with Gary Gensler where when he first was selected to be SEC chair, people were like, oh, he knows blockchain great for us. And you guys, he has a completely different opinion on how all this stuff should be regulated from you. And it's not that he does not understand the technology. He has taught courses at MIT about blockchain technology. He gets it. He just doesn't agree with you about what it is or how it should be regulated, blah, blah, blah.
00:00:39.906 - 00:00:52.730, Speaker A: And so here we are, you were talking about this report, and you're sort of like saying, how can they do this? How can they do that? And I'm just going to suggest again, they might understand it and have just a completely different opinion.
