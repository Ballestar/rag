00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.310, Speaker A: The reason you alienated the community, Aaron, is because you called everybody a scofflaw. And you should have a little bit more empathy for the entrepreneurs that have been with the best intentions trying to make this work. And you go around saying that everybody's violating the law willingly and that you've somehow magically pulled, you know, a rabbit out of a hat, which this is like, frankly, this is a space where a lot of people have been actively working on it. And it's even more insulting when you don't have anything really to show for it other than a license.
00:00:32.810 - 00:00:50.862, Speaker B: What's a little bit insulting is that you basically say people who try to do it the right way are trying to do the wrong thing. And essentially what your argument is, is that people who rushed to market and disregarded the investor protections should be rewarded and should continue to be rewarded as new legislation takes a half a decade to into place.
00:00:50.996 - 00:00:51.854, Speaker A: Basically, you.
00:00:51.892 - 00:00:54.780, Speaker B: Just don't care about the public and what's in their best interest.
