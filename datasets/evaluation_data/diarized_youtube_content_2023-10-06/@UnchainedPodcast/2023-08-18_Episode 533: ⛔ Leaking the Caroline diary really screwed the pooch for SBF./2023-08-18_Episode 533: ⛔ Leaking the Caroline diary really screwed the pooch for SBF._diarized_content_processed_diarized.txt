00:00:00.570 - 00:00:39.906, Speaker A: And as for the Karen Ellison situation, what's been reported is he had a meeting with a New York Times reporter at his house or his parents house and provided his diary to the you know, the story came out. And it was somewhat salacious. And I think the judge and the government felt that that was a way to try to get her to back off from wanting to testify. Bullying and truthfully of his trial. She is an expected witness, one of the government's key witnesses, from what we know. And I think there have been a number of other incidents that had gotten the court's attention about Sam when he's been out. And so I don't think people were surprised that he was detained.
00:00:39.906 - 00:00:54.890, Speaker A: I think most people I've talked to were surprised he wasn't detained from the start. And so now that he's detained, though, that really does change a lot of the dynamics for preparation and for trial. And it does make it much tougher on the defense to prepare for trial.
