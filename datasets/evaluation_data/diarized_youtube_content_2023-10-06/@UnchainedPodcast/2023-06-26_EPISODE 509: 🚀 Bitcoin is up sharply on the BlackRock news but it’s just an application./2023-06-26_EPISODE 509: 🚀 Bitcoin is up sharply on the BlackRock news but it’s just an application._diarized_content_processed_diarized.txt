00:00:00.490 - 00:00:31.714, Speaker A: We don't think the odds of, like, this can get approved are, like, 70%. Like, we think the Grayscale victory, like the ODS, are still stacked against BlackRock. My colleague Eric Beltunis and I are roughly around 50 50, we think, maybe, which is way higher than most other people in the TradFi space. But that said, like I said, the Coinbase allegations are around completely separate securities. They're not accusing them of fraud. So I would make the argument that they're not worried about their Bit Coin custody program. And why would BlackRock choose Coinbase? They already have a partnership with Coinbase.
00:00:31.714 - 00:00:52.698, Speaker A: They use them for pricing algorithms that input on their side on products. They have, like aladdin. And also, I believe it was about a year ago that they announced a partnership with BlackRock, Coinbase and BlackRock. So they'll also, like, institutional clients of BlackRock. They use Coinbase to get access to the crypto market. So I assume it's for custody and other things like that. Trading, perhaps.
00:00:52.698 - 00:00:56.410, Speaker A: So there's already a built in partnership between BlackRock and Coinbase.
