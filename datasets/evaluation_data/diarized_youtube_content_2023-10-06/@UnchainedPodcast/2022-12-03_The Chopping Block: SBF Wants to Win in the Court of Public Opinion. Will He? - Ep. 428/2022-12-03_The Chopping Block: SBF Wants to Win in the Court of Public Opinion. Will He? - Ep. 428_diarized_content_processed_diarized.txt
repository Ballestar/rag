00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:17.970 - 00:00:35.746, Speaker B: Hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes. Next up we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and Captain of Compound. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and Grand Poohba at Gauntlet.
00:00:35.746 - 00:01:09.230, Speaker B: And finally we've got myself. I'm haseeb the head Hype man at Dragonfly. All four of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Okay? So for those of you who are not tuning in live, we just went live after the end of the New York Times interview with SBF. I think it's actually, I guess the second interview that he's done, but certainly the most high profile and it seems like the most hard hitting. I'm just going to give a very quick summary of some of the stuff he said because a lot of it has kind of been repeats of things he's already been asserting publicly and in his tweets.
00:01:09.230 - 00:01:41.950, Speaker B: So some of the key quotes that I pulled out from the conversation he had with Aaron sorkin first he said FTX US and FTX Japan are fully solvent and he expects that they can pay back customers. He's surprised, but they haven't already, and he's confused why they were pulled into the bankruptcy. He was asked at some length about the shiboliths and the game that westerners play that he alluded to in the Vox article. And he tried to paint it as though this is talking about marketing. He's, you know, we do all these dumb ESG marketing campaigns, blah blah, blah, in order to get regulatory.
00:01:43.010 - 00:01:51.600, Speaker A: Don't, don't forget that. He was like, well, I'm sorry that a private conversation that I thought was the truth was revealed. He said that first.
00:01:52.530 - 00:02:23.878, Speaker B: True. So Aaron asked him about criminal liability if he expects that he will have criminal liability. And Sam gave a very interesting answer to that. He said, look, there's a time and place for me to think about that, but right now is not it. Right now I need to be focused on customers and what I can do to help make the situation better. Now Aaron also asked him when did he know that there was a problem at FTX? And Sam answered, he knew that there was a problem starting on November 6. November 6 was the day that CZ tweeted that they were going to sell their FTT.
00:02:23.878 - 00:03:20.726, Speaker B: It was November 7, the day afterwards that Sam actually tweeted that FTX is fine. All assets are fine. We don't trade with customer funds. And so this seems like potentially an admission that Sam knew that things were not fine when he made that tweet and that tweet of course, was later deleted, which indicates probably what we already suspect, which is that he knew that that tweet was not knowingly correct at that time. He repeated again that he regretted that he allowed the bankruptcy process to come into place and he felt that it was possible to potentially make all customers whole. And when he was asked why, he sort of alluded to doing something like Bitfinex, which presumably means issuing some kind of debt token and using that to quote unquote, make customers whole and just continuing to operate. And then lastly he said, which he also said another interview, that he has a hundred K left in his name, so he presumably doesn't have a whole lot of money left and is just hanging out in the Bahamas.
00:03:20.726 - 00:03:27.534, Speaker B: So those are what I kind of perceive to be the highlights reactions we just got off the video. What did you guys think?
00:03:27.652 - 00:03:31.326, Speaker A: Oh yeah, I think you meant Andrew Ross sorkin oh, I'm sorry.
00:03:31.348 - 00:04:20.270, Speaker D: Andrew Ross sorkin my first point is that he said a lot of things and didn't bring the receipts for any of know he can claim or make any statement he wants. He's done that for a long time. But a lot of things he said he didn't necessarily provide any evidence for. How much money does he have? Who knows? Most of those entities have been in his name. How much crypto does he have? If you want me to believe that he has no know, I will answer with extreme skepticism. My take know he seemed to be framing his own defense, whether that's a defense in the court of public opinion or the court of the Department of justice, by framing everything from the beginning to the end as I'm innocent, I didn't know things got away from me. This was just a funny mistake.
00:04:21.250 - 00:04:42.200, Speaker B: Yeah. So it does seem like he's continuing to assert the defense that basically this was a margin position that went wrong. There was no clear decision or moment that he made to say, okay, we're going to take customer funds and give it to Alameda. He's continuing to assert that this was just kind of run of the mill margining that went wrong and the risk systems didn't make this apparent to them.
00:04:42.970 - 00:05:21.442, Speaker A: I think that's just partly the interviewer not understanding how derivatives exchange works to realize how absurd it is to say that that's what happened. I think if Andrew thought understood how clearing and settlement at derivative exchanges works normally and why this makes no it makes no sense to be like someone sent you money in your bank account. I'm going to credit you margin in my exchange makes no sense at all. There's no settlement guarantee. I think that was probably the weakest question in some ways because he didn't kind of press on. How could that even make sense that you did that at all?
00:05:21.576 - 00:05:57.402, Speaker C: Yeah, it's somewhat hard right now for us to piece together everything that's happening because we're getting it in bits and pieces looking externally. But I do feel like once some of the actual internal communications come out, ideally in discovery, there should be a paper trail to evidence that this happened. Right. I doubt they had everything done over phone calls or everything done in person. Surely at some point someone put in writing what actually happened, and then we'll have sort of a smoking gun. Right now, it feels like we're trying to sort of figure out how the system worked from the outside just by seeing sort of what it's emitting.
00:05:57.546 - 00:06:45.034, Speaker B: The fact that they had all these auto deleting messages in all of their internal conversations, I think is going to make it very difficult for any kind of criminal investigation to get a smoking gun now. And also, given the quality of the accounting, the accounting was so bad that clearly it's going to be very difficult to actually do any forensics here to understand who was involved when these decisions were made. It seems that Sam is asserting very clearly, look, I didn't know, and if I had known, I would have stopped it. And yeah, he's saying that, look, this is my responsibility because I'm the CEO and I messed up. But he's also asserting that he was not knowledgeable. And ultimately, that is almost always the key element of a criminal prosecution, is the state of mind of the person who's committing the crime. If they didn't know that it was happening, then generally speaking, you're going to get civil liability, not criminal liability.
00:06:45.034 - 00:07:40.240, Speaker B: Now there are certain things, I think that are pretty slam dunk, like that he made misrepresentations to customers when he said that FTX was fine, that they broke the terms of service in a knowing way, and or that they made misrepresentations to investors. It seems now that many investors are raising their hands and saying, look, we were made assertions about the relationship between Alameda and FTX that were not true and that were demonstrably not true, even with respect to just the detail that we learned, which is that Alameda had a special status in their liquidation engine. There was another interview that Sam did recently with Tiffany Fong, which is actually the very first interview I guess he's done in that interview, other than Kelsey Piper's leaked DMs. And in that interview, he was asked directly about the backdoor that the Wall Street Journal reported on. And Sam's claim was that, no, there's no backdoor. Like, I can't even code how would I make a backdoor? That seemed very confusing to me. Like, wasn't he a quant at.
00:07:46.130 - 00:08:14.150, Speaker A: Once? I remember when I interviewed there, when I left college, one of the jokes that one of my interviewers made was, our founders only know two programming languages, VBA or Excel and OCaml, and nothing in there's. There's actually some reasons, philosophically for them, that most of the quants actually don't do a lot more like picking up the phone and pricing things rather than purely tech based trades.
00:08:14.230 - 00:08:18.522, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess even if you're writing a lot of OCaml, that doesn't mean you know how to write an accounting system.
00:08:18.656 - 00:08:26.640, Speaker A: This doesn't obviate Gary from having done this. He finds Sam can't code. Clearly the CTO can code.
00:08:27.090 - 00:08:27.502, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:27.556 - 00:08:37.678, Speaker D: If he just told one of his close allies within the company to do this in secret, it doesn't change the fact that he ordered there to be a backdoor.
00:08:37.774 - 00:08:41.486, Speaker A: Look, the polycule has one person who could have done it. That's all that matters.
00:08:41.678 - 00:09:20.830, Speaker B: Sure. At least think we're it feels like the whole world is kind of on the same page at this point. Other than Bill Ackman. I don't know if you guys saw Bill Ackman live tweeted during the talk that he said, call me crazy, but I think SBF is telling the truth. It seems like everybody except Bill basically thinks that okay, we kind of roughly know what happened, and I think we see the defense that Sam is trying to make. Honestly, what impressed me the most in this conversation with Sam is the fact that there is no upside for him in doing these interviews. And he's very clearly now at the point where he's like, back to his old self.
00:09:20.830 - 00:10:08.990, Speaker B: It actually was one of the things that the New York Times had this live blogging of different snippets from the conversation. And one of the things they said, which I found very interesting, is like, New York Times wrote this themselves, which is that they said something like, sam is kind of back to his charismatic self, and he's using his intelligence to try to kind of win over the audience and his vulnerability. And it's very clear Sam knows that he's very good at this. Right? It's kind of what made FTX so successful. And he's basically ignoring the obvious advice of any of his lawyers. And he seemed like potentially seemingly the stuff that he said in this interview will almost certainly come out in a criminal trial if and when he has one. And so it does seem like I don't think there's an N dimensional chess here.
00:10:08.990 - 00:10:26.290, Speaker B: Like, this is just clearly bad for him to be doing these kinds of interviews and directly answering questions that potentially implicate him on criminal liability. I think he just genuinely believes what he's saying. At least with respect know, this is not the time for me to go in a hole and just disappear.
00:10:26.710 - 00:10:28.150, Speaker A: You know who agrees with you?
00:10:28.220 - 00:11:06.002, Speaker B: Bill Ackman might believe the details of the story. I don't know that I believe the details of the story, but in terms of Sam's just sense that just I can't just go and do what's in my blind self interest because I feel like, a strong sense of, like it's hard to get, like, what is his motivation? If you think it's all machiavellian with respect to getting on the New York Times DealBook. Interview which is basically I mean, what happened? There was, like, a cross examination. This was the most unfriendly interview I have seen. I don't know, what do you guys think about that?
00:11:06.136 - 00:11:42.902, Speaker C: I think leaking some of the specifics, like, sort of around the November 6 date seems like a big fuck up. But it does seem like, hey, so far from all the leaks that have come out, assume Sam said nothing. It seems extremely criminal, right? It seems like, hey, there was malice behind these actions. And so all of his interviews so far have been trying to spin this plausible deniability story, right? Oh, I fucked up. There's a mistake accounting issue. And I think that the hope is that you repeat that enough times and people begin to believe that that was actually Sam's state of mind. Especially, again, if we don't actually have that written evidence.
00:11:42.902 - 00:11:54.302, Speaker C: So if that is sort of the message that's being spammed out, you have this voice in the group that's actually pushing that versus everything else that's being leaked out about the back door and all these other sort of intentional acts that he took.
00:11:54.436 - 00:12:07.298, Speaker B: I think it's also possible he just can't help it that he's so used to the spotlight and he's so used to being a part of the conversation that maybe he just can't resist continuing to interject himself into that conversation.
00:12:07.474 - 00:12:09.590, Speaker D: He got hooked on crypto, Twitter.
00:12:10.570 - 00:12:11.990, Speaker B: I know how that feels.
00:12:13.370 - 00:12:32.758, Speaker A: It was more funny his way of when asked about the Stimulants, he was just like, well, I didn't drink alcohol until after I was 21. It's like, what kind of deflection is that? And then he started being like, oh, I needed help focusing, but clearly I wasn't focusing enough. My head exploded.
00:12:32.934 - 00:12:53.438, Speaker B: To be fair, I thought that was a legitimate answer, which is like, look, I mean, the guy is like his leg was twitching. He plays World of Warcraft on calls. Clearly he has a problem with focusing, right? So I can understand that this guy, from everything we know about him, probably does need some medication for his lack of focus. So I honestly thought that was a reasonable answer. But it's still funny.
00:12:53.614 - 00:13:06.520, Speaker A: I thought, to me, that was the best part, right? He could have just been like, no, next question. And instead we learned about the fact that he was boring in high school.
00:13:07.370 - 00:13:42.834, Speaker C: Weirdly. I got recommended a talk that he gave in 2018 on YouTube, just like through the algorithm or whatever. And it sort of reminds me of watching old Trump videos of like, this person was actually a very charismatic, well spoken person. It's so hard to sort of square that with sort of this weird twitchy goblin that we now see on screen. But at the time. It's a very sort of different version of Sam. I think maybe was partly because of this, but yeah, it's strange to see him again on screen.
00:13:42.952 - 00:13:48.678, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought it seemed like maybe he'd set that up himself. I mean, I doubt he was getting a lot of help on it.
00:13:48.764 - 00:13:54.450, Speaker A: He needed a camera crew. That thing looked like a guilty angle.
00:13:54.610 - 00:14:10.880, Speaker B: He was looking down and constantly doing this thing as he was answering questions. And I was like, this does not seem like a good way to make yourself seem innocent, especially in the court of public opinion. All these clips are going to be replayed over and over and over again.
00:14:11.650 - 00:14:15.760, Speaker A: It does look like you're in a confession booth. The way that was.
00:14:18.050 - 00:15:11.706, Speaker B: That is 100% the vibe of watching that interview. Well, okay, I think we should kind of zoom out a bit and talk about some of the broader backdrop of what's been happening over the last week. So when we left things off in the last episode, we were talking about Genesis and some of the fears around the Genesis insolvency. And I believe last week we said that we thought Genesis was probably going to be okay, and now a lot more details have come to light and we've learned a valuable lesson, which I think I alluded to very briefly. Last time I was like, oh, after FTX, I don't feel like I should be that confident about anything. Now we learned why is that? It looks like there was a lot of funny business in the accounting at very, very high level. The understanding that we now have from different things that have been reported to the press is that DCG, the parent company of Genesis, made a loan to Genesis.
00:15:11.706 - 00:15:30.646, Speaker B: Or sorry, not a loan. What they did was they bought out Genesis's bad debt in three arrows. So Genesis had, I believe, $2.1 billion of exposure to three arrows. And DCG, the parent company of Genesis, bought that debt at Par, meaning that we are going to make you whole for that 2.1 billion. And so we're going to pay 2.1
00:15:30.646 - 00:16:14.434, Speaker B: billion for this debt, but we're not going to pay it in cash. We're going to pay it in a promissory note that pays out over ten years. So basically, they're going to get, like, some annuity effectively for next ten years. But supposedly there's some term in that promissory note such that if Genesis goes into liquidation, then DCG would be forced to pay the full value of the promissory note. So the note would come due immediately if there's a liquidation of Genesis, which I assume at the time they weren't thinking was a serious possibility. And that was the reason why you can say we're solvent because, yeah, okay, we don't have the cash, but we have the ability to call all the cash that would otherwise be necessary if and when we have to go to the mat on this because of a liquidation. So that's now happening.
00:16:14.434 - 00:16:42.862, Speaker B: You're now in a situation where DCG has to do something with this promissory note. Now that Genesis is stuck, we realize, hey, when we were told that Genesis was solvent, we were including this promissory note. DCG does not have $2.1 billion in cash to pay the value of this promissory note. And so either one, Genesis files and then pulls DCG into bankruptcy because DCG will be called on for this $2.1 billion liability, which obviously they're not going to pay 2.1 billion in cash.
00:16:42.862 - 00:17:31.418, Speaker B: They don't have that. So either one, both entities go into some super complicated bankruptcy procedure, or the other possibility is that Genesis goes under and then the note is itself auctioned off at some value less than par, but somehow it's prevented from DCG going under because maybe the creditors would find that to actually be a worse outcome. I don't exactly understand. I think this is a lot of what people are trying to figure out right now. But TLDR, it looks very, very likely that Genesis either one is going to have to file for bankruptcy, or two, they're going to have to go through a restructuring such that the creditors of Genesis are going to have to collectively agree that like, hey, let's agree to get some. Let's basically reduce our claims at Genesis in order to avoid a bankruptcy just because the bankruptcy would be so deleterious to the big creditors, to Genesis. So this is a live situation.
00:17:31.418 - 00:17:52.434, Speaker B: We don't really know exactly what's happening, but it seems like markets are now pricing in that there's going to be some relatively calm resolution that doesn't involve a bankruptcy but involves the creditors kind of renegotiating what's happening at Genesis. Robert, I know you're closer to this than we are. Any further insight or I don't know if you're not able to know.
00:17:52.472 - 00:18:21.354, Speaker D: I'm only closer because I think out of the four of us, I'm the only one who's a creditor to Genesis. So it's the embarrassing being closer to the situation. I have more empathy with everyone who got wrecked with FTX, I'm wrecked with Genesis. I don't have any more information than that. What's been discussed there? Ryan Selkis tweeted out a weird financial model earlier today saying, like, DCG is healthy. Everybody take a look at this financial model. Full story coming tomorrow.
00:18:21.354 - 00:19:16.160, Speaker D: That could be more optimistic than reality. But if you're looking for something interesting, go find that. Tweet I think the thing that I'm looking for is whether or not they're pushed into bankruptcy involuntarily I think at this point, any number of creditors could push them into bankruptcy if their obligations are in default. They halted withdrawals. There's a lot of customers that had positions that matured and that could ask for their funds back or whether they're able to work things out without filing a bankruptcy petition. So I think the ODS are high, let's say 80%, but the thing I want to ask about and press you on haseeb is you said the markets are indicating a gentle resolution. I'm actually curious what markets are you referring to?
00:19:17.730 - 00:19:29.890, Speaker B: Okay, I could be mistaken, but I believe after the news was reported that the Genesis creditors were seeking a non bankruptcy resolution that markets rebounded. If I'm not mistaken. Did that not happen?
00:19:30.040 - 00:19:31.186, Speaker D: I mean, markets went up.
00:19:31.208 - 00:19:31.858, Speaker B: Not today.
00:19:32.024 - 00:19:35.300, Speaker A: This was a few days ago. That's the rate stuff.
00:19:35.910 - 00:19:46.760, Speaker B: Yeah, that's like jerome, that's today. But this happened a few days ago. Didn't okay, whatever. Take everything that I just said with a grain of salt. I have no idea what markets think.
00:19:47.130 - 00:19:56.186, Speaker A: Although I would be curious if anyone is actually trading ECG credit default swaps because those could actually exist. That was what I was I was.
00:19:56.208 - 00:19:57.306, Speaker C: Kind of curious if you knew that.
00:19:57.328 - 00:19:58.490, Speaker A: A bad existed or something.
00:19:58.560 - 00:20:10.414, Speaker D: Yeah. If anyone listening is trading DCG or Genesis credit default swaps or derivatives somehow, please tweet at us after the show. Let us know. That's super mean.
00:20:10.452 - 00:20:16.994, Speaker A: Certainly it's interesting for people who are creditors in case they want to you.
00:20:17.032 - 00:20:45.260, Speaker D: Know, I've heard of people buying and trading bankruptcy know obviously there's been a huge amount of activity at FTX and people trading bankruptcy claims. Back in the day there was a huge amount of Mount Gox bankruptcy claims being traded. I know, it was like Fortress, the hedge fund made a huge business buying Gox bankruptcy claims. I don't know if you can even trade the claims prior to bankruptcy. Maybe you can. Maybe there is already activity in Genesis claims that would be really interesting.
00:20:46.030 - 00:20:47.462, Speaker A: You can make a warrant.
00:20:47.526 - 00:20:47.706, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:47.728 - 00:20:53.470, Speaker A: That's only exercisable when the event happens and if not, then it goes. Just worthless.
00:20:54.770 - 00:21:05.054, Speaker B: Yeah. There's a lot of folks who are buying out FTX claims as well. I think Genesis a bit early for there to be a market for claims, but I guess possible FTX claims are.
00:21:05.092 - 00:21:07.278, Speaker A: Crazy though, I feel like yeah, they're.
00:21:07.294 - 00:21:08.706, Speaker D: Like five to $0.10 or something.
00:21:08.728 - 00:21:12.814, Speaker B: I think they've gone up. I think they've gone up. Yeah. They were initially closer to $0.05.
00:21:12.942 - 00:21:22.742, Speaker C: In the audio interview that Sam did, he said he expects creditors to get about 25% back. Which is also where I imagine a lot of people who are buying these claims to expect these.
00:21:22.796 - 00:21:36.090, Speaker B: No, because when you're buying the claims, first of all, you're taking all the risk away and also you get your money immediately. Right. So these claims are going for like maybe what I saw was like $0.12 roughly. That was a few days ago.
00:21:36.160 - 00:21:36.346, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:36.368 - 00:21:41.366, Speaker C: I'm saying Sam is expecting when this is finally finished, that you will get back twenty five cents of a dollar.
00:21:41.398 - 00:21:42.278, Speaker A: Which is what I said.
00:21:42.384 - 00:21:46.126, Speaker B: Which may take many, many years. And obviously there's a lot more risk correct. Yeah.
00:21:46.308 - 00:21:54.190, Speaker D: To double your money in like five years. Betting on an FTX recovery seems insane. Like if that's the risk you want.
00:21:54.340 - 00:22:16.870, Speaker A: Everything in crypto is better, shout out to Laura. Actually, I forget exactly who it was, but she had someone on recently who bought a lot of Mount Gox claims, I believe on Unchained, who walks you through the entire process of what it's like to buy a claim, what's like to process. So highly recommend listening to that. I forget the guy's name. It's like Thomas something, but it was.
00:22:17.020 - 00:23:00.414, Speaker B: Very right, so okay, so besides Genesis, which is still an ongoing story, the other big thing was that BlockFi finally filed for bankruptcy. Now this one I think everybody sort of saw coming. I think there was no question when FTX went under that Blockfly was a goner. But we sort of learned a few things from the Blockfly bankruptcy. So for one, we learned that among the biggest creditors, so FTX is one of their creditors. We also saw that the SEC apparently had a $30 million credit to their name as well. Also, apparently the reason why Blockfly was taking so long to file because everyone kind of knew that, okay, Blockfly is toast.
00:23:00.414 - 00:23:42.354, Speaker B: I mean, given their exposure to FTX, this is not going to end well. But apparently they were selling all of their crypto, which was about $250,000,000 worth of crypto they converted into dollars before filing. Apparently there's like now claims going around about Sam's Robinhood stake, which was pledged to BlockFi. I didn't totally fully understand how this relationship works, but there's all these kind know, kind of Spider Man finger pointing meme going on right now between BlockFi, Alameda, FTX, so it's all a bit of a shit show, but BlockFi itself has a bunch of funds stuck on FTX. FTX is a creditor BlockFi. Then there's this Robin Hood thing. So all around I'm pretty confused about what exactly is going on here.
00:23:42.354 - 00:23:48.440, Speaker B: And I don't think we have a clear picture yet of the assets versus liabilities of BlockFi either. So we don't have a good sense of what recovery would look like.
00:23:48.810 - 00:24:23.470, Speaker A: I think the thing was that some of the funds borrowed from BlockFi were used to buy the Robinhood shares from Emergent Technologies, which is like this other entity. And then later I believe that company's shares were used as either part of the bankruptcy purchase and pledged effectively. And so there's this very weird thing where BlockFi's money went to buy Robinhood shares, which came back to BlockFi as collateral. But unlike know, you can't loop, you don't know how many times it's been looped.
00:24:24.450 - 00:25:14.510, Speaker B: It does seem like there's a lot of loops in this whole thing between Elementa and FTX and BlockFi and all this. One of the things that came out also in the interview just now is that Andrew Ross orkin asked SBF like, okay, so why did you spend all this money trying to buy BlockFi? And you know, we've previously speculated on the show that the answer was that he was trying to essentially save his own bank, because if Alameda allowed BlockFi and Voyager to go under, well, they were two of his largest lenders, and that would have exploded the whole thing much earlier. That was a theory. Anyway, it turns out a few things have come to light. One, supposedly that it was reported, or at least speculated, that the purchase price for BlockFi was in FTT. It turns out not to be the case. BlockFi claimed that actually the purchase was in cash.
00:25:14.510 - 00:25:51.878, Speaker B: And so they had, I guess, minimal FTT exposure or no FTT exposure. But then, second, so in the interview, what Sam said is that, look, by the time that we actually made these purchases, they had already margin called us. We had very little loans coming from BlockFi or Voyager. And so the reason why we were buying them was purely to kind of stem contagion in crypto, which was at the time, his stated goal. I don't know what you guys think of this story, and again, it's probably hard to put together the truth just because it was so long ago and it doesn't seem like they're keeping records on any of this stuff. But what's your perception of the recasting of the purchases you made over the summer?
00:25:52.054 - 00:26:30.554, Speaker D: Well, the one that I read, and I don't know how much truth there is to this, and this is for the sleuth out there, was that with things like BlockFi in particular, by acquiring BlockFi, they moved a number of BlockFi customer assets to FTX after the fact. And it's possible that it was cash positive for the FTX broader organization, and it also moved assets from the US. Entity into the offshore entity. So the example of how this worked is the US. Entity provided a loan to BlockFi with the US. Entity dollars. The US.
00:26:30.554 - 00:26:58.370, Speaker D: Entity is the one that's highly regulated and everything is kosher, blah, blah, blah. Right then BlockFi moved its customer money to FTX International and more money than FTX US put in. And the net impact of this was money positive for the Commingled Alameda FTX International organization to help buy them time. That's my understanding. But I could be mistaken.
00:26:59.830 - 00:27:34.330, Speaker A: There's one other thing that was funny in this interview, which I thought was hilarious, was like he was like, yeah, in all the jurisdictions where we were forced to follow the rules, like the US. And Japan, people are solvent. And he basically said that, which is basically saying, like, if we were forced to follow the rules, we follow the rules. Which implies if not forced to follow the rules, then we don't have to do anything. And I guess this idea of moving all these US assets offshore in that vein, of trying to avoid any needing to kind of deal with the rules.
00:27:34.770 - 00:27:39.934, Speaker C: Not to shift gears too much, but one thing that I also feel like is somewhat damning or confusing about the.
00:27:39.972 - 00:27:41.120, Speaker A: FTX is.
00:27:42.930 - 00:28:13.466, Speaker C: Being a lender on FTX is opt in. Like you can have your funds on the platform but not have them being lent out. And so the story of know, hey, we had a bunch of bad collateral, we took out some loans, the collateral goes down. That would make sense if those losses were then socialized amongst the people who were part of the lending margin program on FTX, but if you weren't, then your funds should have been separate. So clearly there's some sort of commingling, otherwise this should not have been possible.
00:28:13.648 - 00:28:43.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that we don't really understand even the nature of Sam's story about how exactly he's even claiming mechanically this whole thing would have. You know, I think it's very unlikely we're going to get any clear answers unless either one, somebody who's much deeper in the details actually interviews him, or two, we basically see this thing dragged in front of a trial of some kind.
00:28:44.470 - 00:28:52.130, Speaker A: Arguably the bankruptcy trial will have to unearth half of these questions more deeply. Right, that's why actually I think it was announced.
00:28:52.210 - 00:28:53.238, Speaker B: Why would it?
00:28:53.404 - 00:29:04.198, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it still has to do recovery for it put all the entities in bankruptcy, including Alameda and every random entity except for a very small number like Ledger X and stuff that didn't enter.
00:29:04.284 - 00:29:20.654, Speaker B: Right. But it's not clear to me that this is the kind of thing that would happen in a bankruptcy court. I think it's much more likely that they're just going to find the assets, figure out the creditors, and then figure out how to distribute what's left. A bankruptcy court is not there to figure out who did something wrong. Right.
00:29:20.692 - 00:29:26.394, Speaker D: It's not forensics necessarily, it's tracking down all the money, getting it back, giving it to the people who deserve.
00:29:26.442 - 00:29:54.106, Speaker B: Yeah. So I don't know that we're going to learn anything much from the bankruptcy court other than just what the money was spent on. I think that we'll learn and there will probably be a lot of stuff of people going after Sam personally, going after some of these entities that were separated, going after some of the real estate. So there'll be a lot of that that I think will come out through the bankruptcy proceedings. But I doubt we're going to get again any answers about what really happened. It's just such a complicated question, and a bankruptcy judge isn't really even equipped to investigate that, so yeah.
00:29:54.128 - 00:30:23.940, Speaker A: Although in this case, I feel like one of the reasons I'm a little more convinced some of these details come out is because where and how the assets are stored and custodied right now is still extremely unclear. Based on some of the statements made by the current John Ray of, like, we don't actually know how to get keys for certain things, or some of the custody state is weird. And so I think that will force you to do some forensics in the process, if that makes sense.
00:30:24.870 - 00:31:09.874, Speaker B: Yeah, that is possible. That is possible. Another thing, so after a lot of the FTX fallout, there was also this Binance recovery fund and there's a lot of weirdness around this recovery fund so I don't know how many of you guys been paying attention to this. So CZ announced that hey, Binance is going to step up and we're going know, dedicate a bunch of money to backstop the industry. It looks like there were some contributors, jump contributed, Polygon contributed, GSR contributed, but it looks like there's only 50 million that was total contributed by outsiders as far as we can tell. And then Finance claimed that they were dedicating 1 billion in BUSD to this sort of bailout fund. Tom, you were going in some detail on the story.
00:31:09.874 - 00:31:12.674, Speaker B: What are we seeing with this Binance recovery fund thing?
00:31:12.792 - 00:31:54.830, Speaker C: Well, I think people just are a bit confused because basically the address that Binance listed as the recovery fund is like a single address that was moved from a Binance Hot wallet. His address was moved from like Binance Seven. So it's like why is the entire recovery fund being stored in a single wallet and why was it moved from a Binance wallet? It's just very confusing right now and especially given that CZ also sounds like he's trying to go out and raise more money for this. So yeah, there isn't really a really very clear story around this, I think is it Huawei or OK is also trying to start their own recovery fund? So I guess now everyone has a recovery fund as well.
00:31:54.900 - 00:32:03.874, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have these recovery funds now, but what are they bailing out? Things are exploding and they are just kind of sitting and watching. I don't understand what this is for.
00:32:03.992 - 00:32:07.110, Speaker A: They're shibalist for society to take you seriously.
00:32:08.330 - 00:32:15.174, Speaker B: Sam was right all along, you guys. It turns out he was telling the truth when nobody else would admit it.
00:32:15.372 - 00:32:39.470, Speaker D: Well, I think Binance is, and this is my hunch binance is going to bail out all the programs from the Binance launchpad and their incubator and all these low to mid tier projects that have run out of money or lost all their funds on FTX or whatever, anything that they've backed in the know. They can probably bail out those teams, the couple million dollars to get them to keep building in the Binance.
00:32:39.810 - 00:33:16.938, Speaker A: I saw a bunch of posts like this that were like developer on Solana move to BSc or move to BNB chain, sorry, BNB chain. And I think there's something about Binance is using this as an opportunity to grow the BNB chain ecosystem. It's really an ecosystem. I mean, it was interesting I mean, not that this is the metric you should always look at because it's quite gameable, but it was interesting that Pancake Swap flipped Uniswap TVL this weekend, not coincidental with the arrival of this fund. So there's something weird about the there's something going on in BNB chain land.
00:33:17.024 - 00:33:18.570, Speaker B: That I think is meaningless.
00:33:20.590 - 00:33:24.800, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. No, and this is comparing V two s.
00:33:26.770 - 00:33:29.934, Speaker D: Well, just V two. Who cares about V Two? Because it's all moving to V Three.
00:33:29.972 - 00:33:34.750, Speaker A: Where it's more but all the really low liquidity random coins are in V Two.
00:33:34.820 - 00:33:37.242, Speaker B: Does pancake swap have a V three equivalent?
00:33:37.386 - 00:33:58.762, Speaker A: No, not yet. But the V three license expires when? Like, April. So I feel like everyone's just going to deploy, like, right now. There's this thing where everyone who wants to deploy V three has to go to Uniswap governance, get governance to approve deploying on your chain. And obviously, I'd say Uniswap governance is very anti BNB chain, so I don't see that ever happening.
00:33:58.896 - 00:34:03.290, Speaker D: But that's why Uniswap governance will extend the license for another year.
00:34:03.360 - 00:34:04.780, Speaker B: Oh, can they choose to do that?
00:34:07.470 - 00:34:15.214, Speaker D: The actual terms of the business source license are governance can grant additions and licensees to it, or it can change.
00:34:15.252 - 00:34:28.800, Speaker B: The date of okay, so just so I understand, because I'm not super close to this, so if somebody goes and deploys Univ three on BNB chain, what happens? Like, who sues who? How does this work?
00:34:30.310 - 00:34:38.098, Speaker D: I don't know if we're actually going to find this out, but I assume Uniswap the protocol votes to hire a.
00:34:38.104 - 00:34:39.910, Speaker B: Law firm to sue some projects.
00:34:40.490 - 00:34:42.262, Speaker D: I have no idea. I have no idea.
00:34:42.316 - 00:34:46.466, Speaker C: I think it's actually supposed to be litigated in Claros court. If I'm familiar with the unisoft.
00:34:46.498 - 00:34:46.786, Speaker A: License.
00:34:46.818 - 00:34:48.360, Speaker C: You guys can correct me on that.
00:34:50.090 - 00:35:06.240, Speaker A: Wait, do you remember what was that trial that happened of that guy Yaz? Like, there was this fake trial trying to censor him, and it was like kind of a kangaroo court in Claros. I forget if it was Claros or somewhere. No, aragon. Aragon is where we saw some crazy.
00:35:06.610 - 00:35:07.946, Speaker D: Yeah, Aragon was nuts.
00:35:07.978 - 00:35:16.002, Speaker A: Aragon was nuts. Aragon was like a kangaroo court. It was somehow we found a way to build all the technology to reinvent Soviet Russia in the 1920s.
00:35:16.056 - 00:36:08.658, Speaker B: Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay, well, speaking of speaking of chaos in DFI, so we did have also last week, a very interesting attack that took place against Ave, and this kind of caused reverberations across all the lending protocols in DFI. So, Tarun and Robert, I assume you guys are closest to this, but I'll give the very, very high level. So we talked before about the Mango Markets attacker, avi Eisenberg abraham Eisenberg is his full name. So he was the one who manipulated Mango Markets and to have a very profitable trading strategy, quote unquote, he announced earlier this idea that he could basically do an attack against Ave by borrowing assets that were less liquid than Ave was kind of giving them credit for and essentially manipulating markets after doing large loans. So I think essentially, the way the attack, it's probably better if you walk through it.
00:36:08.658 - 00:36:19.778, Speaker B: Describe for us what exactly happened with the attack, what happened with Curve and all the kind of play by play why Ave ended up incurring bad debt at the end of this episode.
00:36:19.954 - 00:37:05.054, Speaker A: Well, I mean, the bad debt that the protocol had is the thing that you should be more worried about at the end. Not the ones he made. But he was sort of doing a little bit of the opposite of what happened in Mango, where instead of trying to push the price up of some piece of collateral to borrow everything, he actually put some USDC's collateral then shorted Curve tried to push the price down. And then basically by pushing it down, he basically could borrow all of the supply of Curve. And then if it mean reverted, then you can do a Mango style thing. Now, he didn't really analyze where curve liquidity was. There are not many places to get curve.
00:37:05.054 - 00:37:38.160, Speaker A: For instance, convex finance is a place where people end up locking up curve for multiple years, and there's quite a bit of liquidity in there. And so it was easy for people to take the other side of his trade and basically grief him for shorting this in the way he did. The protocol realized bad debt because basically there wasn't enough curve to do the liquidations. And so it was just expensive in some way, a sense. But the total amount of bad debt was like under $2 million, so it was relatively small.
00:37:38.530 - 00:37:38.894, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:38.932 - 00:38:04.534, Speaker A: So I think at the end of the day, the sheer destruction in overall liquidity since the FTX incident has made these Mango sale things more likely, which is why I think people are being much more cautious now. But the main point is, in the V three s of both compound nave, there are borrow and supply caps which you can use to kind of limit the max size of these types of.
00:38:04.652 - 00:38:26.574, Speaker B: So, if I can summarize in a sentence, there were some stale parameters for borrowing and lending long tail, mostly borrowing long tail assets. And these parameters assumed market conditions that looked more like January than that look like today. And all the stuff, ironically, that we've been talking about with credit destruction for.
00:38:26.612 - 00:38:29.742, Speaker A: Mango, it's actually quite different versus Mango is different.
00:38:29.796 - 00:38:30.400, Speaker B: Yes.
00:38:31.330 - 00:39:23.262, Speaker A: In Mango it was sort of the long tail parameters. Here, there's this weird thing where the collateral used was actually like good collateral, and the liquidation threshold was somewhat high. And it's actually very hard to convince people to lower liquidation thresholds in these communities on the major assets, meaning ETH, WBTC, USDC, Tether, so Avi put up USDC and then shorted curve. So it's a little bit more nuanced if you actually go and look in the details. But yes, it's one of these things where liquidity conditions deteriorated going through governance took. By the time the proposal would make it through, it was late, and so we submitted a proposal and froze stuff. But I guess the point is, I think it was sort of unprecedented, but it wasn't like a huge loss.
00:39:23.262 - 00:39:41.798, Speaker A: Also, Maker had some bad debt as well last week from Gemini Earn. So if you remember, Maker put part of the safety module into Gemini Earn to earn some yield and it incurred some losses from that and has written them off and paid back.
00:39:41.964 - 00:39:46.694, Speaker D: How much did it put into Gemini Earn? And isn't Gemini Earn Genesis? Yeah.
00:39:46.732 - 00:40:00.422, Speaker A: So they wrote it off completely and just paying it and die back to the it was about $2 million. It was almost the same. They were just starting this program. It was like dripping into Genesis Earn.
00:40:00.486 - 00:40:06.160, Speaker B: Great that they were lucky. Yeah, that's great that they I mean, it's not luck, right? Like, they did the slow rollout. That's great. Good for them.
00:40:06.850 - 00:40:38.678, Speaker A: Well, it's not just a slow there is some luck in that the timing of when this happens could have been totally different, of course. But my point is, both protocols had these kind of events. They were relatively small communities, responded pretty quickly. So I would just say that and you can see how the debt is and people are all fighting about it versus, like, I don't know, how did Genesis get like, billions of dollars of debt and not liquidate anyone? It's kind of mild.
00:40:38.774 - 00:40:44.700, Speaker D: Good question. Because the humans didn't want to liquidate their best customers.
00:40:47.390 - 00:41:37.814, Speaker C: Yes, that is definitely true. I think for Genesis and for Gemini Earn specifically, my understanding is that's actually a large bulk of sort of the debt, it's like almost a billion dollars is coming from Gemini Earn. And I think there's inherently this weird issue which I don't know why these programs are set up this way where you set inherent duration mismatches, right, where you sell these sort of yield services to retail customers with the idea that you can always deposit, you can always withdraw like a bank. But then on the backside you're making fixed term loans to market makers. And so even if the loans are fine, you're setting yourself up for a bank run because inherently there's no way to sort of and these aren't very liquid assets. It's not like you can go to the Fed and borrow against them or sell them easily. It's like these are sort of weird bespoke lending agreements.
00:41:37.814 - 00:41:56.170, Speaker C: And so it's almost as if you raise a few million dollars and you told all the Gemini Earned depositors to go on vacation for six months when these loans are supposed to expire and they get their loans back. That is almost like an easier solution rather than trying to get everyone immediate liquidity for a product that just isn't designed to have immediate liquidity.
00:41:56.330 - 00:42:02.882, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's true. But I mean, what you're describing is banking and that's what Genesis is. Genesis is a bank. Right.
00:42:02.936 - 00:42:22.370, Speaker C: I guess my question is why did Gemini not sort of bake that into the SLAs? The idea that in certain market conditions, it's not guaranteed you're going to be able to withdraw one to one or put some limitations on that or something. I guess better. I mean, you're right that I guess this is just banking, but it's weird to me that they're not more presented more clearly upfront.
00:42:22.530 - 00:43:05.286, Speaker B: Yeah, Gemini is one of the biggest creditors and I think that's who Genesis is negotiating with right now. Because if Gemini pushes them into bankruptcy, then it's all going to be a gigantic mess. And I think it's pretty clear that's not good for Gemini or for Gemini customers. But yeah, I think the answer, unfortunately, is that that's what banking is. And banking is basically the business of duration mismatch and trying to manage that duration mismatch so that it doesn't explode in your face. And that's why eventually we invented central banks, is because managing those duration mismatches in times of real trial generally requires a bigger, stronger bank to come and save. You know, if you recall, that's what we thought CZ was doing when we thought it was still a duration mismatch thing.
00:43:05.286 - 00:43:18.326, Speaker B: Now we know it's not a duration mismatch thing, but that was presumably what the story was about how Binance was going to save FTX. That was basically a pseudo central bank stepping in to help a weaker bank.
00:43:18.518 - 00:43:52.226, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, in all of these cases you have entities in the case of FTX, it was essentially running out, making venture investments and buying up all these things with FTX customer money. In Genesis's case, it's having know, longer term assets, longer term loans against really short term. Gemini earn customer money that wants to withdraw every time bad things happen. In all these cases, it's investing for the long term with liabilities that can be demanded on a moment's notice.
00:43:52.338 - 00:44:34.882, Speaker B: Yeah, it's true. And I think look, I agree with you Robert, that DeFi shows us a much better way to resolve these problems. It's much better to have everything out in the open, have smart people thinking about this and not just a management team that's pushed into a corner and has to make up stuff to defend itself. We've seen the same behavior basically from FTX as from Genesis, which is that they just say whatever they need to, to keep deposits on platform. As the deposits leave, then all of a sudden everybody just goes quiet. So as a result of this attack, which to be clear, we're actually not sure whether Avi made money from this attack because presumably he was shorting it on a centralized exchange. And so we don't know how the positions ended out.
00:44:35.016 - 00:44:38.558, Speaker A: We do know the open interest and it was not very high on any of those.
00:44:38.584 - 00:44:51.506, Speaker C: I was going to say there was only like 70 mil in open interest on curve perp. So I think he just evaporated 40 mil unless he had maybe some long exposure. But I don't know if there's like a gigabrain move for the curve short.
00:44:51.548 - 00:44:53.740, Speaker B: I see. So we think most likely he lost money.
00:44:54.190 - 00:44:57.802, Speaker A: Do you think someone like that wouldn't be bragging about it if they even broke even?
00:44:57.856 - 00:44:58.700, Speaker B: That's fair.
00:45:00.510 - 00:45:21.262, Speaker C: I think specifically he was, like, building up this short because he was trying to reach so Michael, the Curve founder, has, like, I think, a few hundred mil in Curve as collateral and so trying to hit his liquidation threshold, which was like $0.25 in the hope that that would cause it to sort of massive dump and unfortunately got discovered and squeezed.
00:45:21.326 - 00:45:31.990, Speaker B: Right, yeah. And then Curve released their white paper for their stable coin in the middle of this thing, which was emergency pocket white paper. Exactly. A great move to have in your utility belt when you need it.
00:45:32.140 - 00:45:52.220, Speaker A: I will say my one criticism, there's maybe some benefits and merits to puts in that paper, but it's very underspecified. But I will say my one criticism is I don't think any DeFi mechanism needs to use the word adiabatic because it has nothing to do with crypto. And that paper has it six times.
00:45:53.790 - 00:46:04.218, Speaker B: Sing it, Tarun. Yeah. Okay. So the consequence of this is that obviously there was some bad debt on Ave. Ave is going to pay that back. So I think Ave is going to be fine. It's a relatively small amount of debt for Ave as well as for maker.
00:46:04.218 - 00:46:12.958, Speaker B: And then Ave paused lending markets for 17 of their tokens compound, then went and did the same thing, which is, I think, a different set of, like, ten tokens.
00:46:13.134 - 00:46:23.686, Speaker A: No, the problem is Ave V two doesn't have caps. There's no, like, debt ceiling. I see ave V three does.
00:46:23.868 - 00:47:00.450, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. So until Ave V three arrives, for now, Ave has paused the lending markets for these tokens compound, instituted these borrow caps, and I think Ave will do the same once they migrate to V three. I think this is a good place to end on, because I know Tarun, you've got to stop here. But it really speaks to the difference again, which we've talked about again and again over the last three weeks, between DFI and CFI in any time, where you have a lot of market instability and you have credit kind of collapsing and a lot of fear in the markets, bad things happen. But you can just see how stark the difference is between what happened in DeFi and what happened in centralized players. Right.
00:47:00.450 - 00:47:34.902, Speaker B: Genesis likely going to bankruptcy, BlockFi imploded, every single lender in the space has basically died. And then, of course, FTX has gone under in absolute disgrace. When Aave and compound were facing the same pressure, what did they do? Except everybody shows up, puts together their collective brain power, sees exactly what's happening with the exposures, and pulls things down. And on the whole, despite the fact there was a coordinated attack, that's not even what was happening at FTX. At FTX, they did it to themselves. But in this case, this was an attacker trying to bring down the platform. And the thing performed beautifully.
00:47:34.902 - 00:47:41.754, Speaker B: It took on only a million and half of bad debt, which was like less than 1% of the debt in the protocol, I think, like less than half a percent of the debt in the protocol.
00:47:41.882 - 00:48:06.070, Speaker A: Yeah. To put into context, the bad debt to revenue ratio is still less than when I was looking at the Fed numbers. Relative to that, I think it ends up being like three or 4%. And the average bad debt to leverage ratio for secured lending below credit grade in the US is like 15%. So it's still quite a bit lower in terms of things like that.
00:48:06.220 - 00:48:07.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:07.212 - 00:48:22.010, Speaker A: Before we end, I actually want to ask question to each of you, which is, what is your prediction for the Telegram decks? Telegram announced today that they were going to like, they're going to have NFTs and the decks and this field 2018. Right again.
00:48:22.160 - 00:48:22.474, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:22.512 - 00:48:26.894, Speaker D: This is all the way back to the origin. Isn't this what they were told they weren't allowed to do?
00:48:26.932 - 00:48:29.998, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why I'm like I'm like, whoa, right.
00:48:30.004 - 00:49:06.234, Speaker B: It was a securities issuance violation. So they said, okay, we're not doing Telegram open network, and then some random people supposedly grabbed the source code and decided they were going to spin it up. And then Telegram, or at least Durov, looked at this and was like, oh, this is so cool, it's actually working. We are going to start supporting this blockchain within Telegram, despite the fact that they had to give the money back to investors that they originally raised, which was a massive amount of amount of money. So, okay, my prediction for the honestly, I haven't been following it super closely. I saw the announcement today. It seems like Ton Token has a huge market cap.
00:49:06.234 - 00:49:25.150, Speaker B: I think it's valued like 2 billion circulating and 5 billion FTV, but very low liquidity. There's very little of this thing trading on any venue, and I think it's like the biggest exchange it's on is Okx and it trades like a couple million a day on Okx. So I don't know, I have a hard time squaring this, but I'm not personally a believer in the messenger.
00:49:26.210 - 00:49:35.620, Speaker A: They're building a dex in the messenger, which to me basically is all those Telegram OTC groups that people are trying to sell you coins in telegram is trying to compete with them.
00:49:36.390 - 00:49:38.674, Speaker B: Bad timing, but yeah, fair enough.
00:49:38.872 - 00:49:58.810, Speaker C: A friend of mine sent me a Ton token recently because I didn't really sort of believe this wallet story, but then I learned that because I have a US phone number, I'm actually not allowed to have a Telegram wallet. So if you hated region gated exchanges and region gated DEXes and region gated relayers, you're going to love the region gated blockchain.
00:50:00.590 - 00:50:05.370, Speaker A: Or region gated messenger, I guess. Yeah, region locked messenger.
00:50:05.530 - 00:50:07.226, Speaker B: Robert, what's your prediction?
00:50:07.418 - 00:50:08.894, Speaker D: I can't speculate on this.
00:50:08.932 - 00:50:10.400, Speaker B: All right, Tariq, what do you think?
00:50:10.850 - 00:50:16.318, Speaker A: Like I said, I think their goal is to kill the OTC chats that are in Telegram.
00:50:16.494 - 00:50:45.990, Speaker B: Fair enough. Well, we'll have to see what happens. I think this is probably so just as a quick caveat before we wrap up the show, normally the show is done every two weeks. We've been doing this weekly basically since FTX exploded, just because the velocity of news has been so crazy. It seems like now things are finally stabilizing. Obviously there's still after effects and contagion that we've yet to see from FTX, but I think the velocity of news has slowed down. So we're probably going to be going back to doing the show every two weeks.
00:50:45.990 - 00:50:59.260, Speaker B: But thank you everybody for tuning in. It's been amazing to see how excited you you guys are to hear from us and get our views on what's going on in the space, hoping that things calm down a bit. Thank you everybody, and you'll hear from us again soon.
