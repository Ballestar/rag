00:00:00.330 - 00:00:56.138, Speaker A: You. If you've heard of NFTs ICOs or decentralized finance, then you've been touched by Ethereum, the more than 500 billion dollar network that has fought the biggest trends in crypto over the last several years. I covered history and how it became the launch pad for the 2017 initial coin offering media. In my book the Crypto Fiance Idealism Greed, Lies and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Crate. The Cryptopians tells the tale of Ethereum's founding power struggle, gives the inside story of the network's first existential crisis, the Dow hack, and depicts the global ICO phenomenon, which boosted prices and the fortunes of a few. It's a page turner that appeals to both newbies and crypto OGS alike. Even though I have covered crypto as a journalist for six and a half years, in this book I reveal all kinds of secrets and shed light on enduring mysteries.
