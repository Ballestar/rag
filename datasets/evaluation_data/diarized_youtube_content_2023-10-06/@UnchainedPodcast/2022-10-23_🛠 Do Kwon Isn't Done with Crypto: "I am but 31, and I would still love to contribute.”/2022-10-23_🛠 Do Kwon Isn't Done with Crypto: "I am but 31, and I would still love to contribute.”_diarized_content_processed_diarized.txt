00:00:00.250 - 00:00:01.902, Speaker A: One of the things that I hope.
00:00:01.956 - 00:00:21.358, Speaker B: The next few years would clarify is what happened with Terra was it wasn't a scam, like, it wasn't a fraud, right? It was a massive market failure. But I think one of the things I want to clarify is I believed in the need and the viability for.
00:00:21.444 - 00:00:25.782, Speaker C: Decentralized algorithmic stablecoins more than anyone else.
00:00:25.916 - 00:00:27.270, Speaker B: And as founders.
00:00:29.530 - 00:00:33.938, Speaker A: We sometimes have a bias, and in some cases, Ernest bias.
00:00:34.034 - 00:00:35.942, Speaker D: For being bullish, right?
00:00:35.996 - 00:00:37.446, Speaker A: So a lot of people say that.
00:00:37.468 - 00:00:40.154, Speaker C: I'm an idiot for buying bitcoin right.
00:00:40.192 - 00:00:42.218, Speaker E: Before it was about to crash or something like that.
00:00:42.304 - 00:00:46.922, Speaker B: But dispositionally speaking, isn't crypto made better.
00:00:46.976 - 00:00:48.474, Speaker E: Or any industry made better?
00:00:48.592 - 00:00:51.578, Speaker D: If there are people that just a.
00:00:51.584 - 00:00:54.566, Speaker B: Little bit believe in things and is.
00:00:54.608 - 00:00:57.886, Speaker E: More optimistic than other people about how things are going to pan out and.
00:00:57.908 - 00:00:59.806, Speaker C: How things are going to work, I.
00:00:59.828 - 00:01:02.014, Speaker A: Think the most important thing is we.
00:01:02.052 - 00:01:05.386, Speaker E: Really did try to hold ourselves to a pretty high standard of integrity.
00:01:05.498 - 00:01:07.810, Speaker C: And I think now we're starting to.
00:01:07.960 - 00:01:10.226, Speaker F: Make some attempts to make sure that.
00:01:10.328 - 00:01:19.958, Speaker E: We provide the right kind of information out there so that people can understand what happened better. We are a pretty small organization at this point, so there's sometimes going to.
00:01:19.964 - 00:01:21.238, Speaker C: Be things that we won't be able.
00:01:21.244 - 00:01:23.414, Speaker D: To answer everything right, because there's just.
00:01:23.452 - 00:01:26.310, Speaker C: Too much accusations coming out and some.
00:01:26.380 - 00:01:29.702, Speaker E: Without any factual basis or something like that. But we are trying our best.
00:01:29.836 - 00:01:31.386, Speaker F: In terms of when it comes to.
00:01:31.408 - 00:01:34.746, Speaker C: My life, I think the way that.
00:01:34.768 - 00:01:35.706, Speaker F: I think about it is I am.
00:01:35.728 - 00:01:43.354, Speaker C: But 31 and I would still love to contribute, so it is going to be an exciting time because I think.
00:01:43.552 - 00:01:45.270, Speaker F: More of the work that I'm going.
00:01:45.280 - 00:01:46.986, Speaker C: To be doing is going to be in the cold.
00:01:47.098 - 00:01:48.510, Speaker F: I get to do a lot more.
00:01:48.580 - 00:01:54.346, Speaker C: Engineering, which I didn't get to do in 2021 when terror was just exploding.

00:02:02.690 - 00:02:04.766, Speaker C: Time in my life in terms of.
00:02:04.788 - 00:02:06.326, Speaker D: The work that I do and the.
