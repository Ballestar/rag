00:00:03.130 - 00:01:03.122, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap Voyager rejects FTX and Alameda Proposal Last Friday, FTX and Alameda Research offered a proposal to grant quick liquidity to customers of Voyager, the recently declared bankrupt crypto lender. In summary, Alameda would purchase customer assets from Voyager with cash and put them into escrow. At the same time, FTX would authorize Voyager customers to create an account and quickly cash out or hold their distressed remaining assets on the FTX exchange. As Sam Bankman Fried described in a tweet thread on the topic. Voyager quickly shot the proposal down, filing its declination on Sunday and describing the proposal as a low ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue, reports the block. In the filing, Voyager claimed that FTX and Alameda made misleading or outright false claims and ignored the tax implications of converting crypto claims to US.
00:01:03.122 - 00:01:38.442, Speaker A: Dollars. According to the bloc, Voyager would be willing to listen to a serious proposal that could potentially better its customers over the crypto lender's current plans. Bitcoin and Digital assets rally on 75 point rate increase following the Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by 75 basis points, the crypto market experienced a substantial surge as bitcoin swelled 9.6% on Wednesday and Ether jumped 15.5% after the increase. Rates are between 2.25% and 2.5%,
00:01:38.442 - 00:02:25.194, Speaker A: the highest levels since before March 2020. As for why the rate increase is good for Bitcoin, Alfonso Peccatello, author of the Macrocompass newsletter, explained on Twitter, if the Fed isn't going to force tighter financial conditions on autopilot anymore, real yields will actually start declining again. With that in mind, he added, when real yields decline, valuation intensive and risk sentiment driven asset classes outperform. That's because the marginal return for owning cash US. Dollars becomes less attractive and the incentive to chase risk assets is larger, such as QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 and Bitcoin. In related news, gross domestic product declined at an annual pace of zero 9% in Q.
00:02:25.232 - 00:02:51.890, Speaker B: Two Celsius customer Emails Leaked On Thursday afternoon, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius emailed its customers stating that their email addresses had been leaked to a third party. The breach occurred through its vendor customer IO, and was the same vendor that had leaked OpenSea customer email addresses a month ago, zero Hedge tweeted. Just when you thought the Celsius circus couldn't turn any more ridiculous.
00:02:52.710 - 00:04:07.718, Speaker A: Kraken to be fined for Serving Iranians Kraken a crypto exchange valued at $11 billion is reportedly under investigation by the US. Treasury Department. The New York Times broke the news on Tuesday, revealing that the Office of Foreign Assets Control has been investigating the exchange since 2019 for allegedly violating US. Sanctions by allowing users in Iran to trade in cryptocurrencies. As for what the investigation is likely to find, the report confirmed the existence of a spreadsheet sent in Kraken's company, Slack Channel, showing that the exchange had 1522 people with residences in Iran, along with 149 in Syria and 83 in Cuba, which are also sanctioned countries. The Times expects there to be a fine speaking of regulation, the much anticipated Bipartisan Stablecoin bill is being shelved over the August congressional recess without draft text seeing the light of day, Representative Maxine Waters explained in a statement. Although their ranking member Patrick McHenry, Secretary Janet Yellen and I have made considerable progress towards an agreement on the legislation, we are unfortunately not there yet and will therefore continue our negotiations over the August recess.
00:04:07.718 - 00:05:02.240, Speaker A: She added, according to the blog, we want to make sure that this bill, this law is technically proficient and a workable law. We don't want a dead letter as soon as we pass this thing. The US. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is transforming its fintech group Lab CFTC into a new unit called the Office of Technology Innovation, which will help the regulator handle the crypto space. Senators Pat Toomey and Kirsten Sinema introduced a bill exempting small crypto transactions from capital gains. The bill would make any transaction under $50 free of capital gains taxes and includes an increase to adjust for inflation. Harmony's 100 Million Dollar Solution Inflation After losing $99 million in the Horizon Bridge hack, the Harmony team published its reimbursement plan this week with the hopes to make wallets either 50% or 100% whole.
00:05:02.240 - 00:06:02.640, Speaker A: The proposal establishes a three year program structured around a hard fork that will inflate the supply of one Harmony's native token through two different options a 50% reimbursement with a minting of 2.48 billion tokens, or a 100% reimbursement with a minting of 4.98 billion tokens with a total supply of â‚©13.1 billion. The proposal plans to print an additional 19% or 38% one tokens to pay back the users affected by the attack via inflation. The team explained the decision as forward looking we decided against using the foundation treasury in the interest of the longevity and well being of the project, as reimbursing from the treasury would greatly hinder the Foundation's ability to support the growth of Harmony and its ecosystem. Harmony foundation is committed to continuing supporting Harmony for years to come, and plans to reserve the foundation tokens to facilitate this.
00:06:02.640 - 00:06:44.960, Speaker A: Comments on the Governance Forum post took umbridge with this approach. For example, Forum participant Diluted to Zero was especially frank with his or her disdain regarding Harmony's proposal. Two weeks for the shitty proposal and no repeg payment in one aka inflation and coins becoming worthless. A hard fork to kill the small chance this chain had WTF. It boggles my mind that not only do we lose money, we also pay for the reimbursement ourselves via inflation. You guys have no shame to call this a reimbursement proposal, he or she wrote. The community will begin voting on the proposal on August 1.
00:06:44.960 - 00:07:41.840, Speaker A: The hacks never stop. This week, we saw two multimillion dollar hacks Audius, a Web Three music platform, lost $6 million in governance tokens after a hacker was able to manipulate an old security bug in the open Zeppelin contract, forming the basis for audience's governance system. Overall, the attacker was able to get away with roughly $1 million. On Thursday, Nirvana, a Salana based DFI protocol, lost $3.5 million to a flash loan attack that drained its liquidity pools. As of press time, its governance token Ana is down 80%. Keeping up with the Governance Posts Lido Finance, the leading decentralized staking service known for its Steeth product, has been locked into a community battle over the seal of 2% of Lido Dow Governance Tokens, which Lido is attempting to swap for stablecoins to secure runway for a potentially yearslong bear market.
00:07:41.840 - 00:08:48.902, Speaker A: Earlier this week, the Lido Dow voted against a proposal calling for Dragonfly Capital to purchase 10 million LDO tokens, or 1% of the LDO supply, over concerns stemming from a lack of vesting. By Tuesday, the community returned with a new proposal that called for a vesting arrangement of one year and also increased the purchase price from a dollar 45 to a seven day average of the LDO price at the time, plus a 5% premium. By the time this podcast airs, the new vote should be underway. Sushi swap's team put forward Jonathan Howard, a software engineer with NFT Experience, for Head Chef this week. The proposal, if passed, would call for an ambitious salary plan. The Dow would be on the hook to pay Howard $800,000 in stablecoins on a yearly basis, plus roughly $750,000 worth of Sushi tokens over a four year vesting period. On top of that, there is a 350,000 Sushi bonus for hitting certain metrics and a price rise payout that could net Howard $8.35
00:08:48.902 - 00:09:31.970, Speaker A: million if Sushi rose above $11. Again, while many of the comments were positive, it was noted by community member Dr. Anon 911 that such an aggressive offer could leave Sushi swap without much of a budget. Assuming the funds for this proposal come out of the operational multisig, which has 2.67 million USDC and 250,000 Sushi. If this guy leaves day one, he will take with him 60% of the USDC and all of the Sushi, with still 50K yet to be paid. The treasury only has 90K USDC, with the rest being almost entirely the $15 million worth of Sushi, wrote Dr.
00:09:31.970 - 00:10:17.026, Speaker A: Anon 911. As of press time, 57% of 102 voters had voted for Jonathan to take over. Time for Fun Bits Coinbase's Dgen Trilogy Well made, but crypto natives gave it a thumbs down Coinbase has had a tough few weeks. It had to stall hiring of former employees being charged with insider trading. And now, as covered in this week's episode, the SEC is investigating the exchange for supporting the trading of securities. Even with all that, Coinbase is still shipping, as evidenced by the unveiling of a trailer for part one of the Dgen Trilogy, a Board Ape Yacht Club themed movie series. While I thought it was well done, the male voiceover actor is awesome.
00:10:17.026 - 00:10:52.110, Speaker A: Many crypto natives didn't seem to have the same opinion, Greg. Unfortunately, I'll never be able to get those five minutes of life back. Aubrey Strobel, did you lay off employees to fund the production of this coinbureau? The SEC should rather be investigating this for illegally inducing cringe. Thanks so much for joining us today.
