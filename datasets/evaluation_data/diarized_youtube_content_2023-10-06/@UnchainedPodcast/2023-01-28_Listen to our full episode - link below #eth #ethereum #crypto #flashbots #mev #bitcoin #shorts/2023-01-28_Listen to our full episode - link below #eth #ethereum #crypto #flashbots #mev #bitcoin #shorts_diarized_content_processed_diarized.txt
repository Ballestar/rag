00:00:00.410 - 00:00:57.934, Speaker A: The last thing we want to do is create systems where being a bad person or creating externalities is better for you individually and is more profitable than being a good actor and behaving within the rules of the system. I think this is a big way that TradFi has failed. In TradFi, if you seek to game the edges of the system, that's the most profitable thing you can possibly do, right? And necessarily need to lead to a social good. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. It doesn't matter. So I think one thing Flashbots really doesn't want to do is advantage people who are willing to extract mev, right? In a world where we say, everyone, please, let's just be kumbaya, leave this on the table, we don't want it to be the case that if you do do it, you'll be way more profitable, right? So that's a big part of creating a level playing field, especially in geopolitically complicated universe like Crypto, where we do have bad actors. Like North Korea does ethereum transactions every day.
00:00:57.934 - 00:00:58.780, Speaker A: You know what I mean? Things like.
