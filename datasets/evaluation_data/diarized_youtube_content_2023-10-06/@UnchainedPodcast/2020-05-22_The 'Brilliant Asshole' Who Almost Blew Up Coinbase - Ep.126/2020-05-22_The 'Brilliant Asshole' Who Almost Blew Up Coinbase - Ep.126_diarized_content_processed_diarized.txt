00:02:33.786 - 00:02:35.230, Speaker B: Hi, Laura, thanks for having me.
00:02:35.300 - 00:02:42.094, Speaker A: Congratulations on your recent book, which is first being released on audio. Can you give us an overview of what it's about?
00:02:42.292 - 00:03:21.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I wanted to tell the story of crypto. There's other bitcoin books out there, of course, but I wanted to make this accessible to a broader audience, people in finance, people in academia. So what it is, is a sort of a plain English narrative of the story of Coinbase to tell the larger story of crypto and how Wall Street and Silicon Valley are coming closer together. And it also includes a lot of gossip about the early days of crypto and the infighting in the world of crypto and also just how they pulled it off to my thesis is Coinbase is basically becoming the crypto version of Morgan. They're going to be a bank one day and I wanted to tell the evolution of how that came to be.
00:03:22.350 - 00:03:26.320, Speaker A: And in the course of the evolution, what would you say were the biggest turning points?
00:03:27.570 - 00:04:18.890, Speaker B: I think the story of crypto forgive me, I'm going to answer the question broadly at first. The larger story of crypto, I think, or its biggest challenge, is to go from being sort of a subculture of tech people who are passionate about it to something that can be embraced by everyone. And I think they're getting there slowly. And I think Coinbase has played a big role in that. I think by trying to walk the legal line, they've helped to mainstream it. But in terms of specific turning points, I think the funding rounds, obviously, and I think just their success in building a highly usable app and also I think just sort of winning over enough mainstream people is what was one of the tipping points. Because the other thing I discovered in reporting the book, a lot of people don't like Coinbase very much in terms of the old school crypto people because they're know not your coins, not your keys.
00:04:18.890 - 00:04:39.670, Speaker B: And I understand the position, but the thesis I think I try to make is that there's room enough for both camps. If you're know, hardcore stored only on your own wallet, that's fine, nothing's stopping you. And I think Coinbase has bringing in millions more bitcoin buyers has helped build an ecosystem so that crypto in general can flourish.
00:04:40.250 - 00:05:06.880, Speaker A: And part of the reason people object to Coinbase holding people's keys and the fact that it goes against that not your keys, not your coins ethos, is that it really puts the onus of security on a centralized place, which makes that also an attractive honeypot for attackers. So in terms of security, which basically was pretty much of the utmost priority for Coinbase, how did that go for them?
00:05:07.490 - 00:05:44.380, Speaker B: I think a tidbit I reveal in my book because Coinbase likes to boast they've never been hacked. That's not actually true. In the early days when there was just five of them, I think it was Charlie Lee and Brian and Fred Ursom and a couple of other folks people, one of their outside vendors did get in and robbed their hot wallet to the tune of $250,000. Can't remember how many bitcoins it was at the time, but it was a lot. This was a long time ago, of course, this was like 2013 or 2014, but that's something I uncovered in the reporting. So that Coinbase is very secure and has a good reputation, but they haven't been infallible, that's for sure.
00:05:45.070 - 00:05:55.200, Speaker A: And another time when it seemed that Coinbase was at ODS with the broader crypto community, was during the bitcoin block size debate. What is your take on how Coinbase handled that?
00:05:55.650 - 00:06:53.300, Speaker B: Well, I think there's, you know, I mean, I cited your excellent article on the big blockers versus small blockers war of 2015 and 2016, and I confess I had some sympathy for Coinbase in that, because this will probably not make me very popular, but I find a lot of the more ideological people in crypto sort of tribal. And I don't think Brian helped himself because I think he wrote a blog post saying you're immature and stuff. You don't win over people that way. So I think there's sort of fault on both sides, but at the same know. I think a lot of the Crypto believers, they love crypto, they love bitcoin, but can also shoot themselves in the foot a little bit. By making it such a sort of subculture and insiders group that if they keep up that attitude, crypto cannot go mainstream because it's just too unapproachable from a social and a technological point of view. So I do have some sympathy for Brian and the Coinbase crew on that one.
00:06:53.830 - 00:07:18.440, Speaker A: And as you kind of alluded to earlier, coinbase has had a tricky line to walk, which is that they've been trying to comply with regulation while also serving this broader crypto community, which does contain more libertarian elements and also has its origins and the cypherpunk movement. How would you say Coinbase has navigated those?
00:07:20.810 - 00:07:53.794, Speaker B: I mean, Coinbase has also skirted regulatory lines a few times. Another thing I bring up in the book, too, is in the early days I thought this was sort of funny, actually, because Apple didn't allow crypto trading on their apps once upon a time. So Brian and Fred Ursom decided to geofence Cupertino, which is sort of funny. So that meant that anyone in Cupertino would not be able to trade or buy and sell on the app. And of course, Cupertino is where Apple's quality check and engineers are. So that was sort of a clever hack. So meanwhile, everyone else was trading as far as Apple could tell.
00:07:53.794 - 00:08:37.858, Speaker B: People couldn't trade and of course they got caught and then got kicked out of the Apple store for a year. So that was sort of funny. And then more seriously, I think Silicon Valley Bank, which is one of the few entities that will know tech and crypto companies, they got cold feet after. I think Fred Urson did a presentation explaining how bitcoin could be used to skirt sanctions. He wasn't suggesting it, he was just describing it because Bitcoin, of course, is decentralized. But at that point, Silicon Valley Bank tossed Coinbase as a customer, which is very serious because if you don't have a bank, it's hard to carry on. Coinbase certainly made its missteps then, but since then I think they've done a better job of sort of walking the line.
00:08:37.858 - 00:09:19.070, Speaker B: And that raises another interesting point, though. By complying with US regulations, which I think many in crypto correctly say are too onerous that opened the door for binance to start running circles around them. And I think that was and is a very interesting story, the nimble ability of binance to build what they want and operate the way they want to. And Coinbase became sort of bureaucratic as a result of having to comply with regulations. And culturally, too, I think they busted out of that a bit when they brought Belaji Srinavasan on. But I think the regulatory thing is a mixed blessing for them. It's helped them become mainstream, but it's also impeded their ability to innovate.
00:09:19.650 - 00:09:40.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually want to discuss more about binance in a moment, but before that, one of the other big issues that came up for them regulatory wise was the I almost want to call it a confrontation. I mean, it was a confrontation because they had to go to court with the IRS. Can you describe what happened there and how Coinbase was able to handle that?
00:09:40.490 - 00:10:04.174, Speaker B: Again, I have some sympathy for Coinbase on that. The I think the IRS. The US. Government has not done a very good job of building and helping to foster what I think is the future of finance. And when they went after Coinbase, it was simply a function of they were the easiest know. I think Coinbase has been more compliant than most. But yeah, I think every crypto reporter is familiar with it and reported on it.
00:10:04.174 - 00:11:07.940, Speaker B: They began subpoenaining them because an IRS agent what they did is they began auditing every American tax return and looking for how many people cited cryptocurrency or bitcoin, and it was something like only 800, which was a big red flag. So then they went to the easiest target they could get hold of, which was Coinbase, because Coinbase had all the KYC records and threatened to subpoena all of that. And I mean, that's sort of overkill, I think, because it would have been millions of documents to hand over and it would have been sort of a phishing expedition. So I think to Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's credit, they push back a lot, although of course, they finally think quietly capitulated and agreed to hand over the records of some of their biggest customers. But I'm really not sure what else they could have done. I mean, I know the same thing happened to Shapeshift, and I think a lot of people in crypto like to think they're beyond government control, and some are, but the reality is, if you're a business operating in the US. You really can't buck the IRS and the treasury department for too long.
00:11:08.470 - 00:11:40.390, Speaker A: All right, in a moment, we'll discuss more about Coinbase's efforts to be on the forefront of digital currency while also being compliant. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. In response to the challenging times, crypto.com is introducing three measures to help the community. First, the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months. Second, you can now get up to 10% back by using the MCO Visa card on food and grocery shopping.
00:11:40.390 - 00:12:26.410, Speaker A: Lastly, you could buy gift cards on the crypto.com app from merchants like Whole Foods, Safeway, Burger King and more, and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries. Download the crypto.com app today. Back to my conversation with Jeff Roberts. So, again, I do want to talk about Binance, but one other question before we get there is that I feel like the entrance of Ethereum into the crypto space also was one of those moments when Coinbase was trying to figure out how it could be on the forefront of digital currency while also being as compliant as possible. How did Coinbase handle wanting to get more cutting edge?
00:12:26.830 - 00:13:18.746, Speaker B: Well, I think at the outset, not very well. They were proceeding so cautiously and I think they got a bit smug because they were in the leading position and they were doing well in bitcoin. But at some point well, I think as a report in the book, the bitcoin environment turned kind of toxic between the big blockers and the small blockers and all that. And then when Fred Erson decided to go his own way and leave the company fred, of course, is Brian's co founder. A big reason was he was really excited about Ethereum and describing sort of the positivity and the energy and the good vibes in that community and, of course, the amazing technology that Ethereum was. And Coinbase just kept dragging its feet and sticking with bitcoin and puttering around. Of course, finally they did get on the Ethereum train, but I think they were slow to do so.
00:13:18.746 - 00:13:31.200, Speaker B: But of course now, finally they did add it and helped contribute to building the ecosystem of it. But I think the story is they were a little sort of slow off the blocks for that, although they did eventually catch up.
00:13:31.810 - 00:13:58.550, Speaker A: And so in 2017, Coinbase really became the main crypto on ramp. But especially later that year, it began seeing a lot of its customers take their coins to finance once they obtained them on Coinbase. And within five months of opening, finance became the number one exchange in the world at Coinbase. What was the internal reaction, or reactions, maybe I should say, to the rise of finance?
00:13:59.290 - 00:15:06.542, Speaker B: Again, I think they got caught flat footed on that. It was a function of being complacent. In 2017, with the bitcoin boom, they had a lot of money, and I think, as Olaf Coulson we told me, they were sitting around saying, how do we maximize our tax opportunities? And things like, you know, as I describe it in my book, coinbase was polishing up their old Ford, feeling really proud, whereas Binance was building a Porsche. And I think they got beat eventually. That's what led to them bringing in Belaji Srinavasan and shaking things up. And I think then and now there was a tension within Coinbase on the corporate side of let's hang with the bankers and be as corporate as we can versus a lot of the coders and real believers who love crypto who are watching what Binance was doing and watching the larger world of crypto and were very frustrated at the pace of innovation and Coinbase's inability to add new assets. And that's what I think led them to bring Bellagio on because they recognized they were getting beat badly by Binance and had to do something.
00:15:06.542 - 00:15:41.260, Speaker B: Just add one more thing, Laura. Of course Binance has got an edge that Coinbase doesn't have. I mean, CZ likes hopping around from Malta to or I've even heard he's going to try set up shop in international waters on a you know, they're cowboys, they're playing fast and loose and you can do that for a while. But if you're operating in a primarily American market, you simply think, you know, you have to be fair to both parties. I think you can commend finance's, nimbleness and innovation, but also recognize that Coinbase, for a lot of reasons, couldn't operate that way.
00:15:42.110 - 00:15:56.494, Speaker A: The finance issue, though, did become a big flashpoint among the top executives in 2018. Who were those executives and what sides were they taking? And how did that debate play out.
00:15:56.532 - 00:17:05.086, Speaker B: In the you know, for lack of a better word, it led to civil war, because what you had is they brought on Asif herji, who is a kind of real corporate type background in conventional banking and telecoms and sort of made him the President on the face of Coinbase for a while. And internally within Coinbase, a lot of the coders were resentful of Asif because he wasn't a crypto guy, he was a corporate suit in their eyes. And meanwhile Bellaji, who know a very mercurial individual, I think no one will dispute he's a genius, but also several people at Coinbase described him as a brilliant asshole and saying he was the ultimate political infighter. So there's two tribes there. You had Balaji who was leading the charge for new assets and understood crypto deeply so he could relate to the coders and the builders. And then Asif meanwhile was trying to turn Coinbase into a mature corporation and it led to screaming matches. There's rumors that they got into a fistfight.
00:17:05.086 - 00:17:31.290, Speaker B: That's not true. But there certainly was instance of them screaming at each other in the boardroom and know, saying a lot of negative things about his SIF and ultimately forcing him out. And I think another part of the story too is who's running this company? Because Brian armstrong, he's the founder. He's the CEO. I think he let these battles get a bit out of hand. Finally he reasserted himself, but only after a lot of departures and a lot of bad blood.
00:17:31.950 - 00:17:45.170, Speaker A: And how did that confrontation between the two of them end between Balaji and OSSIF. And during that time you kind of mentioned that Brian reasserted himself. How would you say he changed too as a leader through this period?
00:17:45.750 - 00:18:47.894, Speaker B: Well, I think after the technical meltdowns in late 2017, I know people like the venture capitalist Chris Dixon were getting a lot of emails from investors and others saying, fix this. And I think Belaji or I'm sorry, Asif did do some good things to try to stabilize their tech stack and their accounting practices and make them run. And then afterwards, of course, Belagi came charging in and was like, f this, F that, we need to add assets. And people were leaving right and left at this point. Brian Armstrong had a few of his trusted lieutenants, olaf, who was their third employee, was long gone. Fred had left, and even Adam White who went to bat. Brian, I think the board started whispering in his ear and finally he reasserted himself and then asif herji, he overstepped his position because he basically saw himself as CEO and tried to get Brian to report to him on matters of product.
00:18:47.894 - 00:19:23.918, Speaker B: And the reality is Brian owns the majority of the company. And finally that was too much and he pushed Asif out. And Asif is quite bitter about Brian and his experience, in part because he said he wasn't even allowed to say goodbye to his staff. But for the bigger picture of Silicon Valley, this is how it goes. All the know, there's a lot of civil wars and infighting and as companies grow quickly, this is par for the course. And at some point in all of this, I think Brian realized he had to, kind know, take a firmer hand on the ship. Brian Armstrong doesn't like confrontation very much, so I think that's how that built up.
00:19:23.918 - 00:19:26.450, Speaker B: But eventually he seems to have found his footing.
00:19:26.870 - 00:19:39.734, Speaker A: Yeah, and one last code on that is that Balaji also left, I think pretty much like right when some portion of his options vested or something like that. Can you fill in the details on that?
00:19:39.932 - 00:20:16.882, Speaker B: Oh, complete mercenary. He came on, signed a one year contract they forced as part of the deal of him coming on Coinbase had to buyearn.com, which people externally and internally have told me was a dog of a company. Since they're both Andreessen Horowitz portfolio companies, it was a good way to kind of force them together and get an exit for earn. And the number cited, I think it was like 60 million or something. People have told me that that was an exaggeration. They sort of juiced that number for Bellaji's ego, so that's how that went down.
00:20:16.882 - 00:20:32.360, Speaker B: And then of course, after one year, that's when know, was was going to be able to cash. You know, most people at least stick around for a few more months for appearances, but right on the dot for one year, blodgi pieced out, and that was that.
00:20:35.130 - 00:20:57.470, Speaker A: Well, let's talk about Coinbase today. Where do you feel like Coinbase is poised to go next? Where do you feel like they're headed? Some of the news this week is that after this period of the Coronavirus, they've decided to become a remote first company. What do you think of that and what else do you think is or should be top of mind for Coinbase?
00:20:58.130 - 00:21:54.094, Speaker B: Well, I think like the coronavirus, I mean, like many people in crypto for one reason or know, I think the crypto people were prescient and were recognized the danger economically and from a health point of view, way ahead of a lot of other people, including Belaji, who, of course, was one know, the first to raise red flags about this. So the remote work thing I don't think is actually that important or mean. You know, companies like Kraken have been remote the whole time and I think that's just the way the world's headed and crypto is earlier to that than most people. I think the more interesting story, though, is what Coinbase is going to become. I heard reliable people telling me they initially planned to do an IPO this year. Of course, like so much else in the world, that's on ice for now. But I think also to Coinbase's credit, they're profitable a lot, know, big Silicon Valley unicorns, know, a complete mess right now, losing money like you wouldn't believe.
00:21:54.094 - 00:22:40.302, Speaker B: Coinbase is financially stable. So the big question is how will they do an IPO? It's not going to be this year, but maybe it'll be next year. This report in my book, ironically, Brian Armstrong and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, who of course is one of the biggest enemies of Bitcoin and is pissed on it for years, turns out they were actually having secret meetings in 2018 at JPMorgan's headquarters. So I can't wait to see what the IPO looks like. Fred Ursum has told me and others at Know they all have a passion for crypto and if they just do a conventional stock listing, that will be sort of, I think, a little bit of a betrayal to the world of crypto and to their own, I think. You know, coinbase. You know, I'm not really supposed to report.
00:22:40.302 - 00:23:11.110, Speaker B: I'm supposed to be neutral. But I'm kind of rooting for them to be bold. And when they do their listing, to see half that become blockchain tokens and issue a coinbase token like Binance's. A lot of that will depend on the regulatory situation, of course, but I think things are getting more favorable. So I think that's what we should be watching and just to see what the future of the stock exchange looks like and will one day Coinbase be offering sort of blockchain tokens for companies like Apple and Nike. I don't know. It's really interesting.
00:23:11.110 - 00:23:14.780, Speaker B: All this is a couple of years away, but I think that's what the story is going to be.
00:23:15.150 - 00:24:02.070, Speaker A: Yeah, and there's one other bit of news that kind of indicates that coinbase will have someone in their corner in at least the federal government, if not in an area directly related to securities. But Coinbase's former chief legal officer, brian brooks will become acting okay, by the way, you guys, this word is spelled comptroller, and I checked the dictionary to see how this was pronounced. It's pronounced controller, which I never knew my whole life. I thought it was comptroller, but I wanted to check it. You're supposed to pronounce it controller. So that was like my super bizarre learning yesterday. But anyway, so he'll become acting controller of the currency.
00:24:02.070 - 00:24:08.860, Speaker A: And why do you think that's significant and how could that affect crypto companies?
00:24:09.390 - 00:24:59.190, Speaker B: I think it's a good thing, of course, because Brian brooks is a conventional lawyer and banker, but he got the crypto bug, too, during his time at coinbase. The more people in Washington who are able to bring a crypto friendly attitude, the quicker we're going to be able know the americans are going to be able to harness the full potential of blockchain and crypto in the financial system. But again, don't underestimate the power of the banks. They can screw with companies like you wouldn't believe. If the banking industry wants to slow down crypto as it has in the past, it will. In the same way with the recent PPP program, the banks froze out companies like PayPal and other fintechs. So the banking lobby is so immensely powerful and they have immense hold over congress.
00:24:59.190 - 00:25:38.594, Speaker B: It's going to take time for more Brian brooks figures to come in to that scene, but I think it's happening slowly and especially if Jamie dimon, as I think Paul vinya in the journal reported recently, has now taken on JP morgan chase, I should say, has now taken on coinbase as a banking client. I think we're getting there slowly. But as I report in the book, too, I mean, silicon valley and Washington, DC. Are like oil and water, cats and dogs, pick your metaphor. And Washington is just bad at innovation. They're bad at crypto style culture. It's just going to take time for the crypto industry to build up their lobbying clout in DC.
00:25:38.594 - 00:25:50.620, Speaker B: And it's not helped by the fact that crypto people do not like that game at all. They don't like schmoozing, they don't like Washington. But the reality is that's how it's going to have to go down and slowly, very slowly, it's happening.
00:25:51.070 - 00:26:19.938, Speaker A: Yeah. And one other thing about that office of the control or the currency is I think they also can determine whether or not the crypto companies still have to go state by state to get their money transmission licenses, which has been such a bane for so many of these crypto exchanges. And that's why even huge companies that are well funded like coinbase still don't operate in all states. All right, so what's next for your book? It came out on audible and can you tell people how to get it and what's next after the audio version?
00:26:20.114 - 00:26:33.238, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, thanks for the it's. You'll learn a lot about coinbase and crypto, but also I like to think it's just a good read. It's nice and quick. You can listen to it in five or 6 hours. You'll learn a lot. You'll get a lot of gossip.
00:26:33.238 - 00:27:17.910, Speaker B: It's out there right now. If you go to Amazon audible and just google kings of know, it's there for download. And if you're not an audio person, I'm glad to say the book has also been published by Harvard business review. And one fun tidbit on this is one of the protagonists of my book, adam White, early coinbase guy. Now, you know, prominent figure at backed, he went to Harvard business review and tried to write about or I'm sorry, he went to Harvard business school and tried to write about bitcoin, when he was there, was discouraged right and left. So I think it's sort of fitting that the world has evolved such that now Harvard business review, which loosely tied to Harvard business school, wants to publish a book on this. And long story short, the hardcover of kings of crypto will be published by Harvard business review.
00:27:17.910 - 00:27:27.340, Speaker B: It's coming out in December or January, so you can find that and pre order it, of course, to be grateful and I hope everyone likes the book.
00:27:27.790 - 00:27:32.266, Speaker A: Great. Well, it's been so great having you on unconfirmed. Thanks for coming on the show.
00:27:32.448 - 00:27:36.080, Speaker B: Well, thanks, Laura. Keep up your great work. It's been a lot of fun.
00:27:36.530 - 00:28:01.442, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the news recap. Stick around for this week in crypto. After this short break in this crisis, many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets. Others seek to minimize the yield on their cash. Nexo allows you to achieve exactly these two goals.

Before we begin, happy ten year anniversary of bitcoin pizza day. Ten years ago today, Laszlo Hanye paid 10,000 BTC for two papa John's pizzas.
00:28:31.150 - 00:29:41.970, Speaker A: At today's prices, he paid the equivalent of $90 million for those two pizzas. I hope they were really good. First headline did Satoshi move 40 BTC this week? Whale alert tweeted that 40 BTC worth $391,000 that were mined in the first month that the bitcoin network was live got moved this Wednesday. While there was some speculation that this could be anonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto moving coins, a number of early bitcoin blockchain analysts and sloops have detected that there was one miner from the early days that had a distinct. Fingerprint every time it mined blocks. They believed that this miner was Satoshi, theorizing that perhaps Satoshi had optimized the client he, she, or they were running, creating that distinct fingerprint. But also because the coins mined with this pattern have never been moved, and the recently moved coins do not come from the sets that were mined under this pattern, meaning that they are likely being spent or moved by another early miner.
00:29:41.970 - 00:30:45.990, Speaker A: In a periscope chat with Lawson Baker, Nick Carter gave a theory that these coins are being moved by someone involved in the Craig Wright case. Perhaps to prove that Craig Wright did not mine those coins, we shall see. I've included links in the show notes where you can read about this so called Patoshi pattern. These blog posts were written by Sergio Lerner, BitMEX, and others, and you can see why it is that they presume that these blocks were mined by Satoshi. And it's very clear when you look at the fingerprint and the plotting of these different blocks, that the 40 BTC that were moved were not in the pitoshi pattern. Next Headline blockfly employee gets SIM swapped hacker gets customer data this definitely deserves an exploding head emoji. A blockfly employee must have been using two FA via SMS because that employee was SIM swapped, and then the hacker was able to use the hijacked phone number to get into BlockFi's systems.
00:30:45.990 - 00:31:55.898, Speaker A: The hacker obtained confidential data such as names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and activity histories. However, the hacker did not access more sensitive data such as bank account details, Social Security and tax identification numbers, passport and driver's license numbers, or photo scans. This incident reminds me of when an engineering lead at BitCo got SIM swapped and lost more than $100,000 in cryptocurrency. People, if you are in any way, shape or form involved in cryptocurrency, you absolutely should not use second factor authentication via your phone number for any service. What this means is so for any service that you use in your personal or business life, if the extra security offered has the company text a code to your phone or call your phone, somebody can steal your number. Click forgot password on maybe your email or your company login and they can get a code that is sent to them that lets them get into your account and lock you out. I wrote about this phenomenon back in 2016.
00:31:55.898 - 00:32:52.238, Speaker A: It's 2020 now. Get a grip, people. No to a pay using your phone number unless it's a Google voice or Google Fi number, since those do not have customer service agents that can be tricked or bribed. And there is no excuse for every single crypto company out there not to be enforcing this rule on all their employees. Next Headline Backed has more than 70 custody clients and insurance backed with insurance broker marsh is now offering its customers more than $500 million worth of insurance coverage when factoring in the existing $125,000,000 in coverage at backed. That brings the total coverage to more than $600 million. In a blog post this week, Bacched president Adam White said the firm has more than 70 clients for its custody services, and the company has completed two types of exams one for financial reporting conducted by KPMG and one for evaluating customer data protection practices conducted by Pricewaterhouse Coopers.
00:32:52.238 - 00:33:53.270, Speaker A: The company also says it is working toward the launch of its consumer app this summer. No word on a new CEO after Mike Blandina stepped down in April to take a job at Morgan Chase. Next Headline TBTC is over for now an attempt to use Bitcoin as collateral in DeFi on Ethereum has failed, at least for the time being. As Matt Luongo described in a recent episode of Unchained, the system contained a single use pause button that would enable users to withdraw funds, and on Monday the TBTC team decided to push it. The bug was that the proof that the DAP was creating to show the Ethereum chain that a deposit on the Bitcoin blockchain had now been redeemed was incorrect. It was not actually proving that the BTC from the deposit had been sent to the correct redeemer address. Keep, which runs the TBTC protocol, is still pursuing some already planned audits and will be announcing how it plans to redeploy TBTC.
00:33:53.270 - 00:35:16.130, Speaker A: Next Headline Steam blockchain attempts to confiscate some community members'tokens but is blocked the original steam community's war with Tron, which recently acquired steemit, continues. On Tuesday, the Tron controlled steam hard forked to create new steam, sort of like New Coke, I guess, cutting out some former Steam so called witnesses who serve as block validators, as well as others who had created another antitron fork of steam called Hive. If you're getting a little confused here, yes, it's because this is just splintering in all different kinds of directions, sort of like the Dow. The Steam blog post announced the move on Monday, saying it would, quote, seize some user accounts that participated in criminal activities by actively contributing to the threat against the steam blockchain and or to the theft of steam holders assets. 64 accounts would have their tokens seized for 23.6 million steam tokens, which is about $5 million as of press time. However, someone known as Community Three Two One who had control of a particular steam wallet was able to divert the tokens there to Bitrex in hopes that Bittrex could return those tokens to their original owners.
00:35:16.130 - 00:36:15.826, Speaker A: Bitrex will be returning the coins to that wallet, though whoever is behind the Community Three Two One wallet will have to declare their identity to Bitrex. Also, by the way, what I've described here so far isn't even the full extent of the fiasco. Justin sun says he is also working with law enforcement to pursue the witnesses on the hive fork. Next Headline A 16 Z on how crypto has grown exponentially across hype cycles. A 16 z wrote up a great analysis on the growth of the crypto industry since the birth of Bitcoin. It says, quote, anecdotally out of the hundreds of conversations with crypto founders we've had, we often hear stories like I heard about crypto in 20 11, 20 13, 20 17, when the prices spiked and everyone was talking about it. At first I thought it was just about money, but then I started reading white papers and blog posts, learned more about the potential of the technology, and eventually I fell in love with it.
00:36:15.826 - 00:37:04.850, Speaker A: I would agree. I hear very similar stories when I do my interviews from all different kinds of founders, and probably some of you listeners also fall into that category. I myself do not, since I somehow got obsessed with it in 2015 when the price was at one of the lows. But anyway, this post, through clear and simple graphs, lays out how price, social media mentions and developer and startup activity have risen and fallen across each bubble. But over time, there have been increases in the compound annual growth rate of more than 200% for social media mentions and more than 50% for startup activity. It's worth taking a look at the post to get a sense of how these hype cycles result in long term growth in the space. Fun bits.
00:37:04.850 - 00:37:36.266, Speaker A: JK Rowling fits right in on crypto Twitter. It all started Friday night with J K rowling replying to CoinDesk writer Lee Quinn on Twitter. I don't understand bitcoin. Please explain it to me. Okay, you guys. So in case you missed it, the full insanity of crypto Twitter was unleashed on the author of the Harry Potter series over the next few days with Vitalik, Buterin CZ. And many others of the crypto community, including myself, trying to explain it to J.
00:37:36.266 - 00:38:03.510, Speaker A: K. Rowling. However, she later tweeted, quote, people are now explaining bitcoin to me, and honestly, it's blah, blah, blah, collectibles my little pony, blah, blah, blah, computers. Got one of those blah, blah, blah, crypto sounds creepy, blah, blah, blah. Understand the risk. I don't, though. Then she wrote, I know you mean to help, but full disclosure, I'm on my fourth very strong, old fashioned, and honestly, you might as well send me a scroll written in Sanskrit.
00:38:03.510 - 00:38:45.294, Speaker A: By the way, fun fact I did learn some Sanskrit back in the day. Those of you may know I used to be a yoga teacher. So yes, this is part of my history. Anyway, somewhere in this mess, an imposter JK. Rowling account tweeted that it had bought bitcoin, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to the imposter account, inviting it to also buy non bitcoin coins, which I know some of you have your own special term for. So after a weekend of ferocious tweeting, the magic Internet money crowd's love affair with Rallying was winding down, and she still seemed not to understand what bitcoin was. The effort had failed.
00:38:45.294 - 00:39:17.850, Speaker A: But then on Monday morning, Rowling tweeted this this is getting silly. I'm not joining the bitcoin community. It should be perfectly obvious by now that I've been trolling bitcoin in the hope of boosting my significant ethereum holdings. Which goes to show sorry. Which goes to show she understands bitcoin perfectly after all. All right, well, thank you so much.
