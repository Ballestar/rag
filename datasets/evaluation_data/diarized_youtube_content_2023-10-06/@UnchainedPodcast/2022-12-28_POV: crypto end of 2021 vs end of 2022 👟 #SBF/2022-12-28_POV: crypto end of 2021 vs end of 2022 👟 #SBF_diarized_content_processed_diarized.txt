00:00:00.250 - 00:00:10.926, Speaker A: Last was SBF's shoes when he went to Congress. Those are what we chose as the best memes of last year. He's gonna be wearing very different shoes this.
00:00:10.948 - 00:00:25.410, Speaker B: Year. I saw a pretty morbid tweet recently where it's him walking around without laces, because, obviously, when you go to jail, they take your shoelaces from you. And so it's a, you know, the shoelace meme, but in a very different bite.
00:00:25.490 - 00:00:26.370, Speaker A: All right. That got heavy.
