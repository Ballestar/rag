00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.162, Speaker A: Not a dividend.
00:00:01.226 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker B: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:16.770 - 00:00:36.530, Speaker C: Alright, hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So start with intros. First up we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next we've got Robert, crypto connoisseur and captain of Compound. Next we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet.
00:00:36.530 - 00:01:05.858, Speaker C: And finally got myself I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. All four of us are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. So it's been a wild week, the big news of the week. So I'm in San Francisco right now and all of SF is a buzz about this. Finally, Elon Musk was forced to buy Twitter. And I was here on Friday. I think Friday was the day that he came into the building and started clearing house.
00:01:05.858 - 00:01:50.666, Speaker C: And there were a bunch of reporters outside the Twitter office, which is usually like kind of a dank part of SF. People were just waiting for employees to come walking out with all their stuff in a box to try to interview them. So it's been crazy to see everybody is kind of a combination of scared and excited. It turns out there's a lot of interesting crypto elements that are weaved into the story. So for one, part of the investment syndicate included 500 million from finance, CZ was interviewed about, hey, what do you think about investing into Twitter? And he was like, oh, it's great, I love free speech. Apparently, Sam bankwood Fried, was a shareholder in Twitter, and so Sam bankrupt fried made some quick money. I think he said he owned somewhere between 50 and 100 million in Twitter.
00:01:50.666 - 00:02:07.154, Speaker C: And so the buyout obviously did well for him. Pocket Dogecoin true for him, probably. Dogecoin has gone nuts. Best performing asset in the last week. I think it's up well over 100%. What do you guys think about the Twitter acquisition? We're here now and everyone's worried about it.
00:02:07.352 - 00:03:07.234, Speaker D: Well, let's just start with the Doge piece because I think that's the most relevant and fun and interesting for the crypto audience. So one of the documents that I saw that was released pursuant to the lawsuit was actually a conversation he was having about the future of Twitter as a blockchain asset. Obviously, leading up to the acquisition, there was interest from a lot of crypto people to participate. CZ participated, there was interest from SBF, there was interest from a lot of other people. Obviously, Elon Musk is well known for espousing an interest in crypto, and so one of the documents that came out was actually him being asked about how Twitter could work on a blockchain. And even though it was probably an offhand comment and it was, know, discardable and it might even been a joke, he said that the Tweets could themselves be posted onto a blockchain like Dogecoin. And you might be in a situation in the future in which you're actually paying Dogecoin as a transaction to republish the same content or to retweet.
00:03:07.234 - 00:03:45.746, Speaker D: So a retweet would potentially cost Dogecoin. So I actually found it, one, interesting that he was talking about how maybe it could exist on a blockchain, and two, that whether it was a deliberate wink wink nod to the community or not, that he referenced Dogecoin as an example of how Twitter could integrate. And so I think that's what was one of many things that fueled a lot of excitement over last week from the you know, it might have been a joke. Alana is truly the master of trolling in every sense of the word, but I found that interesting that it has been a conversation about how Twitter could integrate and know he was using Doge as the example.
00:03:45.928 - 00:03:51.880, Speaker C: So these were in text messages, right, that came out in discovery or something. So these were not intended for public consumption, to be clear.
00:03:52.490 - 00:04:13.798, Speaker A: So I saw another elon text league that came out, also came out in discovery, where I forget who was talking to him about running a decentralized Twitter. And he was very down on the idea. He was like, no, that doesn't make any sense. There's not nearly enough scale to be able to process that. You have state bloat, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so it's like, I don't really know where his head is at. And it also reminded me what's happening with Blue Sky.
00:04:13.798 - 00:04:22.078, Speaker A: Blue sky is spun out, but I'm assuming Twitter still owns some of, you know, what's the latest with that project? How does that relate to the Twitter acquisition? I don't quite know.
00:04:22.164 - 00:05:08.366, Speaker B: They did release their first version and yeah, I'm friends with the person who runs it, and I haven't talked to her in a while since she actually joined. But before that, she was more free. They're actually doing something. I mean, their model of the world is like, they want everything to look like git and they want everyone to be able to clone their own Twitter repo and be able to do forks of it. It's a little bit like I do feel like it's way too developery in the sense that I find a hard time imagining a non developer using it. It's like, why did git take a long time? Git was invented in the 90s. Like Linus torvalds committed it.
00:05:08.366 - 00:05:35.286, Speaker B: I think the first commit message was like 19, 9019 one. But it did take bitbucket GitHub whatever to actually make git useful. Before that, people were using like, perforce, mercurial, things like that. And so there is kind of this trade off of, like, if you make it a little too git like, and need everyone to manage their own local forks, it's like, yeah, theoretically a wallet is supposed to do that for you, but it's really hard with a social network, at least in my mind.
00:05:35.388 - 00:05:45.366, Speaker C: Well, isn't that what Macedon is supposed to there was there's been this talk about people migrating away from Twitter to Macedon as protest of Elon. I assume this is like, massively overbought.
00:05:45.478 - 00:06:38.698, Speaker B: My favorite thing is I would say if I had to describe myself and be the not really intersecting groups in Twitter, I'm in it's like crypto Twitter, ML Twitter, some of math Twitter, some of physics Twitter and physics Twitter and math Twitter are just like, we hate Elon, but whatever. And ML Twitter is like, oh my God, there's going on this huge rampage. And it's kind of ironic because I'm like, these are people who are like, the head of ML at like, or head of ML at OpenAI, or researcher at professor at university. And I'm like, it is kind of ironic that the people who are working on the most centralizing technology in the history of mankind are like, we want this decentralized chat platform. I still can't get over the irony of that.
00:06:38.784 - 00:07:18.422, Speaker C: Well, but here's the other irony. Here's the other irony, right, is that a lot of the storytelling about why we wanted decentralized Twitter was that Twitter was making all of these unilateral decisions, censoring people deciding which viewpoints were okay and which ones are not. Elon is now explicitly saying twitter is going to stop doing that. We're going to be the platform of free speech, blah, blah, blah. If that actually happens, which I'm skeptical that it's going to happen, and they're going to be able to retain advertisers, but let's say that in fact, it's going to do what Elon said it's going to do. It kind of defeats a lot of the Ostensible value proposition for why you care about censorship resistant Twitter if Twitter massively tones down the censorship. On the other hand, the people who are mostly complaining are really more on the left.
00:07:18.422 - 00:07:56.034, Speaker C: They're really more people who just don't like Elon Musk, think that he's an asshole, think that he's, like, bad for the world, don't like the idea of billionaires owning platforms. So their protest is like a very different kind of protest than the kinds of protests that have previously animated calls for a decentralized alternative to Twitter. Now, of course, the actual decentralized alternative to Twitter today, which is de facto Macedon, is still like a tiny nothing that nobody really cares about. I mean, it's cool. It's an awesome project, but in reality, it's so small compared to what Twitter is. I don't know, it feels a bit too shrill right now. And obviously we don't know what changes Elon is going to make.
00:07:56.034 - 00:08:29.914, Speaker C: He's talked about freezing moderation decisions until they construct some kind of council. And that council is going to be making very large, important moderation decisions for the platform, which is basically exactly what Facebook has, if I recall. And so essentially, Twitter is going to become more like Facebook, which I'm not sure really how radical that is. And also for some reason, do people perceive it as radical on both sides, I think on the right people are like, wow, that's like a radical change of open free speech. And on the left they're like, oh, that's a radical reversion to allowing hate speech and all these other horrible things happen. To my mind, it's just basically turning Twitter into Facebook.
00:08:29.962 - 00:08:48.530, Speaker B: I mean, my favorite thing right after the announcement was all of the LARPing of like, oh, look, I see no bots, look, I see more. There's a lot of misinformation about misinformation, which was kind of one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen that happened over the weekend.
00:08:48.610 - 00:08:56.834, Speaker C: I feel like, yeah, there's a tremendous amount of virtue signaling going on right now around the Twitter acquisition or not acquisition.
00:08:56.882 - 00:09:14.010, Speaker B: But the best thing about it is all these people who are tweeting about how to go follow their Mastodon server, and then you go back to their Twitter the next day. Oh, no, actually, hey, you come to my mastodon server, and it's like every day they're writing a tweet. Go to the mast dungeons. Those tweets I find the funniest.
00:09:14.350 - 00:09:31.442, Speaker A: There was actually a really good hacker news comment. Someone was describing how to set up their Macedon server and do all this. And then someone was like, yeah, you could also write out your message on the Notes app and screenshot it, and it would have the same effects because no one's going to see the fucking Macedon post. Save yourself some time.
00:09:31.496 - 00:09:32.434, Speaker B: That was pretty good.
00:09:32.552 - 00:10:01.994, Speaker C: Yeah. To be clear, we're talking about Macedon, so it's probably worth explaining what it is. So Macedon is a Federated social media platform. It's kind of know, you can sort of set up your own server that acts as your own sort of mini Twitter, and many different people can have their own servers and servers can reference each other. So it's like a Federated version of Twitter, but it's entirely kind of self sovereign of smaller servers. And so it's existed for a very long time. It's been kind of niche, and now people are talking about it because they're, I think mostly because they're Virtue signaling about Elon Musk buying Twitter.
00:10:01.994 - 00:10:21.218, Speaker C: So we'll see what happens here. There's been some rumblings, know, beyond the dogecoin stuff. There was also a potential leak, speculation unclear that Twitter has been building a product to have a wallet integrated directly into Twitter. Were there any more details on that or was that it?
00:10:21.304 - 00:10:49.930, Speaker A: It comes from a tweet from Jane Wong, who I follow for a long time. She's great generally. I think her strategy is she decompiles App Store binaries and sort of pokes through it to find features that are in development, and they tend to be pretty accurate. And sometimes she even gets like screenshots of stuff that's in development. So I would assume there's something in the current Twitter app store binary that alludes to a wallet or as some sort of prototype for a wallet. So, I mean, Twitter has been like the most pro crypto of the big tech companies, which is kind of strange.
00:10:50.350 - 00:11:30.274, Speaker B: Well, I mean, they have the crypto user base. There's some feedback loop there. Right. It can't just be one way. During the NFT boom, I think I remember the interesting thing was, like, watching all of these accounts that had one hundred and fifty k to a million followers on Instagram coming to Twitter for the first time because they wanted to sell NFTs and they couldn't. No one on Instagram was buying any NFTs. And so I thought that's a pretty interesting dynamic of like, hey, the market actually is if Twitter has any monetization vehicle that isn't just charging more for verification, probably has to use crypto.
00:11:30.322 - 00:11:48.318, Speaker C: I don't really clear twitter, remember Twitter was banning crypto advertising, right. So they were making money on Twitter users by showing them irrelevant ads. But if they were showing crypto ads, I think Twitter would become a crypto company. They would have made so much money. Yeah.
00:11:48.404 - 00:12:19.686, Speaker B: Last cycle they should have, right. Like 90% of NFT marketing probably was Twitter and discord. And if we look at the two companies, did they make any money off of that? I'm sure their stock went up a bit based on some numbers, but I don't think that they made any on a direct accountable revenue know, imagine if they had an affiliate marketing thing with OpenSea where any link that went to OpenSea from Twitter, like OpenSea paid them like two basis points of the fee. Five basis points. They could have done a lot of things.
00:12:19.708 - 00:12:20.594, Speaker A: Could be more aggressive.
00:12:20.642 - 00:12:22.650, Speaker C: Possible they are doing that for the PFPs.
00:12:23.230 - 00:12:25.980, Speaker B: Yeah, they could be doing that for the PFPs. That's true.
00:12:26.510 - 00:12:26.826, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:26.848 - 00:12:33.840, Speaker A: I mean, think about how much money MetaMask makes on charging 87 bits or whatever. You bake that into Twitter? Like I don't see why not.
00:12:35.010 - 00:12:43.070, Speaker C: Yeah. Unfortunately, Elon kind of took this thing over at precisely the wrong time to ring very much out of the crypto industry.
00:12:44.550 - 00:13:00.934, Speaker B: Finance is like, hey, let's put BUSD pay in Twitter. I thought that was hilarious. Been pushing that, basically. Binance pay, however, is the most impressive product of the last three months that I've seen, period, in crypto. Right.
00:13:01.052 - 00:13:01.990, Speaker C: I've not used it.
00:13:02.060 - 00:13:04.774, Speaker D: Wait, walk us through what it is, because I have not used it.
00:13:04.812 - 00:13:33.950, Speaker B: Yeah, so Binance has basically been actually, Tom, if you want to get up the BUSD market cap or BUSD versus USDC market cap from the last three months, I think that tells half the story. But Binance has really been working on getting BUSD their USD like stablecoin, which is actually held in New York, bizarrely because it's sort of issued by Paxos and they've been working on getting that integrated in a lot of places and also actually removing USDC pairs on binance and trying to encourage people to use BUSD.
00:13:34.370 - 00:13:44.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the bigger story, right, is like you basically are getting force converted into BUSD if you have USDC. I don't know how much finance pay is driving that conversion, but finance pay.
00:13:44.792 - 00:14:17.470, Speaker B: Though has had like $10 billion of actual volume. That's just people sending BUSD on finance to each other. There's actually quite a bit of payment stuff that seems to be happening in BUSD terms in Latin America and Africa. Actually in Colombia during DevCon, I walked by a little almost like local bitcoins place that will take local currency and give you BUSD. And the first time I'd seen that, I've only seen that amongst local bitcoins type of things. I've never seen that for a USD stablecoin.
00:14:17.810 - 00:14:18.558, Speaker C: Wow.
00:14:18.724 - 00:14:50.658, Speaker B: And so I think BUSD, I mean, yeah, you can just see the market cap growth. It's like, clearly they're really pushing on trying to get it to get used and it's almost 50% of circle of the USDC's market cap. It's pretty close and it was like nothing before. I think CZ has been actually saying literally since the acquisition closed, like, hey, I'm going to keep trying to push finance Pay to get integrated into Twitter, which is just using BUSD settlement, kind of like the way Solana Pay is doing USDC settlement, like similar.
00:14:50.844 - 00:14:52.780, Speaker A: Yeah, you can see some of the growth here.
00:14:53.950 - 00:15:36.680, Speaker C: Yeah, there's kind of loosely related. One of the things I've seen some handwriting about coming back to the Twitter story is the fact that there's so much foreign ownership of Twitter. And of course CZ is one of those actors, he owns a significant amount. I think some of the Saudis own a very significant chunk of Twitter. And then of course, Elon Musk himself has significant business interests in China and has relationships with the governments of many other countries. What do you guys think about the kind of free speech and know, making something like a neutral ground for public opinion being potentially jeopardized by all these foreign interests having a big stake in.
00:15:37.370 - 00:16:15.090, Speaker D: Mean, I think there's a lot of interest that held Twitter before it was taken know, as a publicly traded company. There was a lot of people that owned it. I don't think it's going to change. I don't think it's going to increase necessarily call it the intervention into what content is allowed and not allowed on Twitter. I think in general, Alon seems like he wants to take it in the opposite direction, which is way less control over what content is allowed. And so I think in general you can call it free speech or you can call it whatever Aladdin wants it to be, but I think there's going to be less moderation.
00:16:15.830 - 00:16:47.802, Speaker C: The other thing to keep in mind, so Tesla is worth $670,000,000,000. Twitter is worth something fair market value is probably somewhere in the order of 30 something billion. So it's one 20th less than one 20th the value of Tesla, to say nothing of SpaceX. And so very much from the perspective of Elon, I have to imagine that his I don't know exactly what his interest in Tesla is, but has to be much larger than his interest in Twitter. And so to some degree, Twitter might just become subordinate to his business interests.
00:16:47.866 - 00:17:00.990, Speaker B: In he did sell a lot of Tesla. I mean, not a lot relative to his holdings, but like 10% something to fund this. Yeah, but he still has more net overall.
00:17:01.070 - 00:17:37.022, Speaker C: Yeah, it must be a lot more. So, look, if China is leaning on him and China basically says, like, look, we're going to cut your contracts or we're going to make life much harder for you to do some of your manufacturing here or to access our markets unless you blah, blah, blah, blah with Twitter, I think that does seem actually pretty seriously concerning. And that might be in some sense the best argument that we have left for why a decentralized version of Twitter is potentially more compelling at a moment like this. Anyway. Okay, let's move off from Twitter. We'll probably have a lot more to say once we actually know.
00:17:37.076 - 00:17:54.610, Speaker B: Actually, can I ask a quick question? One around the horn thing for each of us? Answer. So do you think if Twitter moves to this $8 your verification is paid for, you will have less spammy check blue check marks? Do you think it'll increase stay the same? Decrease.
00:17:55.110 - 00:17:57.746, Speaker C: I did decrease, yeah.
00:17:57.848 - 00:18:05.030, Speaker A: So I don't actually understand the concept here. Is it idea that if you're already verified you now have to pay or is it the idea that anybody can pay to get verified?
00:18:06.570 - 00:18:13.946, Speaker B: I think you have to pay if you're already verified, but I think they're going to change the verification process. At least that's what yeah, it does.
00:18:13.968 - 00:18:21.626, Speaker C: Seem a bit too vague. It seems a bit too vague right now. What exactly is going to happen? What I saw was that people who are verified have to anyone.
00:18:21.728 - 00:18:29.518, Speaker B: I think the problem is the current verification process is literally like, do you know someone who works at Twitter, ask them to give you a blue check mark and then they'll vouch for you.
00:18:29.604 - 00:18:32.518, Speaker A: Are you saying this because you're the only one of us who's not verified?
00:18:32.714 - 00:18:49.640, Speaker B: You sound a little know. Some of us are men of the I just I'm never joining this blue check mark cabal. That's like the knights of Columbus of online.
00:18:50.090 - 00:19:25.306, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, obviously the purpose of the verification is to prevent fake accounts and thoughts. So giving that to everyone seems kind of silly. But I think the big question is just like, why this monetization method? I understand maybe the desire to get away from advertising if you're going to be cutting down on moderation, but if you just do the math, this doesn't really scale up to be meaningful to Twitter's. Bottom line, Twitter made like $5 billion last year in revenue. You're not going to be able to make $5 billion charging people $8 a month assuming sort of certain opt in rates and certain usage patterns. So it seems kind of like a weird sideshow.
00:19:25.498 - 00:19:51.930, Speaker C: Yeah. Obviously a very small number of Twitter users are verified now. If they do open up verification and say verification now means you're a real person, rather than that you're a notable person. Or maybe there's like a two tier system. There's like a gray checkmark for you're, a real person, and then a blue for you're, a notable person. I think there's just no way that they're going to get rid of the blue check marks being a separate and special group of people, that just seems like kind of intrinsic to how society is organized. Right.
00:19:51.930 - 00:20:21.170, Speaker C: Every single social media platform, even discord, has this concept of the blue verified checkmark that yeah, you're like a special notable person. It's on Facebook. It's on pretty much every single social media platform has this concept. So I'd be very surprised if Twitter gets rid of it. But they may add another thing, which is you are a real person, and everybody is going to be filtering your ability to engage with Twitter based on whether or not you can pass this real person test, which is basically just civil resistance. Right. It's just like pay $8 a month.
00:20:21.170 - 00:20:30.520, Speaker C: So it's almost like you're asking, do you think paying $8 a month is like a good civil resistance mechanism? I'm like, yeah, probably because there's no way that the average bot is making more than $8 a month.
00:20:31.050 - 00:20:32.470, Speaker B: Bot IRR.
00:20:34.170 - 00:20:45.178, Speaker C: It's pretty low. That's why it's so because it's so cheap to spin up a bot on Twitter. That's why all these things that's why they're there. When I was at Airbnb, I had.
00:20:45.184 - 00:20:51.710, Speaker B: This friend who actually worked at Spotify and then left Spotify to make a bot farm, like one of the phone farming farms.
00:20:52.210 - 00:20:53.246, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:20:53.428 - 00:21:11.380, Speaker B: And they said the highest return is Spotify for sure because musicians will pay way more to get moved up the ranks because they have direct economic ties to it. Record labels will sign you based on those metrics, so it's literally worth money to them.
00:21:12.150 - 00:22:06.034, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, that makes was when I was at Airbnb, I used to work on payments fraud, and so we had a pretty deep view into the economics of basically what it costs to spin up a fake account. Usually it involves some kind of supply chain. If you go on the darknet, you buy compromised email, whether it's like a Gmail or a Yahoo or whatever, you use that compromised Gmail that has some reputation to create an account at Airbnb, you buy a fake passport. That's like the most expensive part of that supply chain. If you actually have to KYC, that's why KYC is often the gold standard, is that it's just the most expensive to fake. Yeah, for the most part, it gets you into the several dollars. And unless you're on a very high value marketplace like airbnb, airbnb is very, very high dollar value if you can scam someone on airbnb because these transactions are hundreds or even thousands of dollars, but doing it on a much smaller scale, a much smaller platform, the unit economics just don't work.
00:22:06.034 - 00:22:28.438, Speaker C: So I'd imagine during the heyday of crypto, it would have been worth it because a single mark can net you so much money if somebody falls for your scam. But today, with many fewer eyeballs on crypto, and people just being more just being less crazy and less kind of maniacal about what's going on in the space, my guess is that conversions and ROI are super down for even scammers across the industry.
00:22:28.614 - 00:23:12.206, Speaker B: Actually, I guess this brings back one other question. Amongst the current crypto native, actually, I saw this in the YouTube questions, which is why I wanted to bring this up, which is, like, amongst lens and Farcaster, how do you feel about the native crypto social networks? I think we've actually never talked about them on the show. What are your opinions on them? Because I feel like I don't have a fully formed opinion other than I've definitely heard a lot of people saying that Farcaster is like, the VC is a VC, twitter just migrated, and lens is like the dgens migrated. But that's like the highest level thing. And I've used lens, I've never used Farcaster, so I don't have much strong in terms of strong opinions.
00:23:12.258 - 00:23:16.758, Speaker C: I feel like that's right. Is anybody active on either Farcaster or lens?
00:23:16.854 - 00:23:20.060, Speaker A: I check out Farcaster sometimes maybe once or twice a week.
00:23:20.510 - 00:23:22.714, Speaker D: You go on twice a week? That's pretty good.
00:23:22.752 - 00:24:09.594, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I feel like with these crypto social media plays, I feel like they're mostly there's a great piece by Eugene Wei called status as a service. It's like the quintessential piece on understanding how new social media platforms come into existence and how they compete with each other. And I think the primary thing that matters when it comes to giving life to a new social media platform is understanding what is the status game that's being played on this new platform and what is the crew or the community or the vibe or just the group that I'm going to be joining if I join this platform. And so I think it's much less about the technology, it's much more about the community and the people and the kind of status that you're afforded by getting onto this new platform.
00:24:09.594 - 00:24:23.870, Speaker C: And so I think, tarun, you're absolutely right. One's for Djens, one's for VCs. If they can make that work, maybe that's a good way to seed a new community. But I think it's tough, right? Most social media plays fail just kind of from the beginning.
00:24:24.290 - 00:24:41.590, Speaker A: Yeah. Farcaster reminds me a lot of early Reddit, like kind of 2007, 2008, when it was seeded by all the YC people and so similar kind of thing. People mind what is already happening on a social network and so that's kind of the vibe or the culture that's been seeded on Farcaster.
00:24:43.050 - 00:25:12.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know that people are fundamentally driven by I like this thing because it's decentralized. Maybe for macedon. I think Macedon is actually a good example of people who are really ideological and are using something because it's decentralized or because it's federated, whatever you want to call it. I think the vast majority of users don't make decisions that way. They make decisions based on a value proposition. And for social media, the value proposition is social. So it's like, who's there? What's the content that's there? That's what's going to make people make these decisions.
00:25:12.270 - 00:25:24.594, Speaker C: But I can imagine that starting from the place of we are going to be this maximally decentralized place, attracts the right people, attracts the right crowd, builds you the right culture. I think that's possible, but you have to prove it.
00:25:24.792 - 00:26:18.674, Speaker D: Here's my extremely naive and extremely macro perspective on this. So if you look at what tech companies have been in the business of doing over the last ten years in general, it's been a massive struggle to build enough server farms to even host and keep up with their platforms because they have in some cases actually a billion users, which is incomprehensibly a large amount of usage. Google and Facebook and like, everyone who's been in this market has just been investing so hard in just keeping a platform up. And when I look at centralized versus decentralized, just like data and compute and hosting, it's like, yes, all of these platforms are amazing when you have 10,000 users, you literally can run anything on a blockchain with 10,000 users.
00:26:18.802 - 00:26:20.838, Speaker B: You really can't run anything in a.
00:26:20.844 - 00:27:02.350, Speaker D: Decentralized or distributed way when there's a billion users unless you make radical changes and compromises. And so I think all of these alternatives look amazing when you're counting users in the tens of thousands. I don't necessarily expect they'll function when there's 100 million or a billion. I don't know if 100 million or a billion people want to use something just because it's decentralized, but the hardest problem is building something that 100 million or a billion people want to use and that's unbelievably hard. And once you do that, it's just an unbelievably complicated and difficult tech problem of being able to serve them without going down instantly.
00:27:02.510 - 00:27:44.878, Speaker B: I mean, I will say one thing I think that's interesting about the Lens version of the world is it sort of implicitly assumes that there's going to be hundreds of roll ups and each community is going to run on its own. Roll up. And it's sort of in my mind, if the MultiChain thesis and people are willing to have their own coin for validation works, I could see that being a better version of sort of blue sky or Macedon. Yeah, I can kind of see that the incentivized version of those for many small communities could work versus the one big melting pot type of like it's cool to see the experiments of that.
00:27:45.044 - 00:28:21.062, Speaker C: I mean, that's basically the difference between Reddit and Twitter, right? Like Twitter is a giant public forum. Reddit is like a bunch of little communities. It feels not I haven't spent that much time thinking about these things, but it does seem like those are two almost different categories of social media. And I don't think you're going to end up in a similar like the kinds of conversations that happen on Reddit are very different than the kind of conversations that happen on Twitter. And sometimes people complain about that. Oh, the idea that anybody can jump up and reply, guy you when you're on Twitter and on Reddit, you're in these very specialized forums. Oftentimes they're very different rules, very different etiquette.
00:28:21.062 - 00:29:13.434, Speaker C: People often try to create those sub communities within Twitter and say, okay, well, this is the part of Twitter where we talk this way and we do this kind of thing. But you kind of always know that you're not an enclosed space. You are talking in public. And it feels like one of the different categories of how social media and how these sort of digital spaces effectively are going to be cordoned off and how we're going to think about the rules around them. If you look at the way that people use the decentralized social media stuff today, the interesting thing about it is that it's mostly starting. Almost all these communities are starting with very high value users, right? So they're very wealthy, they're usually accomplished, they have a lot of free time. These are not like the person who's joining Twitter today is very likely a very low value, really, you know, kind of wealthy, knowledgeable, connected, elite people.
00:29:13.434 - 00:29:27.634, Speaker C: They're already on Twitter, they're already on social media. And so in some sense, I kind of feel like a little bit of what's happening with these decentralized social media plays is they're trying to attract a very, very wealthy, high LTV community. And if you can do that, then.
00:29:27.672 - 00:29:30.514, Speaker B: It'S long term value for users who.
00:29:30.552 - 00:30:13.166, Speaker C: Are or lifetime value. Lifetime value. It's plausible that if you have really, really valuable users because they're all like kind of the crypto intelligentsia or the crypto super wealthy and they hang out in one particular place, that their eyeballs will be way more valuable than other eyeballs, right? But fundamentally, that's how social media platforms monetize. They monetize on eyeballs and they advertise stuff to you, right? So you could imagine that maybe that's a story of how even if these social media platforms that are decentralized don't become world scale. They don't get hundreds of millions or even billions of users, but they're just a place where everyone there is super valuable to advertise to. That's one story of how they can become valuable. Another story is that they monetize in a totally different way.
00:30:13.166 - 00:30:45.980, Speaker C: So obviously people have talked for a long, long time about the idea that you have to pay to tweet, you have to pay to retweet. People get paid for curating, blah, blah, blah. I'm skeptical of those stories. I think like, free is just so good. It's just so charismatically obvious that that's what people want. They don't want to think about paying money to interact with a social media platform. But I think to my mind that's the bullcase is that you build a really engaged, really valuable community and that community, even though there are many fewer people than you have for broader social media, they're worth a lot more.
00:30:45.980 - 00:30:47.366, Speaker C: Thoughts?
00:30:47.558 - 00:31:29.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean that's definitely true. My dumb heuristic is. Until I see a 10 million view TikTok video about someone being excited to pay for Clicking, I'm not going to really say that it somehow has to become its own meme and there's no way paying from going from Free to that will do that. But this idea of somewhere in the middle of Reddit and Twitter finding like a hybridization crypto might actually be good for is it does lend some properties of both sides of that public agora versus the very hierarchical structured niche.
00:31:30.430 - 00:32:05.678, Speaker C: Right. Okay, well, let's move on. We have another interesting topic that took place in the last week. So SBF Sam banker Fried, the founder of FTX, he released a bunch of statements about this proposed regulation called Dccpa. I have no idea what it stands for, but doesn't matter. Basically digital currency regulation. That is still we don't have a finalized bill yet, but the bill basically is going to, one, put the CFTC in charge of regulating the crypto spot markets as well as a bunch of other stuff that may potentially touch DeFi or other elements of crypto.
00:32:05.678 - 00:32:31.980, Speaker C: It's a little bit unclear right now what's going to actually end up being in the final bill. And so he posted a bunch of tweet storms about his views on how crypto regulation and crypto policy should evolve and there ended up being a lot of backlash against SPF's views here. It seems like all of a sudden SPF has turned from the hero to the villain of the crypto community. Now a lot of people are very suspicious of his views on any of this stuff. You want to say something?
00:32:32.430 - 00:32:40.110, Speaker B: When has an Exchange CEO not had a fall from grace in crypto? I think that's literally every single one.
00:32:40.260 - 00:32:49.618, Speaker C: Not a fall from grace yet. That's a stronger term I think, than what he has. I think it's more of like a reveal that yes, Sam Bankmanfreed has his own interests that are not just okay.
00:32:49.784 - 00:33:08.620, Speaker B: But every exchange CEO has had that, as far as I can tell, including Hayden. If you count Hayden as one. Even Hayden has had that. I feel like Hayden hasn't. I mean, a little bit. I feel like the post Sushi thing kind of like, had a little bit of this.
00:33:11.550 - 00:33:25.206, Speaker C: I think people still love Hayden. I don't think there's Sam. I think Brian Armstrong and CZ, each of them have there's a shadow to them now that I think people understand and appreciate that once upon a time they didn't.
00:33:25.238 - 00:33:31.200, Speaker B: You know, I correct my statement. I said every exchange CEO star has never had that happen. Star was Star.
00:33:31.970 - 00:34:19.870, Speaker C: Okay, that's fair. Okay, well, okay, so he posted this stuff, got a lot of backlash, and there was a fantastic debate between him and Eric Voorhees, who was the founder of Shapeshift. So Eric Voorhees, longtime kind of Bitcoin influencer, thought leader type person, is founder of Shapeshift, which back in the day was one of the biggest decentralized exchanges. Back before that was a really totally coherent DeFi thing. So Eric Voorhees published a long piece in rebuttal to Sam's proposal for crypto regulation, and they ended up doing a debate on Bankless, which I thought was fantastic. If you haven't seen it, it's like 2 hours long, but it's really a fascinating debate. I think it goes into a lot of the core questions behind how crypto ought to be regulated and kind of, in a sense, goes to the heart of what we're even doing in this industry.
00:34:19.870 - 00:34:28.542, Speaker C: What did you guys think about this argument between Sam, Bankman, Fried and Eric Voorhees?
00:34:28.686 - 00:35:23.230, Speaker A: I mean, before we get into the material of the debate, I do want to say I feel like Sam, I like Sam, but should probably get like, an image consultant. I think he lost pretty much just purely on the aesthetics of the debate. It's like Sam in the FTX call center bouncing his leg up and down and kind of tweaking out and speaking like a thousand words per minute. And then Eric is in this giant mansion in Denver, and he speaks extremely calmly, and he has this glow around him. And I'm like, even if you didn't know what they were know, there's definitely a bias here. But I think yeah, there's one sort of very poignant point which sort of got circulated around Twitter, which is sort of a rehash of this argument that gets discussed a lot around the difference between Gmail and SMTP, where you can have a protocol and you can have a client, and the two can interface and the client can make certain implementation decisions. But everyone could still subscribe to this protocol.
00:35:23.230 - 00:35:59.390, Speaker A: And basically, Eric sort of rolled this out in front of Sam and asking him, why do you think we should treat DeFi differently than we treat email? And there was not really a good answer. And I think that was kind of the moment when the debate tipped. And so, yeah, overall, I think if you actually read the proposal, it's not that unreasonable. I think the main sort of point that people take issue with is the need for regulated front ends, but still allowing the protocols themselves to be unregulated. But certainly, I think, again, just a lot of it is sort of narrative and aesthetics based, which is something that's unfortunate.
00:35:59.890 - 00:36:50.560, Speaker C: So just to summarize briefly, actually, Tom, could you pull up the image from that video? Because I think it illustrates exactly what you're talking about. But the crux of the disagreements, there's a few kind of minutiae, but they got stuck on one particular question, which was, should front ends be allowed to be regulated? And Sam's view was that, look, it's not great if frontends are regulated like front ends for DeFi protocols, like the website, the URL, the domain name, whatever, it's not great for front ends to be regulated, but if you're going to give up something, give up that rather than give up everything else. So he's kind of like, look, chop off the hand to save the body. And Eric's view is like, look, why would we chop anything off? We don't even know that we need to chop anything off. We have to fight for the whole body. And why are you giving up so quickly? It seems like you have some ulterior motive if you're giving up this quickly. That was kind of the thrust of the disagreement between the two.
00:36:50.560 - 00:36:53.694, Speaker C: It's definitely the case. Oh, okay, this is great.
00:36:53.812 - 00:37:02.322, Speaker A: We got Sam and then we got Eric. You have to kind of watch the debate, I think, to sort of get a full feel for it. But it was great. I think they both made great points.
00:37:02.376 - 00:37:12.322, Speaker C: But Eric has such blue eyes. It's amazing. It was kind of terrifying how gorgeous of a man he is. Tarun, you saw the debate as well. What were your thoughts?
00:37:12.466 - 00:37:14.050, Speaker B: I didn't see the debate.
00:37:14.210 - 00:37:15.110, Speaker C: You didn't?
00:37:16.010 - 00:37:22.780, Speaker B: I have other things to do. I'm not just an investor. I have a company I don't have time to listen to.
00:37:23.950 - 00:37:24.634, Speaker C: Right, all right.
00:37:24.672 - 00:37:25.514, Speaker B: I'm sorry.
00:37:25.712 - 00:37:26.426, Speaker C: Here's what I'd say.
00:37:26.448 - 00:37:29.146, Speaker B: Papers don't write. Know.
00:37:29.168 - 00:38:04.518, Speaker C: I know. Here's what I'd say. Having listened to the problem, tom, you said the problem is one of really messaging, and I think in many ways it's true. During DeFi summer, Sam really came to prominence for his kind of just his extreme and extremely rigorous thinking and clarity. And when you're analyzing liquidity mining and you're trading stuff, and that's the name of the game, and you're talking about solana and serum and all these different things, it's like, oh, that's amazing. You're like a vitalik, like person.
00:38:04.604 - 00:38:06.678, Speaker B: And he made people rich, and he.
00:38:06.684 - 00:38:08.950, Speaker C: Made people don't forget that. People were very happy.
00:38:09.020 - 00:38:11.880, Speaker B: I think that important. Halo effect?
00:38:12.250 - 00:38:50.926, Speaker C: Yes, 100%. It's very similar to Andre in many ways. I think he sort of had an Andre like cult of personality around one, making people money, but then also a similar fall from grace. Similar fall from grace, because, again, fall from grace too strong, I would say. Just kind of losing that halo around him. And I think part of it was because that same analytical rigor, when it comes to a moment when it demands that bitcoiner political religious grandstanding, you kind of have to stand up, take a stand and give a sermon. I think that's where Sam is not as strongest.
00:38:50.926 - 00:39:52.198, Speaker C: And you've heard the debate, like, Sam was kind of like, wait, hold on, define your terms. What do you mean by this? Okay, is this like a one out of a ten? Is this like a seven for you? Is this a nine? He was really trying to get this step by step breakdown of everything that Eric was trying to debate. And Eric, on the other hand, was making this very impassioned claim, look, what is the point of all of the stuff that we're doing? He's kind of flailing around. He's kind of making this big, beautiful in a church speech exactly something that looks like a church, exactly about what he believes in, why he's in this industry. Like he's a true believer. And I think that really came across in that debate. And I think this is one of the places where I think Sam, from the perspective of a regulator, is extremely reasonable and he is somebody who a regulator can work with, but he's not somebody who the people crypto Twitter just drawn broadly, feels like they represent them as a religious leader.
00:39:52.198 - 00:39:54.634, Speaker C: And that's where I think now the breakdown is happening.
00:39:54.752 - 00:40:04.782, Speaker A: Sam has, like, less wrong brain. He's like, I'm a rationalist and everyone else is a rationalist. And unfortunately, I think for most people, it's actually not a very compelling argument. Unless of course, you also are.
00:40:04.916 - 00:41:08.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess maybe I'll take his side somewhat in one way, which is like, I think if you're an exchange CEO, you always kind of have to be duplicitously on both sides. There's just not any way to actually be a true believer in anything because you're running a venue whose entire goal is to make no sort of long term belief in any one asset you're trading. You're just trying to believe in the net volume growing. And so that's inevitably, like, your utility function, if you're a utilitarian, your utility function is much more correlated to that, whether it's a DeFi exchange, whether it's centralized exchange. And I think the problem is the narratives that exist in Twitter and especially, I think, in DeFi and NFT. Land are much more emotionally charged in some ways or at least evocative and less about utilitarianism of any form, whether philosophically, or whether it's just like, hey, I'm an expected utility maximizer. And somehow I think every exchange CEO has to go through.
00:41:08.114 - 00:41:49.680, Speaker B: It's just, like, not possible for them to forever ride the wave up. And I think it's inevitably also correlated with market going down and people are now kind of like, oh, looking for someone to blame for things. And if it's someone who got you rich and then maybe, perhaps if you joined later, made you poor or whatever. In your eyes as an emotional trader as opposed to a rational one, it's very easy to see how that can happen. But I just don't think it's possible to run an entity like an Exchange and somehow ever have any real philosophical belief in anything.
00:41:51.810 - 00:41:54.110, Speaker C: That seems too strong. That seems too strong.
00:41:54.260 - 00:42:05.298, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Brian Armstrong and Jesse Powell seem pretty passionate about they're sort of like was it like Rob Lowe in the NFL hat? They're just like they love know a.
00:42:05.304 - 00:42:06.980, Speaker B: Lot more as they stepped away.
00:42:07.350 - 00:42:33.302, Speaker C: CZ is a true believer. CZ is absolutely a true like, I think it's possible to do both. I think Sam is relatively unique in his kind of compartmentalization, but I think most Exchange CEOs, I don't think that's true. I think most CEOs are true believers. You kind of have to be to stick it through that brutal of bear markets. I mean, for Binance, it's not as true. I think for like OK for Hua B, for BitMax, for the folks who've been around, for Kraken.
00:42:33.302 - 00:42:39.710, Speaker C: Right. Even for like you had to stick it through some really friggin brutal times when nobody cared what you were doing.
00:42:39.860 - 00:43:28.346, Speaker B: You still sort of are not like I think if you started 2017 or later, it's probably quite different than the exchanges before. And that's why you made this exception for finance right. When you said it. It's a lot less philosophical and there's a lot less provenance of when you ask people why they are interested or got into space, they don't have a great cipher punk awakening or this particular hashing algorithm. I'm the inventor of it. There's none of that type of stuff. And so because of that, I think if you're new, especially if you joined during the 2021 cycle, I think you also didn't do any provenance research behind and so inevitably you get these time based conflicts.
00:43:28.346 - 00:43:33.390, Speaker B: It's like speed running, Gen Z hating millennials.
00:43:33.810 - 00:43:49.880, Speaker C: It's true. FTX has also kind of been up only since they started, right? What was it, 2018? 2019 when they started. So they've kind of just burst on the scene and it's been kind of perennial bull market for them since they've been here. So maybe that's also part of it.
00:43:50.250 - 00:43:54.546, Speaker D: Did you all see the story today where their balance sheet was released to CoinDesk?
00:43:54.658 - 00:43:54.982, Speaker C: Yes.
00:43:55.036 - 00:43:55.910, Speaker B: Alameda.
00:43:56.650 - 00:44:41.206, Speaker C: Alameda, yeah. So the high level summary, I believe they had what was it like something like 4 billion equity or 6 billion equity, and a lot of it was FTT. They had a lot of FTT on the balance sheet that they used to borrow against that's right, yeah. It did feel a little bit incomplete in the sense that there's just not enough to really understand what is going on there without understanding what are their loan agreements. Look, Know, what's the relationship between Alameda and know how much is Sam backstopping personally, some of the loans that they have. So it's hard to tell, really what's going on there. Also, this is June, so probably a lot's changed between June and today as well.
00:44:41.206 - 00:44:48.902, Speaker C: But you have to imagine all these numbers are probably a lot bigger at the end of the so, but again, hard to mean.
00:44:48.956 - 00:45:10.986, Speaker B: Obviously they have to have a ton of FTT. A, if they sold any FTT, everyone is dumping immediately. There's no doubt about that. They're the biggest market maker that uses FTT as collateral. So first of all, there's that. Secondly, they couldn't sell all of that without taking 99% haircuts on everything. So I would just throw away the FTT part because it's all about rebates on their own exchange.
00:45:10.986 - 00:45:29.000, Speaker B: Right? I mean, you have to stake FTT. So I would kind of ignore the FTT part and focus on the other part. The $2 billion equity book was interesting because I was like, that's a lot of private deals to have done. I don't know, that seemed a lot larger to me.
00:45:30.010 - 00:45:32.326, Speaker D: It could be FTX equity, though. You don't know.
00:45:32.428 - 00:45:40.166, Speaker B: That's true, but that would be bad for their disaffiliation story to get past the CFTC and to get all these trust licenses, right?
00:45:40.348 - 00:45:41.582, Speaker D: Could be Voyager.
00:45:41.746 - 00:45:45.530, Speaker B: They have a major shareholder who is the main market maker.
00:45:46.030 - 00:46:08.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, look, the reality is that this leak was so vague that we don't really know. Also, they said in the leak that CoinDesk reviewed this piece, but they also didn't know whether this was the only entity that Alameda owns. Right. So very often there are multiple entities involved in these things, so we might just be seeing one part of the balance sheet. The reality is, like, look, unless you go do due diligence on Alameda, you really don't know what the complete picture looks like.
00:46:08.552 - 00:46:17.298, Speaker B: Yeah, and also, FTT is a weird rehypothe asset for getting fee rebates and stuff, right. So you should really be I don't.
00:46:17.304 - 00:46:22.498, Speaker C: Think you need like a billion dollars of FTT to get fee rebates. Clearly that's just like they have that for collapse.
00:46:22.514 - 00:46:31.206, Speaker B: I mean, if you are the number one market maker and you want 99% of rebates because the rebates are distributed by FTT staking and you made the.
00:46:31.228 - 00:46:40.410, Speaker C: Coin wait, but doesn't Sam own Alameda? So, like, Sam is paying himself rebate. Who cares? Why would it matter?
00:46:40.480 - 00:46:48.334, Speaker B: Taking revenue from FTX and distributing it to Alameda shareholders? I mean, it seems fine. He has other shareholders FTX, sure, okay, fine.
00:46:48.372 - 00:46:50.638, Speaker C: Yes. But it's just like anyway, it doesn't matter.
00:46:50.804 - 00:46:54.514, Speaker B: I mean, I'm just pointing out that it's not that unlikely if you're, like.
00:46:54.552 - 00:47:00.210, Speaker A: Truly utilizing steve's point was you don't need a billion dollars of FTT to get, like, the max rebate.
00:47:00.870 - 00:47:06.642, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe you do need a billion dollars to defend the FTT price because.
00:47:06.696 - 00:47:13.538, Speaker C: You dan, we're trying to get SPF back on the show at least once or twice.
00:47:13.714 - 00:47:20.710, Speaker B: Hey, I defended him in this Eric Voorhees thing. I think it's just the nature of being a Shane. See you can't.
00:47:21.770 - 00:47:26.940, Speaker C: Robert, what's your view on the Sam kind know, dark side coming out?
00:47:27.310 - 00:47:54.900, Speaker D: I think it's pretty clear that his interests are in making money in what he calls effective altruism. His motives are not the benefit of an industry or the decentralization of an industry or to see any individual project succeed, whether it's the smallest startup or Bitcoin. I don't think that matters to him. I think what he cares about is operating a successful exchange and trading business.
00:47:55.750 - 00:48:30.670, Speaker C: Fair enough. Well, I knew Sam before he got into crypto because I've also been a longtime effective altruist. And I first met him in 2015, I think it was 2015, back when he was still working at Jane Street, because it was a pretty small community at that time. The one thing I will say about Sam is that Sam is he's a very honest person. And so I think he's now in a tough position because he has a lot of stakeholders that he has to be responsive to. Some of them are people who own equity in FTX. Some of them are users of his platform.
00:48:30.670 - 00:49:06.300, Speaker C: Some of them are just people in crypto. Right. You remember last year he came in to try to save Sushi and kind of took it over from Chef? Nomi, he was doing all this stuff. You could tell that it was very much for him, a feeling of obligation to just be kind of a good guy and do the right thing. Now those clearly the things that are pulling at him are much more complicated and coming from many more angles than they were at any time in the past. And so I feel for him, but at the same time, it's very clear that he can't keep that halo for too much longer if he wants to have real power in this industry. Pretty much nobody gets to keep that halo if you stick around long enough.
00:49:06.300 - 00:49:13.134, Speaker C: So unless you want to be just like a pure freedom fighter and not make any real money, I would not.
00:49:13.172 - 00:49:15.280, Speaker B: Say Eric Voorhees is poor, though.
00:49:16.290 - 00:49:18.074, Speaker C: Do you think Eric Voorhees has a halo?
00:49:18.202 - 00:49:20.400, Speaker B: The Satoshi dice didn't roll themselves.
00:49:25.090 - 00:49:50.762, Speaker C: That is a fantastic lie to, I gotta give you credit for that. We gotta make that the subtitle for the show. Okay, so last thing that happened this week is that we saw this interesting phenomenon of these reddit NFTs blowing up. The volume has kind of died down a bit. Now it's being replaced by the Art Gobblers. Art Gobblers? You can tell I'm very right.
00:49:50.896 - 00:49:56.314, Speaker B: They are the most NSFW high value NFT that exists, by the way.
00:49:56.512 - 00:50:14.414, Speaker C: Yes, it is true. But so the reddit NFTs were very interesting because of just how broad based it was. Right. So, like, the art gobblers, very kind of crypto native, very kind of insider thing. The thing that was fascinating about the Reddit NFTs is they had millions of people who were grabbing hold of this stuff. Now, they were not trading it on chain. They were not actually swapping this stuff.
00:50:14.414 - 00:50:22.926, Speaker C: But yeah. Tom, can you walk us through what exactly was the how did Reddit introduce these NFTs and what happened with the trading volume?
00:50:23.038 - 00:51:02.670, Speaker A: So these have been around for a while. So they launched this summer, but the initial version of it was kind of more like an art NFT platform, like a foundation, where it's like, you can go and mint it and it's all on polygon and you go pay the artist for some NFTs. I'm like, they weren't that popular, but they launched this second version, which is very abstracted out. So when you go and mint it, it doesn't call it an NFT, it doesn't call it a wallet. It calls it a collectible. And you create a vault and you kind of see that actually in the usage numbers, where, yeah, the user numbers look very impressive, and it's almost 3 million people who own these, but very few people have actually traded them. And so you're looking at, like, a few hundred people who've actually traded them.
00:51:02.670 - 00:51:23.922, Speaker A: And so you kind of get the sense there's this idea of sort of like the DeFi mullet, where it's like the front end is all dollars and the back end is plugging the DeFi. This is like the NFT mullet. It's like it's reddit on the front end, and you don't know that they're NFTs on the back end. Whether that's effective product strategy or not is kind of TBD. But interesting to see this time around, they've actually gotten a good chunk of activity.
00:51:24.066 - 00:51:27.122, Speaker C: So do they actually call them NFTs, or do they just call them collectibles?
00:51:27.186 - 00:51:28.626, Speaker B: They're just called collectibles.
00:51:28.738 - 00:51:32.086, Speaker D: I think in the documentation, you can see that they're NFTs.
00:51:32.278 - 00:51:32.586, Speaker B: Right.
00:51:32.608 - 00:51:34.570, Speaker A: But in the actual product experience, yeah.
00:51:34.640 - 00:51:54.610, Speaker B: I mean, the best part was reading some of the posts of people being like, these things are much better to trade than NFTs. They don't have the baggage. I love being able to sell things, and it's like, okay, there's a lot of convoluted, circular reasoning.
00:51:54.950 - 00:52:23.370, Speaker D: Yeah. Some of the comments that were on Twitter and Reddit especially, were incredible, where people were just know, NFT bashing and saying, like, NFTs have absolutely no utility whatsoever. Thank God for the digital collectibles. They have so much and unironically. I mean, just like, people couldn't separate the fact that their digital collectibles were NFTs.
00:52:23.790 - 00:52:43.790, Speaker C: I mean, in a way, what it's telling us is that we kind of messed up the NFT branding. Right. Like the concept behind NFTs and digital collectible. Yeah, totally perfect product market fit. But the word kind of has some stank on it now. And so I feel like a 16 z needs to come in and rebrand NFT the way they rebranded crypto to Web Three. We need a new word.
00:52:43.790 - 00:52:44.190, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:44.260 - 00:52:45.120, Speaker D: Web four.
00:52:46.790 - 00:52:50.962, Speaker C: Wait. Didn't we do Web five? We got to go to Web Six now. We skip web four.
00:52:51.016 - 00:52:52.658, Speaker B: Jack jumped to web five.
00:52:52.824 - 00:52:55.810, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like Windows Ten, right?
00:52:55.960 - 00:52:58.920, Speaker B: You skip nine, take up the middle one.
00:52:59.690 - 00:53:07.222, Speaker C: No, you get the middle one, because then that means that Windows there's no Windows. It means that Web Five is better than you already.
00:53:07.276 - 00:53:14.940, Speaker B: Look, windows went backwards. It went from Windows 2000 to XP and then to seven.
00:53:15.550 - 00:53:27.582, Speaker C: That's true. That's a big drop. Yeah, well, it was 98 and then 2000 and then down to seven. So you're like dropping two layers. That is true.
00:53:27.716 - 00:53:32.602, Speaker D: 31 was the best, though. Windows 31. I love that one.
00:53:32.756 - 00:53:42.706, Speaker C: Yeah. Only certain people remember this. Yeah. Well, interesting. Have you guys been doing the art gobbler stuff?
00:53:42.888 - 00:53:51.000, Speaker D: No, I haven't. I made a vow to myself at some point, a couple of months ago that I would no longer purchase NFTs, and so I am wait, what?
00:53:52.810 - 00:53:54.360, Speaker C: Robert, you got to explain this.
00:53:54.810 - 00:53:56.678, Speaker B: We talked about it on the show, I think.
00:53:56.764 - 00:53:58.166, Speaker D: Yeah, we talked about on the show, I think.
00:53:58.188 - 00:53:59.158, Speaker C: Did we talk about the show?
00:53:59.244 - 00:54:00.166, Speaker B: We mentioned it.
00:54:00.268 - 00:54:02.554, Speaker D: You guys gave me some flak for it.
00:54:02.592 - 00:54:02.906, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:54:02.928 - 00:54:07.206, Speaker D: You were like, hey, what a wimp. Why wouldn't you buy NFTs Well, I'm.
00:54:07.238 - 00:54:19.630, Speaker C: Glad that I don't remember this, but I'm glad that my past self did what I wanted to do just now, so I feel vindicated. Yeah. Okay. How does it feel being sober on NFTs? NFT sobriety interesting.
00:54:19.700 - 00:54:33.714, Speaker D: I mean, it's like drinking water at a party, right? Like, everyone else is having a wild time. You can have a great time just drinking water, watching and having conversations and all that, but I'm not a participant in this one.
00:54:33.912 - 00:54:48.950, Speaker B: I just find the concept gross, and I would feel embarrassed if I ever was involved in purchasing one in any way, shape or form. It's just like the grossest story, and I just look at those NFTs, I'm quite repulsed.
00:54:49.110 - 00:54:50.060, Speaker D: Same here.
00:54:51.230 - 00:54:54.278, Speaker A: It's some sort of furry thing, right? That's my understanding.
00:54:54.374 - 00:54:59.622, Speaker B: It's paradigm. Plus, the guy who made that show, brick and Morty.
00:54:59.766 - 00:55:01.114, Speaker C: Brick and Morty. Yeah.
00:55:01.152 - 00:55:14.690, Speaker B: But it's, like, a little too gross for my tastes. I kind of like, yeah, sure. Maybe the five people who watch Adult Swim and also use crypto, Twitter, are going to love this shit. And that's just the five of them.
00:55:14.840 - 00:55:22.334, Speaker C: I think there's actually a pretty large overlap between kind know, Peter Pan stoners and people who buy a lot of crypto.
00:55:22.462 - 00:55:53.434, Speaker B: Interesting thing about it was one of those free to earn launches, and basically all that does is just make the mev auction take all the initial revenue instead of the creator. But whatever. You could see the mev auction actually one. Of the first ones. Someone paid more than the first resale that they did. It started with the Nell. But I think the interesting thing about this kind of start of this thing I mean, I think the cool part is they have this two token thing.
00:55:53.434 - 00:56:25.862, Speaker B: It's sort of like almost like an own bond in some way. Except instead of a bond, you have this. NFT and if you own enough the NFTs, you can mint the ERC 20 this goo. And you kind of have a cycle of, like use a liquid asset, use illiquid asset. And that part is kind of interesting, but it's just like the mechanics of this thing and the way if you looked at the actual number of users and number of unique wallets, it was a very pretty non organic launch, let's say.
00:56:25.996 - 00:56:28.498, Speaker C: What was the total number of users? Like ballpark.
00:56:28.594 - 00:56:57.540, Speaker B: I hadn't looked today, but I think I looked sometime yesterday. Almost three k. Yeah, but it was pretty non organic. You could see if you drew the address cycles there's a lot of wash trading because of the way the mechanism works to move between the illiquid like own the NFT, own the goo, stake it and you get more NFT. That stuff basically seems to be dominated by ten to 15 people. If I were to guess.
00:56:58.070 - 00:57:11.282, Speaker C: That makes sense. It feels a little bit, like, mechanically kind of similar to dark forest, in that it kind of nerd sniped a bunch of people who are both smart and into NFTs and for everybody else, they're just kind of excited about the price movement.
00:57:11.346 - 00:57:19.894, Speaker B: I think if they did this last year, it would have been a huge hit. It would have been like could have memed. Like, ohm, but this year it is a huge hit.
00:57:19.932 - 00:57:23.430, Speaker C: I mean, it is like number one on OpenSea. I think it was at least yesterday.
00:57:23.510 - 00:57:27.738, Speaker B: I don't know if it's compare the number one on OpenSea now to number one OpenSea six months ago.
00:57:27.824 - 00:57:28.218, Speaker C: True.
00:57:28.304 - 00:57:34.110, Speaker B: My point is, it was, like, a little late for the cycle.
00:57:35.010 - 00:57:35.614, Speaker C: Right.
00:57:35.732 - 00:57:48.830, Speaker B: And it also just doesn't have a mass appeal. The thing about board apes and crypto punks is they don't offend that many people. At the end of the day, they're not really that offensive. I feel like a lot of people would find art gobblers offensive.
00:57:50.290 - 00:58:16.280, Speaker C: That's Fair. But it does definitely fit well into the crypto sensibility, because I think crypto crypto does kind of embrace a lot of offensiveness kind of at its core. So I feel like it's not too far off the mark there. But anyway, I think we're up on time, so we'll be back at you in a week or two. So until then, thank you, everybody. Signing Off.
