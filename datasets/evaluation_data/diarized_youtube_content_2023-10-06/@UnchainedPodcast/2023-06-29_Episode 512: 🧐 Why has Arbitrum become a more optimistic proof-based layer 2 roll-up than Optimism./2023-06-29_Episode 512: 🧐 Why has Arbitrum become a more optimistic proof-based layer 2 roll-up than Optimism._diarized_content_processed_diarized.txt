00:00:00.250 - 00:01:01.694, Speaker A: The developers who are building these apps are just looking for particular properties, right? It's like, why do I choose AWS or GCP as my Amazon web services or Google Cloud for my cloud hosting? It's like, oh, maybe they have some particular feature, or like they have a particular type of GPU and it's reliable and I can get it. True. What exactly is that difference between arbitrary optimism? Well, I think optimism bedrock upgrade kind of fixes a lot of the things that people complained about. But the block time reliability wasn't as good. The latency reliability, the way the message passing to the end user was, for mez, stuff was just better. I think it was the learning path of going from OVM to different things. So my point is, there's a sense in which arbortrum did really get a lot of these engineering decisions, right, at the time, that there were these applications that really needed them and had this amazing organic growth story, right.
00:01:01.694 - 00:01:38.390, Speaker A: They really did have organic non incentivized via tokens growth, and that built up their so my point is, I think the roll up wars there is some real politics, no doubt. Right? It certainly shows up. But I do think your technical capabilities are the most important thing eventually, right? Like, if you find you make the technical capabilities that are exactly what the developers at that time are demanding, it's going to be hard to compete with that.
