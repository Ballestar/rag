00:00:00.090 - 00:00:59.210, Speaker A: There was a great graphic that someone tweeted out showing every single major event on the schedule in Congress, particularly out of House financial services this year. And when the SEC has dropped major news about crypto and it's in the preceding one or two days, if not the Friday before, something happening on a Monday. It's uncanny. And people on Capitol Hill know it's precisely what's happening. It's not like it's going to change what the bill sponsors are doing, but the idea is that it signals to people on the fence or who are skeptical or who just simply don't care, that this isn't really worth your time, it's not worth supporting. So don't be surprised if before the 26th, 27th of this month, when they may be marking up these bills, which is a step prior to introducing them to the broader Congress, that the SEC reminds everybody that notwithstanding the Ripple decision.
