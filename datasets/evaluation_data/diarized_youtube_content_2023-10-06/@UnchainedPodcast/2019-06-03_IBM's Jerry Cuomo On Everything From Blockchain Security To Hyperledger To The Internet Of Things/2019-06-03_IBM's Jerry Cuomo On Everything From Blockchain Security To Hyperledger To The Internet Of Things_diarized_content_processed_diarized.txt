IBM is one of the founding partners of the Hyperledger project and it has announced blockchain projects in areas as diverse as private equity, shipping and logistics, pharmaceutical supply chain, food safety, media, digital rights management, and much more. Welcome, Jerry.
00:01:43.174 - 00:01:45.120, Speaker B: Thanks Laura. Good to be here.
00:01:45.490 - 00:01:48.254, Speaker A: You've been at IBM your whole career, is that right?
00:01:48.372 - 00:01:49.280, Speaker B: That's correct.
00:01:49.650 - 00:01:58.850, Speaker A: So I want to spend the majority of the interview talking about IBM's blockchain work, but I also want to know your background. So what did you do before you became focused on blockchain?
00:01:59.910 - 00:02:59.300, Speaker B: I was the CTO for our middleware group, and before that one of the founding fathers of one of our popular middleware products called WebSphere. So if you've ever bought something on ebay or at one of your favorite bank online bank websites, transferred money from one account to another, booked a flight, chances are that that's running through WebSphere software certainly was part of the E business push in the late 90s. Early, mid, late two thousand s. And that set the foundation for my interest in transaction processing. I put my kids through school with the mantra of write once, run anywhere, if you remember that Java slogan, and also with processing transaction. So when Blockchain came around, I was know this is it, this is the next big thing.
00:02:59.690 - 00:03:03.110, Speaker A: And how did you hear about Bitcoin or Blockchain?
00:03:03.690 - 00:03:55.080, Speaker B: We were doing work around mobile and IBM mobile first, and we were looking at mobile payments and one of the engineers that was working on mobile payments had this idea around how we can maybe not get directly in the payments, in the middle of the payments process, but maybe we can use points, loyalty points. We got into Gamification for a while, looking at levels and rewards and things like that, and someone introduced I knew about Bitcoin, but someone introduced the design pattern under bitcoin to me as a way to explain bitcoin. And I couldn't care less about Bitcoin. It was interesting, but it just wasn't what was capturing my attention. What was it was this design pattern. And I asked what it was called and they said it was called blockchain. And I said, that's interesting.
00:03:55.080 - 00:04:07.366, Speaker B: Going to want to follow up on this. Turn the page. A couple of months later, we had stopped working on mobile payments and Gamification, and we were working on blockchain.
00:04:07.478 - 00:04:08.860, Speaker A: And when was this?
00:04:09.230 - 00:04:18.466, Speaker B: This was I would say 2014, 2015. Right around that. Maybe late 2014, early 2015.
00:04:18.468 - 00:04:25.614, Speaker A: And what's your opinion of bitcoin now? Or just Ethereum or other public blockchains?
00:04:25.742 - 00:05:35.958, Speaker B: Well, I have the highest regard in the sense that they helped put this approach, this approach to I would say blockchain is a team sport, but building an ecosystem, building a business network, and allowing transactions to be processed not by any one specific institution, but by groups. From that perspective, I think there is a level of ingenuity there that we're very thankful to have. And I do think that it's the culmination of 20 plus years of computer science, but it did come together quite nicely in that application. And then similarly, you think everyone who started in that 2014 2015 time frame, their first love, and their first love of Fair was with Ethereum. And we were no different in IBM. So we looked at Ethereum as a platform, not just an application where bitcoin was more of a fixed network, but with Ethereum you can customize. And that became very interesting to us.
00:05:35.958 - 00:05:45.660, Speaker B: And I think from that point, we really started kind of an internal group in IBM of blockchain enthusiasts. And that's kind of where it all got started.
00:05:46.030 - 00:06:02.510, Speaker A: And so you just very briefly talked about how you made this transition from this group that was focusing on mobile payments and loyalty points and stuff, and how it suddenly transformed into being about blockchain. How did IBM decide to make that major push into blockchain?
00:06:03.350 - 00:06:40.858, Speaker B: It didn't start as a major push. I mean, it started as a group of hobbyists, almost from different walks of life. And IBM is a multinational company. So in North Carolina, in Almaden, in Yorktown Heights, New York, in different places in Europe, different IBM ers were exploring and tinkering with different aspects of blockchain. And what started happening is we started discovering each other. That was the first step. And there is an executive who runs our research division by the name of Arvind Krishna.
00:06:40.858 - 00:08:10.278, Speaker B: And Arvind was instrumental in introducing us to each other and getting us focused on a thing versus six individual things. So we started as a band of volunteers, and we incrementally started organizing ourselves. And with Arvin's executive support and regular interactions, we actually started forming a strategy right in 2015. And when we started 2016, we were not quite organized into a blockchain unit, but we were still working from different IBM business units, but we were working completely from the same hymn book in 2016. Had a strategy, had a set of goals, both working within the community at the time and I'll talk about the Hyperledger connection here, as well as our platform, which is the IBM blockchain platform. And then some of the solutions work that we've been doing, both organically, some of the networks that IBM is co founders of, some of the custom solutions that we're building with different institutions out there, and then some of the partnerships that we've had. So it's from there, 2015 to 2016, we really started establishing a more organized blockchain team within IBM, again under Arvind Krishna's leadership.
00:08:10.278 - 00:08:15.660, Speaker B: And in 2017, we're actually now a business unit. So go figure.
00:08:16.110 - 00:08:32.990, Speaker A: And yeah, I've met Arvind and he definitely has a passion for this technology and really enjoys talking about it. And I've also interviewed you before, and I know that you are the same. So how did you become VP of blockchain technologies at IBM?
00:08:34.210 - 00:09:27.730, Speaker B: It was for me, I guess only maybe one other time in my life did I see something that would not only have a profound effect on technology, but also on everyday life. The first is the Internet and doing business on the Internet. The second is blockchain. So for me, who was doing the I was the CTO for the middleware team for about 15 years. I saw this as a great opportunity, a great chance to be in at the ground floor, to help lead both from an industry perspective and then help IBM to have a seat at that industry table to help define a new market. So that comes around once in a lifetime. And I've been lucky now to be twice around e business and now this.
00:09:27.730 - 00:09:31.758, Speaker B: So I jumped in with both feet in that 2015 time frame.
00:09:31.854 - 00:09:46.150, Speaker A: And when you mentioned Hyperledger earlier, I remember that IBM aligned with Hyperledger pretty early on. Why did you guys choose that effort over other private or enterprise blockchain?
00:09:47.130 - 00:11:12.306, Speaker B: You know, at the time, we started talking to users and we realized that the type of blockchain that these users needed didn't really exist yet. And we made some attempts to connect with some of the existing communities out there, like the aforementioned Ethereum community, and great collaborators at the time, they were busy starting up the Ethereum main net. And I think we had a set of pretty deep requirements, requirements that really started to look at privacy and confidentiality in certain ways, looking at business networks that had to abide to regulations like HIPAA and European Union Data Protection Directives. So at the Know, we did try to work within the context of some of these existing communities, but we decided we had to prove this out a little bit. You know, inside IBM and this group of volunteers, we decided to start building a blockchain from the ground up, a new style of blockchain, what ultimately became a permissioned blockchain. And as we were just starting to build it, we realized this is not something that any one institution should be building by themselves. So we were doing work around Cloud, like with Cloud Foundry, OpenStack Microservices and things like that.
00:11:12.306 - 00:12:24.054, Speaker B: And the Linux Foundation, it's always been the go to place when we wanted to work with other companies, but in a way that was fairly managed and governed. So we talked to the Linux Foundation, know proposed this idea of a blockchain for business. And basically what Jim Zemlin from the Linux Foundation said, said, that's a great idea, IBM. See in the corner there those eight other companies in a line. They're lining up to do something similar. So why don't you join forces with Know? At that point, we started collaborating with the various players like Digital assets, holding intel and many of the early founders of the Hyperledger project and starting aligning our vision for this blockchain for business and figuring that if we were going to build serious software that was going to be taken seriously by major institutions and major governments around the world, that doing it in a way that no one of us could run the table. No one of us could set the rules and policies.
00:12:24.054 - 00:12:44.340, Speaker B: And to do it under the blueprint of the Linux Foundation was the way to go. And we did. And I think depending on how you measure this, it was either late 2015, early 2016, I think we announced the intention in late 2015 and actually established in February of 2016 the Hyperledger project.
00:12:44.950 - 00:12:51.300, Speaker A: And are all the blockchains that IBM uses in its various projects, are they all done with technology?
00:12:52.150 - 00:13:35.294, Speaker B: Yes. It's important because it's important to know the lineage of the technology that you're working on. And that the technology. Again, a lot of the user base, big or small, it's not necessarily the size of the business, but Everledger currently has over a million diamonds, certificates and digital fingerprints on a blockchain. And that's quite a significant set of assets. Right? So we want to make sure that the assets that are managed on the ledger, the ledger has integrity, and that the code base in which that integrity comes from is known. It's built from.
00:13:35.294 - 00:15:04.686, Speaker B: And I tell you, if you think of Hyperledger, similar to Apache, apache is an umbrella project, and there's several projects being managed at once under the Apache banner. That's the same thing for Hyperledger. There's a number of projects, and within those projects, there is a common way of thinking about licensing how that software is licensed and shared, the maturity model of starting out as incubator, growing to a mature, offering interoperability between the projects. So the Linux Foundation, like Apache, what they've done for web server technology in the Hyperledger has stepped up to be that umbrella. So we are enthusiastic about several of the projects in IBM where devote contributors to the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a core foundational technology with implementing a shared ledger and consensus and permissioning system. And also a new project that has recently been proposed called Hyperledger Composer, which is a higher level framework for building blockchain applications. So we are devote contributors to those too, and first and foremost members of that community where there is at least five or six other important technologies too.
00:15:04.868 - 00:15:27.640, Speaker A: Okay, so it sounds like you don't necessarily really control the protocol, obviously, because there are these other entities that are also working on it. But because you do have contributors that you've devoted, it seems like you're very deep in. Where does that boundary between IBM versus Hyperledger lie? How would you characterize the relationship?
00:15:28.170 - 00:15:52.178, Speaker B: I mean, we're a premier partner, right? So we have a seat at the board. In fact, I occupy that seat representing IBM to the board. Blythe. Masters is the chairman right now. And we also have Chris Ferriss, who is the elected leader for the technical committee for Hyperledger managing all the technologies.
00:15:52.374 - 00:15:53.934, Speaker A: And he is who is he?
00:15:54.052 - 00:16:29.258, Speaker B: Chris Ferriss is a distinguished engineer at IBM. So we have two Ibmrs on the board, so to speak, myself as a premier member, as well as Chris, who is voted in because as the technical committee lead and that vote happens yearly, I believe. So Chris, I think, was he's on his second term now. He was voted in again this year and I think Blythe. Masters was also voted in as her second term. So we like the leaders we have right now. So that's one connection that we have.
00:16:29.258 - 00:17:08.654, Speaker B: But we have another connection where we have some 70 engineers whose day job it is to contribute to software in the Hyperledger project. And these engineers are working across at least two projects, which is the Hyperledger Fabric project and the Hyperledger Composer project. Chris is consulting across all the projects Aroja, Explorer, Sawtooth, these are all other projects working under the so, you know, we have our eye on all of them and we are, as I said, devout contributors to a couple great.
00:17:08.712 - 00:17:25.370, Speaker A: Let's talk about one of the big blockchain projects that you guys are doing, the food supply chain project with Walmart. It must be quite an undertaking to get the world's largest retailer to agree to try something new. How did you sell Walmart on applying blockchain technology to the food supply chain?
00:17:25.870 - 00:18:44.450, Speaker B: So I think first and foremost, when you look know, while blockchain I think applies to all industries and we've seen like last year, especially early last year, the financial services group were the loudest, but there was many other industries out there looking at blockchain, looking at applications and use cases. But I think financial services was getting all the credit as some of the louder proponents of the use of blockchain. As the year unfolded, we started seeing a set of patterns, templates, things that regardless of whatever industry you're in, there was a set of companies looking to use blockchains for a certain purpose. And visibility in provenance is a generic usage that blockchain could play a big role in. So, I have multiple companies working, so I might have an importer, exporter and shipping company. And those three companies are involved in some kind of multiparty collaboration or transaction I e. The importer is expecting something from an exporter that is coming through a shipping company.
00:18:44.450 - 00:20:21.074, Speaker B: So getting visibility where any of our internal systems of record may not have the whole truth of that transaction. We'll just have our part of the truth. There is no kind of bigger picture of the truth that is across the importer, exporter and shipper, right? So, visibility ledgers, that use of blockchain is a big deal and that sets up provenance, which is who owned this thing and what happened to it along the way, how is ownership transferred. And that is a basic usage of blockchain across multiple industries. So one side, you can use that very same pattern for tracking in a healthcare scenario, the validity of drugs as they're manufactured and shipped, or Mangoes and Avocados and food quality. So there's a basic design pattern or in a financial services supply chain watching how loans and channel financing is done for parts and suppliers, right? So I think there is this basic pattern that we see. And Walmart, like many global companies that manage complex supply chains, latched right onto this view, which is blockchain could really be used to give visibility, where visibility doesn't exist across multiple parties that interact across the various supply chains that they're involved with.
00:20:21.074 - 00:21:27.526, Speaker B: So, again, we see this pattern across multiple industries. We're fortunate to have partners like Walmart who are collaborating with us to actually stand up a network to use this pattern to actually not only do something good for business, but also do something good for society. Because I think food qualities like this are not only going to reduce waste and there is a lot of waste in food supply chain but also looking at salmonella outbreaks and not shutting down all of the pork coming. Out of a region, but being able to trace it to the farm and say, okay, this farm is quarantined, but the region is okay, we can continue pork production across that. And that's an important thing to be able to pinpoint at that level with this ledger, with this food quality ledger, this is increasingly becoming a reality. And we've had our first asset transfers as we watched food tracked in two different regions of the world using our IBM blockchain platform that's powered by the.
00:21:27.548 - 00:21:31.990, Speaker A: Hyperledger fabric and what are those regions and what food is being tracked?
00:21:33.550 - 00:22:21.820, Speaker B: I mentioned the two are one is pork. And I'm going to get this, I have to go back and look at the reference. But I think getting one is pork and I think it was in China. And we did a series of tests. And Laura, one of the things in blockchain, like any system, there are phases, right? And I think there's the crawl, walk and run phase. None of these networks are at the run phase yet, but several of them are walking and we progress up. And I think we've been in the case of the food quality project with Walmart, and some of the work that we've done with our teams in China is to shoot a tracer through the system.
00:22:21.820 - 00:23:23.598, Speaker B: So let's go end to end, get multiple institutions involved using the same ledger and run a couple through, if you know what I mean. Right. So let's look at a shipment going from an exporter to a regional supplier to border patrol, et cetera, et cetera, and take it through and look at the transaction going through the ledger to make sure this system is working as expected. Right, so that's usually the crawl phase and then the walk phase is to get more and more institutions gaining visibility on that ledger, right. So including more of that ecosystem, members of the ecosystem. So maybe a food processing company, maybe a retail company, et cetera, and start building out the members of that ecosystem that are now leveraging the ledger, if that makes sense.
00:23:23.764 - 00:23:35.700, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm assuming for the run phase you have kind of like some target goals in mind. How many transactions might a blockchain like that process per day?
00:23:36.870 - 00:24:56.218, Speaker B: Probably not as many as you think. One of the things about blockchain is that blockchain is less used in these cases as a database for the data itself, but more as an event tracking system, evidence that things have happened versus the things themselves. So obviously we're not putting pork on the blockchain, grinding it down and molecularly putting it on, but we're doing things like we're recording evidence of the packages and in some cases RFID tags that the shipments are contained in and things of that nature. And each institution that passes probably has about four or five events that they instrument their existing It systems to implement and push over into the ledger. Right. So again, each institution still has their existing It systems, but they're adding a couple more bits of information and pushing it over to the ledger. And this is allowing, again, this bigger system of truth to establish if that makes sense.
00:24:56.304 - 00:25:11.070, Speaker A: And are there Internet of things, devices that are used to make this happen? Like when a shipment arrives in a particular port, is there some kind of device that triggers a new entry on the blockchain?
00:25:11.570 - 00:26:18.840, Speaker B: I think in the run phase we would like it to be completely automated and right down to the RFID, I'm sorry, the IoT devices, they're registered and trusted, so they have certificates associated with them. And we'd only trust information coming from certain, I'd say, permissioned devices. And I think that's the end state we actually want to get there in the state we're in right now, which is somewhere between kind of entering into the walk phase and starting one or two experiments around run. Some of this is just being manually added. I'm saying manually, we're doing everything. One of the terms, Laura, that we've brought up is this notion of a shadow ledger, which is we're not changing the existing business processes, but we're enhancing them. So the ledger isn't the system of record, but it's an enrichment to the system of record.
00:26:18.840 - 00:26:43.850, Speaker B: So in these phases, we will do things, I'd say lighter integration, like log scraping and maybe in a proxy server, sending an additional message out and things of that nature. Right. So I think right now, the phase we're in, we're not quite fully automated IoT, but we're starting to see how that can come into play and how we can automate.
00:26:44.010 - 00:27:05.494, Speaker A: And a shadow ledger is sort of a way of just getting kind of like the system up and running to see how this would work. But before you fully transfer all of the information onto a blockchain, and then once the shadow ledger kind of works fairly well, then you can start thinking about transferring everything over. Is that the purpose of that?
00:27:05.532 - 00:27:46.082, Speaker B: Okay, exactly right. If the shadow ledger stops working, you can still make shipments. It doesn't bring down the whole ecosystem. The ecosystem still works, but the shadow ledger is there to shadow follow or enrich the main business process and add value. In this case, the value is visibility across multiple groups. And I think as we build up that, as we build up that, over time, that will become this system of record. But we don't need to rip and replace all the existing systems before we start bringing value into that ecosystem, I guess is the point.
00:27:46.216 - 00:28:14.410, Speaker A: Okay. And one last question, which is sort of just a question about how some of these b, two b business models work. Once you develop this system and this technology, can you then also go and sell this system to Walmart's competitors? Like, could you say to Aldi or some other grocer, hey, we have this great food shipment tracking method? Is that something that you're free to do?
00:28:14.560 - 00:29:12.038, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. One of the things I believe is there will not be one blockchain to rule them all. I think like today, these shared ledgers will pop up within, in and around existing business ecosystems. I think that's the most natural, the natural pull will be towards enriching the way businesses currently interact today. I think over time, what's going to happen is adjacent blockchains will start to merge or at a minimum, interoperate with each other, right? And then you kind of have a web effect going on where you'll be able to interlink ledger system A and ledger system B together. And a transaction can actually flow from one to another. So you can get permission to query from one ledger to the other.
00:29:12.038 - 00:30:03.662, Speaker B: And then I see probably maybe a Walmart ecosystem merging with another ecosystem, because when you think about it, a lot of the suppliers are also members of those other ecosystems too. Right? But I think that's an advanced run. Maybe that's when we get to the sprint phase, we start looking at how these ecosystems start to play together. And really when we get to that point and that's certainly a social point of how these ecosystems work together. But also it's a technological point how do we integrate these blockchains? And I think there's two points. Clearly, the hyperledger fabric, as a core foundational technology has capabilities that will allow multiple ecosystems to collaborate. So that's one thought.
00:30:03.662 - 00:30:40.694, Speaker B: But I also think that not every blockchain, although I'd love to see convergence around hyperledger fabric technology, I think the reality is there's going to be multiple technologies out there, so there will still be a need for blockchains to interoperate with one another. And I think as we get to these permissioned blockchains, perhaps in 2018, the end of next year, that will start to become an interesting topic of discussion. How do these blockchains interact? But we need permission blockchains first to exist before we have to worry about how they're going to interoperate.
00:30:40.822 - 00:31:28.854, Speaker A: Yes, I do hear some people talking about the interoperability and how that might work, but you're right, it's far off.

00:31:28.854 - 00:31:52.880, Speaker A: You can learn more and see examples of its work@thinkonramp.com. I'm speaking with Jerry Cuomo, vice President of Blockchain Technologies at IBM. Let's talk about a project that's somewhat at the other end of the spectrum from the Walmart one. This is a private equity project with a less well known company, Northern Trust. Who is Northern Trust and what does this blockchain do?
00:31:53.270 - 00:33:06.546, Speaker B: So one of the things that Northern Trust is looking at doing is remove friction from the process of private equity management and private equity administration. So you've heard of private equity funds and northern Trust is one of the world's largest private equity fund management companies. Out there, like any regulated activity around financial services, private equity to produce and create a fund and to manage the fund, there are many players involved. And across the players one of the players, there is regulatory involvement and rules that need to be followed. And Northern Trust had this idea of building a private equity management ecosystem around a shared ledger, where as a fund is being created, as a fund is being managed in its various states, getting that collaboration to occur on a shared ledger.
00:33:06.738 - 00:33:17.100, Speaker A: And can you describe for me the lifecycle of a private equity deal and what are all the different transactions that can happen and then how the blockchain would manage those?
00:33:17.630 - 00:33:57.574, Speaker B: Not very well. I know more about food quality and private equity than I ever did before. But I'm far from an expert. I do know a number of things. Like from an overall design pattern is that there are multiple institutions involved in multiple countries and there are documents that are exchanged amongst these institutions. The documents have to be validated and consented on that the documents were validated on this time and date. And there needs to be audit trails of those activities happening.
00:33:57.574 - 00:35:03.070, Speaker B: You can't go back, it would be really a bad thing to go back and alter any of those agreements that are embodied in those documents. And then as this is all happening, a regulatory commission needs to sign off and actually see have visibility as an auditor to these activities as they are happening. Right? So there's multiple players exchanging information and doing it under regulatory guidance. So I think that at least from where we came in this from, IBM was helping Northern Trust and the key members of their ecosystem to kind of come to a level playing field very quickly. Meaning building out this environment on a shared ledger required each of the members to process documents a certain way, push those documents out to a new environment, which is this shared ledger environment. So if we all had to do this know, I like to talk about blockchain being a team sport. Like if each institution had to do this as a one off, that would take a lot of time.
00:35:03.070 - 00:35:50.566, Speaker B: So what IBM did is we helped them kind of raise the tide for all of the members of the ecosystem equally so, helping build the smart contracts, deploy those smart contracts to all the players through what we call a high security business network. Right? So one of the core underpinnings of IBM blockchain is this thing we call the high security business network. So Northern Trust and the members of the Northern Trust ecosystem all leveraged this to quickly get at the blockchain software and the various portals that we had to construct so that they know push documents and sign documents and get them out onto the ledger. So that's what we. Did in IBM. And there are people in IBM that understand private equity. I'm not one of them.
00:35:50.566 - 00:35:51.200, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:35:51.890 - 00:36:22.258, Speaker A: Well, that's fine. I actually wanted to ask you about security though. How do you manage security in a private blockchain? Like how many nodes would you need to feel that a blockchain was secure? As you know, Bitcoin and other public blockchains use many nodes because simply, really, anybody can join. So what metrics do you also use? Number of nodes or computing power as a way to measure security or do you have different metrics?
00:36:22.434 - 00:37:08.994, Speaker B: No, we have different metrics. So as I said, this is permission blockchain and we do run consensus. There is a consensus algorithm and there are maintainers of the integrity of the ledger that run their own copy of the blockchain software. So the minimum number is around five nodes, and there's statistic importance to that. You have to be able to reach consensus. So reaching consensus with two nodes is pretty difficult. Three nodes, it's possible, but if one node happens to be down for a reason, then you're back to two, right? So you want to make it big enough so that you can reach consensus, so you can reach a majority.
00:37:08.994 - 00:37:15.414, Speaker B: So the magic number, minimum number is usually around that number, five or six.
00:37:15.532 - 00:37:22.140, Speaker A: But then what's the ideal number? I mean, I can't imagine five as the ideal. That's the bare minimum. What's an ideal number?
00:37:22.910 - 00:38:28.590, Speaker B: That's the bare minimum. And the ideal number is a function of what the business network does and what is the foundation of trust for that network. I've said this several other times. To convict a Felon, the justice system says you need a jury of twelve, right? So that is the right number. And that was derived as the right number within that ecosystem at that problem. Right? And you look at other trust relationships, like some of the work that we're doing around trusted identity in Canada with SecureKey the trust system, especially in Canada, the regional banks, the six main banks of Canada, are viewed as a foundation of trust. So if all six banks are consenting, are part of the consenting algorithm, it's interesting to see how other institutions in that ecosystem will delegate their trust to the six.
00:38:28.590 - 00:39:10.810, Speaker B: Right? And we see this depending on the ecosystem. There is a hierarchy of trust, right? So there's usually a judge, which is one or more groups that set the rules. Then there's the jury, which is the group that maintain the rules and apply the rules, which is usually the number, and then their participants. And there can be many more participants, but the participants delegate their trust to the jury, who delegates their trust to the judge. Right? So there's a hierarchy in a permissioned blockchain and it works out really well. But you don't need everyone in the network to be running blockchain software. Many people in the network may need access to it and it's permissioned access.
00:39:10.810 - 00:40:02.650, Speaker B: You need keys to be able to sign a transaction, to do a query. But not everyone needs to be weighing in on the consensus, and that's a function of what the network is doing, right? So an important part of the founder, I call them the judges or the founder in this example, is to set the rules. What is the rule of that blockchain? And we talk about public or private. I'm not sure that either of those are right. It's just that in a permissioned blockchain, you can apply these thoughts, right? In a permissioned blockchain, you can set up this hierarchy of trust. And I think this hierarchy of trust is much closer to the way we see institutions running today. I mentioned convictioning, a felon.
00:40:02.650 - 00:40:52.010, Speaker B: We can't get on a plane unless we have a government issued ID card, whether it's a driver's license or a passport. So we trust the DMZ. We trust the Homeland Security group. So there is a delegation of trust for any ecosystem. And I think what we're seeing is these early adopters of blockchain for permissioned blockchain are emulating that and actually some people come back and say, well then, is it really a blockchain? And the answer is, heck yeah. All of the benefits that you get from decentralization, from having that Immutable ledger, the audit trail, the visibility is all there, right? The smart contract pieces, they're all there. So I think it's a way, as I said, it is a new style blockchain.
00:40:52.010 - 00:40:58.814, Speaker B: It is a new style blockchain that I think more closely emulates the way society operates today.
00:40:58.932 - 00:41:18.006, Speaker A: You've raised a couple of times this issue of trust and also different in different ways. You've referenced identity. And I know that this is going to be a linchpin in this whole future of blockchains. And this is also an area that you guys are working in. Tell us exactly what you're doing and who your partners are.
00:41:18.188 - 00:42:45.218, Speaker B: So I think there's probably two dimensions when you talk about identity and blockchain, there's two dimensions to it, two sides to the coin. There's identity within the blockchain ecosystem. And that's the relationship that I just talked about, the trust relationship from the founders, to the maintainers of the integrity of the ledger to the participants in that network, I think these are all form the core relationships of institutions participating within the shared ledger. So I think that's from that perspective, there is the digital identity of the institutions that comprise the blockchain ecosystems that we've been talking about, whether it's private equity or Walmart, food quality, et cetera. But then there is, could we use a blockchain for reimagining a consumer identity, know, for larger populations, users like you and I, where today to get on an aeroplane, we need to hold a plastic driver's license along with our phone that has a digital boarding pass. Why can't we have a digital boarding pass and a digital proof of our identity being all on our phone. Right.
00:42:45.218 - 00:43:09.138, Speaker B: And I think a blockchain becomes a very interesting way to meet some of the most stringent requirements that privacy institutions are really pushing. Things like self sovereign, that the end user has to be in control of where and who and when their digital identity is utilized.
00:43:09.234 - 00:43:22.650, Speaker A: Is that how your digital identity work? Is that the goal here, for it to be self sovereign? I know you guys are doing some work with different banks in Canada around that, but I'm not sure exactly how it's structured.
00:43:22.810 - 00:44:38.514, Speaker B: Yeah, Secure Key is a business partner, and we made a recent announcement that we're working together. They're well underway of building an identity verification system on IBM blockchain, leveraging the hyperledger fabric, and that is a self sovereign identity system that they're building I. E. The user is in control of their identity attributes, but it's managed across an ecosystem, an identity ecosystem of institutions. And these are the pillars of society, like banks, like Telcos, like provinces, et cetera. It's, I think, a very clever system that is well recognized by identity aficionados like NIST, the National Institute for Standards and Technology, who've put out identity frameworks best practices for how to deal with consumer identity. As I said, things like, you shouldn't be able to do analytics on identity.
00:44:38.514 - 00:45:12.714, Speaker B: You shouldn't be able to trace identity. You shouldn't have honeypots intermediaries that are collecting honeypots of identity. You should only ask the minimal amount of questions, like when you show up at a bar to prove your age. The age proof is you're sharing an identity document that also has your address and that you're an organ donor. That's extra questions that weren't. You didn't need to provide that information. You just need to say, are you over 21 or not? Right.
00:45:12.714 - 00:45:39.206, Speaker B: So identity, there are these fine institutions around the world that are making really important observations and putting important frameworks in place around how to manage digital identity. And institutions like SecureKey are finding a way have found a way to use a blockchain to implement those. Right. And then the system that they're building in Canada is one such example.
00:45:39.388 - 00:46:27.786, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of really great ways to or a lot of great ways that blockchains can solve some problems that occur around identity, such as fraud, which another guest I've had on the podcast, Catherine Hahn, who is with the Department of justice, she talked at length about that in her podcast. So I will reference that in our show notes. Another project I wanted to ask you about is one that I'm actually personally interested in because it concerns digital rights management for creators. In this case, you guys are working with musicians, and I'm interested in it because my copyright is actually stolen very often. So can you tell us briefly what it is that IBM is doing in this area and how this technology will.
00:46:27.808 - 00:47:35.950, Speaker B: Work on the digital rights? So, you know, again, digital rights management is perfect for this application. And there are a number of partners that have come to IBM on looking at using digital or distributed ledger technology for, again, very much similar to our conversation around identity, which is managing rights with full visibility, traceability provenance and all that. Remember I said earlier, Laura, there's a pattern here and whether it's digital rights or pork in China or healthcare records, this notion of going from the originator and having that original stamp, right? So whether it's the original copyright, whether it's a digital sampling and a signature from a piece of music or art or a picture or a high res picture of a diamond, it starts with the provenance, the origin and be able to put that origin mark.
00:47:36.100 - 00:47:43.810, Speaker A: And so does this work kind of like as a smart contract that's embedded in an MP3 file or something? Is that how it is structured.
00:47:45.510 - 00:49:18.202, Speaker B: For digital rights management? I have yet to see. We talked about some of the crawl walk run phases of some of the other projects. I haven't seen any of the digital rights actually make it to the walk phase yet. So to say how is it done? Is it done with smart contracts and MP3 s or not clear yet. But smart contracts do play an important role here on any kind of when you get into self sovereign management. The ability to set a contract that says here is a key to this and you have the key, this key is valid for the duration of this contract, right? And then after that, so whether it's renting a piece of music or a podcast or I'm going into a hospital and I want to allow that hospital to write to my healthcare records, contribute to my healthcare record collection, I think managing utilization and ownership read, write access via smart contracts is a very powerful thing. And the nice part about blockchain and how, for example, the hyperledger fabric manages data and logic, it manages them all on the ledger, right? So the contract is the data, the data is also the contract.
00:49:18.202 - 00:50:28.290, Speaker B: So these things are managed on the ledger in the same immutable fashion as the data is. So that gives the tools and the capability, puts it in the hands of those groups that are looking at how to reimagine digital rights management on the blockchain. That's a very powerful set of tools and it's the same tools that, again, I think a lot of the folks that we've been talking about in this podcast are using across different industries. But it's a similar pattern and it is the same exact tools. I said that looking now across the last year of users and founders building solutions on blockchain. I see from a hyperledger fabric perspective, 100% of the users, across all these various use cases and industries, 100% of the users utilize about 90% of the technology. Which means that hyperledger fabric and the tool set that it brings around it is quite applicable to all industries.
00:50:28.290 - 00:50:55.260, Speaker B: And these design patterns that we talked about, visibility, provenance, et cetera, are the same or similar across all of these. And then the 10% difference Hyperledger fabric provide is modular, right? So you can create and plug in new modules to customize it. So I think between that and the smart contracts, you can really start to tailor for various use cases like the ones we've talked about here.
00:50:55.630 - 00:51:43.260, Speaker A: Well, IBM has its hands in so many of the different cutting edge blockchain projects that are out there, there isn't time to cover them all. Another one I wanted to ask about was the work you're doing with Merrisk. But in the interest of time, I actually want to use the last remaining minutes to ask you about some criticism that I've heard. IBM has at least 400 clients, according to a New York Times article that I read, who are testing out blockchain technology, and 650 employees working on blockchain. So what do you say to some people who have expressed potential worries that if a big public company like IBM is creating blockchain solutions that sets up IBM to potentially lock its customers into their version of the.
00:51:45.950 - 00:52:38.400, Speaker B: You? It's not potential. We hear it, we've heard it before and I think it's probably not ultimately, it's obviously not something that we're intending to do. That's not our intention. In fact, the whole opening conversation around building within the community process of the Hyperledger project is a key way we go forward, and building out around that open source set of projects is where it all starts. And of course, from that perspective, we're going to try to provide some of the best production environments around that. And we're hoping some of the newer members of the Hyperledger project, like SAP, Red Hat, Cisco have been in there. We're hoping some of our peers in Hyperledger will be as eager as we are.
00:52:38.400 - 00:52:54.370, Speaker B: And I think until we start to see some of the others pick up their press releases and pick up their commercial plans around blockchain, it's going to be looking like IBM is outstanding in the field by ourselves and all of those proprietary comments will come up.
00:52:54.520 - 00:53:14.700, Speaker A: Yeah, it is true, it is a little bit early, and I do know that there are other efforts like the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which just announced and so is potentially a competitor, but also relatively new. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show. Where can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you?
00:53:15.230 - 00:53:42.580, Speaker B: I think the two places obviously Hyperledger.org. Please join the community. We as the Hyperledger community, welcome everyone, both technology companies, users from all industries, et cetera. So that's place number one to go, I think place number two to go is Ibm.com slash blockchain. And you can read about all of the things we talked about offer there.
