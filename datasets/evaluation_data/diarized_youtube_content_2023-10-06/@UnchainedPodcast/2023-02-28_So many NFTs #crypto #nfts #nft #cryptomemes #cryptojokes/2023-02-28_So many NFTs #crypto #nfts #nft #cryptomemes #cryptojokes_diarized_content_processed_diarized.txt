00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.754, Speaker A: NFT industry is panicking. And this time it's not because of a weird asset trip. It all started when Jeffrey Huang, aka Machi Big Brother, a well known crypto whale, sold over a thousand NFTs. I know what you're thinking. Why would anyone own over a thousand NFTs? Well, he did, but he got rid of them. He sold board apes, mutant apes, azukis. He even tried to sell off his own virginity.
00:00:21.754 - 00:00:43.478, Speaker A: But I don't think that one took. Some are speculating that this was the largest NFT sale of all time. Which does make sense. I mean, why would anyone want to sell off their NFTs? Me, personally, I've just used them to decorate my wall. He sold them on Blur, which is now the largest NFT marketplace by volume. Here's where it gets weird. Atie and his fellow whale, Franklin Is Bored have been trading NFTs back and forth for weeks.
00:00:43.478 - 00:00:59.850, Speaker A: They're trying to boost trading volume for blur's AirDrop, which is a multi month process wherein blur airdrops tokens to large traders. So, in essence, these whales are just trying to get free stuff. It's relatable. I mean, I spent 6 hours on Saturday answering surveys online to get one free gift card to Denny's.
