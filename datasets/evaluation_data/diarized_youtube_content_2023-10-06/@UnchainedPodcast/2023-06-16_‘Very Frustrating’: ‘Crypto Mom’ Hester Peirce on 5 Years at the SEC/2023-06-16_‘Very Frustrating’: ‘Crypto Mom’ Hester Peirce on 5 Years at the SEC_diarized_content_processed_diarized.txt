Today's guest is SEC Commissioner Hester Purse.
00:01:01.978 - 00:01:03.562, Speaker B: Welcome commissioner purse.
00:01:03.706 - 00:01:04.346, Speaker C: Hi, Laura.
00:01:04.378 - 00:01:05.620, Speaker A: It's great to be back.
00:01:06.230 - 00:01:23.718, Speaker B: The SEC has taken a particular approach to regulating crypto in the US. And in the last few months especially, it's becoming more clear that it's regulation by enforcement. If you became the chair of the SEC today, what would you do in the first six months to regulate crypto in the US.
00:01:23.884 - 00:01:24.866, Speaker A: Well, thanks, Laura.
00:01:24.898 - 00:01:39.206, Speaker C: And I do want to start with my standard disclaimer, which is that my views are my own views as a commissioner and not necessarily those of my fellow commissioners or the SEC as a whole. If I were able to set the agenda for the SEC, which would require.
00:01:39.238 - 00:01:41.726, Speaker A: Me to be chair, I would, I.
00:01:41.748 - 00:01:43.918, Speaker C: Think, take each of the discrete issues.
00:01:44.004 - 00:01:49.854, Speaker A: Around crypto, try to develop some sort of position paper so that we could.
00:01:49.892 - 00:02:02.706, Speaker C: Then put those out for people to look at, comment on, and then come in and actually have a discussion. I think it's really valuable to have people discussing the same document together to.
00:02:02.888 - 00:02:05.966, Speaker A: Sort of assess whether the approach laid.
00:02:05.998 - 00:02:07.622, Speaker C: Out in the position paper makes sense.
00:02:07.676 - 00:02:19.494, Speaker A: Or not, and then move on from there. I think that there are a number of issues, discrete issues, that could be addressed to make it clear either how.
00:02:19.532 - 00:02:29.786, Speaker C: We as an agency need to move forward or maybe to lay the groundwork for Congress to move forward. This kind of conversation is something that we could have in conjunction with the.
00:02:29.808 - 00:02:34.670, Speaker A: CFTC, obviously would be respectful of wherever Congress is.
00:02:34.820 - 00:02:41.886, Speaker C: I think that's important as well. I mean, there's a lot of activity right now in Congress on crypto, and.
00:02:41.908 - 00:02:44.962, Speaker A: So the agencies need to be looking.
00:02:45.016 - 00:02:56.174, Speaker C: To Congress for their direction. But I think the agencies also can be pretty helpful in thinking through some of the more technical problems and doing that again with the help of industry.
00:02:56.302 - 00:02:59.398, Speaker B: And what are those discrete areas that you would want to look at?
00:02:59.484 - 00:03:04.246, Speaker C: So I think question number one is what kind of disclosure do you want.
00:03:04.348 - 00:03:06.950, Speaker A: When people buy tokens?
00:03:07.530 - 00:03:11.894, Speaker C: That's something you can talk about. Second thing is, if you have trading.
00:03:11.942 - 00:03:17.834, Speaker A: Platforms, what would a good set of rules look like for trading platforms and.
00:03:17.872 - 00:03:23.642, Speaker C: Who might be the agency that would oversee those or would it be a joint effort?
00:03:23.786 - 00:03:25.726, Speaker A: And again, some of these questions are.
00:03:25.748 - 00:03:29.054, Speaker C: Going to be resolved by Congress, not necessarily by the SEC.
00:03:29.252 - 00:03:35.246, Speaker A: And then another area would be custody. There's some unique issues around custody of.
00:03:35.268 - 00:03:38.034, Speaker C: Digital assets and I think that's something.
00:03:38.072 - 00:03:40.606, Speaker A: That you'd want to think about, you'd.
00:03:40.638 - 00:03:47.334, Speaker C: Want to think about and again, some of this may not fit within the SEC's jurisdiction, may or may not. You'd want to think about stablecoins, how.
00:03:47.372 - 00:03:59.202, Speaker A: They should be regulated. So those are some of the places where I would start. I think it would make sense. You want to also have a framework.
00:03:59.266 - 00:04:01.894, Speaker C: For people to identify which regulatory regime.
00:04:01.942 - 00:04:06.410, Speaker A: They fit in, and I think that would be something that could be discussed as well.
00:04:06.560 - 00:04:24.640, Speaker B: In a recent interview on Unchained's premium offering, former SEC cyber enforcement chief Rob Cohen said that he thought it was unfair that the SEC has been naming crypto tokens as securities in lawsuits where the token issuers are not named as defendants and so are unable to defend themselves. What's your response to those?
00:04:25.170 - 00:04:27.022, Speaker C: Know, this is one of the areas.
00:04:27.086 - 00:04:33.426, Speaker A: Where people really want to get clarity around what's going to be treated as.
00:04:33.448 - 00:04:38.166, Speaker C: A security and what's not a security. And I've been talking about this for a long time that I think we.
00:04:38.188 - 00:04:41.894, Speaker A: Need to be very legally precise in.
00:04:41.932 - 00:04:46.854, Speaker C: How we're thinking about these things. And you do end up in a.
00:04:46.892 - 00:04:50.726, Speaker A: Situation where it's not only in crypto.
00:04:50.758 - 00:04:57.558, Speaker C: But there are many areas where we may bring a lawsuit and someone else may have an interest in the outcome.
00:04:57.734 - 00:05:00.106, Speaker A: Of that lawsuit or even in the.
00:05:00.128 - 00:05:01.718, Speaker C: Fact that we brought a lawsuit.
00:05:01.814 - 00:05:04.858, Speaker A: And that can be very problematic.
00:05:05.034 - 00:05:41.446, Speaker B: One of the more famous enforcement cases the SEC has made in crypto was the one against EOS, which is now perceived as a slap on the wrist since EOS raised $4 billion in an ICO, for which the company that launched the network paid only $25 million in a fine. In contrast, some of the tokens that have been named as securities in the recent lawsuits followed all the rules. They qualified for proper exemptions so they wouldn't have to register their tokens as securities. Now their tokens have been named as securities in these lawsuits. Why do you think these enforcement actions have been so unevenly applied and do you agree with how they've been applied?
00:05:41.558 - 00:05:52.366, Speaker C: I think if you look at trying to address the issues in crypto using an enforcement approach, I think we're all going to agree there are a lot.
00:05:52.388 - 00:05:55.274, Speaker A: Of frauds in the space where you're.
00:05:55.322 - 00:06:03.520, Speaker C: Basically using the label crypto and you're raising funds for yourself that you're going to run off with yourself and you're lying to people.
00:06:03.890 - 00:06:05.474, Speaker A: I think we can all agree that.
00:06:05.512 - 00:06:19.158, Speaker C: That'S an appropriate place for enforcement to come in. As I've said, though, if we're going to try to go on an ICO by ICO, a token by token approach, we're going to be at this for many, many years.
00:06:19.324 - 00:06:29.580, Speaker A: It's a very slow way to do things. So I think we really need to think about providing a regulatory solution to.
00:06:30.110 - 00:06:43.070, Speaker C: The again, there are real issues around information asymmetry and around protecting customers that we want to think about. We can think about those, but I think a regulatory approach is better.
00:06:43.220 - 00:06:47.774, Speaker A: Now, I will say that people need to be aware that we look at.
00:06:47.812 - 00:06:50.058, Speaker C: Each case on its facts and circumstances.
00:06:50.154 - 00:06:52.654, Speaker A: And you can look at a few.
00:06:52.692 - 00:07:02.562, Speaker C: Facts, you can pick out a few facts and say, well, I think this case should be compared to another case, and this case doesn't appear fair in comparison to this other case.
00:07:02.696 - 00:07:04.690, Speaker A: But there may be other facts that.
00:07:04.760 - 00:07:07.394, Speaker C: Weigh one way that push one way or the other.
00:07:07.432 - 00:07:10.726, Speaker A: And I think it's really important to remember that.
00:07:10.908 - 00:07:12.134, Speaker C: If you want to know how I.
00:07:12.172 - 00:07:14.886, Speaker A: Feel about particular cases, you can look.
00:07:14.908 - 00:07:16.754, Speaker C: At my voting record on those cases.
00:07:16.802 - 00:07:18.946, Speaker A: It doesn't come out till I will.
00:07:18.988 - 00:07:27.994, Speaker C: Say if we're bringing a litigated action, you won't see that until the conclusion of the litigation. If it's a settlement, you can look.
00:07:28.032 - 00:07:30.410, Speaker A: At that closer to real time.
00:07:30.560 - 00:07:48.110, Speaker B: I recently did an interview with two crypto trading platforms that had gotten FINRA approved to trade digital asset securities. One of them in particular, Prometheum, received a special purpose broker dealer license. And I wondered what you thought of this as a path for existing crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, et cetera.
00:07:48.190 - 00:08:02.678, Speaker C: Well, we put that special purpose broker dealer relief out, I think at the end of it was December 2020, if I recall correctly. And so we now have one firm that has been able to get through.
00:08:02.764 - 00:08:08.394, Speaker A: And get this designation. And even at the time that we.
00:08:08.512 - 00:08:11.466, Speaker C: Put that relief out there, made it.
00:08:11.488 - 00:08:18.278, Speaker A: Available to people, I thought it was too narrow. It makes it quite difficult to use that relief.
00:08:18.454 - 00:08:25.754, Speaker C: So now we have an opportunity to see how it will work. But I think people really need to look at the conditions in that relief.
00:08:25.802 - 00:08:29.070, Speaker A: And see how narrow they are and.
00:08:29.140 - 00:08:31.786, Speaker C: Ask whether is that really the solution.
00:08:31.978 - 00:08:34.926, Speaker A: The regulatory solution that we're looking for?
00:08:35.108 - 00:08:48.086, Speaker C: My response would be, I don't think that's the regulatory solution. We need to really sit down and come up with a serious framework. That was a baby step, right? I'm not saying that it was good we did something. I was happy at the time we.
00:08:48.108 - 00:08:53.078, Speaker A: Did something, but I never viewed it as the solution to the problem.
00:08:53.244 - 00:09:27.746, Speaker B: On my show, Prometheum's CEO Aaron Kaplan seemed to imply that Ether, for example, is a digital asset security and so could be listed on the Prometheum site. Do you agree with that? Obviously you may not be able to answer for Ether specifically, but their website included screenshots of trading, for instance, like comp or something like that. So if you agree that tokens that are kind of all in that class could be agreed, then I wonder who you thought would register those tokens as a security with the proper paperwork and disclosures, if any.
00:09:27.928 - 00:09:29.682, Speaker C: Laura I think what you're pointing out.
00:09:29.736 - 00:09:37.462, Speaker A: Is that there are unique aspects of digital assets that I think require us.
00:09:37.516 - 00:09:45.862, Speaker C: To think about what the right regulatory framework is. Not trying to jam digital assets into.
00:09:45.996 - 00:09:51.114, Speaker A: An existing regulatory framework. And that's something that I've been talking.
00:09:51.152 - 00:09:56.650, Speaker C: About for some time, but many others have been talking about this for a long time as well.
00:09:56.800 - 00:10:00.234, Speaker A: It's not an objection to addressing the.
00:10:00.272 - 00:10:06.414, Speaker C: Investor protection or customer protection concerns that are out there. It's not an objection to getting information out there.
00:10:06.452 - 00:10:08.414, Speaker A: It's just trying to think, how does.
00:10:08.452 - 00:10:21.666, Speaker C: It make sense to get information out there? There are different approaches that are floating around. We have a legislative draft that's out there now that people are looking at. There are ways to deal with this. But I think just assuming that you.
00:10:21.688 - 00:10:32.280, Speaker A: Can take these digital assets, which as you point out, are quite different from your traditional share of a company, that.
00:10:32.650 - 00:10:37.160, Speaker C: The company is obviously going to be the one to provide the disclosure for something.
00:10:37.470 - 00:10:43.526, Speaker A: And so that's why I think we've wasted a lot of time not sitting.
00:10:43.558 - 00:10:47.402, Speaker C: Down and figuring out reasonable solutions that.
00:10:47.456 - 00:10:51.580, Speaker A: Address concerns, but also are practical and.
00:10:51.950 - 00:10:59.978, Speaker C: Answer questions about what does this actually mean for these tokens in the primary market and the secondary market? How are they going to trade, who's.
00:10:59.994 - 00:11:01.120, Speaker A: Going to trade them?
00:11:01.730 - 00:11:04.800, Speaker C: Do you need intermediation all of these kinds of questions?
00:11:05.490 - 00:11:20.806, Speaker B: And so between the last two answers, it sort of feels like what you are saying is that even with these spbbp licenses that it's pretty limited in what you can list and for instance, something like an Ether or a Comp or similar tokens probably wouldn't be.
00:11:20.908 - 00:11:24.200, Speaker C: Laura I'm not going to speak to that.
00:11:24.970 - 00:11:28.070, Speaker A: I think we have to see how this develops.
00:11:28.730 - 00:11:37.802, Speaker C: The approval just came through. I haven't had a chance to talk to the particular company post approval, so I don't know what their plans are.
00:11:37.936 - 00:11:45.054, Speaker A: I think the issue though is that we have to stop thinking about just.
00:11:45.172 - 00:11:53.842, Speaker C: Putting our existing regulatory know, insisting that our existing regulatory framework doesn't need any adjustments at all.
00:11:53.896 - 00:11:57.234, Speaker A: When Congress told us, we're giving you.
00:11:57.272 - 00:12:01.038, Speaker C: Exemptive authority, we're giving you the ability to make adjustments.
00:12:01.214 - 00:12:03.634, Speaker A: And so we need to do that.
00:12:03.752 - 00:12:07.782, Speaker C: And people need to understand what is it we're allowed to do and what.
00:12:07.836 - 00:12:10.246, Speaker A: Structure do we have to adopt in.
00:12:10.268 - 00:12:11.222, Speaker C: Order to do that.
00:12:11.276 - 00:12:20.426, Speaker A: And you see it over and over again that we're just making these statements that no, you have to fit into the existing model.
00:12:20.528 - 00:12:22.554, Speaker C: We saw that with the definition of.
00:12:22.592 - 00:12:29.926, Speaker A: Exchange release that came out recently. We're not acknowledging the fact that the.
00:12:29.968 - 00:12:35.566, Speaker C: Technology offers some new qualities, some of which make it harder to regulate, some.
00:12:35.588 - 00:12:46.226, Speaker A: Of which make it unnecessary to regulate. So let's think about each of these on its own and stop just trying.
00:12:46.248 - 00:13:01.798, Speaker C: To do everything through enforcement or through we need to have conversations that involve all of the potential competitors. And we want to make sure that we're not designing a regime that works only for one company. We want it to work for many.
00:13:01.884 - 00:13:04.146, Speaker A: So that we can have lots of competition.
00:13:04.258 - 00:13:37.406, Speaker B: So in a moment, we're going to talk more about the Communication Protocol definition. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

So, as you mentioned, there's also this proposed rulemaking on the definition of an exchange, and some lawyers are viewing the current version as an effective ban on public blockchains in the US.
00:14:34.146 - 00:15:05.962, Speaker B: Because, for instance, it would require all validators to form a group and come in and register as either national securities exchanges or ATSs, which stands for Alternative Trading Systems. As an example, there's 773,000 validators on Ethereum alone. And so forcing them to become an organization forces them to become centralized. So what's your response to this notion that this change in rulemaking could effectively ban public blockchains in the US. Or force blockchains themselves to become more centralized?
00:15:06.106 - 00:15:10.686, Speaker A: One thing is that release in which.
00:15:10.788 - 00:15:12.362, Speaker C: We asked for more comment.
00:15:12.426 - 00:15:14.246, Speaker A: So we had put out an initial.
00:15:14.298 - 00:15:21.554, Speaker C: Rule proposal, and this was an additional request for comment with a lot more detail about how it might apply in this space.
00:15:21.672 - 00:15:29.960, Speaker A: Whereas the first release didn't talk about DeFi or crypto at all, this one was all about it.
00:15:30.330 - 00:15:34.022, Speaker C: And I think if you read it, there are statements made about the current.
00:15:34.076 - 00:15:36.614, Speaker A: State of the world even before that.
00:15:36.652 - 00:15:39.366, Speaker C: Proposal goes into effect. So I think people need to look.
00:15:39.388 - 00:15:43.994, Speaker A: At that release very closely. But I don't see how people are.
00:15:44.032 - 00:15:52.638, Speaker C: Better off if they come to you with a technology that says, we want to do away with intermediaries so that people can interact directly with one another.
00:15:52.724 - 00:15:55.998, Speaker A: Or more accurately, interact with code.
00:15:56.164 - 00:16:02.334, Speaker C: So your response to that is to say, find an intermediary because we want to be able to regulate it, or.
00:16:02.372 - 00:16:05.326, Speaker A: Your response is shut down, or your.
00:16:05.348 - 00:16:12.782, Speaker C: Response is, Get out of the United States. I don't understand how that benefits the American people. I mean, I'm looking forward to reading the comments.
00:16:12.846 - 00:16:15.106, Speaker A: I think the comment period might have.
00:16:15.128 - 00:16:19.366, Speaker C: Just closed, or maybe it's today, I don't know, but it's closing soon, if.
00:16:19.388 - 00:16:22.006, Speaker A: It hasn't already, and a couple of.
00:16:22.028 - 00:16:23.414, Speaker C: Comments had come in when I last.
00:16:23.452 - 00:16:24.790, Speaker A: Looked at the file.
00:16:26.010 - 00:16:35.546, Speaker C: But I'm looking forward to reading what people have to say, and maybe there's something I'm missing about how people think that the technology can work with the.
00:16:35.568 - 00:16:42.842, Speaker A: Regulation, but I don't think it's a good solution to say, find an intermediary or close down.
00:16:42.976 - 00:17:12.114, Speaker B: On Tuesday, the SEC released emails around Bill Hinman's 2018 speech, and he's the former Director of Corporation Finance in which he said, leaving aside the manner in which Ether was sold, that it is presently not a security. And looking over the emails, it looks like at least 19 people weighed in on the phrasing of his speech, including the Office of the General Counsel. Wouldn't that suggest that Hinman's speech saying Ether was not a security not only reflected his personal remarks, but that of the agency?
00:17:12.242 - 00:17:27.082, Speaker C: Here's one important thing to understand about regulatory agencies that a lot of people don't think about until they're actually either working in a regulatory agency or working with a regulatory agency on the outside. As a lawyer who interacts with the.
00:17:27.136 - 00:17:30.934, Speaker A: Regulatory agency, you've got a lot of rules.
00:17:30.982 - 00:17:34.080, Speaker C: The SEC has a lot of rules about a lot of different things.
00:17:34.450 - 00:17:37.706, Speaker A: And when we as a commission, I'm.
00:17:37.738 - 00:17:51.042, Speaker C: One of five, and we make the decisions in terms of updating rules or new rules or bringing enforcement actions. But there are a lot of interpretive questions that come up. There are a lot of questions about.
00:17:51.096 - 00:17:53.986, Speaker A: I'm trying to do X and can.
00:17:54.008 - 00:17:55.706, Speaker C: I do this under the rules?
00:17:55.838 - 00:18:00.054, Speaker A: If you required every time someone would.
00:18:00.092 - 00:18:05.640, Speaker C: Have to go to the commission itself to get an answer, people would never get answers out of the SEC.
00:18:06.010 - 00:18:10.018, Speaker A: So there has been a tradition of.
00:18:10.204 - 00:18:45.346, Speaker C: Staff being able to provide, for example, no action, relief or staff being able to go to a conference and make a statement and talk about how they're thinking about a rule. They're doing it in their capacity on the staff, but they're explaining how they're thinking about things. If we really want to shut all that down. People will never be able to get answers from their regulator. And those are answers that people really need to proceed forward. No one as I started out this conversation, I can't speak on behalf of the commission. I can only tell you what I.
00:18:45.368 - 00:18:46.622, Speaker A: Think as a commissioner.
00:18:46.766 - 00:18:48.598, Speaker C: No one else can do that either.
00:18:48.764 - 00:18:51.766, Speaker A: But I think you really wouldn't want.
00:18:51.788 - 00:18:53.334, Speaker C: To have a situation where the only.
00:18:53.372 - 00:18:55.960, Speaker A: Time the agency spoke was when it.
00:18:56.890 - 00:19:00.462, Speaker C: Proposed or adopted a rule or brought an enforcement action.
00:19:00.626 - 00:19:13.850, Speaker B: Okay, but I mean, it does seem then that it is true that in a way, the speeches are another way for the agency to make its views known. And then we could extrapolate that to what happened with Bill Henman's speech.
00:19:14.010 - 00:19:16.334, Speaker A: Let me tell you, though, that if.
00:19:16.372 - 00:19:24.640, Speaker C: I go on the website and look at a speech that Chair Gensler gave, that's not speaking for me. He might have one view, I might have another.
00:19:27.730 - 00:19:41.094, Speaker A: You know, I had often take issue with rulemakings and enforcement actions. I sometimes issue dissents on enforcement actions. So the fact that someone on the staff has said something doesn't mean that.
00:19:41.212 - 00:19:45.622, Speaker C: I or the rest of the commission agree with that. And so I think that it is.
00:19:45.676 - 00:19:50.330, Speaker A: Really important for people to understand that. And every agency is different.
00:19:50.400 - 00:19:53.706, Speaker C: We're unusual in that we're a five member commission, so there are five of.
00:19:53.728 - 00:19:55.830, Speaker A: Us who are decision makers.
00:19:55.910 - 00:19:58.954, Speaker C: But even in an agency and look.
00:19:58.992 - 00:20:07.422, Speaker A: I'm not an administrative lawyer, so you probably should talk to one of them to get more detail on these kinds of things.
00:20:07.476 - 00:20:13.754, Speaker C: But even in a single director agency, you have staff and you have people who need to call up the staff.
00:20:13.802 - 00:20:17.250, Speaker A: To say, hey, how are you thinking about this staff?
00:20:18.150 - 00:20:20.290, Speaker C: And the staff can provide their answer.
00:20:20.360 - 00:20:25.266, Speaker A: Now, if you look at no action letters, what they say is the staff.
00:20:25.298 - 00:20:30.466, Speaker C: Will not recommend that the Commission take an enforcement action.
00:20:30.578 - 00:20:47.786, Speaker A: If you follow these conditions, doesn't say the Commission won't. It's a pretty good guide for you, because the Commission looks to the staff because they're experts for guidance, but it.
00:20:47.808 - 00:20:49.258, Speaker C: Doesn'T mean that the Commission has to.
00:20:49.264 - 00:20:50.682, Speaker A: Do what the staff says.
00:20:50.816 - 00:21:12.542, Speaker B: Would you say that the SEC has changed its stance from Chair Jay Clayton to Chair Gensler regarding crypto? And if so, is that inconsistency in its approach a typical characteristic of regulation in the know in any agency? Or is the SEC's lack of consistency atypical for a government agency and maybe even problematic?
00:21:12.686 - 00:21:19.526, Speaker C: The goal of having a five member commission, which is politically balanced, is that you have more consistency over time, so.
00:21:19.548 - 00:21:23.634, Speaker A: That you don't have rules that change that swing dramatically.
00:21:23.682 - 00:21:27.958, Speaker C: Right? You have rules that are more consistent over time. But that doesn't mean that when a.
00:21:27.964 - 00:21:30.374, Speaker A: New chairman comes in, the new chairman.
00:21:30.422 - 00:21:32.698, Speaker C: Doesn'T bring his own thoughts about things.
00:21:32.784 - 00:21:37.962, Speaker A: And we've seen with this commission that and this is outside the crypto space.
00:21:38.016 - 00:21:40.006, Speaker C: But there were rules that we had.
00:21:40.048 - 00:21:43.166, Speaker A: Adopted under the prior chairman that have.
00:21:43.188 - 00:21:44.942, Speaker C: Gotten reversed under this one.
00:21:44.996 - 00:21:50.560, Speaker A: So there certainly can be change over time. But you also have to look at.
00:21:50.930 - 00:21:59.406, Speaker C: Change in the environment in which we're regulating. And everyone knows that 2022, for example, was not a great year for crypto.
00:21:59.518 - 00:22:01.378, Speaker A: A lot of things happened and I.
00:22:01.384 - 00:22:03.666, Speaker C: Think it affects the way all of.
00:22:03.688 - 00:22:05.646, Speaker A: Us think about crypto.
00:22:05.758 - 00:22:17.414, Speaker C: So I can't speak for Chair Gensler, whether his views align with Chair Clayton. All I can say is that I've been at the agency for over five years and it's very frustrating to me.
00:22:17.452 - 00:22:21.370, Speaker A: That in that time we haven't done something more productive.
00:22:21.950 - 00:22:32.966, Speaker B: Has the year of 2022 when crypto changed the way that you view crypto, given your history as crypto mom and being viewed as more of a proponent of the industry than other SEC commissioners?
00:22:33.078 - 00:22:40.190, Speaker C: I mean, I wouldn't describe myself as a proponent of the industry. I'm a proponent of people's ability to make decisions for themselves, to try things.
00:22:40.260 - 00:22:41.834, Speaker A: Even if those things fail.
00:22:41.962 - 00:22:43.566, Speaker C: But I don't think that people in.
00:22:43.588 - 00:22:50.466, Speaker A: Crypto should delude themselves about when you have centralized entities, don't think that just.
00:22:50.488 - 00:23:01.670, Speaker C: Because they have crypto on the front door, you're not going to experience the same kind of problems you would experience with other kinds of centralized entities. And I think people in the industry could be doing a lot better job.
00:23:01.740 - 00:23:04.934, Speaker A: Of looking at 2022 and there are.
00:23:04.972 - 00:23:06.306, Speaker C: People doing this in the industry.
00:23:06.338 - 00:23:08.442, Speaker A: But I think people should really be.
00:23:08.496 - 00:23:13.878, Speaker C: Looking at this and saying, what can we do? Even without a regulatory framework, we don't.
00:23:13.894 - 00:23:20.474, Speaker A: Need regulators to tell us to be more careful. We don't need regulators to tell us.
00:23:20.512 - 00:23:22.066, Speaker C: To put in some of these protections.
00:23:22.118 - 00:23:24.046, Speaker A: And I think it's good when the.
00:23:24.068 - 00:23:34.090, Speaker C: Industry kind of steps up and says, all right, we're going to recognize that centralized entities have these problems and we're going to take steps to protect that.
00:23:34.180 - 00:23:36.674, Speaker A: And we're really going to think about.
00:23:36.792 - 00:23:44.082, Speaker C: Where does decentralization make sense if we decide that? I'm not saying the industry makes the decision as a whole. Right.
00:23:44.136 - 00:23:46.342, Speaker A: But if people decide that they want.
00:23:46.396 - 00:23:52.354, Speaker C: Something to be centralized, that they think it makes sense for centralization to remain.
00:23:52.482 - 00:23:58.242, Speaker A: Well put in protections around it. So has it changed the way I think about crypto?
00:23:58.306 - 00:24:01.386, Speaker C: No. I mean, I think it's been a reminder to me as well as to.
00:24:01.408 - 00:24:06.442, Speaker A: Everyone else, that the same kinds of problems show up in lots of different.
00:24:06.496 - 00:24:09.762, Speaker C: Ways in lots of different areas.
00:24:09.926 - 00:24:19.694, Speaker A: But it has, I think, convinced me even more that as regulators, when we fall down on the job of not.
00:24:19.732 - 00:24:26.606, Speaker C: Putting in a regulatory framework that makes sense, it is so much harder to distinguish the good actors from the bad actors.
00:24:26.798 - 00:24:45.042, Speaker A: And we actually undermine protection of American people by making it so hard for people to figure out, how can I set up a business, do it legitimately, and not spend all my time thinking about regulation.
00:24:45.106 - 00:24:53.010, Speaker C: I want people to think about what it is they're trying to build, and I want the regulatory framework to be clear enough so that they know, okay, here's what I have to do to.
00:24:53.020 - 00:24:57.178, Speaker A: Be in compliance, and I'm going to do that. And then I'm going to spend the.
00:24:57.184 - 00:24:59.962, Speaker C: Rest of my time actually thinking about what it is I'm trying to build.
00:25:00.016 - 00:25:02.954, Speaker A: I think we've probably changed the way.
00:25:02.992 - 00:25:04.846, Speaker C: The whole industry has developed in the.
00:25:04.868 - 00:25:08.878, Speaker A: United States, because everyone is thinking all.
00:25:08.884 - 00:25:13.854, Speaker C: The time of, well, I don't want it to be considered a security, so I'm going to design it this way instead.
00:25:14.052 - 00:25:17.314, Speaker A: And I don't think that's helpful to know.
00:25:17.352 - 00:25:39.350, Speaker B: I have to say that your remarks remind me a lot of a recent interview I saw of Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, being interviewed by The Wall Street Journal, and it almost feels like the sentiments that he was saying are being echoed by you. And I don't have a question there. I know you probably don't want to speak about specific cases, but I can't help be struck by the similarities.
00:25:39.710 - 00:25:46.522, Speaker C: I don't want to address that specifically, except to say that I'm someone who comes to regulation with a view that.
00:25:46.656 - 00:25:49.466, Speaker A: The American people should be free to.
00:25:49.488 - 00:26:01.566, Speaker C: Do their own thing and make their own decisions. There are times when regulators have to step in. We have a regulatory framework, which I have an obligation to uphold because Congress gave it to us and told us to do it.
00:26:01.668 - 00:26:05.198, Speaker A: But we also should not be in.
00:26:05.204 - 00:26:12.450, Speaker C: A world where the government is making merit based decisions about what people can and cannot do.
00:26:12.600 - 00:26:15.474, Speaker A: And that's where I feel that we're.
00:26:15.522 - 00:26:18.994, Speaker C: In a world where we're using regulatory.
00:26:19.122 - 00:26:23.494, Speaker A: Ambiguity to prevent people from doing things.
00:26:23.532 - 00:26:29.126, Speaker C: That they want to do. And I don't see why I should step in ahead of that.
00:26:29.228 - 00:26:32.090, Speaker A: As a regulator, I need a reason to step in.
00:26:32.240 - 00:26:33.898, Speaker C: We're just not approaching this in a.
00:26:33.904 - 00:26:36.474, Speaker A: Way that I think is the best.
00:26:36.592 - 00:26:39.702, Speaker C: And I'm hoping that we will wake up tomorrow.
00:26:39.846 - 00:26:41.846, Speaker A: Keep saying this, but I keep hoping.
00:26:41.878 - 00:26:44.014, Speaker C: It that we'll wake up tomorrow and.
00:26:44.052 - 00:26:46.734, Speaker A: We'Ll say, all right, let's think about.
00:26:46.772 - 00:26:48.366, Speaker C: How we can really do this in.
00:26:48.388 - 00:26:51.582, Speaker A: A way that's efficient and effective, gets.
00:26:51.636 - 00:26:53.182, Speaker C: To the problems that we've all seen.
00:26:53.236 - 00:26:55.854, Speaker A: Crop up, but also allows people to.
00:26:55.892 - 00:27:02.338, Speaker C: Try things and to fail. It's not up to me to decide whether crypto is going to change the world or not.
00:27:02.424 - 00:27:04.194, Speaker A: It's up to me just to set.
00:27:04.232 - 00:27:06.674, Speaker C: Up a framework within which people who.
00:27:06.712 - 00:27:09.166, Speaker A: Think it will change the world can.
00:27:09.208 - 00:27:10.726, Speaker C: Go try their thing and do it.
00:27:10.748 - 00:27:12.966, Speaker A: In the United States, not have to.
00:27:12.988 - 00:27:17.030, Speaker C: Run to some other country to do it, because, frankly, people in the US.
00:27:17.100 - 00:27:22.086, Speaker A: Will be better protected if the innovation is happening in the US.
00:27:22.268 - 00:27:36.720, Speaker B: Last quick question. There is a bill that's been introduced in Congress to ask Gary Gensler from his position as chair, however, and whenever he leaves, how committed is the staff to applying or enforcing the stance that everything in crypto besides Bitcoin, is a security?
00:27:37.250 - 00:27:58.530, Speaker C: We at the SEC have a very hardworking, dedicated staff. I know that a lot of people in crypto are very frustrated with the SEC, but we have a great staff. Staff is duty bound to respond to the decisions made by me and my fellow commissioners.
00:27:58.690 - 00:28:05.494, Speaker A: And so to the extent that people have complaints about the SEC, and many.
00:28:05.532 - 00:28:10.410, Speaker C: Of them do, direct them at me, but that is the appropriate place to direct them. It's at the commission itself.
00:28:10.560 - 00:28:16.010, Speaker A: So the way the commission goes will depend on who's running the commission.
00:28:16.590 - 00:28:19.158, Speaker B: All right, well, thank you so much for coming on Unchained.

Revelation of Hinman documents sparks Ripple's call for probe as mentioned during the show, former SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman's emails about the status of Ether as a security or non security were revealed this week. Ripple has now initiated calls for a renewed probe into hindman following the exposure of these documents tied to the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. Ripple's chief Legal officer, Stuart Aldorati stated, quote, an investigation must be conducted to understand what or who influenced Hinman. The document suggests that Hinman planned a conversation with Ethereum co founder Vitalik Buterin to better comprehend the workings of the Ethereum Foundation, a point that further fuels Ripple's push for a new investigation.
00:29:42.578 - 00:30:30.914, Speaker B: This discussion aimed to underpin Henman's opinion that ETH wasn't a security. Gabriel Shapiro, General counsel at Delphi Labs, tweeted, quote, we need Congress to step up and create a clear, reasonable, easily navigated set of fit for purpose rules for crypto. Background of Prometheum founder Prompts Questions prometheum, a previously under the radar firm, made headlines in the crypto universe after co founder Aaron Kaplan's testimony before A-U-S. House committee. Kaplan, mirroring the SEC's perspective, advocated for current securities laws to govern the crypto world. At the committee meeting, Kaplan stood up for the SEC's governing structure, suggesting that existing regulations provide, quote, a compliant path forward for crypto in the US. He sharply criticizes platforms that don't comply with these laws, labeling them as, quote, reckless and unlawful.
00:30:30.914 - 00:31:06.690, Speaker B: In an interview with Unchained, he stated, quote, crypto exchanges argue that there's a lack of. Regulatory clarity because they're literally best served by the lack of regulatory clarity. Some people in the crypto community are claiming Prometheum's past isn't squeaky clean. For instance, it's been revealed that the firm has paid over $1.5 million in sales commissions to a company with numerous regulatory infractions. In fact, it was involved in the Long Island Iced Tea Company that pivoted to Long Blockchain and was the subject of an SEC enforcement action. Also, the credentials of two Prometheum officers have come under scrutiny as their law school lost its accreditation.
00:31:06.690 - 00:32:16.454, Speaker B: Adam Cochrane, partner at Cinemhane Ventures, has speculated about Prometheum strategies, highlighting that the company's website features tokens that were named as securities in the SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, potentially suggesting that Prometheum had some foreknowledge of which tokens would be labeled as securities. Cochrane suggests that Prometheum may be getting a regulatory break, manipulating its regulatory connections or even running a dubious scheme. In response to the revelations, the blockchain association submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the SEC seeking details about the crypto broker. SEC Versus Coinbase A 120 Day countdown Begins in the latest update on the legal battle between the SEC and Coinbase. The agency has requested more time to respond to Coinbase's petition for clarity on digital asset industry rules. Despite Coinbase's push for a court mandated response, the SEC said that the breadth of the rulemaking petition, filed just months ago and recently supplemented by Coinbase, needs a thorough review. The SEC anticipates that staff will be able to give a recommendation to the agency on the petition within the next 120 days, with a status report to follow.
00:32:16.454 - 00:33:19.802, Speaker B: Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Graywall tweeted, quote, they ignore the clear statements of the Chair that confirm that they have no intent to issue new rules. FTX's customer confidentiality upheld amid legal turmoil, u s. Bankruptcy judge John Dorsey has allowed collapsed crypto Exchange FTX to permanently redact customer names from bankruptcy related court documents. This decision concludes a lengthy dispute between FTX's bankruptcy, estate and external parties, including media outlets and government lawyers who sought access to the customer list. Judge Dorsey emphasized customer protection, stating, quote, we want to make sure that they are protected and they don't fall victim to any types of scams. The ruling supports FTX's argument that revealing customer names could harm the exchange's sale value. Moreover the US Department of Justice's case against Sam Bankman Fried, former CEO of FTX, faced a key decision when the Bahamas Supreme Court ruled that Bankman Fried could contest additional charges being added beyond the original eight brought in December 2022.
00:33:19.802 - 00:34:14.794, Speaker B: The additional charges center on wire fraud, securities fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Elections Commission. The court's decision came after Bankman Fried's defense team contested the inclusion of five additional charges, including bank fraud and bribery, arguing their inclusion violated the terms of extradition from the Bahamas. Thursday afternoon, Judge Lewis Kaplan agreed to allow prosecutors to charge him on those additional charges in a separate trial set for the spring of 2024. BlackRock files for bitcoin ETF. BlackRock's ishares unit has submitted paperwork to the SEC to create a bitcoin spot ETF. The proposed fund, named the Ishares Bitcoin Trust, will primarily consist of Bitcoin held by Coinbase on behalf of the trust. Despite the SEC's history of rejecting similar ventures, many people are saying that BlackRock's prominent position in asset management and political influence could potentially sway the outcome.
00:34:14.794 - 00:35:09.850, Speaker B: Uniswap announces new draft code with customizable liquidity pools Uniswap, the largest decentralized crypto exchange by volume, released the draft code for its fourth version, introducing the concept of customizable liquidity pools. The new V Four will feature hooks, which are smart contracts that allow developers to create custom liquidity pools and introduce innovative features. These hooks will enable the creation of on chain limit orders, automatic deposits to lending protocols, auto compound liquidity provider fees and more. However, in the latest episode of the Chopping Block, haseeb Qureshi, Robert Lesner, Tom Schmidt and Tarun Chitra raised concerns that the implementation would bring problems around security and user experience.
