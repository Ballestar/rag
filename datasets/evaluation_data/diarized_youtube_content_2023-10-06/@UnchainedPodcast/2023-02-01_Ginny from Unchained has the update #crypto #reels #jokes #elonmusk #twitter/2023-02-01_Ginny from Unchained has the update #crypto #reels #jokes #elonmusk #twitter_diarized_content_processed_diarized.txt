00:00:00.250 - 00:00:24.622, Speaker A: Amazing news. Twitter is making moves to allow for payments, including crypto payments. I know what you're thinking. There are people who would give their financial information to Twitter.com. Well, not yet, but Elon Musk has said that he wants people to use Twitter to send payments to each other, as opposed to how it's used now, which is just to send death threats to each other. Musk says that he wants Twitter to earn $1.3 billion in payment revenues by 2028.
00:00:24.622 - 00:00:49.522, Speaker A: So if he uses it for all of his child support payments, then they only need another $25 worth of transactions. I'm sure a loyal dogecoin user will help them out. Speaking of dogecoin, shot up 200% following this news. Turns out it's a good day to be a dude who spent an embarrassing amount of money trying to be funny. Kind of like that time that Elon Musk bought Twitter. Okay, one teensy weency little problem. No one really works at Twitter anymore.
00:00:49.522 - 00:00:56.570, Speaker A: Elon has a solution for this, too. He's going to seek outside funding from venture capitalists. You want my opinion? I think you should start with the people who invested in theranos.
