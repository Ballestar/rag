00:00:00.250 - 00:00:08.974, Speaker A: Do you think that type of algorithmic stablecoin could ever work? Or do you think that pretty much they're always going to end up with this downward spiral effect that.
00:00:09.012 - 00:00:48.370, Speaker B: Depends on could work? I mean, it was kind of a cool thing, right? It was like a cool concept, but it's super risky and I think it's always going to be super risky, right? You're not going to escape that part of it. And so I think I just wouldn't even think of it as a stable coin. I don't know whether the kind of thing that if you wanted it to exist, it would have to exist in such a way that was not really being branded as a stable coin, that was being branded as an algorithmic weird kind of thing in Jigger that was not all that stable. And it should be thought of as an investment, not as a store of wealth that is kind of safe.
