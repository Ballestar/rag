00:00:00.330 - 00:00:23.050, Speaker A: You. Hi everyone. Welcome to Unconfirmed, the podcast that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon. I'm your host, Laura Shin. In response to the challenging times, crypto.com is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases.
00:00:23.050 - 00:00:35.378, Speaker A: Download the Crypto.com app day. Today's guest is Stephen Palley, partner at Anderson Kill and chair of the firm's Technology Media and Distributed Systems Practice Group. Welcome, Stephen.
00:00:35.554 - 00:00:37.074, Speaker B: Hi, how are you doing, Laura?
00:00:37.202 - 00:01:06.686, Speaker A: Great, glad to have you. There's been a lot going on in the area of crypto and law recently. Let's start with the recent spate of class action lawsuits against 42 defendants in 16 countries that all relate to ICOs as well as exchanges from 2017. Some of the defendants include Finance Block One, Bancorp Status, Civic, Tron, BitMEX, et cetera. Can you summarize what those eleven lawsuits.
00:01:06.718 - 00:01:36.860, Speaker B: Are about in 5 seconds or less? Yes. People lost money due to market fluctuations and even though the assets are at issue, are described as decentralized or distributed, as one would expect, when people lose money, they try to find other people who are responsible. That's it in a nutshell, basically.
00:01:37.630 - 00:01:40.010, Speaker A: And who are these plaintiffs?
00:01:40.770 - 00:02:21.050, Speaker B: I don't know who they are personally. They are people who owned crypto and some of them own substantial amounts and they allegedly suffered substantial losses. They're represented by the same at least one of the firms that's involved is a firm that represents the plaintiff in a lawsuit against Craig Wright in Florida federal court. And there are people who these are what are known as, I believe these were filed as putative class actions, which means they hope to represent others who they allege were similarly wronged.
00:02:21.390 - 00:02:36.190, Speaker A: And is it just that they lost money? Because if I buy a stock and lose money on the stock, obviously I can't bring a lawsuit. So what is it about the situation here that gives them grounds to bring a lawsuit?
00:02:36.930 - 00:03:52.120, Speaker B: Well, they claim that there is a culpability market manipulation, that the various defendants had a role in causing or contributing assets to their assets, the value of their assets to diminish, and that's it sort of over generalizing, but that's sort of the nubbin of it. And this has always been something that people who watch lawyers who watch this market expected. I expect you're going to be asking me about the maker Dow lawsuit as well. But what we see generally in all of the crypto lawsuits is traditional legal principles being applied to newish technology and old fashioned causes of actions and claims, whether federal securities law claims or common law tort claims being applied regardless of the names or titles given to the assets in question or frankly, for that matter, regardless of the location of the defendants. Because many of the defendants in the lawsuits that you asked about are actually not in the United States.
00:03:52.890 - 00:04:20.320, Speaker A: Yeah, this was something we'll get to that in a moment. But I also wanted to ask, since a lot of the ICOs named in these lawsuits are from 2017, which is about three years ago, and a lot of them also are from the period before the SEC's Dow Report, which was kind of their first foray into the world of ICO, why do you think these lawsuits are happening now?
00:04:21.330 - 00:05:16.750, Speaker B: Because of recent substantial losses, flash crashes and so forth. The argument there will be like one of the defenses that will be raised absolutely is statute of limitations. Right. And so skimming through some of the lawsuits, you can see that the plaintiffs are using the SEC's digital framework document, which came out, I want to say about a year ago. I don't have the exact date, maybe it was in May of last year. They're using that as a sort of a threshold date, as when it became known, according to the plaintiffs, that many of these things were actually securities. Now, whether or not that argument will win the day remains to be seen, but we can certainly expect many of the defendants to argue that these cases or claims were stale.
00:05:16.750 - 00:06:39.660, Speaker B: And many of them will argue that at the very least, people who invested in Pre report ICOs should have known as of the time those reports were issued. The plaintiffs will also make arguments that the statute of limitations wouldn't apply to exchanges, particularly in cases where the exchanges were not registered as national exchanges or as broker dealers and where they were engaged in a continuing sale of the assets at issue. So that was a long winded answer, which is basically the TLDR is it's complicated? Time is definitely going to be an issue. It's not entirely clear to me who's going to win it's mistake to on the one hand say it's a slam dunk for the plaintiffs. It's not, it's a challenge. On the other hand would be a mistake to underestimate either the merits of the lawsuit, the lawsuits, the resources that these lawyers are bringing to it, or the quality of those lawyers. If you look at the Craig Wright litigation, the Roach Friedman firm with which I'm familiar, they've got skills, so I wouldn't rule out some success.
00:06:40.030 - 00:06:53.780, Speaker A: So yeah, before we talk about that law firm, I actually also wanted to dive into the claims against the exchanges. So I've been asking about the ICOs, but what about the exchanges? What do these lawsuits tend to say?
00:06:54.310 - 00:07:56.210, Speaker B: So I don't actually have the complaints in front of me. I should have done that. But there are allegations that they were acting as unregistered broker dealers, as unregistered exchanges, and as a consequence were acting in violation of federal securities laws, that they were selling unregistered securities and in addition to that, that they were perhaps negligent in the way that they maintain their exchanges. So those are some of the claims. So basically the basic idea is that if you are acting as an exchange, as that term is defined under the securities Exchange Act of 1934, you have to register unless you're subject to an exemption or if you are acting as a broker or a dealer of securities. And the allegation is that these digital assets were securities, you have to register as such, and the failure to do so can expose you to fairly significant liability.
00:07:56.710 - 00:08:11.930, Speaker A: And you mentioned about this law firm that it's the same one that's brought suits against Craig Wright and Bitfinex. And I wondered, is there any significance to that about it being the same law firm, or is it know they're familiar with this territory?
00:08:12.270 - 00:09:04.540, Speaker B: Well, they're good lawyers. They've also, because they have the way it works is in law there's a certain amount of marketing that you do in name building and brand building. So I don't know how they got their clients, but it's certainly possible that people sent them direct messages on Twitter or emailed them. Someone who lost money might have gone to them and said, hey, I saw what you did in the Craig Wright litigation. Can you represent me? In this case? They might have also done some sort of marketing or advertising or outreach, I don't know. But part of it is sort of definitely an interest and some expertise in the space which they've gained through that litigation and another litigation, some of it would be people recognizing their name because of that involvement. It does happen.
00:09:04.540 - 00:09:49.354, Speaker B: Another piece of it is they probably I don't have any personal knowledge of this, but I'm assuming that they have a decent financial cushion. It took a fairly significant amount of time to put those lawsuits together to write them. People have got to eat and pay rent or mortgages while they do so, and a class action can take years to resolve. When was the tezos class action filed? Was that filed initially? In 2017. It settled in 2020, in the spring. These things take time, and that didn't even get to class certification. So in order to successfully prosecute a class action, you have to have money.
00:09:49.354 - 00:09:56.650, Speaker B: It's an investment because the lawyers aren't being paid hourly, presumably, unless they've got litigation funding or finance.
00:09:57.230 - 00:10:26.142, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we'll discuss more of the details about these lawsuits, plus get into the MakerDAO one. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. In response to the challenging times, crypto.com is introducing three measures to help the community. First, the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months. Second, you can now get up to 10% back by using the MCO Visa card on food and grocery shopping.
00:10:26.142 - 00:11:03.818, Speaker A: Lastly, you could buy gift cards on the Crypto.com app from merchants like Whole Foods, Safeway, Burger King, and more, and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries. Download the Crypto.com app today back to my conversation with Stephen Palley. So the lawsuits also specifically name some individuals such as Changpang Zhao, also known as CZ, the CEO of Binance, also Brendan Bloomer, the CEO of Block One BitMEX, co founder and CEO Arthur Hayes, as well as other people. The claims against them are under something called Control Theory Liability.
00:11:03.914 - 00:11:06.690, Speaker B: Control person control person liability, yeah.
00:11:06.760 - 00:11:12.690, Speaker A: Can you explain more what that means and then whether or not you actually think that applies in these lawsuits?
00:11:13.350 - 00:12:26.074, Speaker B: Yes. So the basic idea that's Section 20, section 20 a claim under the securities act, the basic idea is that if you have management control or authority over the sale of security or securities related transaction, you can have derivative or secondary liability for that. What does that mean? It's a way, typically speaking, corporate executives, directors, officers and employees are typically protected from liability for claims against the corporation by the corporate shield. That's why you form a corporation. Right. Or an LLC. One of the reasons is for limited liability under American securities law, someone who has a control person role can be deemed personally responsible or personally liable for securities law violations undertaken by the company.
00:12:26.074 - 00:12:39.038, Speaker B: So it's something that I'm involved in litigating now, outside of the securities context. Yeah, it's real and yeah.
00:12:39.204 - 00:12:42.110, Speaker A: Do you think that will apply in these lawsuits?
00:12:43.170 - 00:13:14.470, Speaker B: I am sure that they will argue that they don't have control personal liability. But a CEO of a corporation founder, somebody involved in selling an unregistered security, if that's what it is, this is what a Control Person Liability theory is made for. So yes, no, I don't think these are trivial arguments. Yes, it's a real thing and it's sort of the bread and butter of securities litigation. You see these in all kinds of securities related lawsuits.
00:13:14.550 - 00:13:27.226, Speaker A: So you're saying like, essentially there is a possibility that somebody would find that it does apply in this case, but it's a slam dunk.
00:13:27.418 - 00:14:23.322, Speaker B: Well, so if the plaintiffs get past, here's, what's going to happen? There will be motions to dismiss, there will be motions to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds. They may raise time as an issue. So statute of limitations may be an issue and they're also going to have to serve people overseas via the Hague Convention. All of that procedural stuff is going to take some time. But if they manage to get past that, yes, if they can state a claim against the entities, the claims against the CEOs and founders under Section 20 Controlled Person Theory, those will remain and they will have secondary or derivative liability. Potentially, yeah. The question in the first instance, in order for there to be control person liability, there has to be underlying fault.
00:14:23.322 - 00:14:52.620, Speaker B: So you have to find fault in something that the business did in the first instance. I think that's a correct statement of the law. If not, I'm sure somebody listening will post an angry tweet. But without that, without the underlying liability. You don't have the secondary liability or the control person liability, and frankly, the entities are fairly deep pocketed. So I don't think that there's going to be a collection issue or problem.
00:14:53.310 - 00:15:01.286, Speaker A: Okay, but one other potential hurdle is the fact that the eleven class action lawsuits span 16 jurisdictions.
00:15:01.398 - 00:15:01.882, Speaker B: I know.
00:15:01.936 - 00:15:12.814, Speaker A: So how does that work? Do you need to work out jurisdiction with each different jurisdiction? Is it like case by case, or is it a blanket thing? Or how do they assert that it's.
00:15:12.862 - 00:16:01.642, Speaker B: Possible that I wonder if these lawsuits will be I guess there's a possibility they'll be consolidated. But the answer is every defendant is entitled to raise jurisdictional objections and is entitled to, if they're overseas, require service via where it's applicable to Hague Conventions. So for example, if you sue someone and let's say you sue a defendant in France, what you'd have to do is you need to get the lawsuit translated into French and then you typically would have to get it. I haven't done this with France recently. I've done it working on something with the UK right now. You have to serve it through something called a central authority, which might be a court. It takes a while, it can take several months, six months in some countries.
00:16:01.642 - 00:16:31.610, Speaker B: Now, because of COVID central authorities aren't actually working. So that's another factor that's going to slow things down. Some courts aren't you can file lawsuits, but courts aren't issuing a summons, which is something you need in order to serve a lawsuit. So I kind of diverged a little bit. But the basic answer is every single defendant is going to be allowed to raise their own jurisdictional argument.
00:16:32.510 - 00:16:48.750, Speaker A: Okay. And it sounds like that will also be how it goes for the actual securities claims. That again, it will be the facts and circumstances of each one. Is that what you think? Or do you think that we'll see kind of like the same judgment across all eleven?
00:16:49.330 - 00:17:35.546, Speaker B: No, I mean, what could happen is all of these cases could end up being assigned to the same judge or the same set of judges. That might make sense because there will be common legal issues. But look, they're different parties. The jurisdictional questions will be addressed with each. If people remember, I know you followed this if you remember the Tezos litigation, there were motions to dismiss that were filed by a variety of defendants and some of the European defendants actually got out. So what was it, bitcoin suisse? I believe they were dismissed, the other defendants. So the foundation, the individual defendants, they remained in their jurisdictional.
00:17:35.546 - 00:17:47.250, Speaker B: Motions were not allowed. So it's going to be a defendant by defendant inquiry. Each of them will have to be served and each of them will be able to say, no, there's no jurisdiction over me in New York.
00:17:47.320 - 00:17:55.460, Speaker A: Right, right. And sorry, my question wasn't about the jurisdiction, but just about the actual outcome of the case about whether or not securities laws were.
00:17:57.190 - 00:18:49.702, Speaker B: So, you know, each of the ICOs was different. If you're asking whether a decision in one case will be influential in another, my view is yes, it will be. If one judge is making these determinations, then how they decide what civic is and how they decide what block one is or what that offering was will certainly be influential. The judge will also look at their recent Telegram ruling, which I know is up on appeal, but yes, I think it will at least be persuasive. So in law, there are two concepts for authority. You've got persuasive authority and you've got binding authority. So it might be persuasive authority for what one judge says about one ICO with respect to a ruling in another.
00:18:49.702 - 00:19:03.334, Speaker B: But the actual finding will not be binding on another case. It wouldn't be what lawyers call res judicata or collateral estoppel or so forth.
00:19:03.462 - 00:19:22.910, Speaker A: Okay, so we're running out of time, but let's quickly move on to the other big class action lawsuit, news in Crypto, which is the $28 million case against the Maker Foundation for losses suffered on Black Thursday. Can you summarize what that's about and what the likelihood is that you think it has of succeeding?
00:19:23.670 - 00:20:48.330, Speaker B: So the allegation is that the Maker Foundation developed and actively promotes the use of a digital currency called Dai, which it claims is more secure and stable than others because Dai are over collateralized by other digital currency. And if the value of the collateral drops, maker foundation assures investors, then that triggers a liquidation event where collateral is auctioned off to pay outstanding Dai plus liquidation penalty. Otherwise the holder gets the balance of their collateral back. And they say that on March twelveTH, 2020, which is known as Black Thursday, the value of ethereum dropped dramatically, triggering mass liquidation events for CDP holders. But instead of triggering actual auctions that would have resulted in minimal or at least mitigated losses for investors, the Maker Foundation protocol triggered what they call pseudo actions, and two bots continually operated, buying up liquidated CDPs for zero dollar bids. So in other words, despite being promised that auction and over collateralization would mitigate damages against dramatic drops in collateral, they instead lost 100% of their collateral, losing a total of 8.325 million during the liquidation, which is, they say, now worth over $11 million.
00:20:48.330 - 00:21:11.940, Speaker B: That's a summary that I'm taking from the complaint, but that's basically the nuts and bolts of it. What's interesting is it sounds very much like sort of a traditional margin liquidation. This sounds like sort of traditional finance, I guess is what I'm saying, even though it's called decentralized and these things are called CDPs, right?
00:21:12.470 - 00:21:16.470, Speaker A: So what do you think the likelihood is that this lawsuit will succeed?
00:21:17.290 - 00:22:18.234, Speaker B: I don't actually have a good read on it, so I don't know. I'm not going to make a prediction about this one. I guess what I'd say is I personally, without getting into the merits of whether Die is going to be successful in the end or whether or not Maker Foundation did a good thing, I was always skeptical that these things were actually decentralized in such a way that the people involved in them couldn't end up having personal liability. So I think it's really interesting to see this decentralized ecosystem thing end up being directly responsible, according to the complaint, for people losing, according to the complaint, more than $10 million. And instead of it being hard to figure out who to blame for it, they're corporate entities that are named. Right. That, to me, is the really interesting thing about this.
00:22:18.234 - 00:22:36.000, Speaker B: And whatever one thinks of bitcoin or doesn't think of bitcoin, it also perhaps shows the wisdom of satoshi in remaining anonymous. The only security against getting sued for problems with digital assets is really for nobody knowing who the heck you are.
00:22:37.890 - 00:23:10.570, Speaker A: One other thing I wanted to ask about the maker lawsuit is something that just was so incredibly fascinating to me, which is that the maker community had a vote on whether or not to compensate victims, and most people were in favor. But there was another part that really caught my attention, which is that they agreed that, quote, to withdraw, vault holders will need to browse to a web page where they agree to indemnify maker and affiliates against any potential legal claims for their loss. Do you think that's enforceable?
00:23:12.350 - 00:23:34.660, Speaker B: Enforceable? I mean, it's crazy that all of this decentralization theater and you're getting a traditional somebody's demanding an indemnity. I don't know. I'd have to read it to tell you whether or not it's enforceable. The reason why you ask for things like this is because you're worried that somebody's going to come after you, right?
00:23:35.750 - 00:23:37.842, Speaker A: Well, somebody already did come after them.
00:23:37.896 - 00:23:53.318, Speaker B: Yeah, right. The indemnity is would it be contrary to public policy? I don't know. I haven't actually read it, so I'd be speculating. It's fascinating to me that someone asked for that, though.
00:23:53.484 - 00:24:16.560, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll have to see how that plays out. Well, I was going to ask you about the little crypto twitter storm around your tweet this week, but we're sort of out of time. So I think I'll just have to recommend that people read the essay that you wrote or the responses to your tweet, which most of them seem to all be saying the same thing, which was some variation of you're wrong.
00:24:18.050 - 00:24:42.470, Speaker B: Well, I mean, you know, you play on twitter, you have to expect people know, say, face, palm, boomer, lol. But that's really I will say this I know we're running out of time. It's sparked a really interesting conversation, and I've gotten some wonderful feedback, and it's helped refine my views, so I welcome all of it. Even the people who say I'm an idiot.
00:24:43.770 - 00:24:48.566, Speaker A: Yes, I agree. It was actually a really interesting thing to follow, and I like to hear.
00:24:48.668 - 00:24:52.170, Speaker B: I had to mute it, actually, so I'm not paying attention to the responses anymore.
00:24:54.750 - 00:24:59.690, Speaker A: That's so funny. I totally get it. Sometimes you're just like, I'm over this conversation.
00:25:00.110 - 00:25:07.790, Speaker B: I'm not, but I have, like, 12 hours of work to do. Like, I didn't do any work responding one day, and the next day I had to work until, like, midnight.
00:25:08.370 - 00:25:20.526, Speaker A: Yeah, that's actually why I don't spend a lot of time on Twitter, because I have other stuff I have to do. Anyway, all right, well, it's been so great having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
00:25:20.638 - 00:25:22.820, Speaker B: Thank you so much. That was a ton of fun.
00:25:23.750 - 00:26:34.700, Speaker A: Okay, now it's time for everyone's favorite news recap. First Headline in depth china's soon to launch national blockchain platform lots of blockchain news out of China this week. China's Blockchain Service Network, or BNS, launched domestically on Wednesday and is set to launch globally on April 25. It is designed to make it easy for companies and software developers to plug and play to build blockchain applications. CoinDesk quotes James Cooper, a law professor at California Western School of Law, who says, quote, the move is very much like the One Belt one road initiative in which China provides other countries with infrastructure and gains some first mover advantage. CoinDesk also says the BSN is not a blockchain protocol, but, quote, a centralized platform that has done the hefty lifting for developers so they can plug in and code, choosing from several enterprise blockchain protocols or public chains. The goal is to reduce their operational costs, improve flexibility and provide better regulatory oversight, according to the White Paper.
00:26:34.700 - 00:28:08.890, Speaker A: So far, the permissioned blockchain protocols included are Hyperledger, Baidu's, Zooperchain and Fisco, which is from a consortium of China's Shenzhen government agencies and local tech companies such as Tencent, WeBank and Huawei. The White Paper says that the BSN will also include public blockchains, ethereum and EOS. Next Headline DCEP wallet application revealed Screenshots from a test of a DCEP wallet application from the Agricultural Bank of China made the rounds on Twitter this week. In a tweetstorm last week's, Unconfirmed guest Matthew Graham said that it shows the four test cities, which are Shenzhen, Shanghan, Chengdu and Xuzhao, which he calls Tier One or Tier Two cities that are home to tech talent. One especially notable feature is touch offline payment, which enables users to transact via near field communication or NFC when users are offline. He also notes that the system for issuing DCEP follows a two tier system in which the People's Bank of China connects to commercial banks and other financial intermediaries, which in turn connect with retail customers. The issuance of cash as DCEP is more like a conversion event, and that is a bottom up approach, he says, quote, starting from the user's own bank wallet as opposed to top down from the PBOC.
00:28:08.890 - 00:30:00.594, Speaker A: Molly from HashKey wrote a tweetstorm about it and said, quote, if China decides to fully regulate the crypto exchanges using DCEP might become the only way to buy or sell crypto to fiat. Next Headline Libra Reissues White paper adds single currency stablecoins While China's central bank digital currency plans get underway, Libra is retooling to create a handful of stablecoins tied to the US dollar, euro, British pound and Singapore dollar. It will still issue the Libra token, but that is now becoming a smart contract that aggregates these single currency stablecoins. The approach is similar to the IMF's Special Drawing Rights, or SDR. The system, which they initially said would begin permissioned, but over time, transition to permissionless will now instead move to what David Marcus, the head of Libra or Celibra actually at Facebook, described in a tweet as quote, A market driven, open and competitive network, one in which the participants will always remain known to each other. As for what people think of the changes, one Silicon Valley investor told CoinDesk governments could be interested in outsourcing the transition of their currencies to digital to an organization like Libra, but he'd questioned whether or not partners will remain interested in a project whose business model features such low returns. Next Headline The Financial Stability Board advises G 20 regulators about the risks of global stablecoins The Financial Stability Board, or FSB, which advises the G 20 on how to improve the global financial system, published a report on the risks posed by global stablecoins such as Libra.
00:30:00.594 - 00:31:18.870, Speaker A: It said, quote if users relied upon a stablecoin to make regular payments, significant operational disruptions could quickly affect real economic activity, large scale flows of funds into or out of the GSC global stablecoin could test the ability of the supporting infrastructure to handle high transaction volumes and the financing conditions of the wider financial system. Next Headline Ethereum milestone Value transfer reaches parity with bitcoin Meanwhile, the rise of stablecoins has helped fuel activity on ethereum to the point where value transfer on ethereum is now equal to that on bitcoin, Masari reports. In a Tweet storm, Masari's Ryan Watkins said this was driven by the fact that Q One was the best quarter ever for stablecoins, due in part to the flight to safety caused by the coronavirus pandemic. He tweeted quote the action this quarter was so dramatic it shook the prevailing order in cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is becoming the dominant value transfer layer in crypto. He has three bullet points, and that was the first one tether cracked. The top three cryptocurrencies by market cap and stablecoin challengers have gained serious momentum.
00:31:18.870 - 00:32:14.102, Speaker A: He also tweeted stablecoins now account for 80% of daily transfer value on ethereum, and they're used for significantly larger transfers on average than bitcoin. Super interesting stuff. All right. Next Headline Grayscale reports Largest quarterly inflows in Q one of 2020 Grayscale investments raised $504,000,000 with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC garnering the most investment at 389,000,000 institutions such as hedge funds, crypto, native investors and family offices constitute 90% of the inflows since inception. On a related note, the Financial Times reports that Andreessen Horowitz is raising a second fund for a 16 z crypto, and they are eyeing a $450,000,000 raise. All right, time for fun, bits. I have two fun Bits this week.
00:32:14.102 - 00:32:44.174, Speaker A: The first is human. IPOs. Is this going to be a thing this week? Crypto entrepreneur Alex Masmej. And if he's listening excuse me if I just mingled your name. I hope not. Alex announced that he'd sold $20,000 worth of personal tokens called you guessed it, Alex to 29 participants. Alex holders will receive 15% of his income in the next three years, capped at $100,000.
00:32:44.174 - 00:33:37.220, Speaker A: Plus, they receive one on one sessions with Masmedge, access to his network, and possible participation in the seed round of his next startup. He's going to work on building a new DFI savings startup. The $20,000 will fund his relocation from Paris to San Francisco. So am I the only one who heard this and immediately whipped out the calculator to figure out how the hell the math works out for him on this? Because either he's underestimating how far the $20,000 will go in San Francisco, or his idea of how much money he's going to make is kind of low. But then also on top of all that, he has these Kickstarter like bonuses he's going to give out, some of which are time consuming. And as we all know, time is the most precious resource. So maybe I'm wrong.
00:33:37.220 - 00:34:10.358, Speaker A: We'll see, I guess. Yeah. We'll just have to wait to see how this pans out. All right. Second fun bits. Another crypto community coronavirus effort COVIDathon. Last week I mentioned some crypto community efforts to fight COVID-19, and I forgot to mention one called COVIDathon, which is a hackathon working on building privacy centric solutions for COVID-19 using AI and blockchain technologies it's put on by the decentralized AI alliance under the leadership of Singularity, Net and Ocean Protocol.
00:34:10.358 - 00:34:39.800, Speaker A: The first phase runs until April 30, which is the deadline to submit. So if you have an idea, you still have a bit less than two weeks to do so.
