00:00:00.170 - 00:00:37.266, Speaker A: What the examiner describes is that in around 2021, obviously the price of bitcoin and ethereum had been rising and the celsius realized it had a problem. It had been using the coins that users have been giving them to purchase sell. And suddenly now it has this big coin deficit because it spent it all on propping up the price of sell. The price of bitcoin has risen significantly. And now in dollar terms, that hold is very large. And celsius does an interesting thing to fix it, they used other customer coins. We've got a gap of bitcoin.
00:00:37.266 - 00:00:53.530, Speaker A: We're going to use the other bitcoin that we have that we haven't spent. We're going to use that as collateral to borrow stablecoins. So we're going to go out and get loans using this user bitcoin as collateral. And then we're going to use stablecoin that we've got to buy bitcoin to plug the bitcoin hole.
