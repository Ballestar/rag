00:00:52.190 - 00:00:54.462, Speaker B: Glad to be here, Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:00:54.596 - 00:01:02.190, Speaker A: This week bitwise had big news. A company announced that it had passed the $100 million in assets under management. Mark, congratulations.
00:01:02.610 - 00:01:05.546, Speaker B: Thanks so much. We're very excited.
00:01:05.658 - 00:01:08.594, Speaker A: What do you think has been driving the interest in bitwise products?
00:01:08.792 - 00:01:39.020, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think, as you know, Laura, what bitwise focuses on is the financial advisor marketplace. And that marketplace is really maturing in the crypto space. So a few years ago, they were just kicking the tires of crypto. Now and I think what this news that represents hitting $100 million is that you're starting to see meaningful allocations from financial advisors for their clients into the crypto market. And that's important because they control a lot of wealth in America, about $15 trillion. So it's a meaningful piece of news.
00:01:39.710 - 00:01:49.438, Speaker A: And so when you say that, you're seeing kind of a change in who's interested. So who exactly is driving this new demand for crypto asset based financial products?
00:01:49.604 - 00:02:12.870, Speaker B: Yeah, for us we're seeing two big drivers. So the first is financial advisors. These are individuals who control the wealth of wealthy Americans. And I think what's bubbling up is that population is demanding that they get exposure to crypto in the market. There are a couple of reasons happy to dig into those. And the other is hedge funds. There is really a major rise in demand for crypto from the hedge fund community.
00:02:12.870 - 00:02:18.902, Speaker B: And I think we're seeing that at bitwise and other asset managers are seeing that as, yeah.
00:02:18.956 - 00:02:23.590, Speaker A: Do you want to dive a little into why you're seeing the interest from the financial advisors?
00:02:23.750 - 00:03:01.510, Speaker B: For sure. I think there are probably two or three big drivers. So the first big driver, the sort of underlying push in this market that's been happening all year is rising concerns about the potential for inflation and people looking for efficient hedge. People have watched how governments, not just in the US. But around the world, have responded to the pandemic and the ensuing economic worsening with massive QE, massive fiscal stimulus, and people want to hedge. And bitcoin crypto more broadly is the most efficient hedge for that space. But the other piece of news that's driving it is just you're just seeing a massive maturation of the crypto market.
00:03:01.510 - 00:03:25.454, Speaker B: It's now acceptable for institutional and professional investors to allocate and that's being driven by improvements in custody, improvements in trading, big improvements in regulation and then some proof of concept development like what we saw on the DeFi market. So it's just the perfect market for people to allocate. You have these couple of big catalysts and I think we're at the early innings of this happening. I think it's going to snowball from here.
00:03:25.652 - 00:03:35.630, Speaker A: And when you mentioned the maturation of the crypto market, how would you say that that has changed the customer base of your product since your launch in 2017?
00:03:36.210 - 00:04:09.110, Speaker B: It's been huge. So the customer base when we launched in 2017 was primarily high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals who were looking for an easy way to get exposure to all the or at least the majority of the crypto asset market cap. That's what we offer. Right. We're best known for having the first index fund in the space. It's a way to get push button exposure to crypto as an asset class that's really shifted. So those people are still allocating in bitwise but the driver of the inflows that led to the 100 million dollar mark is hedge funds and financial advisors.
00:04:09.110 - 00:04:35.346, Speaker B: And they couldn't, particularly financial advisors couldn't really have allocated two years ago. Two years ago there were no regulated insured custodians in the market. Now there are a dozen bitwise uses coinbase, Custody and Fidelity. Two years ago, trading was uneven in the market. Now bitcoin and other crypto assets trade at pennywise spread. Two years ago there were massive regulatory risks in the market. There was whether ethereum would be dubbed a security.
00:04:35.346 - 00:05:10.670, Speaker B: There was still a lot of nefarious activity in the crypto asset market that's been swept away. I sort of knew we were in this new market. We were in a powerful bull market, not just an incidental bull market, but a powerful bull market. When the BitMEX news came out and no one blinked, the market maybe waffled like a percent or so. If you had had that happen two years ago, if they had put one of the BitMEX executives in jail, they had fundamentally harmed maybe one of the largest at the time, derivative markets in the crypto space. The market would have collapsed. This time it barely went down.
00:05:10.670 - 00:05:27.662, Speaker B: When bad news doesn't impact you, you know you're in a deep bull market and I think that's just indicative of the space. We've matured. We've put that sort of old crypto legacy behind us and we're moving into a mature, regulated and institutional future and that's going to be meaningful in terms of asset flows.
00:05:27.806 - 00:05:41.750, Speaker A: And so when you talk with your investors, do they ask different types of questions or is it simply that you have different facts and figures you can offer them. How have the conversations changed since that 2017 bubble era?
00:05:41.910 - 00:06:37.258, Speaker B: Yeah, I think 2017 you had very simple questions. What is crypto? Doesn't it always get stolen? Doesn't it always get hacked? Now, we can answer many of those questions really easily, right? We can talk about Fidelity and Coinbase and insured regulated custody and sweep that aside, now people are really asking questions about how does it fit in a portfolio, does it increase the portfolio's volatility? What should I think about particular developments? I got a question from a financial advisor today about what the impact of JPMorgan Coin will be on different crypto assets within the bitwise ten. That's a very sophisticated question. It's a good question. It has very different impacts on bitcoin versus Ethereum versus XRP. But that's a very sophisticated question. What we were getting two years ago was, what is crypto? What is this fake internet money? No one understood what blockchains were.
00:06:37.258 - 00:06:58.770, Speaker B: People were excited about blockchain stocks. Do you remember that? People were all excited about investing in blockchain equities and not crypto assets. There was the whole blockchain, not bitcoin that's been swept aside. People understand that this market is not going away. They understand the importance of public blockchains powered by crypto assets. And we're getting much more sophisticated questions.
00:06:58.840 - 00:07:36.206, Speaker A: Now, and I'd love for you to expound on that Morgan note. And just for listeners who may not know what Matt was referring, JP Morgan came up with a global market strategy report that said that bitcoin could compete with gold. And one of the choice quotes was, a crowding out of gold as an alternative currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term. Mechanically, the market cap of bitcoin would have to rise ten times from here to match the total private sector investment to gold via ETFs or bars or coins. So can you just tell us, aside from that one question, what impact do you think this research note could have?
00:07:36.388 - 00:08:27.694, Speaker B: It's massive in terms of its indication of where we're going, and it's not the first. So just a few months ago, bloomberg's senior commodity strategist came out and said bitcoin could trade to $100,000. And now you have JPMorgan saying it could easily two or three X if millennials crowd out gold, and it could ten X if it replaced and mixed it. These were price targets that people were expounding on crypto maybe in 2017, and getting laughed out of the room by traditional Wall Street. Now it's traditional Wall Street that recognizing the potential size of this market, if even a fraction of the investors. That allocate based on reports like JPMorgan and the reports we're going to see from every other major bank in the next six to twelve months saying the same thing. If even a fraction of that money comes into the market, the potential impact is huge.
00:08:27.694 - 00:09:00.950, Speaker B: One really important thing that the crypto industry needs to understand, and I come from the traditional finance industry is crypto is built on retail money. And retail investors, as wonderful as they are, control a very small fraction of the overall wealth in America. It's controlled by institutions and also by financial advisors and hedge funds. 80, 90% of the wealth. So even if we get modest pickup, it could be significant. One more thing about the JPMorgan report. It's worth noting, and maybe this is a nuance, that they wrote this in one of their flagship publications.
00:09:00.950 - 00:09:26.130, Speaker B: This wasn't some junior analyst who had just cottoned on to bitcoin writing their first research report where they figured in a few sentences about bitcoin and crypto. This was their flagship publication talking about this as a potential important new asset class. I think it's hugely meaningful in isolation and as an indication of what we're going to see over the next year. It's a very telling development.
00:09:26.950 - 00:10:34.034, Speaker A: Yeah. And earlier this summer we did see the letter from the OCC that said that banks could custody digital assets and you wrote a Forbes piece saying that that was a huge deal. And in general, I feel like we're just noticing so much news about banks and crypto. And on top of that, other well known established financial institutions like PayPal and Venmo will soon be offering bitcoin, Ether, and some other cryptocurrencies. But about that, I wanted to ask you so initially PayPal users will be limited to just buying bitcoin and these other cryptos and then being able to use those for purchases, but the merchants themselves will actually just receive dollars. So I wondered, do you think the offering of crypto on PayPal will be kind of like a novelty feature that few people will use? Similar to how and I know this is going far back, but to how in kind of 2014, 2015, microsoft and Dell began accepting bitcoin as payment, but there wasn't like a lot of uptake of it, right? Or do you think this time around it's different and we'll see these actually used on these platforms?
00:10:34.162 - 00:10:52.746, Speaker B: I think that's a great question. I think there are two big impacts of the PayPal news and maybe three. Actually three. So the first one, which doesn't get to whether they'll be used at retail and investment chains, is just investment. Right. PayPal has 200 million US. Users who will now be able to buy bitcoin with the push of a button in an app that they're familiar with.
00:10:52.746 - 00:11:14.242, Speaker B: They won't have to decide between a coinbase or kraken account. They won't have to open a new account. They already have it. They have money there. They can allocate that. That could double the number of investors in crypto assets overnight before they try to spend a penny of it at a retail location. I do think the retail step should be seen as a minor incremental step.
00:11:14.242 - 00:11:59.982, Speaker B: I don't think it's that we're going to wake up in January 2021 and everyone's going to be buying their coffee with bitcoin. There's still huge negative tax implications. You're absolutely right that the merchants will be receiving cash. I think what we'll see, though, is there'll be some niche retailing establishments that favor or push for people to pay in crypto assets. And the other thing you'll see is you have to think of this as an incremental step. It's actually a huge incremental step. But do you think two years from now, maybe one year from now, certainly three years from now, you think that will still be true at PayPal? That they won't allow payments to retailers in crypto? I think the fact that they're crossing this chasm in a big giant leap means that's inevitable.
00:11:59.982 - 00:12:17.142, Speaker B: Inevitably, retailers will be able to get paid directly in crypto from PayPal. People who expect them to go from zero to 100 in one step are expecting too much. They made a huge jump. They went from zero to 50. They could have just done some tiny little thing. They didn't. They did a big thing.
00:12:17.142 - 00:12:48.340, Speaker B: But no, I don't think there'll be a massive explosion in retail use next year. There's still a lot of issues to be worked out, but we're making progress. The third impact is PayPal has cleared the way for every major institution to enter the market. So I think we saw the PayPal news and people don't realize how big PayPal PayPal is much bigger than Morgan Stanley, it's much bigger than Goldman Sachs, it's bigger than bank of America. From a market cap perspective, it's a huge institution. You're going to see every other major institution follow suit. They now have to.
00:12:48.340 - 00:12:52.530, Speaker B: It's table stakes.
00:12:52.870 - 00:13:10.614, Speaker A: In a moment, we'll discuss other big corporate moves in crypto. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn and spend crypto all in one place. Earn up to 8.5% per year on your BTC. Download the Crypto.com

Once in the app, you can apply for the Crypto.com metal card which pays you up to 8% cash back instantly. Reserve years now in the Crypto.com app. Back to my conversation with Matt Hogan. So as you mentioned earlier, we've also seen interest by corporate treasuries with the purchase of Bitcoin by MicroStrategy and Square.
00:13:35.394 - 00:13:45.250, Speaker A: And I wondered what ripple effects you thought that their pioneering of this area would have. And have you seen it already come up in conversations with your investors?
00:13:45.830 - 00:14:29.246, Speaker B: We actually have, yeah. Shortly after the MicroStrategy news, we have a number of advisors who advise corporate clients on their treasury holdings and who have been bullish on crypto. And we're going to use that as a way to reopen the conversation about whether crypto is appropriate. Now, I don't think most corporations are going to start allocating to the space tomorrow and I think we will all agree that MicroStrategy's reasons were idiosyncratic. Square's reasons were idiosyncratic, but that's always how the earliest phase of innovation and innovative adopters occur. It's always idiosyncratic reasons, but it does pave the way for a broader audience. So a year ago, there were no publicly traded corporations with Bitcoin on their balance sheet.
00:14:29.246 - 00:14:47.094, Speaker B: Now they're a couple, and in a few more years or in a few more months, I suspect we'll see more. So I do think it's important, but it's not like the floodgates are going to open. I don't think Apple's going to buy $100 million of bitcoin tomorrow. Maybe eventually, but it'll take a while. But it's big news.
00:14:47.212 - 00:14:52.950, Speaker A: And why did you say that MicroStrategy's and Square's reasons for purchasing Bitcoin were idiosyncratic?
00:14:53.110 - 00:15:40.282, Speaker B: Well, MicroStrategy is a unique company, right? It has a strong CEO who has supermajority voting shares. He's a deep believer in Bitcoin, has been for a while. They had huge cash balances and they're a not cash intensive business. So they needed to do something with those cash balances and they had the ability to make that allocation because Sailor is such a strong CEO there. Square obviously has had a long standing relationship with Bitcoin, sees it as the internet currency. So it's not the same as IBM or Apple or Microsoft making the allocation, but it does pave the way for that in the future. And we've seen that again and again in the crypto market, that it takes brave institutions to pave the way for others.
00:15:40.282 - 00:16:12.740, Speaker B: So another example is fidelity. Fidelity was really one of the first major US. Financial institutions to put a stake in the ground and say, crypto is real and we're going to offer custody for institutional clients. They were able to do it first because Abby Johnson was a deep believer and it's a family owned business, and that paved the way for eventually publicly traded companies that aren't family owned businesses to follow suit. So it's often these pioneers who have idiosyncratic reasons that open the doors and then you will see people follow on.
00:16:14.070 - 00:16:39.740, Speaker A: So you've alluded to this kind of throughout this conversation, but the backdrop to all this activity is that the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, has said that the Fed will now target a 2% average inflation rate. And so we've kind of talked a little bit here and there, sprinkled throughout the conversation how this is affecting maybe individual decisions. But can you just talk more broadly about how you expect this will affect crypto and the industry in general?
00:16:40.110 - 00:17:32.806, Speaker B: It's going to lead to massive inflows into inflation protecting assets, and that will include things like gold, but it will also include things like crypto. Look, no one is going to say for certain that we're going to see significant runaway inflation, right? Drucken. Miller came out the other day and said we could see five or 10% inflation in the next few years. But what is certain if you're a financial analyst, is that the tail risk of higher inflation is higher today than it was two years ago. There is a higher probability we'll face inflationary pressures and inflationary risks in the future than there was two years ago. And even if that doesn't occur, because it's a higher probability as a portfolio manager or a fiduciary, you need to think about hedging that risk. The beautiful thing about crypto, the beautiful thing about bitcoin is it's a very efficient hedge against inflation risk.
00:17:32.806 - 00:18:33.650, Speaker B: We were talking to an endowment the other day, they were very worried about inflation, and they said, look, it's really hard with gold, because even if I'm the most bullish gold person in the world, I might think gold will go from $2000 to $3,000 an ounce, up 50%. That would be an amazing result. I have to allocate so much of my portfolio to gold to actually provide an efficient hedge for the 100% of my portfolio that it's impossible. I can't allocate 20% to this inflation hedge. The beautiful thing about bitcoin or crypto is because the upside is so much more significant, because it could ten x, as JPMorgan said, or it could go to $100,000, as Bloomberg said, that you can make a relatively small allocation a couple of percent, and you can hedge that inflation risk in a meaningful way. So I think you're going to see massive inflows into inflation hedging assets across the board. I think some significant portion of those inflows will go into bitcoin and other crypto assets, and I think that will be a really big macro story in 2021 that drives a lot of allocations.
00:18:34.710 - 00:19:16.366, Speaker A: Yeah. I do feel like somehow the coronavirus sort of accelerated trends that were already in place. But now with all this quantitative easing and what we just mentioned about the target interest rate, it sort of feels like what's going to happen is a supercharging of things that were already on their way. One other thing, so you did mention the BitMax action by the CFTC and DOJ, and I wondered previously, bitwise attempted to get approval for a bitcoin ETF. And so, given those types of regulatory actions, what do you think the ODS are for a bitcoin ETF in the.
00:19:16.388 - 00:19:45.954, Speaker B: Next few oh, I think in the next few years, the ODS are extraordinarily good. This is really becoming an institutional marketplace. Right. The CME is now often the largest single market in the world in bitcoin. Yesterday, I think it traded over a billion dollars. That's a fully regulated market. And the BitMEX news is another example that we're shedding the sort of legacy past that kept this market from being of robust enough quality to justify an ETF.
00:19:45.954 - 00:20:26.270, Speaker B: So the next few years, I think the chances are extremely high. I do think we're still a little ways away from it. Bitwise continues to work on it, and I think you could see news next year or the year that follows. So there's still work to be done, but in terms of will we get there? We'll absolutely get there. And the BitMEX news is a great example. I really think something remarkable is happening on the regulatory front, which is that the crypto industry is taking two regulatory tracks. On the one hand, regulators are shutting down bad actors and we've seen enforcement actions since 2018 that have repeatedly crushed actors that are trying to skirt the surface.
00:20:26.270 - 00:20:43.370, Speaker B: And on the other hand, you have the thing like the OCC letter where they're creating this amazing, open, positive, supportive playing space for this crypto industry to flourish. You couldn't design a better regulatory outcome than what we've seen over the last few years in terms of where crypto is going.
00:20:43.440 - 00:21:13.726, Speaker A: So we're going to come back to this regulatory thing in one moment. But I just have one quick question on an unrelated topic I have to ask. Right now, the new emerging area of crypto is DeFi. It's truly the Wild West. There have just been countless hacks, including two, I guess you would call them, exploits this week, one in Harvest and the other involving MakerDAO. And yet I've seen you write positively about DeFi. But I was just curious bitwise interfaces with more traditional investors.
00:21:13.726 - 00:21:19.666, Speaker A: So I wondered how you thought a firm like yours could capitalize on the trend in DeFi.
00:21:19.858 - 00:21:46.094, Speaker B: Oh, that's great. I'll start with my general thoughts on DeFi, which is that I have a love hate relationship with it. Everything you said is true. I think as a proof of concept, it's absolutely amazing what you're seeing in automated market making, what you're seeing in automated lending, what you're seeing in the stablecoin growth. I think it's proof of concept. It's amazing, but it's still, as you said, the wild, wild west. I think we'll see significant blow ups in the automated market making space in the next year.
00:21:46.094 - 00:22:23.190, Speaker B: I think we'll see continued hacks. A lot of these are sort of thrown into the market and become billion dollar projects overnight and without the due diligence and scale. So it's great proof of concept. It's showing what the future is going to look like and it's going to be a very rocky road between now and the future. In terms of Bitwise, we take a two track approach. That's the message we give to investors, that this is a very interesting, potentially extremely large market and that it's really early and what you're seeing is proof of concept. And you have to expect significant issues in the next year as that market matures.
00:22:23.190 - 00:22:51.666, Speaker B: And then in terms of sort of product development, it's something we keep an eye on. People have certainly talked a lot about tokenization of ETFs and things like that. Certainly a lot of conversations around that. Recently, Jay Clayton said that was something they would look at. Again, I think it's very early. I think the majority of asset flows into the crypto space, whether the crypto industry likes it or not, is going to come through traditional regulated products that fit into the traditional architecture, at least for the next few years.
00:22:51.848 - 00:23:02.710, Speaker A: All right, so back to regulators. Next week is the presidential election and I was curious to know how you thought a trump versus a biden win would affect the industry.
00:23:03.210 - 00:23:58.210, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. I think in either case, if you have the president and congress of the same party, I think inflationary risks increase because there's going to be a pressure for significant stimulus and the ability to get it done versus the gridlock that we've seen recently. So if you have an alignment of both parties in the white house and in congress, I think the pressures we talked about in terms of forcing people to find inflation protecting securities is going to go up significantly. Beyond that, in terms of the impact, I think we're in a safe space either way. I think three or four years ago, a change in political party, a change in regulatory tenor could have had a real impact on crypto. It could have potentially delayed the industry multiple years, right? They could have cracked down on crypto banking or banking to crypto related companies. They could have pushed to regulate them more heavily.
00:23:58.210 - 00:24:24.494, Speaker B: We're past that. We're past that. We've created such a regulatory safe space. We've made so much regulatory progress in the past two years. And the fundamental growth of the crypto industry has been so significant that it's at escape velocity. So beyond the potential impact on inflation, I don't worry about the market being slowed or being advanced. I think every major financial institution now realizes that this market is not going away.
00:24:24.494 - 00:24:36.530, Speaker B: I think every major financial institution realizes that the future of how money moves on the internet is over crypto and blockchain. And I think that ship is sailed regardless of who's in the white house or who's in congress.
00:24:37.430 - 00:24:44.786, Speaker A: That's a great perspective and it makes a lot of sense. This has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.
00:24:44.978 - 00:24:46.006, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:24:46.028 - 00:25:08.814, Speaker A: Laura, don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline JP. Morgan is finally bullish for bitcoin. After years of skepticism, JP. Morgan is now projecting bitcoin's. Price could see, quote, a doubling or tripling assuming current trends hold.
00:25:08.814 - 00:26:13.220, Speaker A: A research note published by the bank says the cryptocurrency is a valid alternative to gold among millennials while still cautioning that bitcoin is overbought in the near term. In addition to demographic trends, the company cites positive developments for bitcoin, such as the recent announcement by PayPal to offer bitcoin to customers as well as the fact that companies such as square have added the asset to their balance sheets. JP. Morgan also had other crypto related news this week. The block reports that the bank has been in talks with crypto native firms as it explores how it can offer cryptocurrency custody the plan would likely be for Morgan to enlist sub custodians to provide services, and it has reportedly reached out to Fidelity Digital Assets and Paxos, among others. Amidst all of this Morgan blockchain news, the firm's digital currency JPMCoin is being used commercially for the first time this week to send payments worldwide. The company's also rebranded its banking network to the name Link that's with two eyes and invited its 500 plus financial institutions to start building on the platform.
00:26:13.220 - 00:27:49.938, Speaker A: The head of the Link product, Christine Moy, called it, quote, the foundation of an enterprise main net. All these blockchain digital currency efforts have now been housed under a new business entity dubbed Onyx, which currently has more than 100 staffers. Next headline Was Finance US set up as a decoy for US regulators? Michael Del Castillo at Forbes, who I wish I had had the opportunity to work with, though he arrived there after I had left, did a thorough look into Binance's approach to US regulation and in particular, its reason for establishing the regulatorily compliant Binance US. Michael obtained a 2018 document that detailed finance's plans for the launch of the entity that would eventually become Finance US, but was at the time called, quote, the Tai Chi entity, which, Michael writes, is, quote, an allusion to the Chinese martial art whose approach is built around the principle of yield and overcome, or using an opponent's own weight against him. Michael says, quote While the then unnamed entity set up operations in the United States to distract regulators with feigned interest in compliance, measures would be put in place to move revenue in the form of licensing fees and more to the parent company Binance. Some of the more startling revelations from the document are a bold bullet point that says, quote, key Binance personnel continue to operate from a non US location to avoid enforcement risks. The document then also says, quote, License and service fees paid by the US service company to Binance are functionally US.
00:27:49.938 - 00:28:49.362, Speaker A: Sourced trading fees. Then Michael writes but unlike an actual subsidiary whose parent company could be held accountable for regulatory violations, the tai chi entity would have little more than a contractual relationship. Further, quote, insulating Binance from US enforcement, according to the document, Michael writes, Essentially, it would be a decoy. This article is perhaps the most thorough look into how Binance is playing regulatory arbitrage, in particular with US regulators. It's definitely worth a read and certainly offers arguments to people who believe Binance is playing fast and loose when it comes to US regulations, as well as those who believe US regulations regarding crypto are too stringent.

00:31:43.694 - 00:32:53.410, Speaker A: million for unknown reasons soon after the attack.

Harvest claimed to know the attacker's identity, saying they are quote, well known in the crypto community. Harvest then provided the Bitcoin address of the attacker containing what they called, quote, a significant amount of personally identifiable information. And Harvest also put up a $100,000 bounty for the first person or team to get the attacker to return the funds to the deployer address. Although the attack is devastating, people have stopped short of calling it a hack.
