00:00:31.820 - 00:00:42.038, Speaker B: You'll love the unlimited airport lounge access and interbank exchange rates if you travel a lot. Today's guest is Kevin Kelly, macro strategist at Delphi Digital. Welcome, Kevin.
00:00:42.134 - 00:00:43.462, Speaker C: Thanks for having me, Laura.
00:00:43.606 - 00:00:59.658, Speaker A: We've been through some pretty sobering weeks, both in terms of the coronavirus's impact on the economy and financial markets, but also in terms of its impact on public health. Bitcoin was also affected, although it has not suffered anywhere near the same level of carnage.
00:00:59.754 - 00:01:01.454, Speaker B: Let's first just get an overview of.
00:01:01.492 - 00:01:10.098, Speaker A: What happened in Q One. What did you see in the traditional financial markets and how did that impact bitcoin as well?
00:01:10.264 - 00:01:55.234, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely so, I mean, one of the big kind of key themes that we've been watching and this kind of spills over from last year in 2019 was you saw this really big kind of run up in financial markets across different asset classes. We kind of deemed it as the everything rally from last year. And a lot of that was driven by this kind of pivot by central banks to more kind of dovish or accommodative monetary policies. And so that gave a bid to, as I mentioned, asset prices kind of across the board. And you basically saw that entire theme really flipped on its head here in Q one. I mean, we just wrapped up Q One this week and to be honest, it was nothing short of a bloodbath, especially towards the latter half. And as you mentioned, bitcoin certainly had a pretty significant drawdown, but it wasn't unique in that sense.
00:01:55.234 - 00:02:48.398, Speaker C: And it certainly wasn't, I don't think, isolated from a lot of the carnage that happened in traditional financial markets. If you think about riskier asset classes like stocks and use the S and P 500 as a US benchmark, the S and P 500 fell a clean 20% over the last, basically over the last month or so. And it at one point was down almost 35% from its all time high in mid to late February. Right. So you saw some really drastic drawdowns. And part of the reason for that, and this kind of spills over into what happened to bitcoin as well, is that there was a key catalyst or turning point, I should say, in the severity or how much the market was pricing in the severity of coronavirus and COVID-19. And from there you saw this kind of transpire or spiral of events that caused a liquidity crisis across asset classes.
00:02:48.398 - 00:03:24.480, Speaker C: And basically historically, when you have a liquidity crisis where people are basically just trying to get out and sell whatever it is they can, that has decent liquidity, oftentimes it gets to a point where it doesn't really matter what the asset is that you're selling, right? So it could be stocks eventually. We even saw liquidity drive in the treasury market. Gold had a bit of a drawdown. Bitcoin certainly had a big drawdown. So we talk about bitcoin being longer term and uncorrelated asset and things of that nature, but when it comes to real kind of seismic liquidity, events like that isn't something that necessarily you'd think bitcoin or crypto would be immune to.
00:03:24.850 - 00:04:08.918, Speaker A: Yeah, although one thing in your analysis was that actually the impact on bitcoin was less, I guess, than kind of the more traditional financial markets. One of the obvious comparisons would be crude oil was down to 66%, but even the s and p 500 was down 19% compared to bitcoin, which was down 10%. So somehow the impact was muted. But actually that leads me to my next question, which is that for years there's been this kind of conventional wisdom about bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, which is that in times of distress, some portion of that population in whatever economy that is, will turn to bitcoin and push up demand for it in that particular region.
00:04:09.014 - 00:04:10.426, Speaker B: Do you think that that theory has.
00:04:10.448 - 00:04:13.290, Speaker A: Held true during the coronavirus pandemic?
00:04:13.950 - 00:05:09.434, Speaker C: I think it's too early to dismiss that theory, to say that it hasn't come true. I mean, certainly the macro hedge argument has taken a lot of heat just because of, again, that large drawdown that we saw in bitcoin alongside riskier asset classes. But at the same time, if you rewind the clock and you think back to what happened in the financial crisis 2008, 2009, you actually saw gold as stock started to sell off. Gold itself, which has been deemed as obviously a complement or comparison for bitcoin, but also has been a store of value for not only hundreds of years, but thousands of years. At this point, you saw gold take a pretty solid drawdown as well. I mean, it fell more than 30% between, I think it was march of 2008 through October of that year, and then gold really outperformed risk assets coming out of the global financial crisis. And so I think it's a little bit too early to pronounce that macro hedge argument as dead for bitcoin.
00:05:09.434 - 00:05:51.230, Speaker C: I think it depends on how it reacts and really comes out of all the turmoil that we're seeing here. And a big part of that is what's going on in the kind of monetary and fiscal policy world and the implications of that long term for hard, scarce assets. Bitcoin certainly being kind of a higher beta approach to an asset like that. But I think it's again too early to deem it necessarily dead because again, in a liquidity type crisis or a really severe downturn initially you have selling pressure across the board and even something like gold isn't necessarily immune from that. So to think that Bitcoin would kind of be negatively correlated at a time in which correlations across asset classes are all moving towards one I think would be a little bit naive.
00:05:51.970 - 00:06:12.398, Speaker A: And you guys published a report and in the report you mentioned the US. I can't even talk $2 trillion Coronavirus relief package and you talk about how it's going to double the deficit and how the government is relying on the US dollar's status as the last global reserve currency.
00:06:12.494 - 00:06:14.994, Speaker B: And you conclude, quote, the setup for.
00:06:15.032 - 00:06:22.310, Speaker A: Broad based currency debasement is playing out in front of our eyes. So what effect do you think this will have on Bitcoin and the crypto markets?
00:06:22.730 - 00:07:14.006, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. It's a theme we've certainly been harping on, doing a lot of work on recently. If you kind of just take a step back and think about what the core issue that's really facing the global economy right now. Obviously, COVID-19 has certainly thrown a wrench into economic growth and it's not to say the global economy wasn't vulnerable heading into this. And I think Coronavirus is going to get blamed for a lot of the recessionary fears right now and it's certainly accelerated the downturn but it's not necessarily the sole cause of it. But basically if you kind of take a step back at the core of all of this is really kind of a cash flow issue initially because you've seen a massive exogenous shock to revenue for companies, small businesses, right, corporate America. And it comes at a time in which the world was heavily indebted, right? And so a lot of these risks are starting to compound on one another.
00:07:14.006 - 00:08:21.318, Speaker C: And what policymakers and lawmakers are really trying to do right now is see if they can or trying their best to create this monetary and fiscal bridge almost if they can bridge the gap between what's happening right now with all the global government shutdowns certainly happening here in the US. You and I sit in New York City, I mean, we've been on lockdown for weeks now, is basically trying to build this bridge to get the global economy across to a time in which the global economy reopens or opens back up. And they're doing that by know literally trillions and trillions of dollars into the system. And so in the short term, obviously a lot of the focus right now is on just supporting employees, supporting small businesses, supporting corporate America, right. Really trying to just keep the economic engine light on, I guess you could say. But the long term implications of that is that there's going to be a lot of money that's pumped into the system. And so you're starting to hear a lot of arguments about if we do get through this and maybe things aren't necessarily as bad as we think because policymakers reacted so quickly and we don't actually see the next great depression.
00:08:21.318 - 00:08:52.150, Speaker C: Well, what is that going to leave us with on the other end of this? And if you really do see demand come back and you see a lot of businesses hopefully potentially even survive the next, whether it's one quarter, two quarters, or the next twelve months, hopefully it's not that long. But hypothetically, if you do see businesses come out on the other side of this and demand does ramp back up relatively quickly, you certainly could see inflationary pressures start to build and that's where you start to get this long term bullcase for things like bitcoin, crypto assets, but even precious metals like gold.
00:08:53.290 - 00:09:32.658, Speaker A: Yeah, well, one other thing that I wanted to ask about was unfortunately, this is just such a sad statistic, but these historic jobless claims, you know, reaching $10 million or ten mil. See you guys, my brain, I had a terrible dream about coronavirus and I just feel like this is on my brain. But anyway, 10 million claims, and that's obviously eclipsed all previous periods of high unemployment. And while obviously we don't know, I mean, just in terms of bitcoin's history so far, we don't know if there's a correlation between unemployment and bitcoin because that number is so staggering. I just wonder if there are going.
00:09:32.664 - 00:09:33.742, Speaker B: To be ripple effects.
00:09:33.806 - 00:09:35.938, Speaker A: How do you think that will play out?
00:09:36.104 - 00:10:24.702, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely. It's absolutely staggering. And again, what's difficult too, taking a step back and looking at markets is a number like today. I mean, it's over six and a half million in terms of initial jobless claims. I mean, that's a number most people never thought they would see or never hoped that they would see, obviously. And it certainly was even higher than a lot of the highest economist expectations, right? So it really did surpass a lot of what people thought was already going to be a really high number. And I think in the short to intermediate term, actually potentially have a negative correlation just because, again, if you think about right now the core issue that a lot of people are facing in terms of household income and really just kind of trying to keep their head above water, right? It's not a time in which you're putting potentially excess cash or some of that income into the markets or into something like bitcoin.
00:10:24.702 - 00:11:11.986, Speaker C: Again, long term, certainly believe in the store value argument for it. But right now, at the current juncture and where bitcoin and crypto is an asset class really sits, I don't think you're necessarily going to see people getting unemployment benefits and then rolling some of that money into something like bitcoin just because, again, they're just trying to keep the lights on, trying to keep their head above water. What I think the longer term, we'll call it maybe more indirect impact from something like jobless claims would be how does that affect the policy response to what's going on in the global economy? And again, this isn't just a US. Issue. Obviously it's a global issue. As you see global central banks and country leaders and lawmakers come out and increase. I mean, I don't think we're really close to the end game in terms of what the stimulus packages are actually going to look like here in the US.
00:11:11.986 - 00:11:45.520, Speaker C: You mentioned we already had that $2 trillion stimulus package that was passed, but that's already being talked about. Adding on top of that because again, small businesses are really starting to struggle and haven't gotten that money flowing into their pockets yet. I think the policy responses to numbers like the jobless claims are going to long term be kind of the more indirect effects on bitcoin, crypto and other asset classes. And in the short run, as the situation gets worse, it's not necessarily something that would be in the short term good for bitcoin or bitcoin's price.
00:11:46.130 - 00:11:56.586, Speaker A: So in a moment, we're going to dive into more details on bitcoin's price as well as who's been selling. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Why should you get an MCO visa.
00:11:56.618 - 00:11:58.690, Speaker B: Card from crypto.com first?
00:11:58.760 - 00:12:00.274, Speaker A: It's a beautiful metal card.
00:12:00.392 - 00:12:01.666, Speaker B: You can top up the card with.
00:12:01.688 - 00:12:04.286, Speaker A: Crypto and spend anywhere visa is accepted.
00:12:04.398 - 00:12:13.190, Speaker B: You also get up to 5% back on all spending. You know, they'll pay for your spotify and Netflix too. You'll love the unlimited airport lounge access.
00:12:13.260 - 00:12:14.706, Speaker A: And interbank exchange rates.
00:12:14.738 - 00:12:24.566, Speaker B: If you travel a lot, there are so many cool perks loaded in one card. Download the crypto.com app. Now back to my conversation with Kevin Kelly.
00:12:24.758 - 00:12:37.274, Speaker A: Your firm put out reports with comprehensive analyses of some of the different factors affecting the bitcoin price, such as the technical analysis and looking at some of the crypto specific metrics like bitcoin's network.
00:12:37.322 - 00:12:39.162, Speaker B: Value to transaction signal.
00:12:39.306 - 00:12:47.300, Speaker A: What did you find from these different analyses that you've done? And when you explain that, if you could also define any terms listeners may not know.
00:12:48.550 - 00:13:49.298, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely. So one of the things that we do pretty regularly is update our UTXO analysis, which basically is the unspent transaction outputs. And for bitcoin, what that allows us to do is basically see the last time bitcoin was moved and what the associated price was. And you can create a lot of these really interesting and potentially useful metrics that you just mentioned. And so one of the things we'll look at is trying to define who the types of holders or sellers would be during a period in which you see pre volatile price movement. And so, for example, if you look at our most recent outlook and look at the UTXO age bands, right, we break those out in terms of how long it's been since bitcoin's moved and the percentage or the amount that hasn't moved in that associated period of time. You see that a lot of this recent trading activity, recent selling pressure has come from more kind of short term holders, right? So not your longer term holders that you would potentially see like we saw back in 2018.
00:13:49.298 - 00:14:38.398, Speaker C: You saw that kind of final layup capitulation where you had long term holders sell out. And that kind of gave us an idea of where a potential bottom would be. And that's why we came out with our December 2018 report talking about how we thought a bottom was going to be in for bitcoin because you were starting to see signs of capitulation. What we're seeing now is a lot of this has been short term holder driven. And it is an interesting sign because we pair things like that with looking at bitcoin exchange flows, for example, and seeing that a lot of bitcoin, we not only had a significant amount of stablecoin inflows into exchanges, but also there was a good amount of bitcoin that was taken off exchange. Right? So we would think that longer term, these are people who are basically going in buying bitcoin and trying to store it longer term because again, they're bullish on it. They think this could actually serve as a store of value during a time in which, as you mentioned, we have that rising risk of fiat currency debasement.
00:14:38.398 - 00:15:27.090, Speaker C: And so we'll take a look at a lot of these different metrics. And to be honest, what's kind of fascinating me about the crypto space and bitcoin specifically is the underlying blockchain and the transparency of it. You're able to create these really interesting metrics and track them pretty much in real time at this point that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise in other asset classes. I come from the equity world, from the stock market world, and you don't have things like UTXOs to be able to track buying and selling or holder position trends and things of that nature. So it's really interesting, obviously, if anybody's more curious about that, certainly reach out to us. But I think that's one of the cooler aspects of crypto and being an analyst in this space is always trying to kind of deviate or come up with different variations of these metrics to see if they have any leading signals.
00:15:28.890 - 00:15:44.140, Speaker A: What do you think the impact of the coronavirus and the economic fallout will be on bitcoin at the time of the having? Are you noticing any effects on bitcoin mining at the moment that would give us further insight into what might happen at that time?
00:15:44.910 - 00:16:34.630, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a really good question and one that's obviously highly debated. And to be quite frank, I think the momentum or the trend in which bitcoin's price is going is going to help dictate how the immediate kind of price reaction is following the having. Right. And I think what's interesting is right now we've actually seen, at least this morning, bitcoin start to catch a bit of a bid. Last time I checked, I think it was at 6900, close to a kind of key technical level in 7000. And if you started to see bitcoin, let's say, move back towards ten k, as you start to see again more and more talk about having what the potential long term effects of that will be with the supply decrease. I think the momentum heading into it is certainly going to be one of the catalysts that helps dictate, at least in the short to intermediate term, how price is affected.
00:16:34.630 - 00:17:33.040, Speaker C: But long term, I mean, certainly a bullish event or indicator. Because again, a lot of the crux of the argument for Bitcoin being digital gold or a store of value long term, is that hard cap supply, right? And really, when you talk about a non sovereign, digitally native, censorship resistant asset, bitcoin certainly, obviously fits all of those. And it's an asset that this world simply hasn't seen yet, right? So I think it'll at the very least draw more attention to what's happening even on the day that the having occurs. It'll just drive news flow. It'll drive more attention and awareness about what's going on in Bitcoin. At a time in which you're seeing a lot of macro people really wake up to this risk of broad based fiat currency debasement and they're now on the prowl and really searching for what is that asset that's again potentially non sovereign and would potentially benefit from a macro environment like that.
00:17:33.730 - 00:17:56.722, Speaker A: So let's now switch gears and discuss Maker, because that well, DeFi in general was obviously in the news in a big way because of the coronavirus impact. And your colleague Medio DiMarco published a report advocating that Maker not use Token burns as the only tool in its arsenal and that it should keep tokens in reserve.
00:17:56.866 - 00:17:58.562, Speaker B: Can you walk us through his argument.
00:17:58.626 - 00:18:01.800, Speaker A: And what he's saying and why he's saying it?
00:18:02.570 - 00:18:55.622, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely. He's certainly the go to expert on our team for this topic area, for sure. He's done a lot of work on it and I think he brings up some really interesting points and he tries to relate it back to honestly kind of something that's going on in the stock market right now. When you talk about the level of cash positions on company balance sheets and buybacks. And there's obviously a huge argument about whether or not some of these companies should be bailed out or should be able to get relief funding because they've spent a lot of their cash flow on buybacks over the last five years, ten years. Basically. His proposal, when he walks through, is talking about increasing kind of the optionality for the Dow itself and potentially reducing the amount of fee revenue that automatically gets burned and proposing that essentially having it pools instead on the dow's balance sheet because this would give it more optionality, could sit on cash.
00:18:55.622 - 00:19:59.338, Speaker C: You could invest it, pay debts, use it for buyback things of that nature, essentially retaining kind of more earnings within the system. And he even goes on to propose that eventually that pooled fee revenue could be using other DeFi applications lent out, could increase the yield of that balance sheet. And basically the greater the surplus, the more confidence people potentially would have in the stability of the system and as it relates to or as a corollary would have more confidence in the stability of something like Dai. Right. And so he does a couple of comparisons in terms of looking at total cumulative maker revenue so far, which is just under 8 million relative to what that shortfall was based on Black Thursday, as you were mentioning. And just again outlining some potential situations in which pooling some of this fee revenue and creating basically having create a balance sheet and taking advantage of some of these surpluses, especially when times are good, would help to make it. A more resilient system when it faces really true.
00:19:59.338 - 00:20:07.520, Speaker C: I want to say call it black Swan type events, but really high risk, low probability events like we saw a couple of weeks ago.
00:20:08.530 - 00:20:23.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought it was a really well argued report and we'll see if any of the maker team finds it convincing or persuasive in any way. Well, it's been so great having you on the show and thanks for coming.
00:20:23.688 - 00:20:28.962, Speaker B: On Unconfirmed and I hope you and all your friends and family stay safe and healthy.
00:20:29.106 - 00:20:32.934, Speaker C: Really appreciate it. Thanks for having me on. Yeah, stay safe, stay healthy out there.
00:20:33.132 - 00:20:35.778, Speaker B: Don't forget, next up is the news recap.
00:20:35.954 - 00:20:38.134, Speaker A: Hey everyone, I hope you're all safe.
00:20:38.182 - 00:21:57.742, Speaker B: And healthy and I hope that when you have a choice, you are all staying at home and maybe doing internet y things like playing with digital currencies. Here are this week's top crypto headlines. First Headline binance Acquires CoinMarketCap may change business Model in the biggest acquisition in the Crypto space, Crypto Exchange Finance acquired Coin market Cap, which saw 207,000,000 visitors in the last six months. The deal, a mix of equity and the BNB Token, was valued at between 300 and $400 million. The block which broke the news also reported, quote, several employees at Finance told the block that the firm was considering a significant change in CoinMarketCap's business model, shifting away from an ad based model to a subscription model, which will charge exchanges to be included on the site. Additionally, Founder and CEO Brendan Chez is stepping down, while CSO Carolyn Chan is now acting CEO. CoinDesk had a great analysis on the acquisition with Andy Chung, former Chief operating Officer at Okx and founder of crypto derivative platform ACDX, questioning the deal due to the conflict of interest between Binance and CoinMarketCap.
00:21:57.742 - 00:23:00.342, Speaker B: He said, quote I can understand the business or potential profit, but honestly, how are you going to convince people that the rankings and volume are true when you're operating an exchange and also probably the biggest holder of BNB. Others pointed out that rival exchanges may be less willing to give CoinMarketCap data. NoMix founder and CEO Clay Collins said, quote that data is now being given to a competitor with surveillance abilities. It's unlikely that other exchanges will want to see binance aggregating and monetizing their own data. Next Headline Crypto startups struggle amidst pandemic uncertainty The Block reports that crypto startups are being affected by the broader economic slowdown. Chris Maurice, the CEO of an early stage crypto startup called Yellow Card, said quote within the past week and a half, we have three VCs that pretty much we are in final stage of due diligence with. Come back and say, look, it's not you, but we are not deploying capital within six months.
00:23:00.342 - 00:23:58.550, Speaker B: Given what just happened in the market. The timing of the coronavirus is especially significant since 2018 was the year a lot of startups got initial funding. According to PitchBook, 88% of all funding rounds from 2017 to 2019 of less than $5 million closed in 2018 and 2019 and have had no follow up rounds. One sector that's been particularly badly hit is DFI because it lacks an obvious path to profitability. Next Headline Riot Blockchain's filing shows how Coronavirus could impact bitcoin miners in a ten K filing with the SEC, Nasdaq listed Riot Blockchain said it is having difficulty mining because its workers are being quarantined. Plus, its access to mining equipment has been disrupted due to factory closures and border restrictions. On top of all that, it is categorized as a non essential business, which could make the company unable to service its miners.
00:23:58.550 - 00:24:18.254, Speaker B: Similarly, in February, Chinese mining farms had limited available staff to run miners. On a somewhat related note, Microsoft filed a patent for crypto mining based on human activity, which wouldn't that be awesome if we could just mine digital currency and not contribute to climate change and.
00:24:18.292 - 00:24:23.780, Speaker A: Do all that while we're running or swimming or dancing or doing yoga or whatever it is we like to do?
00:24:24.630 - 00:25:29.750, Speaker B: Next Headline Quest to bring bitcoin to Ethereum garners $7.7 million I think the whole Bitcoin Ethereum cultural split has outlived its usefulness, says Matt Luongo, the founder of Thesis, which is behind a trustless version of Bitcoin that is being developed for Ethereum and has raised $7.7 million from Paradigm and Finbushi Capital, among others, for that effort. While a version of Bitcoin called wrapped bitcoin does exist on Ethereum, it is custody by BitCo. CoinDesk reports that, on the other hand, quote to mint one TBTC, a user contacts the keep network, which designates a wallet for storing the bitcoin. The keys for that wallet are held in a multi SIG structure across several nodes on the keep network that have staked keep. Tokens Bloomberg writes that on Ethereum, TBTC could be used as, quote collateral to earn interest, trade using leverage or access enhanced financial privacy applications, all without having to sell their bitcoin.
00:25:29.750 - 00:26:00.478, Speaker B: Next headline the effect of zero interest rates on stablecoins CoinDesk columnist JP. Koning wrote this week that with US. Interest rates collapsing to zero, the stablecoin industry could find itself in a tough spot. He writes quote here's a quick back of the envelope calculation most stablecoins are based on the US. Dollar. At the end of July 2019, US treasury bill rates were at 2.5%, the total number of stablecoins in existence summed up to around $5 billion at that time.
00:26:00.478 - 00:27:00.370, Speaker B: Assuming the issuers invested $4 billion of their customers funds in T bills and kept $1 billion in liquid no interest accounts, that comes out to around $100 million in expected interest income at the end of July.

In the piece, he explains how it will make money not by lending, but by charging fees for services and custodying securities issued on a blockchain. Long told Forbes, quote There are eight products we've identified that Avanti will be able to offer that do not exist in the marketplace today precisely because traditional banks can't custody crypto and trust companies don't have access to the Fed directly.
