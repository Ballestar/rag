00:01:26.010 - 00:01:27.400, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:01:28.090 - 00:01:41.950, Speaker A: This is the second week in a row I'm doing a show about yield farming here on Unconfirmed because people are continuing to talk about it like crazy. So let's just start with the basics. What is yield farming?
00:01:43.250 - 00:02:42.382, Speaker D: Yield farming is something that what is yield farming? We'll start from the basics. So there are ways to borrow and lend money on ethereum. And normally when you lend money, you can earn an interest rate because the borrowers are paying for the opportunity to borrow the money from you. Recently, some of the platforms that facilitate this transaction between the borrowers and lenders have been giving people a sort of subsidy, like a cash back for both borrowing and lending. So this cash back has been so lucrative that people have been creating and changing up their strategies across multiple platforms to maximize the amount of cash back they can get. At times, this has been as lucrative as 100% 200% annualized returns on just simply lending and borrowing money. And it's been fluctuating wildly over the last couple of weeks.
00:02:42.382 - 00:02:52.660, Speaker D: And with a couple of new tokens that are being introduced to the markets, that's been adding even more opportunity for new strategies as well as more volatility in the overall space.
00:02:53.110 - 00:03:02.662, Speaker B: And so just walk us through an example. Kane Warwick of Synthetix was on the show last week and talked about how people were doing this on comp maybe.
00:03:02.796 - 00:03:04.118, Speaker A: But he kind of glossed over it.
00:03:04.124 - 00:03:08.970, Speaker B: Quickly, so you can use that as an example. Know any of these other tokens?
00:03:09.710 - 00:03:53.110, Speaker D: Sure. So compound is really where it's gotten started. On compound, you can borrow and lend a handful of cryptocurrencies, notably US dollar variants like USDT, USDC and Dai, as well as wrapped bitcoin, which is a bitcoin on ethereum, ethereum itself, and two or three altcoins, just other coins that are on ethereum. Each of these coins have their own markets. So the rate to borrow USDT is different from the rate to borrow ethereum. And that's all just based on supply and demand and the degree to which the team compound thinks those are risky assets to borrow and lend. So the curve that determines the rates varies slightly.
00:03:53.110 - 00:04:58.358, Speaker D: In normal times, people are mostly borrowing this money to get more leverage in the market. So a really popular way to use the platform before was to deposit ethereum, lend that out to get a stablecoin like Dai and then use that Dai to buy more ethereum so they have more ethereum exposure. Overall, that costs something for the borrower usually. And that rate has been somewhere between one and 10%, depending on the times what happened when what's new is that compound announced their governance token and this token is going to be used, is actually already being used today for the community to vote on changes to the parameters of the system. Things like adding new tokens, changing the curve that determines the rates, even the decision to distribute the compound token to the community itself, that was something that was done through this governance process. The way they're distributing it is splitting every day. They have just like a chunk of compound that they're distributing to all of their users.
00:04:58.358 - 00:05:38.550, Speaker D: And the way they calculate that is 50% goes to the lenders in the market and 50% goes to the borrowers. And the way they decide how much each person gets is based on how much interest they're either earning or they're receiving. So if you want to maximize the amount of this token that you get, you want to have the highest share of that interest on either side that you possibly can. So that's led to all sorts of crazy things because the compound token itself was priced by the market at a pretty high price. I think it listed, the team put it on uniswap so that there was a market for it at around, I want to say around $20. I don't know exactly what it is, but like directionally there. And then at its peak it went up to almost $400.
00:05:38.550 - 00:06:19.030, Speaker D: And for the most of that first week, it was hovering around 200. That was a lot higher than anybody expected. And so the result of that was you could borrow at really high rates, like 30% plus APY, like you're paying out that much to borrow things, but you're still positive because the value of the compound that you're earning from borrowing was so much higher than the fees that you were paying to borrow. And this is basically where the term yield farming came to be because it's not simply just borrowing and lending for a use case anymore, it's really gaming the system and rotating your crops, so to speak, to the most popular markets so that you could maximize your overall profits.
00:06:19.850 - 00:06:33.238, Speaker B: Yeah, I find it pretty nutty that people can earn money from borrowing. It doesn't sound like something that happens normally in real life. And some of the interest rates that you're talking about, it's pretty eye opening.
00:06:33.334 - 00:06:35.734, Speaker A: But I just wondered so is this sustainable?
00:06:35.782 - 00:06:48.682, Speaker B: Because in a way it's just like compound is incentivizing people to go on there and either borrow or lend, but only to get more comp, not for the actual activity.
00:06:48.746 - 00:06:49.022, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:49.076 - 00:06:51.680, Speaker B: So I'm not sure where this is going to go.
00:06:52.450 - 00:07:29.658, Speaker D: Yeah, so it's definitely not sustainable forever. The rates have to end up converging on the organic market for the borrowing and lending. So a few ways this would compress is on the supply side. You just see way more capital coming in competing for the same fixed rate of those rewards. That just means like every person, every dollar in the system gets less and less of that share which makes it less profitable for everybody overall. We already saw that like massive, massive inflows onto compound to compete for these rewards. The other way it could compress is the price of compound itself goes down and as a result the rewards in dollar terms goes down for everybody that's competing for them as well.
00:07:29.658 - 00:08:19.946, Speaker D: And both of these things have been happening and just over the long term it doesn't really make sense for it to be net positive to borrow. The real question is what is the long term value of doing these things? Because if it's just kind of shuffling chairs around on a deck it really doesn't matter. It's just like a short term arbitrage thing and I think a lot of people feel that that may be the case. That's one. And the second thing is what is the actual value of doing this? Is there any point to this other than juicing up engagement for individual platforms? And I think both those are pretty interesting conversations on the first one. I think this degree of rewards is not going to last forever because it's a bad deal for compound to be paying out this much money for the return on the engagement. Right.
00:08:19.946 - 00:09:11.370, Speaker D: They actually don't have a high incentive to just give away free money, so to speak, to the people that are most sophisticated at gaming the system. But what they actually end up want to do is they want to get a fair distribution of their coins to as many people that are most likely to be users of their platform and stewards of the direction of the platform for the long term. That's the end goal. The end goal is how do you come up with a good strategy to give control of the platform to the users who care about it most. And this is super early days for figuring this out. It's clearly imperfect, but that's the vision and this is a way to do it. Whether this is a really short term Fad or whether we're going to have to keep thinking about this for a while, it really depends on how many new projects are going to continue introducing these types of incentivized engagement things and how much the market values these subsidies.
00:09:11.370 - 00:09:38.440, Speaker D: And I think my prediction is that we're going to see a lot more of it before it starts to cool down, just because there are so many projects in DeFi that fit into this whole ecosystem where it makes sense to try to create a governance token and start to give away control to the users. There's a bit of a frenzy here for sure, but the activities are going to keep going. I think we're going to see more of this type of thing directionally, the yield being 100%, 200%, probably not.
00:09:38.890 - 00:09:59.980, Speaker B: Yeah. I wouldn't be curious to know how many different addresses now have comp and kind of what those addresses look like in terms of the other tokens they own, because I just wonder if it's sort of making the same crypto rich group richer and just sort of distributing amongst the same people.
00:10:00.910 - 00:10:02.438, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we're.
00:10:02.454 - 00:10:10.734, Speaker B: Going to discuss the potential downsides of yield farming. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Diversify has partnered with Starkware to bring.

00:11:20.170 - 00:11:22.550, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Tony Shang.
00:11:22.890 - 00:11:26.840, Speaker A: So actually, before we talk about the downsides, I did also just want to ask.
00:11:28.750 - 00:11:42.640, Speaker B: The amount that you can earn for borrowing and lending something like Tether as opposed to USDC or ETH in particular, or really any of these other coins that you can earn money from.
00:11:43.250 - 00:11:45.534, Speaker A: Why is it that Tether pays so.
00:11:45.572 - 00:11:49.150, Speaker B: Much more in compound?
00:11:50.290 - 00:12:21.814, Speaker D: It's mostly just a function of how the platform determines the rates. So tether was the first one that yield. Farmers figured out they could get the rates up very high and you can do that by just borrowing a ton of it. If you borrow a ton of it, then that means there's more demand to borrow and that increases the fee that you have to pay to borrow it. That in turn increases the fee. That the interest rate you can get for lending it. And then the balance of the supply and demand is what determines the rates.
00:12:21.814 - 00:13:10.726, Speaker D: And they have a high incentive to keep the rates high because they want the rates high because they're earning more comp and that's profitable for them. So what happened is the rates were pretty stable going into this. Once it happened, they realized tether was the market, that they could move the interest rate up highest, most quickly because there's a huge supply of tether and you can just keep dump borrowing and borrowing and borrowing. But eventually that rotated to Bat and zero X, which are less liquid coins, which they could move the interest rate up even further. So these are the type of games people are playing. It's just going to be continuously playing this game with all the folks with the most weight behind their activities. And there's never going to be a stable equilibrium here.
00:13:10.726 - 00:13:20.570, Speaker D: They're just going to be constantly shuffling things around and people trying to go move to the more profitable strategy. The more people that move there, the less profitable it gets. So they have to come up with a new one and so on and so forth.
00:13:21.070 - 00:13:36.526, Speaker B: And people are also, maybe you kind of describe this slightly, but they're basically borrowing tether and then once they borrow it, then they lend it also they're sort of leveraging. So how much leverage are people using when they yield?
00:13:36.558 - 00:14:01.242, Speaker D: Farm I don't know. On average I'd actually be really interested to see that. I think it's pretty common to do one loop of depositing something, borrowing something, using that to buy something, depositing it again, borrowing something else. You can do that until you're out of borrowing power. And I think it's pretty common to do one loop. It's probably pretty common to get up to like three or four X leverage. I think people are doing crazier things than that as well.
00:14:01.242 - 00:14:38.790, Speaker D: But I think the key here is that leverage is scary. People should be very careful with leverage. The nice thing though is in DeFi it's all transparent, so there's no scary black box where money disappears and it's way more leveraged than you think it is and everything falls apart. There could be a daisy chain of liquidations for sure. Something goes wrong somewhere and that just kind of collapses everything. Everybody gets liquidated, but we have more eyes on it and we don't have ways to borrow under collateralized, which means like if I have $1, I can't borrow ten. I need to have $10 to borrow, like, eight or something.
00:14:38.790 - 00:14:51.500, Speaker D: So those are all sort of what would you call them? Just things that put a ceiling on the degree of leverage that can be in the system right now.
00:14:51.870 - 00:15:08.800, Speaker B: All right, so let's now talk about the risks. You did a nice little Tweet storm on this, and there are at least from your Tweetstorm, kind of three main things people should be worried about or careful about. So why don't you walk us through what those are?
00:15:09.250 - 00:15:26.770, Speaker D: Sure. So the three ways you can lose your money yield, farming the three main ones, there are other ones too, but the three main ones are, a, you deposit money into an app to try to farm yield, and that money gets robbed somehow. That one's pretty easy to understand.
00:15:26.840 - 00:15:29.080, Speaker B: When you say robbed, what do you mean?
00:15:29.690 - 00:16:39.606, Speaker D: It's just somebody takes it that you don't expect that they shouldn't be able to take it. So the most common way we've seen this happen is a hacker finds a vulnerability in the smart contract where you're depositing the money and then they're able to drain the funds, run away with them, and then sell them. Another way that's been much less common is especially with more reputable projects, is that there is some secret way that the team can actually go and access the smart contract, change it, and then take the funds themselves. And third, it doesn't even have to be malicious intent. Sometimes there's just a mistake and then the funds get frozen and nobody can get them anymore or something like that. So it's really just like smart contracts are pretty difficult to build. There's a long history of vulnerabilities with smart contracts, so it should be one of the first questions you have in your mind, like, what is the risk that the smart contract fails heuristics that people can use to sort of gauge that is, how long have they been around unchanged? How many security audits have there been? How much capital has it secured over some long period of time? It sort of gives you more confidence that there are fewer risks of an unknown vulnerability.
00:16:39.606 - 00:17:03.860, Speaker D: But those risks still apply. And one way they can mitigate that now is to use smart contract insurance. Nexus Mutual and Open, I think both offer insurance on compound. I believe Nexus got tapped out completely. Like, they don't have any more capacity to insure compound just because of how much demand there is to insure it. But over time, this is going to become a more mature market. You'll be able to get coverage on anything that you want.
00:17:04.870 - 00:17:10.310, Speaker B: And there are a couple of other ways. One that we sort of hinted at earlier is people can get liquidated.
00:17:11.050 - 00:17:40.762, Speaker D: Yes, the liquidations have been happening. I'm actually curious for more numbers on this. I would love to see somebody do a report on actually how much has been liquidated from my conversations with people that run liquidation bots, it doesn't seem like it's been super crazy. Like they haven't been making money hand over fist, liquidating people. So that says something. But yeah, you can get liquidated anytime you borrow money. Like, if you borrow money, then these systems work by maintaining a ratio of collateral to your borrow.
00:17:40.762 - 00:18:20.362, Speaker D: So, like we had talked about before, I need to put down $10 to borrow $8 of something else. If my initial deposit falls below what the system requires of me, then they'll start doing things to make sure that everybody gets paid back. And usually what that is, is they sell whatever deposit you put down for what you borrowed to pay it off, and you get what's left over. That can be really painful because the exchange rates aren't always good. You usually get hit with a big penalty. And if you're chasing 100% 50% yield a year, and you've only been in the system for two days, and you get liquidated and get a 15% fee on it, you've lost a lot of money. So it's important for people to keep those risks in mind.
00:18:20.362 - 00:18:25.258, Speaker D: But these really aren't unique to yield. Farming this is just leverage is scary. People should take caution.
00:18:25.354 - 00:18:26.862, Speaker B: And is that based on the US.
00:18:26.916 - 00:18:28.400, Speaker C: Dollar value of the.
00:18:34.290 - 00:18:45.026, Speaker D: Sorry, it is the US dollar, but more specifically, it's the exchange rate between what you deposit and what you borrow. So if that exchange rate deviates too.
00:18:45.048 - 00:18:53.014, Speaker B: Much so if you put in Tether sorry. If you put down ETH and then borrow Bat or something exactly.
00:18:53.132 - 00:18:53.558, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:53.644 - 00:19:00.406, Speaker D: It still kind of reduces to the USD price for both of them. But just like, technically, it's the exchange rate between the two.
00:19:00.508 - 00:19:01.158, Speaker A: Okay.
00:19:01.324 - 00:19:09.546, Speaker B: And the last way that people can lose their money is that the value in the asset itself can get robbed, which was very interesting. Can you describe what that one is?
00:19:09.728 - 00:20:04.786, Speaker D: Yeah, this isn't one that people have to think about too much outside of crypto. In crypto, we have a lot of assets that are either synthetically created or they are like fiat coins. Or you take something in the real world, you lock it up and you issue a token and say, hey, this thing has claims on this much of this other thing. And so the simplest way to think about this is through USDT or USDC, which are both US dollar fiat coins. Here people are depositing US dollars into some bank account, and then the system mints ethereum version of that dollar, and you can trade that around. That's what USDT and USDC are. There's been a ton of controversy over USDT in particular, because people are worried that they're under collateralized that they only have there have been accusations that they're only like 85 or 87% collateralized, and actually they had admitted that that was the case, and then they took on to fill the gap.
00:20:04.786 - 00:20:38.762, Speaker D: They had promises of future dollars or something like that to make it 100% anyways, not something I've really spent a lot of time on. But the worry is if it's not 100% backed, then your US dollar ethereum coin actually isn't worth one dollars. It's worth whatever ratio it is. And actually it should be a discount to that because you can't trust them to report the truth anymore. So you could see it go all the way down to zero because everybody just doesn't want it anymore. Why this matters is like say you've taken out a loan in USDT, something like this happens. The value of your loan drops sharply even though you thought that it was dollars borrowing dollars.
00:20:38.762 - 00:21:10.690, Speaker D: So the risk was low. You're liquidated, you lose a bunch of money, everything sucks. That's like the really toy example of it. There are other ways, especially with the synthetic ones. There are more complex ways that your perceived value of the thing is actually not matched with the actual value of it. In fact, smart contract vulnerabilities could be a reason why something that should be pegged to a dollar ends up falling off that peg.
00:21:11.910 - 00:21:29.506, Speaker B: All right, well, we've been talking about I don't know if I even want to call them benefits because I get worried a little bit that people will think that this is just easy money. But then obviously there are the risks.
00:21:29.538 - 00:21:31.578, Speaker A: And so I just wonder overall, what.
00:21:31.584 - 00:21:50.190, Speaker B: Do you think the significance is of yield farming for both DeFi and the crypto space? Is this kind of just a flash in the pan and it'll die out because it's unsustainable, sort of like the ICO craze? Or do you think that this will be some kind of fundamental building block of crypto that we're seeing being formed?
00:21:51.010 - 00:22:24.518, Speaker D: I think it'll become more subtle. I think it'll stick around, but it won't be as like people won't self identify as a yield farmer. They might for a while. ICO era lasted. I mean, people think it was a flash in the pan, but it lasted a while even after the craziness. Like people filling a $30 million ICO in one block on a PowerPoint deck that went away pretty fast. But raising funds to capitalize a project with tokens people are still doing it right, but we just don't think of it as the ICO crew.
00:22:24.518 - 00:23:26.574, Speaker D: So I think it may be a similar analogy there. But what is important to, I think a useful analogy that I haven't heard too much yet is this is a subsidy to the overall market that's just going to get baked into the economics of the market. Just like VC, subsidizing consumer goods startups give you cheaper prices on food delivery, like ride sharing, buying mattresses, stuff like that, eventually the bottom can fall out. But who loses it's? The companies, the investors, et cetera, because the unit economics weren't good. At the end of the day, you still need the organic demand to be high enough to justify the existence of a thing. But what's new about this is you're taking that model of subsidizing the marketplace to bootstrap the marketplace, period, which is proven to be a winning strategy in a marketplace business if done correctly and successfully. And then you're adding community ownership to these things.
00:23:26.574 - 00:24:15.114, Speaker D: So it'd be like instead of getting a few percent off of your grocery delivery, it's every time you're delivering goods or you're buying your groceries, you're getting a little piece of instacart, a lot of quibbles here on the equivalence of equity versus these tokens and stuff like that. I'm not going to get into that. But that's the vision. The vision is as we're bootstrapping these things, as we're in these early phases, you're going to be subsidizing people for taking on early risk, doing things that are kind of new and unproven and maybe they won't work out. At the end of the day, they're going to be rewarded by being the stewards of these platforms. So if everything works out, we're going to shake off this mania pretty quickly. Then it'll just be like there are some extra incentives in the market to go and use these things that are unproven, don't have as much real world utility yet, and eventually get to a state where some of these things are super valuable.

If you've been watching this yield farming trend, wondering what exactly is going on, check out a recent post by Dan Elitzer of IDEO Colab Ventures called Aquaponic Yield Farming. He says, quote, Lending and exchange protocols, particularly ones that utilize pooled liquidity and automated market makers are naturally symbiotic. Lending protocols like Compound and Ave want large quantities of assets to be deposited in their liquidity pools to maximize loan availability while minimizing borrowing costs. Exchange protocols like Uniswap and Balancer want large quantities of assets to be deposited in their liquidity pools to maximize the potential size and volume of trades, while minimizing slippage.
00:26:28.194 - 00:26:29.839, Speaker B: They don't care whether the assets in.
00:26:29.839 - 00:27:34.858, Speaker A: Their pools are receipts for loan collateral, so long as there is sufficient unutilized liquidity in the lending pool to enable withdrawals as needed. Then he describes how people are earning from lending, using that money to yield from trading, and then making more money available for lending. Next Headline What effect do coinbase listings have on listed assets? CoinMetrics did a detailed analysis of how coinbase listings have impacted the prices of the listed crypto assets. Unsurprisingly prices tended to immediately rise after the announcement, but the size of the increase does vary based on whether it's a bull or bear market. For instance, before its December 2018 announcement, most assets listed were dropping in price. Afterward, the asset saw price rebounds of, on average, 50% against bitcoin in August 2019. Bitcoin had just hit highs that July, but it started to trend down for assets announced then there was an immediate bump of 10%, but by 100 days out, many of the prices had dropped.
00:27:34.858 - 00:28:24.202, Speaker A: And finally, for new assets announced in June 2020, the listing announcement was made as asset prices were trending upward after the selloff in March. Afterward, asset prices continued to rise. CoinMetrics warns that the 132% pop that Omise Go saw after its listing announcement is an outlier, and the mean and median values for appreciation against USD bitcoin and ETH are usually between negative 1% and 14%.
