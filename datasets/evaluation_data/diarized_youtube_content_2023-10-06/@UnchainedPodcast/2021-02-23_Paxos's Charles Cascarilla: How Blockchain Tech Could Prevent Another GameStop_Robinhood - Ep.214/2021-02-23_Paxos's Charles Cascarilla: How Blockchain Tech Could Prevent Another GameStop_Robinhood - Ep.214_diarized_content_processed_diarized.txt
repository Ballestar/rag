00:00:59.730 - 00:01:04.618, Speaker A: Today's guest is Chad Cascarilla, CEO and co founder of Paxos. Welcome, Chad.
00:01:04.714 - 00:01:05.954, Speaker C: Hi, great to be on here.
00:01:05.992 - 00:01:14.446, Speaker A: Laura, you got started in bitcoin super early. Why don't you tell us your background before bitcoin and then also how you got into bitcoin.
00:01:14.478 - 00:01:49.920, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So background is really almost entirely in financial services. And I started working at Goldman Sachs and bank of America, really covering financial services companies from the sell side. And then I went to the buy side and was an investor. And then I started my own asset manager in 2005 with a co founder, Emil Woods. And that specialized just investing in financial services companies. And we came across bitcoin after going through the financial crisis and getting a lot of things right about it and saw bitcoin at three or four cents and was immediately intrigued by the technology.
00:01:49.920 - 00:02:04.542, Speaker C: Certainly would never imagine we'd be at high 40,000 price of bitcoin here, which is obviously really exciting for everybody. But we really thought the technology could be transformative, not just bitcoin. And that got us to start Paxos.
00:02:04.686 - 00:02:06.338, Speaker D: About seven years ago now.
00:02:06.504 - 00:02:14.614, Speaker A: And so I've also heard you say that what you saw in the financial crisis got you interested in bitcoin. So why don't you connect the dots for us there?
00:02:14.732 - 00:03:15.194, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think some of the key themes that we captured as investors was how the electronification of markets changed price discovery. It changed how you traded in a really fundamental way and you went from basically being on the floor to microseconds in about ten years, huge amounts of innovation. And in that same time you basically went from t plus five to t plus three settlement. So almost nothing changed in the middle and back office, but everything changed in the front end. And so when we came across bitcoin and blockchain, we immediately recognized a possible way to solve those problems in a new way and in a way that could really fix the infrastructure and the plumbing, which very desperately needs it. And we've seen that in Lehman brothers, we've seen it with GameStop, and frankly, we're going to see in the next financial crisis if we haven't upgraded that. The plumbing is actually really exacerbating the crises and in certain cases actually creating them.
00:03:15.194 - 00:03:39.758, Speaker C: And bitcoin and blockchain offer pass forward because you're getting real time movements of assets, not real lags in them. And so coming out of the financial cris, when we saw this technology, we immediately thought, here is a way to know who owns what when, and that's not possible in today's financial system. I know that kind of shocks everybody, but you don't really know who owns what when. I mean, it's a fairly basic concept.
00:03:39.854 - 00:03:42.418, Speaker D: But financial markets were set up from.
00:03:42.424 - 00:03:45.026, Speaker C: An infrastructural standpoint to promote liquidity and.
00:03:45.048 - 00:03:47.958, Speaker D: Trading, not to promote clear ownership and.
00:03:47.964 - 00:04:01.546, Speaker C: Chain of title because of lots of weights of history going back 50 years. And that's what really fascinated us about this technology, is that we could see a way to change fundamentally how the financial system would operate and to make.
00:04:01.568 - 00:04:02.998, Speaker D: It fairer and safer.
00:04:03.174 - 00:04:44.422, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're going to tie together a lot of the strands that you just mentioned on, plus some new ones, because there are so many things going on right now in the markets that I think really make everything that you just discussed kind of illustrate the importance of all that. But one other thing that I wanted to ask you about was in the early days, as you mentioned, you got that New York State Trust Company charter and you received it in May 2015, but you started the process of trying to get it in 2012. I think I once heard you say it was May 2012. So can you describe what it was like working in the bitcoin industry at that time and compare it to the bitcoin industry right now?
00:04:44.556 - 00:04:52.166, Speaker C: Well, I don't know. It's like we were wandering in the desert. It felt like in some sense, if you go back to 2012, there wasn't even ethereum.
00:04:52.358 - 00:04:55.706, Speaker D: So we really were believing that this.
00:04:55.728 - 00:05:05.120, Speaker C: Could fundamentally alter the financial system in a profound way from very early days when it was really, in some sense.
00:05:05.490 - 00:05:08.320, Speaker D: A bit crack pottery to believe that.
00:05:09.810 - 00:05:54.298, Speaker C: And catching things early is really exciting because you can see how things evolve and it really evolved a lot. I mean, it was a very early community, very, I would say cyberpunky. It was really not hugely financially literate in a sophisticated sense. It was really much more about being technologically literate. There's so many exciting things when you're that early to see something evolve into what it is now. And it's gone through a number of different stages from really the absolute cutting edge, like kind of cyberpunks and hard libertarians and people who are really deeply into cryptography, into decentralization.
00:05:54.394 - 00:05:56.830, Speaker D: It was such a new field back then.
00:05:56.980 - 00:06:45.870, Speaker C: And I'm not a technologist, so I definitely enjoyed talking with them, but I was completely out of my depth because I don't know those things on a native basis. And I remember after about five clicks, you would be through all of the information about Bitcoin. When you first started, you had like, the white paper, you had three websites and you had one chat board and that was about it. And to now get to the point where the torrent of interest and the many, many different types of communities that are evolving so rapidly you can't even keep up with it. It's bewildering almost and that's awesome to see because the reason we got involved so early was because we thought it could get this big. And that wasn't obvious, but it was something we really believed had the potential.
00:06:46.850 - 00:06:47.310, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:06:47.380 - 00:06:55.562, Speaker A: And I was just trying to think back. I think the price around then was am I right? That it was either in the single digits or the low double digits?
00:06:55.626 - 00:07:10.966, Speaker C: That sounds definitely right. I think it was probably somewhere around $10 or $20. When we started wanting to work on the Trust, it was really kind of surprising how much the price started to move in very unusual ways and the.
00:07:10.988 - 00:07:14.182, Speaker D: Technology itself was less of a focus.
00:07:14.236 - 00:07:40.622, Speaker C: And so you went through a number of these stages where it would be about the technology or be about Bitcoin, or be about the technology or be about Bitcoin. And so at that time, it really was still a lot about Bitcoin starting to move up. And so when we were applying for the Trust, a lot of people were like, why are you so focused on this Bitcoin thing? It seems like it's just for money launderers or for the dark web. We kept trying to point out that.
00:07:40.676 - 00:07:44.946, Speaker D: Actually the technology and Bitcoin, while they.
00:07:44.968 - 00:08:16.154, Speaker C: Might be separate, are allowing the same thing, which is more financial freedom and more financial access, and that they're going to play a common part together. And it just wasn't so obvious for people who are familiar with financial markets that Bitcoin could make sense and then people who are really familiar with technology said, oh, yes, I understand Bitcoin, but I don't understand how the plumbing works and why this technology could be so fundamental. And that's what we've actually bridged at Paxos for so long, is on one.
00:08:16.192 - 00:08:19.466, Speaker D: Sense, traditional markets and the problems they.
00:08:19.488 - 00:08:33.374, Speaker C: Have and what this technology can solve, versus the insurgent nature of Bitcoin, which we also believed in in terms of how it can really fundamentally alter a lot of the financial services market as well. So there's so much to go on.
00:08:33.412 - 00:08:34.640, Speaker D: Between both of them.
00:08:35.270 - 00:09:25.458, Speaker A: Yeah. Something that's really interesting is I'm pretty sure that right around that time that you started that process of trying to get the Trust charter is right around when Brian Armstrong of Coinbase was starting his Y Combinator program. And so it's just interesting. So Paxos and Coinbase, I think, kind of got their start roughly around the same. Yeah. And I think what's also so fascinating is that with your traditional financial services background goldman and everything, that you saw the potential and could see where this was going at a time when I just feel like a lot of people with your background really did not. Because I feel like 2012 era was when you started seeing more of the entrepreneurs like the Wences Casaris's of the world kind of start to get into it.
00:09:25.458 - 00:09:31.250, Speaker A: Although he did actually convince some people on Wall Street.
00:09:32.230 - 00:10:00.154, Speaker C: And I would also say what really fascinated us was because I had spent so long as an investor there's lots of different ways to invest but one of the fundamental ways we invested was being contrarians which is trying to find non consensus ways of looking at problems and what could be very huge optionality out of them. So we looked for that a number of different times in our career. I think we caught some of them, some of them we were wrong on because you're never going to be right.
00:10:00.192 - 00:10:00.890, Speaker D: On all of those.
00:10:00.960 - 00:10:31.846, Speaker C: But we caught a number of them investing in exchanges and clearing corpse when they're really trading below the value of the buildings that they were housed in then they suddenly are trading at 15 times revenues. Huge opportunity. We were short subprime mortgages and commercial real estate mortgages then we were long distressed mortgages coming out of the crisis. We had a number of other positions. Those are some of the more notable ones. And then coming across bitcoin at three or four cents and kind of really having fun with it and looking at the technology, but constantly trying to think.
00:10:31.868 - 00:10:34.246, Speaker D: Of what is the problem and what.
00:10:34.268 - 00:10:43.740, Speaker C: Is the best way to potentially have real upside in that problem being solved. That's what really kind of lent us.
00:10:44.350 - 00:10:47.834, Speaker D: To understanding this opportunity, but also why.
00:10:47.872 - 00:11:23.622, Speaker C: It was actually important for us to be in financial services in order to see that if we hadn't gone through the crisis, if we hadn't seen the problem and the plumbing of the system. If we hadn't understood all of those things, I think it would have been really hard for us to get it. And because we lived there, which is still different than most people on Wall Street, living in those types of areas of the markets, it made us really understand, I think on a native basis, what the problem was and why this was able to solve it and have conviction around it, to continue to hold it and not just be like, oh, it's hit 200, it's time to sell. Or It's hit 1000, it's time to sell.
00:11:23.676 - 00:11:28.230, Speaker D: Because otherwise you would, I think from our backgrounds, right?
00:11:28.380 - 00:12:21.866, Speaker A: No, for sure. I feel like the more tradery type of people tend to not have that conviction and want to sell when they think the price is high. So one other thing that I wanted to ask about, just because you do have such a long history in this space. And I feel like during that time, you were kind of gathering all these different elements that have now come together to form what we think of as paxos, which obviously, probably is most well known for its relationship with, you know, before that you had, which obviously you still do. But it's definitely one of the smaller exchanges. Were there times when you and obviously, I think we discussed this the last time you were on my other show, Unconfirmed, where we were talking about how in 2015, when you did get the Trust charter. I recognized that that was significant, but I sort of still didn't understand exactly why how it was going to be used.
00:12:21.866 - 00:12:48.430, Speaker A: I couldn't really see where things were going or what was going to be created. And so I kind of want to hear about your journey over that seven year time period where you were building paxos and maybe you tried certain things. And did you kind of always know where you were going to end up? Which right now I think you're kind of more in this b to b play or earlier, were you trying other things? And then did you feel like you tried to pivot?
00:12:48.510 - 00:12:52.238, Speaker C: Well, I think there's a number of components to that. When you're in the early adopter stage.
00:12:52.334 - 00:12:55.346, Speaker D: Which I think is clear way of.
00:12:55.368 - 00:13:29.774, Speaker C: Describing where the market was five or six or seven years ago, and real early adopter, no adopter stage right at that point, and you could tell the whole community in one reddit room or one email thread. And so when you're in that stage, you kind of need to have the AOL strategy. I describe it as which you need to do everything from soup to nuts, from the front end all the way to the back end. It's a small world, and the only way you can capture value is by doing a lot of different things, because your customers need all those things done.
00:13:29.812 - 00:13:31.838, Speaker D: But there's nowhere else for them to go get it.
00:13:32.004 - 00:13:52.678, Speaker C: And that AOL strategy makes a lot of sense. And if you're going to end up in a mainstream adoption point, the AOL strategy starts to make less and less sense and it becomes much more about specialization over time and enabling a wider swath of users and businesses. B to B, B to B to C. And it's not just around having the entire stack yourself.
00:13:52.844 - 00:13:55.046, Speaker D: Because we had this belief that this.
00:13:55.068 - 00:14:02.614, Speaker C: Technology could fundamentally change financial services, we thought about what types of strategies, what types of businesses can be very valuable.
00:14:02.662 - 00:14:07.354, Speaker D: And very important when you get to a more mature state, and what should.
00:14:07.392 - 00:14:10.778, Speaker C: We start to build in order for that to happen? Now, I would have never imagined it.
00:14:10.784 - 00:14:12.666, Speaker D: Was going to take what in some.
00:14:12.688 - 00:14:35.766, Speaker C: Sense seems like a short period of time, but in some sense feels like a long period of time, which is seven, eight years, nine years, whatever it is, to get to this really fantastic moment that the space is having now. I thought it would have happened maybe three years ago where we'd get to something that looked more like this and I guess things always take longer than you think and then they happen faster than you thought. I think that's the saying. And so that happened for us. And so when, when we built the.
00:14:35.788 - 00:14:38.482, Speaker D: Business, it was always with the intention.
00:14:38.546 - 00:14:49.554, Speaker C: Of let's be for many different types of institutions that want to eventually come in on a turnkey basis and be able to access crypto, be able to access tokenized assets.
00:14:49.682 - 00:14:51.706, Speaker D: Because I still believe that this is.
00:14:51.728 - 00:15:41.254, Speaker C: About a lot more than Bitcoin. It's hugely important element is bitcoin, but just the power of replatforming the financial system onto a blockchain is beyond transformative across the board in so many different ways and we can talk about that. And building that in the early days definitely felt like we were wandering in some sense through the desert because we weren't building a B to C platform and that was mainly who the earliest adopters were and then it was mainly for traders trading with those early adopter retail. And that's still very much still almost retail in some sense. And here we are not building a retail platform. But I think that over the horizon viewpoint of where things were going to go is what is really paying off for us right now because we've made sure we kept our business, I think a lot more focused on that infrastructural layer. And so the point of IPID, our.
00:15:41.292 - 00:15:44.138, Speaker D: Exchange was this is for institutions to.
00:15:44.144 - 00:16:12.082, Speaker C: Be able to use who are holding their assets, want it to be a safe liquidity pool, want it to be a safe place to be able to execute. But of course that only has so much utility if you don't have lots of retail players in there now you can go acquire those retail players or you could go acquire businesses that have retail players. And so that's the point here is add firms like PayPal, add firms like Revolute, and a whole number of other firms where they want to power their.
00:16:12.136 - 00:16:15.346, Speaker D: End user experiences and have a safe.
00:16:15.378 - 00:16:24.246, Speaker C: Reliable, compliant turnkey solution. And you can't get that anywhere else because there wasn't maybe an obvious thing.
00:16:24.268 - 00:16:27.670, Speaker D: To build when you're in the early adopter stages.
00:16:28.330 - 00:16:59.042, Speaker A: It's interesting also because I could imagine and you tell me if I'm wrong but it sort of seems like when you're trying to make that type of sales pitch, what happens is that maybe getting the first kind of big client would take a while, but that once that happens, then there would be kind of like a flood of them. Do you know what I mean? It's just like whoever wants to be first, like nobody wants to be first, but then once somebody goes and everybody's like we all have to catch up. So am I right? That that's kind of how those conversations went.
00:16:59.096 - 00:17:01.742, Speaker C: Well, there's some elements of these firms.
00:17:01.806 - 00:17:05.186, Speaker D: Just really coming into a space that.
00:17:05.368 - 00:17:07.734, Speaker C: They have to be careful about that.
00:17:07.852 - 00:17:09.702, Speaker D: Has a little bit of a risk to it.
00:17:09.836 - 00:18:05.800, Speaker C: People fear the reputational risk or they fear just doing something new, fear being first. Lots of regulation. And so all of those things certainly I think, held back this mainstream phase a little bit more than we would have thought. And so I think all of those are contributing factors and not just to them coming to Paxos, but to them coming into the space in general. And so really playing that through with our strategy of we're going to focus on creating turnkey solutions for these types of businesses, banks, brokers, payment companies, technology firms, remittance companies. I think that's now really clear that that was the right way to approach things. But it felt again like, hey, why didn't you just go out and acquire millions of retail customers? And I think that is just the nature of shifting from early adopter to mainstream, having the right moment in time.
00:18:05.800 - 00:18:17.114, Speaker C: And we were able to get there because we had the right investors, I think we had the right vision. All of us really believed in where this was going to go over time, even when it was not obvious.
00:18:17.312 - 00:18:37.378, Speaker A: Yeah, it is so similar to your initial contrarian bets in the traditional financial services space in the markets where you could kind of see that something was going to happen, but you just needed to wait long enough for it to happen. Which I know that can be a challenge, but obviously it paid off for you.
00:18:37.464 - 00:19:12.746, Speaker C: In investing, there's a saying there's no difference between being early and being wrong. And that's because you have to be able to have the position, you have to be able to continue to make it. And there are so many firms in crypto and in general where that time just was too hard, or maybe they focused too much on just the blockchain technology. Private blockchains being such a huge fad for a moment in time. Not that it's gone away, but there was a huge moment where everyone was just about it's only about private blockchains. About private blockchains, not public blockchains. You could get really deterred and pulled away.
00:19:12.746 - 00:19:21.390, Speaker C: So lots of chapters in this book when you kind of drill in and it kind of looks smooth when you zoom out, but it definitely has been a wild ride.
00:19:21.970 - 00:20:15.550, Speaker A: Yeah, you've kind of actually straddled the two trends pretty well, especially given that one of them hasn't really panned out in the same way that the hype kind of seemed to indicate it would back in 2015, 2016. So speaking of the PayPal relationship, I did ask on Twitter what I should ask you, and a number of people wanted to know this. So PayPal empowers corporations to provide a crypto experience for their customers so they can buy, sell and hold crypto. It also does enable those customers or not, but your customers, the firms to send and receive crypto. And so I know obviously you don't represent PayPal, but can you give us insight into why PayPal users cannot withdraw the crypto that they purchase know directly to their own wallets or to other crypto?
00:20:16.290 - 00:21:05.550, Speaker C: You know, I think there's a couple components to this. The first is I think everyone should appreciate PayPal. Coming to space is probably the biggest thing that's happened to the space notwithstanding Elon Musk and Tesla creating some huge hoopla around it, at the end of the day that's 300 million consumers that PayPal either has enabled or will plan to enable. They're rolling this out over time, including International and Venmo. And so there's a lot that PayPal is doing here and just getting that into place was a big deal for them. They've never had a possibility of owning something aside from dollars, holding something aside from dollars in their app. So this is a big deal and I think them making the commitment, which is very big to the crypto space and decentralized finance space is just an important moment for all of us.
00:21:05.550 - 00:21:26.358, Speaker C: And if you go and read their two page press release, they've laid out what are some really expansive goals that they want to achieve over the next twelve to 24 months. Now I don't think that I can tell you exactly what their plans are, but I would say that this was just the first step. This is let's get going. You can't launch everything on day one.
00:21:26.444 - 00:21:27.574, Speaker D: And so they have a lot more.
00:21:27.612 - 00:21:59.922, Speaker C: Plans and when those actually come out we'll see. But I don't think this was as far as they want to go. This was how do we get going and launch something as fast as we can and build on that. And so if you approach it from that perspective, I think it looks less know you're buying crypto, but you don't really own it to it's. More like I now have access to crypto in a way I never did. Before, and there's going to be a lot more coming down the pike, and that's going to be really great. If you're a PayPal customer.
00:21:59.922 - 00:22:13.062, Speaker C: And of course PayPal and Paxos, we're sitting here trying our best to make sure they have as much functionality as they want to be able to offer to their customers. And I think you're going to see a lot more exciting things from them in pretty short order.
00:22:13.196 - 00:22:43.370, Speaker A: So my theory around why people can't send the crypto directly to their own wallet or other crypto addresses is because when you're switching from a service that runs on the traditional financial rails where you can claw back funds, if you need to. And then you're moving to a system where you cannot claw back funds if you need to. This creates an opportunity for fraudsters. And so they maybe need to kind of up their fraud protection. Is that a good theory.
00:22:43.450 - 00:23:10.282, Speaker C: Well I think this is an important component and by the way we saw this with the rules out of treasury. They're thinking about different ways of being able to track movements of funds to non customer wallets in blockchain and crypto. So there know clearly like a compliance component to making sure that you understand what's going on when funds leave your platform, whether it's Paxos or Coinbase or so. But again, I think I would really.
00:23:10.336 - 00:23:13.082, Speaker D: Focus on wow, this is a huge.
00:23:13.136 - 00:23:19.980, Speaker C: Effort for PayPal to get to where they're at and this is about adding in functionality over.
00:23:20.750 - 00:23:24.274, Speaker A: So are you working with PayPal on adding those functionality?
00:23:24.342 - 00:23:54.294, Speaker C: Well, I can't really speak for PayPal here, but I would say that we're clearly excited to be an infrastructure provider for them. And as they continue to roll out more services, I think we're going to be there with them in a lot of ways. And I know that people really want as much as you can possibly have today, but sometimes you got to be patient and I think you'll see some really good things out of what Paxos is doing and what a PayPal is going to do in the next twelve months.
00:23:54.492 - 00:24:07.110, Speaker A: And I also noticed in the PayPal Q four earnings call that CEO Daniel Schulman said that PayPal will be creating a new business unit dedicated to crypto. I wondered what does that mean for Paxis's partnership with PayPal?
00:24:07.190 - 00:24:56.698, Speaker C: Well firstly I think that gets to the point we were just making before, which is they're putting a lot of resources behind this. They have a group that's just focused on it, we work with them all the time. It's great to see them now have more dedicated resources in that know, at the end of the day Paxos is an infrastructure provider. We're not going to be the only infrastructure that PayPal relies on. I think it'd be probably nutty if they only use Know, given the size that they are, it would just make sense that they're going to do things themselves, they're going to use other providers. But on the other hand there are just a number of things that we can uniquely enable and not just now, but over what they want to do over the next several years. And so we're going to be there I think as a really important partner for them and we're excited to be that best possible partner for them and others too.
00:24:56.698 - 00:25:29.766, Speaker C: There's just so many players now who are saying wow, PayPal blazed the path, they're doing it, why can't we do it? A lot of people are saying oh man, look what's going on, we have to get off our hands and get in the game and they're trying to figure out a way to do it and here we are as Paxos purely dedicated to that. We're not going to compete with anybody. We're here to help you, we're here to do it fast, we're here to do it in the most trustworthy way that you could possibly. You know, we're really thankful for the.
00:25:29.788 - 00:25:31.702, Speaker D: Partnership we've had with PayPal so far.
00:25:31.836 - 00:25:57.038, Speaker A: And shortly before recording this show, you were the final speaker at the bitcoin for corporations event held by MicroStrategy. And your parting message to the audience was that bitcoin as a reserve asset for corporations would be a trend in the future, or pretty much has arrived and they should not be the last to get in, but to be early. And I was know it's only been a few days, but what kind of interest has paxo seen since that event?
00:25:57.124 - 00:26:27.154, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's really another exciting moment here in bitcoin. It's just chapters and sometimes they're unpredictable. I wouldn't have imagined that late 2020 and early 2021 was going to be about corporate treasury adoption of crypto. Honestly, I would have never imagined that. On the other hand, it's very exciting to see because like I was mentioning at that conference, MicroStrategy, which was so exciting to be a part of because it's opening up all kinds of new vistas here. People are seeing this as a reserve.
00:26:27.202 - 00:26:29.782, Speaker D: Asset and a monetary network.
00:26:29.926 - 00:26:56.514, Speaker C: And in some ways it's like gold was before we went off the gold standard, I think. And that's what digital gold allows, is now a capacity to hold something where you can participate in a monetary network in the future. And so you get involved. You own some now. It's still a small market cap overall versus where it can be. There's a lot of tailwinds. They're not going to stop printing money anytime soon.
00:26:56.514 - 00:27:06.622, Speaker C: We have another $1.9 trillion stimulus bill coming through. I was looking at the amount of government spending as a percentage GDP. We're just about where we were during world war II.
00:27:06.766 - 00:27:07.874, Speaker D: And that's crazy, right?
00:27:07.912 - 00:27:40.554, Speaker C: This is where we're at world war II. I mean, COVID is like a real crisis, but this is not world war II crisis. And so we're printing money and spending it at a pace we've never, ever seen before. And with that type of tailwind, unfortunate as it might be for the value of the dollar, it's very fortunate for the value of bitcoin and its emergence as a monetary network that can be used in the future as a means to connect everybody on a global basis. And it's exciting to see corporations want to be a part of that because that really is mainstream adoption.
00:27:40.602 - 00:27:43.806, Speaker D: I mean, that is as mainstream as it then.
00:27:43.908 - 00:27:52.478, Speaker A: I mean, this obviously is just a few days after that event, but also with the tesla news. Did that create any extra spike?
00:27:52.574 - 00:28:23.326, Speaker C: Well, it's definitely created even more interest. I mean, you have MicroStrategy, which was almost like a revival in some ways around how fantastic bitcoin and the bitcoin monetary network can be for society on a broad basis. I think Stephen ross did an awesome job of explaining that when he was talking. With Michael saylor. But also now you have who the richest man in the world. He has a huge platform. He's put some real dollars behind it.
00:28:23.326 - 00:28:43.042, Speaker C: A billion and a half dollars is not a small amount. Clearly, he's thought about this. It's a public company. And that, I think, starts to really open up this possibility for a lot of other companies. Someone's got to go first. People need air cover. People need someone to be able to point to and say, someone else could do it.
00:28:43.042 - 00:29:06.266, Speaker C: Why can't we do it? And he's been the first in a lot of things, from electric cars to trying to go to Mars. And so why wouldn't it make sense for him to be one of the first to own what could be really the new monetary asset? And I think everyone's going to look at that and say, well, he's been really prescient. We should take a really hard look at this. And that's definitely what we're seeing.
00:29:06.448 - 00:29:21.694, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk about all kinds of other current events that involve this technology, such as the GameStop Robinhood situation. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. There's a lot to think about when.

00:30:32.956 - 00:30:48.058, Speaker A: Now back to my conversation with Chad Cascarilla. So, let's also talk about some other current affairs that touch on all these issues we've been discussing. How would you characterize the main issues that occurred with the situation?
00:30:48.224 - 00:30:50.960, Speaker C: Well, I think this is.
00:30:53.010 - 00:30:53.758, Speaker D: A really.
00:30:53.844 - 00:31:03.514, Speaker C: Important warning sign for all of us in financial markets, and I wrote a blog post about this. And my point is, Lehman Brothers GameStop.
00:31:03.562 - 00:31:05.854, Speaker D: And the Next financial crisis all have.
00:31:05.892 - 00:31:19.682, Speaker C: Something in common, which is that if we're relying and continue to rely on the infrastructure we have, it's inevitable that you're going to see more of this. And the real problem is in financial markets. We built them 50 years ago because.
00:31:19.736 - 00:31:22.082, Speaker D: We were switching from paper to electronic.
00:31:22.226 - 00:31:26.774, Speaker C: There was a lot of good reasons why you had to get out of paper and get onto electronic, but you.
00:31:26.812 - 00:31:31.238, Speaker D: Gave up something when you did it. So when your paper you're sitting here.
00:31:31.244 - 00:32:00.206, Speaker C: Having to settle trades, giving a paper certificate and getting dollars for it, you're actually moving the real asset. That certificate is the ownership of IBM. And if I give it to you, Laura, you own the IBM shares. That's a bearer asset. And when you happen is you try to electronify that, it's not easy to do. It's really hard to use the right technology 50 years ago to make sure that there's an electronic certificate that's moving from myself directly to you specifically. And so they put everything into a giant pool.
00:32:00.398 - 00:32:01.678, Speaker D: And so this is what people don't.
00:32:01.694 - 00:32:32.186, Speaker C: Really understand, is that actually all the shares of all stocks in the country sit in a giant pool at the DDC. And it's actually held in a street name called CD Co. No one's even heard of it. But they hold all of the stocks in the entire US. Are basically sitting there unless you withdraw them into your name, which some people know. Certain preppers and conspiracy theorists are like, I want to own my own stock. And rightfully so, because what happened we saw in Lema Brothers is that you can't let someone fail because everything is, in a sense, mutually owned together.
00:32:32.186 - 00:33:06.134, Speaker C: And so everything becomes too big to fail because it's all sitting in a giant pool. And so 50 years ago, that made sense because you needed to solve this problem of paper to create more liquidity, because they were having to shut the stock market every Wednesday and limit hours. You just couldn't keep up with the amount of trading. So they're like, okay, let's start DTC, and put everything in a big pool account. The problem is, 50 years have gone by and we've completely outgrown that mode of doing things. It's running on cobalt mainframes from the 70s. It's taking two days to settle, which doesn't make any sense.
00:33:06.134 - 00:33:45.390, Speaker C: You can order toilet paper to your house faster than you can settle a share of stock. That doesn't make why does that make sense? So all of these things are a real problem, and you basically get something like GameStop, and it really underscores it. I mean, we haven't even had a real crisis, in essence. And the plumbing came unglued. You know, we almost had it with COVID we almost had it with GameStop where things almost locked up. And if we don't rearchitect the system in the right way, we're going to have this again. And it's shocking that we're using the equivalent of Latin cobalt mainframes to manage things when we could now be using technology like blockchain.
00:33:45.390 - 00:34:20.670, Speaker C: And you could be actually tracking each share, moving through the system, and know the end owner at all times. And that gets back to, what does a blockchain do? It says, who owns what when? So that's the backdrop to this GameStop issue. And so what happened is you have 140% of the share short. Everyone's like, well, why does that happen? And they think, oh, maybe it's the Reddit Army or maybe it's hedge funds, or maybe it's the broker dealers who's the problem here. And actually the problem is the infrastructure, because everything's sitting in a pooled account. You can't tell where the shares are. So I'll give an example really simple here.
00:34:20.670 - 00:34:27.738, Speaker C: So I buy a share. I take that share and I lend it to you. You take that share that you've borrowed.
00:34:27.754 - 00:34:31.346, Speaker D: From me and you sell it, and then someone else buys it, and then.
00:34:31.368 - 00:34:37.314, Speaker C: They can lend it out again. And the same share keeps getting lent out again and again. And there's nothing nefarious per se happening.
00:34:37.432 - 00:34:39.166, Speaker D: Except for the fact that we don't.
00:34:39.198 - 00:34:40.626, Speaker C: Have a way of being able to track the shares.
00:34:40.658 - 00:34:43.798, Speaker D: They keep moving through the system. And so now you end up with.
00:34:43.804 - 00:34:48.098, Speaker C: 140% of the shares short. And then the next problem is you're.
00:34:48.114 - 00:34:51.306, Speaker D: Settling in two days. Why are you settling in two days?
00:34:51.328 - 00:34:57.770, Speaker C: I mean, it doesn't make sense, but you are. And so between the day you trade the share and the day you settle.
00:34:58.190 - 00:35:00.122, Speaker D: Well, someone guarantees it.
00:35:00.256 - 00:35:03.702, Speaker C: And all trades are actually guaranteed by the DTC.
00:35:03.846 - 00:35:07.374, Speaker D: Now, they've never used this guarantee fund in 50 years.
00:35:07.412 - 00:35:17.154, Speaker C: It didn't use it in the 87 crash, didn't use it during the Asian cris or the.com bubble or when Lehman Brothers failed. It's never been used before. But what they do is they make.
00:35:17.192 - 00:35:20.450, Speaker D: Huge capital calls right at the moment.
00:35:20.520 - 00:35:23.010, Speaker C: When everyone needs their own capital.
00:35:23.430 - 00:35:28.194, Speaker D: So they normally have $7 billion of capital in the fund. I can tell you I know three.
00:35:28.232 - 00:35:45.610, Speaker C: Brokers, including Robin Hood, where there's over $7 billion of capital calls that were made just from three brokers. I mean, there are tens of billions of dollars, most likely, of capital calls that were being made right at the moment when all those brokers need money. So they're actually drawing in all this capital and making more systemic risk because.
00:35:45.680 - 00:35:47.078, Speaker D: It'S too big to fail.
00:35:47.254 - 00:36:16.226, Speaker C: And so why do you have a too big to fail intermediary sitting in the middle? Well, because 50 years ago, we decided that was the best way we could do things, and it was, but now it isn't. You could be moving the shares around in near real time, maybe same day you could start at, and that would really collapse all of the risk of your fear that someone would fail. And so you need a guarantee. And so taking from T zero to T two to settle is a big problem. And then here's another nuance, which people won't believe. On the day of settlement, all the.
00:36:16.248 - 00:36:19.880, Speaker D: Shares and all the cash go in. They only come out at the end of the day.
00:36:20.410 - 00:36:23.618, Speaker C: In between, there's a lien on it from the DTC.
00:36:23.794 - 00:36:25.574, Speaker D: So you have a guarantee that's happening.
00:36:25.612 - 00:36:29.274, Speaker C: For two days, and then on settlement day, you have all this cash and.
00:36:29.312 - 00:36:30.678, Speaker D: Shares that are trapped.
00:36:30.854 - 00:37:04.066, Speaker C: Crazy that you would do this and really an anachronism that it's still done this way. And so you can imagine now GameStop is just a small example of how this could unravel. Too much shares are short because the technology is old and can't track it. It takes a long time for there to be settlement. It takes a long time for there to be a trade guarantee. You have a too big to fail intermediary in the middle and suddenly things really just become the plumbing just gums it all up.
00:37:04.248 - 00:37:55.220, Speaker A: I think just from a pure narrative perspective, what I also love about this story about how all of this kind of nasty and outdated underbelly of finance got exposed was it was from a really crass and vulgar subreddit where some of the people had names like Deep Effing Value and YouTube personalities like the name Roaring Kitty. And then on the other hand, a lot of it was driven by anger at a firm that came out with a little note about why GameStop stock would go. And it was like a famed short seller. And so when you put all that together and then you just see how this house of cards tipped over just from all that.
00:37:55.590 - 00:38:23.142, Speaker C: To me, it was kindling just there dry kindling. And it's because the plumbing just doesn't exist. And there is a much better way to do this. And you could have a system where actually you free up capital and have more safety and more fairness. You would know where all the shares are that are short. You can track everything. You can shrink settlement times, and that can open up access and it can allow there to be a lot more people participating in the markets.
00:38:23.142 - 00:38:59.742, Speaker C: So I think it's like, in some sense, it feels mundane. Oh, wow, it's the plumbing. That doesn't sound like somebody that you want to turn into a bad guy. The plumbing is the bad guy. But it really, in this case, is something that's actually holding back the whole financial system because everywhere you go, whether it's payments, equities, corporate bonds, the whole thing is all 19th century sewer systems like in New York City. And it just looks fine and a storm comes and it doesn't even have to be a bad one. This is just like a simple summer thunderstorm and the street started to flood.
00:38:59.742 - 00:39:02.780, Speaker C: Just wait. If we had another superstorm come through.
00:39:03.390 - 00:39:10.406, Speaker A: It's really funny you made that analogy because I wrote my grad school master's thesis on that issue on sewer systems.
00:39:10.438 - 00:39:11.260, Speaker D: That's amazing.
00:39:12.350 - 00:39:55.302, Speaker A: Well, yeah, kind of. It's like it was about environmental, et cetera, et cetera. But anyway, okay, so Paxos has built something that kind of maybe could be the beginnings of the kind of solution that you were describing in the fall of 2019. You announced that Paxos had received a no action letter from the SEC to settle stock trades on a blockchain based platform in near real time. And that is something that really could threaten the dominance of DTC, as you mentioned. So can you describe for me what your private permissioned blockchain, the Pexos Settlement Service looks like and what problems it solves and whether it could actually resolve the issues we saw with Robinhood and GameStop?
00:39:55.366 - 00:39:55.690, Speaker D: Yes.
00:39:55.760 - 00:39:59.926, Speaker C: So we're really proud. We have a no action letter from the SEC to settle Tokenized equities.
00:39:59.958 - 00:40:04.826, Speaker D: We're the only firm that has that now. The no action letter limits us in.
00:40:04.848 - 00:40:18.306, Speaker C: Terms of number of stocks and amount of volume. So we're doing it in a handful of stocks and a certain amount of volume. I think we've done 1.7 million trades now since last February when we started. We got approved to begin what is.
00:40:18.328 - 00:40:20.114, Speaker A: The number of institutions on it.
00:40:20.152 - 00:41:02.046, Speaker C: So right now it's Sockgen, Credit Suisse and Instinet. Nomora, we have another participant that will be joining shortly and another one that signed on. So we know another couple that are coming on and then we have some more that are really engaging with us. And certainly the GameStop News has accelerated interest in how people can move settlement and how they can really remove these impediments to their business. This is now a real focus because it's become, in some sense, an existential issue for many firms. And that's good because you want to address this when you can, not when you have to, and when you have to. Being a crisis, it'd be a real problem.
00:41:02.046 - 00:41:12.850, Speaker C: So now is a good moment. Times are still good. It's not going to be a different type of issue, like if you had a Lehman Brothers again. And so we've started with those firms.
00:41:13.270 - 00:41:15.060, Speaker D: This is really working well.
00:41:15.510 - 00:41:48.846, Speaker C: We're applying for a clearing agency registration license, which is fairly rarefied piece of infrastructure. There's two that are really functioning right now, the DTC and the Options Clearing Corp. The OCC. We would be the third. We'd be the second one that's settling equities trades with the DTC and ourselves being those two. And that would allow us to really start to do unlimited volume in a whole variety, almost unlimited Qsips here. And so I think we've been working on this application now for years, believe it or not.
00:41:48.846 - 00:42:35.646, Speaker C: So I think we're very close to being able to submit it and go through public comment and get approved. Hopefully we're optimistic in the middle part of this year, certainly, I think the latest news, I think, underscores the need for this. And so we're really excited to get this thing going. And believe it or not, only ten firms are 80% of the US equities market. So I know it's like you think the equities market seems like it's a lot of players, but actually it starts to really narrow down in terms of who is actually trading with who? One broker. Trading with a broker, 80% is ten brokers. And so I think we can be at five, six, eight when we launch, which gets us most of the way there, and we'll continue to add more.
00:42:35.646 - 00:42:40.826, Speaker C: And what the advantage of this is, you can settle in any time frame you want. You can know exactly how many shares.
00:42:40.858 - 00:42:43.966, Speaker D: Are short, you can track it, where it's moving.
00:42:44.148 - 00:42:51.954, Speaker C: You can be in a position where you have much lower expenses. We cut 70% of the expenses out. Since you're settling potentially on the same.
00:42:51.992 - 00:42:53.874, Speaker D: Day that you do the trade, you.
00:42:53.912 - 00:43:10.742, Speaker C: Actually be able to release capital while being safer, because most of the capital is tied up because you're afraid someone might fail over two days from when you do the trade. Now imagine if you're actually settling on the same day. This is like real big improvement. And potentially you could even do intraday.
00:43:10.886 - 00:43:12.346, Speaker D: Like every couple of hours.
00:43:12.528 - 00:43:49.766, Speaker C: You could settle up all the trades really make a big, big difference in terms of allowing there to be more access, allowing there to be more safety and fairness in the markets, and there'll be transparency for the regulators to see what risks are building up every single day in real time. Whereas right now you don't have that. And instead you have a too big to fail intermediary that's facing every single trade in the market. And that's how the DTC operates. So we're really excited about what we have. This is modern technology using blockchain tokenizing shares. And I think the key shift is paper allowed you going from paper to.
00:43:49.868 - 00:43:52.754, Speaker D: Digital allowed you to create more liquidity.
00:43:52.882 - 00:44:06.230, Speaker C: Going from digital to token allows you to keep that liquidity, but to also have chain of ownership so you really know who's owning the shares at all time. And that actually creates safer and fairer markets.
00:44:06.390 - 00:44:19.002, Speaker A: And famously, a lot of blockchains have issues with throughput when you compare them to legacy systems. So for the Paxo settlement service, what is the current number of transactions per second it can handle?
00:44:19.066 - 00:44:45.206, Speaker C: So this is a good point. And there's a couple of components to this clearly blockchains can't handle in real time. So what I would call real time gross settlement, every time there's a trade, you settle. Blockchains could not handle that level of volume. It's just very hard to do because you're potentially trading in microseconds and then you have to settle and resettle. And that would be very cumbersome to do. You don't need to settle that fast, even if you want to trade that quickly.
00:44:45.206 - 00:45:19.602, Speaker C: And so you can set up a system where you're settling every couple of hours. So the trades come through, you're batching them, you could net the trades down, and then you settled out. And then you continue on for the next period and you could pick whatever settlement time period you want. And that actually is something a blockchain can do very reliably. That does not stress them. Now, you could not put that on a public blockchain. Also, to be clear, initially, I think you have trouble because regulators want to make sure they understand who's securing the network, and that's harder to understand in a public blockchain at the moment.
00:45:19.602 - 00:45:33.734, Speaker C: People are becoming more and more comfortable with it. But also the throughput on Ethereum, for instance, is 17 transactions per second. That wouldn't be able to handle even batched settlements in the equities markets because you have about 120,000,000 settlements a day.
00:45:33.932 - 00:45:35.318, Speaker D: On the other hand, being able to.
00:45:35.324 - 00:45:37.126, Speaker C: Do 120 settlements at the end of.
00:45:37.148 - 00:45:39.574, Speaker D: A trading day over, say, the course.
00:45:39.612 - 00:46:09.460, Speaker C: Of 30 minutes or 45 minutes is really not that complicated. Maybe 20 years it was, or 30 years ago it was. That was probably a confounding problem 30 years ago, but now it's not. The advances in hardware and the advances in software mean that you can actually manage that type of volume relatively in a straightforward way. So I think you have to think about what exactly problem do you want to solve? Do you want real time growth settlement? That technology for blockchain is not going to do that right now. Maybe it will in the future.
00:46:09.830 - 00:46:10.818, Speaker D: If you want to be able to.
00:46:10.824 - 00:46:11.794, Speaker C: Settle at the end of the day.
00:46:11.832 - 00:46:13.906, Speaker D: Or in batches and be able to.
00:46:13.928 - 00:46:19.960, Speaker C: Handle even all the amount of settlements in the market, that is completely achievable with today's technology.
00:46:20.730 - 00:47:08.958, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, batching maybe at the end of the day would still introduce some of the risk that we were discussing with Robin Hood and GameStop. But if you did it multiple times throughout the day, it could mitigate that. And one other thing, so just so I understand, with all the companies whose stocks then trade on the Paxo settlement service, all the shares are now digitized and only tradable there, and then all the shares for that company then are transparent in the trading, and all of them is transparent. And so if any of them were to become the new darling of Wall Street bets, then we wouldn't see the same kind of issues that we saw with GameStop. Is that the theory?
00:47:09.054 - 00:47:54.734, Speaker C: So there's two components to what you said, just to unpack it a little bit. Even if you settled, by the way, at the end of the day of T zero, you'd still be fairly safe versus intraday batches, because what happens is you see the risks building up all day long, and you could have limits, and you could say, oh, okay, you've hit a limit. You need to pay down the level of risk that you have, and so you'd have transparency on all of your counterparty risks in real time. And that means if something got out of whack, you don't have to wait to the end of the day. You could do it earlier. So even if you said normal processes, end of day during exceptional times you'd be able to address it earlier. So I think that that's the component here is creating flexibility so that you can reduce risk when it's appropriate.
00:47:54.734 - 00:48:29.498, Speaker C: You don't have to necessarily force it at all times. And then the next component is we're backward compatible. We have a full DTC participant account when we hopefully, knock on wood here, receive our clearing agency license. It's a mandate that we are backward compatible into the DTC. And so that means that when shares trade, if the two participants are Paxos customers, the shares will settle at Paxos. If one of them is, it can settle at the DTC. And if none of them are, it would definitely settle at the DTC.
00:48:29.498 - 00:49:05.226, Speaker C: And so that means that shares can move over into the Paxos environment and get tokenized. And if they need to go back into the old environment, they can't. So there's some moment of time where we're backward compatible into the old environment. And that allows somebody and doesn't create a requirement that every single person switch over to Paxos. But I suspect what will happen is you're going to get a certain amount that come through and then you hit a tipping point. And that's when you start to get all kinds of additional benefits around, tracking every single share at all times. Because if it goes back into the old environment, you can't track it.
00:49:05.226 - 00:49:07.462, Speaker C: We can only track stuff that stays on Paxos.
00:49:07.606 - 00:49:08.202, Speaker D: Oh, wow.
00:49:08.256 - 00:49:27.714, Speaker A: Okay. That's really interesting. Yeah, so maybe you're right that there might be kind of like a messy period where it's sort of in and out, kind of somewhat transparent and somewhat not transparent. And then at a certain point, there probably would be a tipping point when it's just obviously superior and everybody moves that way.
00:49:27.832 - 00:50:01.254, Speaker C: And the advantage to that is we wanted to make it backward compatible so that it made it really easy for participants. Because ultimately you have to think about how do you get people to adopt this? Well, you get them to adopt it because it costs less. It's solving operational problems. It's safer, it's fair. It allows them to mobilize their assets in a different way. But also part of that is how do we solve your operational problems? Means we can't create new operational problems. So if you have two places that don't talk to each other, that would be a real difficulty.
00:50:01.254 - 00:50:16.386, Speaker C: And so we deliberately set up where that wouldn't be the case. And that just means that benefits will scale over time. We're not going to port the whole market over tomorrow. But if your broker spent all of their time in the Paxos environment, you.
00:50:16.408 - 00:50:18.674, Speaker D: Would be able to track all the know.
00:50:18.712 - 00:50:25.746, Speaker C: So if someone spend, I only want to settle on Paxos, you can only trade me. If you're settled on Paxos, you'd be.
00:50:25.768 - 00:50:27.238, Speaker D: Able to see that.
00:50:27.324 - 00:50:30.726, Speaker C: So this comes down to partly know how do you want to get the.
00:50:30.748 - 00:50:33.574, Speaker D: Benefits and when all right.
00:50:33.612 - 00:50:44.342, Speaker A: And for the SEC Clearing Agency registration, when you get that, that's the registration that will enable you to move on from stocks to other types of assets.
00:50:44.406 - 00:51:39.082, Speaker C: Well, it allow us to move on from stocks in a no action letter so that we can then operate really in all stocks and in unrestricted volume, but also, by the way, it can allow us to do a lot more than stocks, bonds, et cetera, other things. So there's so much opportunity here because the stock market alone is 45 or $50 trillion of assets. The single largest asset class in the world is US. Equities. You can imagine getting the point where that's tokenized is a huge step forward in basically replatforming the financial system and creating a much safer, a much more dynamic way of being able to allow companies to raise capital and for participants to be active in the equity markets. It's a huge deal to get that to go because then it becomes a lot easier to get subsequent asset classes. Most participants will already be on if you got the US.
00:51:39.082 - 00:51:55.620, Speaker C: Equities market to go. And that's part of our point of let's do the US. Equities markets because it's very liquid, it needs it, it's a big problem, and it'll then be the product journey to get the whole rest of the asset class moving on this journey, too.
00:51:56.470 - 00:52:17.426, Speaker A: Part of your journey to tokenize other assets has started with a tokenized gold product that you guys offer. And I was wondering why was that one of your choices for a different type of real world asset that you would offer? And how do you plan to move on from securities and from the one gold offering?
00:52:17.538 - 00:52:41.742, Speaker C: Yeah, so we're really excited about where the gold product is. It's grown a lot in the last year. It's gone from maybe 15 million of Tokenized gold to about 100 and almost $30 million of Tokenized gold. And so it's growing quite a bit. Gold was a very logical asset to start Tokenize, firstly, because it is a bearer asset, but you can't own it in a bearer asset way.
00:52:41.796 - 00:52:44.286, Speaker D: In the digital world, people have been.
00:52:44.308 - 00:53:23.394, Speaker C: Owning gold by owning an ETF for a future. And so this is a problem. How do you get bearer assets that are physical to operate like bearer assets in a digital way and not just be an account based asset, but be a token based asset? And so, in the case of gold, first of all, it's been money before. People want to be able to use it like money. In many places, it's still the foremost store of value, even though Bitcoin is clearly showing so much promise. And there's $10 trillion of gold in the world, and gold is mainly traded around and moved. It's not consumed.
00:53:23.394 - 00:53:46.626, Speaker C: So you wouldn't want to go do iron ore. You basically pull iron ore out of the ground and then you consume it. So there's not as much need to tokenize it as it would be for something that's highly tradable us. Equities is an example, gold is an example. I think we're going to definitely do other types of assets. Silver, platinum and palladium are logical other ones to do. They trade, not nearly as much as gold.
00:53:46.626 - 00:54:07.354, Speaker C: And there's a lot of other things to add besides equities. There's bonds, there's private company shares, which is something we'll be doing shortly. And you kind of go on from there, real estate collectibles. But there's an adoption curve in my mind around how assets become tokenized. And that adoption curve is driven by.
00:54:07.392 - 00:54:11.994, Speaker D: What are the benefits that you get by being tokenized.
00:54:12.122 - 00:54:16.174, Speaker C: And so there's really kind of three ish benefits as I think about it.
00:54:16.212 - 00:54:20.414, Speaker D: One is it just saves you money.
00:54:20.532 - 00:54:40.070, Speaker C: And it might save you capital, it might save you expenses some way. It's saving you money by going from what is either a digital account based asset or a physical asset into a tokenized asset. The other benefit you get is liquidity.
00:54:40.490 - 00:54:42.246, Speaker D: And liquidity means that you've now made.
00:54:42.268 - 00:55:00.860, Speaker C: The asset easier to move around and trade. And so that can be a significant benefit because a lot of times there's frictional costs when you're trying to move assets around. And then the last benefit is access. When you create a digitized version of the asset on a public blockchain, it's open access.
00:55:01.550 - 00:55:02.474, Speaker D: Now you have to have the right.
00:55:02.512 - 00:55:08.106, Speaker C: Controls in place from a compliance perspective, but it's open access. You can really create an ability for someone to have assets that they couldn't.
00:55:08.138 - 00:55:11.150, Speaker D: Before, example being dollars.
00:55:11.220 - 00:55:46.266, Speaker C: An example could be gold. Now some people get scared about open access because they think, oh my God, it's going to go to money launderers and terrorists. Now of course there's some risk with that. But on the other hand, you also get the capacity to create universal ability to access financial assets, which is really hard for people. There's so many people who don't have bank accounts or don't have ability to access and participate in the financial system. And so access is a really key thing. And maybe you could say the fourth thing is it allows there to be more innovation because you can now program assets and change them around and do different things with them.
00:55:46.266 - 00:55:55.326, Speaker C: That's the advantage of basically going tokenized. And so if that's the benefit, you want to think which assets get the.
00:55:55.348 - 00:55:58.570, Speaker D: Most benefits from going this route?
00:55:58.730 - 00:56:31.426, Speaker C: And that's where you want to start. And so obviously, crypto is a new asset class and that's pulling people in. It's pulled dollars in and you needed to have dollars in there because it helps to create all kinds of operational savings to have money moving 24 hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year. There's lower expenses. You have freed up capital because the money is moving fast. You don't have it just sitting there moving slowly through the banking. System over many days, and then you have an ability to program it and create more accessibility.
00:56:31.426 - 00:56:33.786, Speaker C: People can hold dollars without a bank account.
00:56:33.968 - 00:56:35.142, Speaker D: That's a huge benefit.
00:56:35.206 - 00:56:52.590, Speaker C: Cash is a logical thing to get pulled in. It got pulled in by crypto, but it can be now used in buying goods and services and eventually for wholesale asset settlements. So dollars the next thing. And then you say, oh, gold could make sense and equities can make sense. When do you get to real estate? That's probably a little bit later, in my opinion.
00:56:52.930 - 00:57:05.918, Speaker A: Quickly, before we move to stable coins, which you were just mentioning, I did want to ask earlier, when you said collectibles, did you mean physical collectibles? And if so, like, what? Art or coins or stamps or I didn't even know what you meant.
00:57:05.934 - 00:57:14.630, Speaker C: It could be any of those. There's examples of cars, art. I know of a number of projects that are working on art, like digital or physical art.
00:57:14.780 - 00:57:15.574, Speaker D: Physical art.
00:57:15.612 - 00:57:24.298, Speaker C: And so let me give you an example of one that could be interesting as well. There's a lot of museums that are having troubles and tough times now. Well, what they could do is sell.
00:57:24.384 - 00:57:27.258, Speaker D: Some of their collection, maybe pieces of.
00:57:27.264 - 00:57:31.654, Speaker C: It, to people who can own some of it. But the museum continues to be the depository.
00:57:31.702 - 00:57:32.826, Speaker D: They hold it.
00:57:33.008 - 00:57:55.970, Speaker C: People can go see it. But you can now raise money where you could sell fractions of pieces of art. Like, that's one example of something that you could do with art. Another one could be that you just use it for whole pieces of artwork. You want to trade fractions of it or whole pieces. How do you make sure you track the provenance of artwork? It's an enormous problem, and it's an enormous asset class. And so art is an example.
00:57:55.970 - 00:58:19.354, Speaker C: We've seen people try and do collectible cars. I think there's really no end to the way you could use the blockchain to track who owns what when. But what you need to do is figure out some of the operational and logistical hurdles to it, to have it make sense, to do it at what time. And so you're going to see more of it. Real estate is another example. People's houses. Imagine if you could track the mortgage title moving through the house.
00:58:19.354 - 00:58:35.966, Speaker C: You never have to use title insurance again. You kind of go on and on. There's so many exciting things to do. There's $600 trillion of assets in the world. How do you start with a problem that big? There's going to be lots of nuance when you get into individual assets and individual countries.
00:58:36.158 - 00:59:07.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I could imagine custody would be a big question for things like physical art and stuff, but okay, let's move on to the stablecoin question, because you did talk about, obviously, how stablecoins have become a big part of the crypto ecosystem. But I just wondered. I know it is one of your business lines, you have your own stablecoin and you also provide the back end for other providers to have their own stablecoins. How do the different stablecoin providers compete with each other?
00:59:08.270 - 00:59:51.926, Speaker C: They're ultimately competing on a number of different propositions. One is what is the utility of this coin? What can I do with it, can I go buy things with it on different exchanges? Can I go make a loan? Could I borrow in it, can I just hold my money in it? Is it available in lots of different types of wallets? So there are some that are much more widely usable than others. USDC tether PAX BUSD husdr coins. I think we have three of the top five dollar stablecoins and they're very accessible and very usable. And that distinguishes it from some smaller stablecoins where they might not be available on lots of different types of wallets or on lots of different exchanges.
00:59:52.118 - 01:00:00.186, Speaker D: So that's one thing that distinguishes the next thing is, well, what's the regulatory oversight? And I think particularly for Paxos, we.
01:00:00.208 - 01:00:55.674, Speaker C: Have a primary regulator, which is the New York Department of Financial Services that oversees our stablecoins. And that's different from anyone else's. So Tether has no regulator, USDC doesn't have a primary regulator. They have money transmission licenses, but they don't have a primary regulator that oversees it. We actually have both us as a trust company has a primary regulator and our products have a primary regulator. And that's exactly what if you looked at what Faffa guidance, the FATF, or you look at treasury guidance and others, they really talk about, you should have a primary regulator that oversees it because otherwise you open yourself up to all kinds of possible misuse of it. And so we're, I think, really tried to always make sure in everything we do at Paxos that we're looking at what the regulators are saying, making sure that we're following best practice because we're not just trying to hamstring ourselves.
01:00:55.674 - 01:00:59.466, Speaker C: We're doing this because ultimately how do you get to mainstream adoption?
01:00:59.658 - 01:01:00.986, Speaker D: You're never going to get to mainstream.
01:01:01.018 - 01:01:42.718, Speaker C: Adoption without a primary regulator overseeing the coin. Banks aren't going to accept it. I don't think corporations are going to accept it. They're going to want to use something that they can trust. And part of that trust is having someone else who's overseeing it. That's what you always have in financial services because you can get to issues where an issuer without a primary regulator overseeing it could very well be faking the assets that are backing the token. And of course you can use auditors and other people to help, but some are unaudited and unregulated and that could start to create systemic risks and maybe consumers wouldn't realize it or less sophisticated users wouldn't realize it.
01:01:42.718 - 01:01:45.920, Speaker C: And that's what we're proud of, how we separate ourselves from others.
01:01:46.690 - 01:02:09.540, Speaker A: And so it sounds like you're talking about Tether primarily, which is unregulated. And what was the other thing unbacked unregulated and unbacked or unaudited. Rather, we don't know if it's unbacked. There are a lot of allegations about that, although now, recently there's news that a loan that Tether gave out to Bitfinex has now been paid back.
01:02:10.470 - 01:02:31.990, Speaker C: Well, that's what I was going to say is we do know it's unbacked, actually. So they actually said we're unbacked, meaning they said we have a loan. Yes, and they have Bitcoin and other things. If you look at the terms and service, it doesn't say it's backed just by dollars sitting in a bank account. If you look at the Bahamian Banks, they have like maybe $700 million in all the Bahamian Banks, but the primary.
01:02:32.070 - 01:02:35.014, Speaker D: Tether bank is supposedly in the Bahamas.
01:02:35.062 - 01:02:45.906, Speaker C: Where is the $25 billion sitting? Everyone would like to know the answer to that. No one knows, but they have said that they're not fully backed one for one with dollars. And that may be fine, but that.
01:02:45.928 - 01:02:48.578, Speaker D: Means it's not a dollar stablecoin, right?
01:02:48.744 - 01:03:39.714, Speaker A: Although I did have Gregory Peppin, I think was his name, the deputy CEO at Deltech who said that that 700 million dollar figure for the Bahamian Banks was some portion of the assets, like just the Bahamian dollar reserves or something like that, and that US. Dollar reserves should not be counted in that. I think that was his explanation. I'm going to have to link to this in the show notes because I don't remember the exact specifics, but he did have an explanation. But something that was interesting was you discussed this with Frank Chaparro on the Scoop podcast back in September 2019, and you were talking about Tether. And at that time you said this is the best it's ever going to be for them because it's unregulated and institutions won't touch it. And hello, at that time, Tether was about 3.5
01:03:39.714 - 01:03:53.798, Speaker A: billion and now it was ballooned to 28.5 billion. So do you believe that now is the best it will ever be for Tether? And just in general, how do you think this whole thing with the kind of regulated, unregulated stable coins is going to play out?
01:03:53.964 - 01:04:03.594, Speaker C: Well, I'd say maybe two or three things here. First, yes, I still think this is the best it's ever going to be. And what I meant by that is it's never going to get used outside.
01:04:03.632 - 01:04:06.122, Speaker D: Of the crypto ecosystem, right?
01:04:06.176 - 01:04:47.122, Speaker C: So it's never going to get mainstream adoption, and so maybe it grows to $50 billion, but it's only going to happen because people in the crypto space are using it, not because I can tell you. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I would be shocked if Tesla or MicroStrategy goes, oh, I'm going to start using tether to move dollars around. But I don't think that it'll be shocking for Tesla or MicroStrategy to move tokenized dollars around. They're just not going to move Tether dollars around. And so when you think about there's $60 trillion of m two in the world is tether going to be the number $1 stablecoin. In a world where you get to huge amounts of tokenized dollars. No shot.
01:04:47.122 - 01:05:00.714, Speaker C: It's impossible. It's unbacked. They've already told us. We'll see what happens with the New York Attorney General. I just think it's very unlikely that you could be unregulated, unbacked and unaudited. We can throw an extra on there.
01:05:00.752 - 01:05:03.978, Speaker A: I don't think we know enough to say whether or not it's unbacked.
01:05:04.074 - 01:05:13.470, Speaker C: But clearly I thought that they went on a podcast and clearly we yes, and in terms of service, say it may not be backed. If you go on the tether website.
01:05:13.540 - 01:05:15.742, Speaker D: It says it's not fully backed.
01:05:15.886 - 01:05:20.318, Speaker A: Yeah, well, or that it holds a mix of other assets, including Bitcoin, that's.
01:05:20.334 - 01:05:27.410, Speaker C: Not being dollar backed. So maybe we could say it be more precise and say it's not fully US. Dollar backed.
01:05:27.770 - 01:05:30.966, Speaker D: There's other assets that are backing it. Right.
01:05:31.068 - 01:05:48.940, Speaker C: I mean, that's a big deal. You're supposed to be a dollar stablecoin. You're really not. Then you're a security. Actually, you're a security when you start to have other assets in there that aren't short term US. Dollars in there. I know because we spent a lot of time examining know, we'll see, obviously what happens here over time, but.
01:05:50.990 - 01:05:51.306, Speaker D: I.
01:05:51.328 - 01:05:52.800, Speaker C: Think they're whistling past the.
01:05:54.530 - 01:06:25.378, Speaker A: Mean it could be a security. Yeah, no, it is interesting to see how this is going to play out. And also I think something that fascinates me too, about this is that a huge percentage of tether usage comes from Asia. So in the end it may be fine for um but yeah, here in the US. Things may go in a different direction. All right, so I have so many questions about regulation. Obviously, we talked about how Paxos initiated the process to obtain that New York trust charter even before the Bit license existed.
01:06:25.378 - 01:06:36.250, Speaker A: If it had existed at that time that you started that process, would you opt for that? Know, what do you think of kind of going the trust charter route versus the Bit license?
01:06:36.830 - 01:07:13.670, Speaker C: Well, for us, it's just crucial to have been a trust company. And that's why we did it. In the very beginning, we thought about getting a money transmission license and there was conversations about what a Bit license might look like. And for us, getting the trust license made all the sense of the world because we wanted to be infrastructure. And it'd be very hard to be infrastructure if you just have a Bit license. It'd be very hard to have a primary regulator that oversees the tokens that we've issued, our gold tokens, our dollar tokens, additional tokens that we launch in the future without having the trust. And so to me, it's a linchpin of our strategy.
01:07:13.670 - 01:08:08.482, Speaker C: Getting it meant that we were going to operate a little bit more slowly than firms that were just using money transmission licenses or the Bit license because they could operate in other states in a much different way than we could as a trust. But again, it kind of goes back to our strategy of did you want to be the early adopter winner or do you want to be the mainstream adoption winner? Do you want to be infrastructure for the B to B and the B to B to C players when this goes into being about billions of users? Or did you want to get the scale at 40 or 50 million users? And so we just tried to have that long term viewpoint from the very beginning and it really was an over the horizon viewpoint, like our conversation earlier. But it's one that I think is really clearly bearing fruit now and has put us in a different place with all of these firms that are now coming in and looking for turnkey solutions.
01:08:08.626 - 01:08:53.254, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see how this plays out over the long term. Because obviously if we go back to that comparison point about how Coinbase started around the same time and it has gone that route with the money transmission licenses. I just think in general, operating from California versus New York, which has had these pretty onerous regulations, coinbase, now in January they did $117,000,000,000 of volume. Itbit saw a little over 2 billion. So I understand that now you're going after a different route, but Coinbase clearly has been successful. They're going to IPO. It's going to be what looks to be a successful absolutely.
01:08:53.372 - 01:09:03.610, Speaker C: I think Coinbase is like it's been fantastic. I mean, they have huge retail user base in that way. It's where I'd say the money transmission licensing route makes a lot of sense.
01:09:03.680 - 01:09:07.766, Speaker D: Because you can acquire the retail consumers.
01:09:07.878 - 01:09:27.860, Speaker C: For them, it's about the service that you're offering. And then when you look at institutions, they're expecting just a different level of oversight. And so that meant that in the early adopter phase, you're going to be moving slower, but in the mainstream phase, you're in a different position. So it's not bad or good. It's just a different thing.
01:09:28.310 - 01:09:53.306, Speaker A: Right, well, so your firm has been so buttoned up when it comes to compliance and regulation and so it seems like you have a pretty pragmatic approach to it. And yet I do imagine that you maybe have thoughts about how regulation in the US. Could be improved, particularly since you do operate in other jurisdictions. So what would be on your regulatory wish list for US. Regulators? And we can talk both federal and.
01:09:53.328 - 01:09:56.282, Speaker D: State, you know, they kind of interplay together.
01:09:56.336 - 01:10:19.074, Speaker C: There's just an alphabet soup of different regulators kind of across the board. The treasury and different departments within the treasury and then the OCC and Finsen and that's part of Treasury, CFTC, SEC. You look at all the different state regulators, it's almost bewildering in some sense, I think there are some simple things.
01:10:19.112 - 01:10:21.538, Speaker D: That could be done, which is states.
01:10:21.624 - 01:11:05.182, Speaker C: Coming up with a way of being able to create reciprocity. If you hit certain benchmarks with other states. Right now, the only way to get explicit reciprocity is essentially you have FDIC insurance. That's the most green line way of getting, so to speak, full reciprocity across states or having a federal oversight. And of course that would be becoming either a federal bank or federal trust. And so I think it's important for there to be some competition amongst regulators because you can be innovative, then we want competition in the markets, we want competition everywhere. And you want to be able to have different places where people can try different things.
01:11:05.182 - 01:11:37.894, Speaker C: So I think that's valuable. But on the other hand, you can have too much competition and then you don't get reciprocity and it becomes really hard to move around. So I don't think you should have one regulator, but I also don't think that having a lack of reciprocity works either. That would be one easy way to solve things. Of course there's also something I didn't mention, which is the Federal Reserve is also another regulator. So the Fed, the OCC, this SEC, the CFT, now they're doing different things, but even the IRS is a regulator. And so where does this come into play? It gets a little confusing.
01:11:37.894 - 01:11:47.498, Speaker C: The IRS says Bitcoin is property treasury and Fincend is saying this is a monetary instrument. How you're being treated for tax reasons is different from how you're being treated for regulatory reasons.
01:11:47.594 - 01:11:48.462, Speaker D: That is a problem.
01:11:48.516 - 01:11:53.998, Speaker C: I think there needs to be some way of creating some clear understanding of.
01:11:54.004 - 01:11:57.730, Speaker D: What an asset is amongst these different regulators.
01:11:58.230 - 01:12:33.646, Speaker C: And sometimes it might blur the line, but like for instance, Bitcoin doesn't feel like we're blurring the line here. There should be a common way, but there isn't. And so there has to be a common way of saying let's look at an asset class or look at a token, let's have some of these federal regulators come together who might be overseeing it. Is a security, is it a derivative, is it property? And being able to have a common viewpoint that would actually really promote without having to make any kind of adjustments to all these different regulatory umbrellas that would actually have a really clear way of giving entrepreneurs an understanding. And then the last thing I would.
01:12:33.668 - 01:12:41.866, Speaker D: Say is regulation tends to be one size fits all. And that is really difficult because businesses.
01:12:41.898 - 01:12:43.470, Speaker C: Aren'T one size fits all.
01:12:43.620 - 01:12:46.046, Speaker D: If you have to carry the burdens.
01:12:46.238 - 01:13:31.594, Speaker C: Of being a fully regulated entity, but say you only have a million or $2 million in revenues, you're not really taking a risk based approach to what applies. When can you be in a sandbox? When can you have a period of time to get up to speed? We'll give you a grace period of one year, two years, or revenue threshold when you need to get to someplace could really help entrepreneurs a lot. And that's necessarily good for Paxos, because we've already done all this but I think it's good public policy, which is how do we allow there to be more innovation and more competition. I think that's what you need and so you have to make it so it's possible for people to be entrepreneurs and not get tied down in oversight.
01:13:31.642 - 01:13:34.474, Speaker D: That makes sense if you're a large.
01:13:34.532 - 01:13:42.580, Speaker C: Company, but doesn't make sense if you have almost no customers. You're trying to get a product out into the market. And so I think those three things.
01:13:43.350 - 01:13:46.166, Speaker D: State oversight, clear understanding of where an.
01:13:46.188 - 01:13:54.790, Speaker C: Asset sits, and some types of sandbox and grace periods can make a huge, huge difference for financial services.
01:13:54.860 - 01:13:56.530, Speaker D: We've seen it in other areas.
01:13:56.690 - 01:14:04.150, Speaker A: And one other thing I was so curious about was in the US. What percentage of your operating cost do you estimate you spend on compliance?
01:14:04.310 - 01:14:20.586, Speaker C: Well, that's a good question. I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. We were looking at this a couple of months ago but it's very significant and now some of those are fixed costs. So it changes over time as we scale. Those costs can scale. But I can tell you we've spent.
01:14:20.618 - 01:14:23.050, Speaker D: Tens of millions of dollars getting ourselves.
01:14:23.130 - 01:14:56.442, Speaker C: Into the position that we are right now. From a regulatory perspective, that's an enormous amount of capital. You look at just creating the trust company, millions and millions and millions of dollars of capital. You can't be a startup who's raised a seed round of $1.2 million and said, I'm going to go become a trust company. It's just not going to work. Now there's a reason why you probably should not need to be a trust company, but could you operate in a sandbox to be able to do things? Could you have a grace period to be able to offer certain things? Maybe there's a minimum amount of revenues that could get you a chance to.
01:14:56.496 - 01:14:58.394, Speaker D: Explore product market fit.
01:14:58.592 - 01:15:09.774, Speaker C: I think that would be really huge for breaking open competition in financial services, which is going to be good for everybody. And it doesn't mean you don't need.
01:15:09.812 - 01:15:12.526, Speaker D: Regulation, but it's when do you need it.
01:15:12.708 - 01:15:31.586, Speaker A: All right, so I've kept you long enough but last quick well, we'll see whether or not it's quick question. You've applied to be a trust bank nationally and in December Paxos also recently raised its Series C fundraising round of $142,000,000. And so I just wondered what was next for Paxos.
01:15:31.778 - 01:16:08.754, Speaker C: Well, look, we're going to keep pushing our regulatory stack to be able to handle more assets and to be able to handle them in broader ways. Having the trust on a national basis does create explicit federal preemption so you can operate in all the states in a really clear way that's valuable. It also gives you potential access directly to the Federal Reserve where you can now hold dollars and bonds directly with them. That will be important for us getting a clearing agency registration from the SEC, as I mentioned before, is another big approval and we're doing a bunch of these outside the United States.
01:16:08.792 - 01:16:10.946, Speaker D: As you know, you're going to have.
01:16:10.968 - 01:16:33.740, Speaker C: To keep building on a regulatory stack. There's no kind of sitting on your laurels because as this becomes more and more mainstream, it needs to be able to operate in different ways than maybe where you did five years ago or even where you did today. And so we're constantly looking down field at other things that we can do to be able to expand the geographies we're in, the assets that we're in, and the way those assets are being used.
01:16:34.190 - 01:16:37.734, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been super fun. Where can people learn more about you and Paxos?
