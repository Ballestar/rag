00:01:17.218 - 00:01:21.602, Speaker A: Today's guest is Dylan Chen, CEO of Edgeware. Welcome, Dylan.
00:01:21.746 - 00:01:23.094, Speaker C: Hi. How's it?
00:01:23.292 - 00:01:34.460, Speaker A: Good, good. I just traveled a little bit and I'm so glad to be at home. But anyway, this show is not about me. So why don't you tell me what does Edgeware do?
00:01:34.910 - 00:02:11.494, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess the tagline for Edgeware is a polkadot smart contract platform and I guess along the three legs that it kind of stands on, it is a WASM smart contract platform. So you can write in rust C assembly and any language you're comfortable with. That compiles down to WASM Two, it's built on polkadot and three, it's on chain governed. And to seed the network, we're doing this thing we're calling the lockdrop. So you lock your Ethereum and you can get Edgeware tokens kind of in return.
00:02:11.692 - 00:02:15.480, Speaker A: And so talk a little bit more about how the lockdrop works.
00:02:15.850 - 00:02:58.530, Speaker C: Yeah. So I guess to preface this a little bit, we decided on the lockdrop kind of like in November of 2018 when we were first conceiving of the project. And the reason for that is, one, we just needed to decide on a way to seed a proof of stake network with what we felt like would be like a healthy ecosystem. And an ICO was obviously out of the question. An AirDrop didn't seem like the right way to do things, so we needed kind of like a happy medium to have people put a little skin in the game but still have wide participation. And so the lockdrop was kind of the mechanism we chose. So the lockdrop basically you time lock your ethereum.
00:02:58.530 - 00:03:39.118, Speaker C: You basically send your ethereum to a smart contract. It creates a small individual lock contract and you can lock for three, six or twelve months. You can redeem your ethereum at the end of that process and the ethereum that you lock up is counted towards this lockdrop. And so you can claim essentially Edgeware tokens at the end of this whole shenanigan. Yeah, that's the lockdown in a nutshell. If you lock up for longer, you get a little bit of bonus edgeware token. So for three months you'll get basically the face value of ethereum.
00:03:39.118 - 00:03:59.754, Speaker C: For six months you'll get 130% of your ethereum. And for locking for twelve months you'll get 220% of your ethereum essentially in edgeware token. Yeah, that's the kind of process in a nutshell. There's a few bells and whistles, but maybe I'll just pause there.
00:03:59.952 - 00:04:07.206, Speaker A: And why don't you also talk about one of the last ways to participate in the log shop, which is through something called signaling.
00:04:07.398 - 00:05:00.300, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. Again, we basically want to widen participation on Edgeware and so we kind of like what is like scratch our heads a little bit and thought about a way to lower the bars even further. If you can't lock up for three months, we know that that can be out of the question for some people. We felt that adding this signaling option would be the right move. So basically what you do is you sign a transaction, you ping the lockdown smart contract with an address. It can be your address that you're basically sending the transaction from, or you can essentially send a transaction on behalf of an account or contract that you created. And the reason for this kind of second option is basically because there's a lot of multi sigs that people hold funds in.
00:05:00.300 - 00:05:47.866, Speaker C: That kind of we wanted to be able to participate in this process. There's one other kind of like Wrinkle, which or maybe two Wrinkles basically, is if you signal instead of like a bonus, you'll get like a deduction since you're not really putting up any opportunity cost of your ethereum. So instead you'll get 20% basically of the face value of whatever gets signaled. And then the other thing is you'll get 25% of the Edgeware tokens on network launch September 15 and then also 75% a year later, essentially. So September 15, 2020. Yeah, that's the other option to participate. It's kind of the lowest hanging fruit, so to speak.
00:05:48.048 - 00:05:56.670, Speaker A: And why did you decide on the lockdrop as your way of distributing the token as opposed to, for instance, an ICO?
00:05:57.490 - 00:06:51.520, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely one is the larger question of thinking about what we should actually be looking at in our crypto projects. We really wanted to build a healthy ecosystem and we know one of the biggest measures of that is number of addresses that actually have any amount of token. And that's especially small for projects in their early days. But the lockdown process is actually going on right now. It started June 1. And if I remember correctly, I think we have 2100 individual transactions that have kind of been sent. And so that corresponds to around 1600 different addresses that have participated in this process and that's only in the first ten or so days.
00:06:51.520 - 00:07:30.122, Speaker C: And so over the kind of three months that the lockdrop process is going on, we hope to have a larger set of stakeholders versus an ICO that might have only had maybe 1000 people participate. We felt an open process where people, I guess, aren't investing money felt like the right thing to do. Is there anything else? Maybe. I mean, we didn't really need to raise any other funds since we're equity funded and the Edgeware network is kind of like being hopefully launched organically again through this process. Yeah, that would be probably the last reason as well.
00:07:30.256 - 00:07:45.140, Speaker A: And how do you think that doing the lockdrop as opposed to an ICO will affect the distribution of the tokens? Other than just perhaps making it available to or other than just having more people participate in sheer numbers?
00:07:45.830 - 00:08:50.054, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a really good question. I would say that we hope it incentivizes a different set of participants to come in. I guess through the lockdown process you have to specify a specific Edgeware address, like the new address on the new network that we're helping launch. And basically we do that because we want to have people that are actively participating. So whether they be developers, core network developers, DAP developers, like governance enthusiasts who want to run on chain governance experiments on Edgeware or just like end users versus a speculator who might be thinking more about, I guess like the future value of Edgeware. And so hopefully the lockdrop process drives the former. So active participants versus speculators? Yeah, that would be the largest hope we'll see it kind of like as the kind of network plays out, I think that's something that you can only really tell as time goes on.
00:08:50.252 - 00:08:53.880, Speaker A: Can you or anyone else use the ETH that's locked up?
00:08:55.210 - 00:09:59.818, Speaker C: No, it's something that sometimes we joke about internally. The lockdown process. Basically the funds are time locked and only you the contract or sorry, the sender can redeem or use the ethereum. Yeah, the reason for that is kind of we thought let's go with the most plain vanilla option. Obviously the lockdrop is kind of experimental in its own right and so any other bells and whistles we thought could come in probably a future network. Although I think I mentioned this a little earlier that we had some community members come up with creative ways that the funds might be used in a future lockdrop. Potentially opening up like a uniswap or adding to a liquidity pool and kind of like earning a little bit of, I guess interest, so to speak, and then funding potentially like a treasury for that new network that's being spun out.
00:09:59.818 - 00:10:06.960, Speaker C: That could be something pretty fun to play with. Shout out to token economy for that idea.
00:10:07.410 - 00:10:13.418, Speaker A: We're going to discuss how Edgeware fits into the overall ecosystem in a moment. But first, a quick word from our fabulous sponsors.

Back to my conversation with Dylan Chen of Edgeware. So you mentioned for signaling that people will receive a quarter of the tokens that they're owed upon network launch and then the remaining three quarters a year later. So when did the other lockshop participants receive their tokens?
00:12:26.510 - 00:12:36.810, Speaker C: They receive their tokens on the network launch date as well. So they just get 100% of what they should be owed, essentially September.
00:12:36.890 - 00:12:52.980, Speaker A: And then there's one subset of people we didn't mention, which I find so fascinating, but basically the people who have funds frozen in the parity multisig wallet, they can participate in the lockdrop. So how does that work?
00:12:53.350 - 00:14:12.842, Speaker C: Yeah, so one I'd like to definitely bring up. So we're looking for active participants and people who we feel like will bring a lot of value to the ecosystem. And so we feel like people who definitely participated in that previous, I guess a process should also be able to participate here. I would also like to note that that's only one example of people that are able to participate in this process. We kind of instituted something called a generalized lock, so people who basically can send a signal transaction, and then if we look at the contract address that they might have signaled on behalf of if you can't send a message or a transaction that has an ETH value greater than zero. Basically what that effectively means is you're not able to move your ethereum for the period of that lock process, then we will count it as a lock versus a signal. And so one of those would be the parity multisig class of wallets that were kind of created and then other kind of unrecoverable, quote unquote funds are also able to participate.
00:14:12.842 - 00:14:29.714, Speaker C: Yeah, so we felt like they would bring a lot of value to a new network because they certainly have a lot of skin in the game and know how early kind of we are in the evolution of, I don't know, crypto networks are.
00:14:29.832 - 00:15:22.226, Speaker A: We are yeah, I mean, there's kind of a lot of money locked up in the parity frozen funds. It's I think like 587 wallets and they're holding what in dollar terms is more than a billion dollars worth of ether. So I think that does open up a lot of people who maybe have ether. I don't know if have is the right verb, but at one point had or at one point had access to and no longer have access to their ether, but they can at least sort of participate in the ecosystem in another way. So let's then talk about what it is that people will do with the tokens. You mentioned that Edgeware is for governance. So once people get their tokens, what can they do with them?
00:15:22.408 - 00:16:35.894, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we've had about 250,000 E locked in the first ten days and so this process running over the whole summer and so hopefully that continues to grow and I want to say like 660,000 signaled as well. And so hopefully that again, knock on wood, people continue to participate in the process. And so once all these people till the end of the summer, at the end of August get into September 15, the Edgeware network launches. Basically we'll have a fully functional smart contract platform. So validators will be able to stake or bond for their own validator to mint new blocks. People will be able to delegate to these validators and earn rewards in terms of Edgeware token. People will be able to pay for essentially gas or transactions on the network and for functioning of any smart contract and they'll be able to vote and basically allocate more funds from an Edgeware Dow.
00:16:35.894 - 00:17:01.326, Speaker C: It's like one wrinkle is that 50% of the initial block reward in the first year will be allocated to a treasury. And so it should be pretty sizable in terms of raw edgeware or sorry, edgeware tokens. And so it should be a pretty fun experiment in terms of governing and on chain governance.
00:17:01.518 - 00:17:11.830, Speaker A: And so since you're going to be functioning as a parachain on polkadot, how do you see Edgeware fitting into the overall ecosystem?
00:17:12.650 - 00:18:25.710, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess one thing I would definitely note is I feel like the ecosystem has been really supportive from different parachains that are active or coming online now, like ChainX out here in China. I'm actually here in China right now, so I guess, like shout out, but also the fact that there's a bunch of other projects like Pocuscan, enzyme speckle, other projects that kind of support the whole ecosystem. And so for Edgeware specifically, a lot of the parachains that we've kind of seen are kind of like app specific. So they could be a Dex like ChainX specifically or another chain like Aragon is going to build a Dow chain specifically. And so within the kind of like Polkadot ecosystem, there still, we feel like, should be like a general purpose smart contract platform where people can still kind of have the playground that we kind of know and love from ethereum and then interact still with the larger kind of application specific parachains. That's kind of the role we kind of hope we can play in the ecosystem. It's still pretty early in the lifecycle.
00:18:25.710 - 00:18:36.770, Speaker C: Polkadot, God willing, will kind of launch at the end of this year. And so we're kind of excited for the ecosystem to kind of form around that.
00:18:36.920 - 00:18:48.870, Speaker A: And so Edgeware, since it's a governance chain, will those tokens then be usable for performing any type of governance actions on other parachains?
00:18:51.050 - 00:19:52.730, Speaker C: Let me think it would be really cool for that to happen. And so, actually, one experiment that's kind of being run right now, one of the community members, Garrett, he's running a project or a Dao essentially on Edgeware, called our node. Basically, it's like moloch built on edgeware. And right now, kind of donations are being accepted in Edgeware token and dots. And so I think what will happen is that Dow will run on Edgeware and basically it could send funds to a different parachain, kind of as like the first step. And so that'd be a really exciting you know, any any Edgeware smart contract should be able to interoperate with any other smart contract and more specifically Dows in general. And so that's kind of like, I think the top way that Edgeware and the Edgeware token holders would be able to interact and help govern any other parachain.
00:19:53.230 - 00:20:15.890, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, well, I guess we'll see how the lockdrop goes and whether or not this kind of becomes a new way that people try to distribute their tokens. Actually, before we go, just one last question. So, are there any issues regulatory wise regarding the lockdrop?
00:20:17.190 - 00:20:57.050, Speaker C: It looks like we are preliminarily in the clear. I think, since we're not a let me mentally refresh real quick. Since we're not taking essentially any investment, we're not using the Edgeworth or sorry, the ethereum itself to fund further development. The network, we think it should be fully functional. We've run several testnets. You can build smart contracts. You can validate do all these other so it looks like we've kind of in the clear from that perspective.
00:20:57.890 - 00:21:17.342, Speaker A: Okay, we'll see. Yeah, because the AirDrop issue the SEC was making noise about. Yeah. All right. Well, as so much regarding that topic, I think it remains to be seen how that will play out. But thanks for coming on the show. It's been great having you on unconfirmed.
