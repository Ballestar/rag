00:00:03.450 - 00:00:45.530, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Unchained, your no Hype resource for all things crypto. I'm your host, Laura Shin, a journalist with over two decades of experience. I started covering crypto six years ago and as a senior editor at Forbes, was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full time. Follow Unchained on Twitter at unchained underscore pod, where you can find all sorts of content ranging from my weekly newsletter to updates on my upcoming book and a whole lot more. Today's episode is a panel I moderated for ambergroup on power women in crypto. The four speakers are executives in crypto who are happy to discuss the role of gender in the industry, what explanations are most effective for bringing in women, good hiring practices for bringing more women into the industry? And more.
00:00:45.530 - 00:01:22.434, Speaker A: Panelists include Mia Deng, a partner at Dragonfly Capital amy Zhang, vice president of sales at Fireblocks, alexis Galba, founder at Open and Annabelle Huang, partner at Ambergroup. For those of you watching on video, you may notice we're all wearing white. The organizers asked us to wear white as a symbol of inclusiveness across traditional finance and crypto. No matter where you're listening, this panel was an extremely interesting discussion on a subject that many women in the industry seek about privately, but not openly. I hope you enjoy it. Now onto the show. Today's episode is sponsored by EY Blockchain.
00:01:22.434 - 00:01:46.426, Speaker A: Ernst and Young is committed to supporting integration of the world's business ecosystems on the public ethereum blockchain.

00:02:05.288 - 00:02:25.594, Speaker B: Welcome to this panel put on by the Amber Group, power Women of the Next Generation, from traditional finance to crypto. We have four different panelists here, and we're going to start with each of them telling us how we got into crypto and what their company does and what it is that they do. And Amy Zhang, why don't we start with great.
00:02:25.632 - 00:03:14.940, Speaker C: Well, hi everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. I'm super excited to share about our experiences and talk about women in crypto. My name is Amy. I run sales for Fireblocks in Asia. Fireblocks is a technology company that provide secure digital asset transfer infrastructure and custody infrastructure for over 250 clients, from crypto hedge funds to OTC desks to exchanges. Most recently, we were a technology provider vendor selected for some of the larger banks in the industry as really my goal at Fireblocks is to drive revenue for us in the APAC region, establish relationships with partners, and deliver products to allow them to continue to build a bigger business in the digital asset space.
00:03:14.940 - 00:04:08.620, Speaker C: Before fireblocks, I ran sales for a company called Diginex. That was my first role in crypto starting in 2018 and late 2007, 2018. And at diginex, I helped them to grow their exchange trading custody fund, the funds business prior to that and my foray into crypto, I will used to be a sales trader at Deutsche bank where I serviced institutional clients. Right. And really my kind of move and foray into crypto started when I was at deutsche and then looked at my colleagues and looked at where they were and I thought to myself, I didn't want to be any of them ten years from now. So I went out and ventured out into looking for new opportunities and crypto became one of the industries that really draw my attention, so and the rest is history.
00:04:09.470 - 00:04:12.266, Speaker B: Great. And we also have Annabelle Huang.
00:04:12.458 - 00:04:39.960, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. Again very happy to be here as well and being able to chat with a lot of my old friends. I knew Amy from Deutsche bank who were the same year analyst, and also Miash who was at Amber and now one of our investors and then a lot of the new friends I've made. So very glad to be here with you guys. Hi. My name is Annabelle Huang. I am a partner at Ember group.
00:04:39.960 - 00:05:17.454, Speaker D: We're a global leading crypto finance service provider, servicing institutional and individual clients globally. We help our clients buy and sell crypto. If they have borrowed lending needs, they have asset management needs. In crypto, we help them across basically all of the crypto finance needs. We service a lot of the crypto native funds and institutions as well as a lot of the people who are new to crypto, especially after this bull cycle this year. So it's been a very fun ride. Before Amber, I was at AirSwap.
00:05:17.454 - 00:06:09.620, Speaker D: It's a decentralized exchange built on ethereum. And that was my first foray into crypto. That was in 2018. I was at nomura where similar to deutsche, I was doing FX and rate structuring related roles. And that's where I met a few of my caranki Mellon alums in New York. And they were telling me about this decentralized finance and how we're able to really automate a lot of the processes that we've seen in traditional finance into a smart contract on this new public chain. And that to me is really marrying finance with technology and really revolutionize finance as we know, you know, decided to give it a shot and just cannot turn back ever since.
00:06:09.990 - 00:06:12.674, Speaker B: And Mia. We have Mia ding as well.
00:06:12.792 - 00:06:13.458, Speaker E: Hey everyone.
00:06:13.544 - 00:06:46.670, Speaker F: It's awesome to be here. And I'm Mia. And I'm a partner at Dragonfly. We're a global crypto venture fund with presence in Asia and the states and dragonfly invests across the sectors in crypto. So we have centralized financial infrastructure like companies like Amber. And open is also DeFi a big focus area of ours. And deep tech and NFTs, and I particularly head up our investment in Asia with a focus in China.
00:06:46.670 - 00:07:40.110, Speaker F: And before Dragonfly, I was a founding member at Amber, joined them when there were six people in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. And that was my foray into Asia's, crypto and landscape and really saw how that connects to the broader crypto market. And the founding thesis of Dragonfly is that crypto is a market global from day one, and we need have deep understanding of both east and west. And that's how Dragonfly comes in the middle. And then yeah, before crypto, I actually come from a tech background. I was a product manager at Mobike, which is this bike share unicorn company in China. And I think that experience taught me how the Internet companies the room left for innovation is actually quite limited.
00:07:40.110 - 00:07:50.820, Speaker F: The incumbents, like the giants, kind of control the user data, and crypto seems like the perfect way to turn that around.
00:07:51.510 - 00:07:52.066, Speaker E: Great.
00:07:52.168 - 00:07:54.366, Speaker B: And finally, Alexis GABA.
00:07:54.558 - 00:08:32.238, Speaker E: Hey, I'm alexis. I'm excited to be here. So I'm the co founder of Open. We are building a decentralized options platform on Ethereum, so for the first time, anyone, anywhere can create or trade an option on any ERC 20. I've just been super excited about crypto and DFI for a while now and very thrilled to be in the space. Kind of before Open, I was studying at UC Berkeley and then dropped out of school to do Open. But while I was at Cal, also started she 256, which is a 501 nonprofit focused on diversity in crypto that's been absolutely amazing to work on as well.
00:08:32.238 - 00:08:58.360, Speaker E: It honestly just started as a conference and seeing the response of the community was incredible. And since then, we've built it into a full nonprofit and we have a mentorship program that's matched over 900 people from over 40 countries, which has been really cool. We're working on some studies to capture tangible data on diversity, inclusion in the space, and a lot more initiatives. So very excited to be here and excited about everything that's happening in the space right now.
00:08:58.910 - 00:09:55.340, Speaker B: Great. So when the organizer for this reached out to me about this panel, I was excited to do it because for years now, I have been in these different chat groups and discussion rooms, slack rooms for women in crypto, and they have a lot to say on this topic, actually. But surprisingly, if I would try to do a show on it or write an article on it or whatever, people generally wouldn't actually really want to discuss it publicly. So I was curious to know why it is that you all were willing to do so and whether or not you thought it was a good thing to discuss it publicly or I think in the case of a lot of these other women that declined, many of them would rather only talk about their work. So, yeah, just what is your perspective on that issue.
00:09:56.030 - 00:10:36.040, Speaker C: I guess I can go first here. I think a lot of times when you're working in an industry that might be perhaps male dominated, you want people to really focus on your work and remove the focus on you being a woman because you want to call attention to it. You want to be treated equally. Right. So as such, you really push for evaluating on my work. But really, I think a lot of times you do want to talk and speak out about it because there are perhaps inequality in certain industries when it comes to being a woman in the workforce. And we have unique challenges that we want to be able to share and communicate with each other.
00:10:36.650 - 00:11:20.200, Speaker D: Yeah, I share the same feeling, I think. I guess both of us came from traditional finance space as well. And that was a very white male dominated scene. And when I first joined, I almost felt the need to blend, know, to be a bro so that I could be treated equally. On the structuring desk in New York, there was just me, my former MD, probably. I never had a woman on his team before, so he didn't really know even how to deal with me almost. He's like, can I tell you as it is, I'm like, yes, we're all professional people here.
00:11:20.200 - 00:12:00.050, Speaker D: I think there's a little bit of that. Sometimes I even feel like, oh, maybe we shouldn't. There are a lot of women in crypto chats. And then I feel like there are a lot of issues that we feel strongly about, at least when we talk to each other. And I always just find it so inspiring to get a group of women together and talk about the work we do. And it's just inspiring because there are not that many of us in the space, but then there is the fear of us perhaps making it as a way to call attention to ourselves or to get any unfair advantage. But I really don't think it is.
00:12:00.050 - 00:12:17.714, Speaker D: I think it's just opening up a platform for us to chat together and hopefully encouraging more women to come. So we have a community, just as a lot of the men would have their fraternity organizations of the likes in finance.
00:12:17.842 - 00:13:04.360, Speaker F: Yeah, I would just add on to that. Crypto is an intersection of tech and finance, so it's two super male dominant industries, so you get crypto, which is even more. And I think the rationale for me is quite straightforward. I think if we hold a thesis that crypto is going to be adopted by the entire humanity and it's 50 50 split by men and women, and in the process of designing this tech and really getting it mainstream adoption, we need that representation. And I think right now that representation is heavily skewed. And I think that we carry that mission at least to balance it out a little bit.
00:13:04.810 - 00:13:11.514, Speaker B: And Alexis, as the founder of she 256. Do you have thoughts as well?
00:13:11.552 - 00:13:12.106, Speaker D: No, absolutely.
00:13:12.208 - 00:13:50.040, Speaker E: I think jumping off of what everyone already said, our goal for crypto is for it to serve the whole population. And how can we serve the whole population if the people building aren't representative of the people we are to serve? So I think it's incredibly important and to get more people in the space. And I think it is inspiring to see that other people have done it before and that there are real struggles or real difficulties, but everyone is focused on getting through it. Everyone here is incredible at what they do and focused on their work, but at the same time is also open to having these conversations and bringing people in. And so I think that is really important.
00:13:50.810 - 00:14:19.630, Speaker B: And so what would you say are the main issues when it comes to this general topic of women in crypto? Obviously, one is simply the fact that there are many fewer women in crypto than there are men. It's not anywhere near gender parity, so there's that. But then maybe there are other issues. What do you guys see as kind of the main issues or main things that you would want others to know about this topic?
00:14:20.050 - 00:15:06.318, Speaker D: I guess I can start. I think the fact that there are so few of us and we're underrepresented, I think, gave the outside world the impression that this is a space only for men because it can be very demanding. Right. It's a 24/7 market, so for anyone who wants to be in this business, it is physically and mentally demanding, but doesn't mean that the women should be discouraged to join. And I am making a point of hiring more women on my team and even just at Amber in general. But then a lot of times, even at a candidate level, you don't see a lot of female applicants. And I just feel like maybe they feel dissuaded from the start.
00:15:06.318 - 00:16:03.342, Speaker D: And there are a few people of women at Deutsche and Namura or even just at current Mellon reach out to me saying, you know, it's just so great to hear your voice even in these platforms and making me feel like I can also be part of it. And I want all of us to be able to tell them that maybe it's not easy, just as it's not easy to do anything well. But then being a woman is certainly not a disadvantage, if not an advantage in itself, because I think crypto should be very inclusive and then it really should represent a more diverse background when companies building products or building infrastructures or anything in the space. We need to hear both sides of the story.
00:16:03.476 - 00:17:20.280, Speaker C: Yeah. And another thing is crypto also most crypto businesses today, maybe the exception of a few, are still startups. Right? And I think a lot of the decision you have as a person to join a startup company is they don't have a huge HR department that has well Trouted processes when it comes to dealing with issues in a traditional bank. These are all done and you could go in knowing how your insurance would be like and all of these custom benefits that you get right and you don't have to go through this battle again versus when you're in a startup. You have to not only do your job, but then knowing the fact that there might be potential of discrimination, what do you do? So I think a lot of times these women think about these problems in their head a lot where they're like how do I want to manage my risk, my career and what's the most optimal way for me to succeed? And they evaluate the risk associated being joined a new industry that is predominantly dominated by a group of people and again these are startups right? So all these risk compound together I feel like the problem might not be as apparent and if you break it down into different layers of the industry that we operate in the result know there's just less women in our industry working.
00:17:20.670 - 00:18:30.106, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it goes pretty know like Mia mentioned like crypto is the intersection of tech and finance and societally on a larger scale beyond just crypto. Women are often dissuaded from going into tech or finance or don't learn about it as at a young age just anecdotally so many of my male friends started investing or getting into the stock market and stuff like that way before my female friends ever did and had completely different risk tolerances and different conceptions towards it. And not to say that women can't, women can all these people are doing incredible all my friends are investing now doing incredible things just like at a young age their teachers, their parents, their friends weren't telling them hey you should check out the stock market, you should learn how to do this. The way their male peers were getting that kind of encouragement and so kind of a broader socialized thing at a younger age where it's like okay, crypto is the intersection of these two things. How do we say you're welcome here and we're going to teach you. You can come in here and you can ask questions and we're going to help you answer them. I didn't know what an order book was until I started looking into crypto.
00:18:30.106 - 00:18:34.610, Speaker E: I didn't know any of this stuff and so definitely was learning it on the fly.
00:18:35.190 - 00:18:36.946, Speaker B: And Mia did you want to add anything?
00:18:37.048 - 00:19:22.480, Speaker F: Yeah, I think there's really a lack of where I love to see change. I think she's 250 is doing great things about bringing women together. And I think, really, when you find role models, you want to find those who you can relate with. And I think right now, it's very little visibility of these role models or, you know, or just people who can you can reach out who are already in the industry. And I think that's why having a very clear theme of, you know, a panel like this or Sheetan 56 is really giving that kind of beacon or basically for more women to reach out to.
00:19:23.250 - 00:19:44.470, Speaker B: So since we did mention she 256 a few times, alexis, I did want to ask you, what did you feel were your big takeaways from that initiative about either what the main obstacles are to bringing more diversity to crypto or what you think maybe are the best ways to overcome those obstacles?
00:19:45.770 - 00:20:24.622, Speaker E: Absolutely. I think that's a great question. I think one insight that I'll point to that's pretty interesting. We ran a beta of our job board last year, and the majority of the postings on the job board were for the senior level positions. But a lot of the folks who were coming in from our community were either more junior or didn't have experience in crypto. And it was hard to find a match of companies that were willing to put in the investment to train up people to get them to whatever level versus looking for senior talent out of the gate. And the definition of senior might be missing different perspectives or missing different things that these people bring to the table that might not be in that job description.
00:20:24.622 - 00:21:25.990, Speaker E: So what we've done for that job board beta and then now the job board that's going to be launching this year is put together a set of guidelines that companies can look to to help them improve their practices. And help them up with their job descriptions to bring more people in the door and see how those people can add specific value to their company. And so that's one anecdote that I'll point out that happened recently that I thought was interesting in terms of how people can get involved. I think one really cool thing about the emergence of DeFi and governance is that it's really made this playing field very accessible. You can go in with an anonymous identity, ask your questions, no one even has to know who you are. You can join groups like GT 56 where you can connect with other people. You can start making pull requests, asking questions, contributing on forums, and people are usually very willing to answer questions, which is something that I really appreciate about this space.
00:21:25.990 - 00:21:36.300, Speaker E: But I think it's always incredibly helpful to have those like minded communities and places where you feel comfortable asking questions, even with your own identity, without having to go make an anonymous account to feel.
00:21:39.230 - 00:22:14.280, Speaker B: Know. We did discuss how a lot of other industries that relate to crypto also are known for being more male dominated. And Annabelle and Amy, since you both have that background in traditional finance, I was curious to hear your take on how the two compare in terms of what it's like to be a woman in either of these industries. Traditional finance or crypto? Is it different or is it the same or how are you finding it?
00:22:15.050 - 00:22:56.834, Speaker C: Maybe I can start I think it's actually different in a way. I think we're from like a bulge bracket bank and you from that kind of industry where in the last 2030 years have went through a massive shift in culture. Right. If I was a trader on Wall Street 30 years ago, I think my experience would perhaps be very different than I do now because a lot of the issues I think you do get to see have been resolved more so. Right. Within traditional finance, there's a lot of these women's group and there's a lot of support in the organization in terms of mentorship because they're larger organizations as well. But me joining the trading floor at Deutsche yes, I know.
00:22:56.834 - 00:23:39.522, Speaker C: I noticed visibly that I was one of the few women who were there, but it wasn't as though I felt like I'm on an island by myself and I try to figure out everything on my own. There's a lot of resources being there to help you. I think when it comes to crypto, partially because it's new, partially because these again are startups coming in, I didn't get the same kind of resources. Right, you had to figure a lot of it on your own. You have to talk to your managers and speak with the HR and figure it out. What does I need to do? Right. I think that's difference number one between traditional into the world we operate in and I think part two probably is also different.
00:23:39.522 - 00:24:29.300, Speaker C: Again, crypto is also very tech driven. Right. So I think with trading it's mostly there's capital markets and I think tech culture, maybe Mia can speak to a little bit more, but it's also unique tech culture that we also have to operate in within as well. And I speak to a lot of know the product managers who are women within crypto and they deal more similarly to what they used to deal with in the tech industry. Right. Which is how do I make sure my voices are heard, how do I get my male peers to respect me? It's actually very interesting because the industry that we operate in and there's both side of the coin where I think come from a trading seat. You feel like oh, I need to hang with the traders and be more bro y and be that perspective versus I think if you look at it from a tech perspective then it's actually very different from a culture element as well.
00:24:30.390 - 00:25:19.522, Speaker D: Yeah. I would echo what Amy just said. I think that's also because we were in I guess I was in New York at Deutsche versus Amy was in Hong Kong. So maybe there's also slightly cultural differences too. And in New York it is very, I would say very politically correct when it comes to a lot of the things gender related so there are even like they would make a point to give you a lot of the support groups and there are a lot of women's association that you can join. So you definitely feel like, okay, this is a topic that people talk about, and obviously with the whole, you know, there's different backdrops, but then it is the gender topic. A gender issue is very top of mind for a lot of people in the US.
00:25:19.522 - 00:26:00.080, Speaker D: But versus in Asia, I guess culturally is different. The inequality level is perhaps different between genders in Asia, more so, at least that's how I feel. So I think that there's also that aspect of it, and crypto, for sure, I think because most of us are in startups, I remember first joined, there is the physical checkups benefit for everyone. There are so few women, I don't think OBGYN was even included. That didn't even cross their mind. It's funny, but then it's also serious. Right.
00:26:00.080 - 00:26:13.154, Speaker D: I think that just means for us who are early in the space, perhaps, we have to do more work together, hopefully, and to build a better baseline for a lot of women that come.
00:26:13.192 - 00:26:25.590, Speaker B: After and wait, so earlier when you were saying that you felt like the gender issues in the US. Are different from then in Asia. How so? It wasn't clear to me which direction.
00:26:26.490 - 00:26:56.274, Speaker D: I think it's just more talked about in the US. That people understand that there is gender inequality. They accept it, they acknowledge it, and then people are doing things, or at least trying harder, I feel, to address that versus in Asia, there's this more inherent gender inequality that's more rooted in a culture, perhaps. Yeah. And it's more accepted. People don't talk about it. People kind of expect it.
00:26:56.274 - 00:27:22.730, Speaker D: Like, if you're a like here in Asia, when I try to do business, people are, who are you? An assistant? And that's their default assumption. And it's hard to climb out of that. You have to go further. You have to work much harder to prove that, no, I have a seated table and perhaps deserve more so than you do. So that's just some extra hurdles that we have to overcome.
00:27:23.070 - 00:27:31.626, Speaker B: Wow, okay. Yeah, that's definitely not good if people just assume that because you're a woman, you're an assistant.
00:27:31.658 - 00:27:35.920, Speaker F: That's actually really I've had that encounter as well.
00:27:39.490 - 00:28:01.286, Speaker C: I think the goal here is not talking about Asia versus UIs or whatnot, but right. But I think also it's a lot of social pressure, too. It's not just like business pressure. It's like people look at you and be, you know, you're getting old. Are you have a husband? Are you getting married? And there's all these expectations of you in Asia, specifically more so probably in the US. And that adds into your overall decision making. Right.
00:28:01.286 - 00:28:45.800, Speaker C: Like, we talk about why are we having these conversations? And a lot of it's also social pressure. And you have friends, families, influences that has maybe a more traditional way of looking at things. And yes, of course we all can fight against it and perhaps find our own identity, but the current is going against you, right? So you're constant to swim upwards and it's tough. I think that's probably why at the end of the day, you combine many different things, including the difficulties they face professionally and then the difficulties they face culturally, the influence you have to deal with from your friends and families. And that's why we're having these conversations today, right, about why is it more harder and what can we do to address these things.
00:28:46.730 - 00:29:43.800, Speaker B: I have noticed that and this is now just almost getting into cultural differences, which is not the exact topic, but I have noticed sometimes if I deal with foreigners from Asia, they will ask me questions that are quite directed of some of these things that are quite specific to women. So yeah, somehow just being a woman makes them want to be nosy about those things. But anyway, so one thing I did want to ask though, is we've kind of been talking in the abstract about what it's like to be a woman in a male dominated industry. But do any of you feel that it's been a hindrance or that you've experienced any discrimination or is it just something that is more subtle or what has your just experience been of being a woman in crypto when most of the people that you work with are men?
00:29:44.410 - 00:30:11.582, Speaker C: Maybe I have a really good example in this. I have a friend of mine who recently came up to me in the industry and said, hey, I just started a new job and I'm pregnant. I was like, wow, congratulations, I'm so happy for you. I'm super excited. Oh my God, like all of these things. And she was like, I'm worried about telling my manager because I was shocked. Right? I've never considered this in my life.
00:30:11.582 - 00:30:40.380, Speaker C: And I was like, you should not feel bad and you should not feel sorry. And that's something that really kind of hit me first time in a while where I was like, oh, you do have to think about these things differently. And maybe because I'm not in the stage in the life where I am thinking about that. But that was something that as an example, right, but maybe this is not specific crypto, maybe it's just in general women in the workforce. But that's an example where I think a lot of times women have to think about these things being like, oh, what's my timeline look like? I'm out of commission. What does that mean?
00:30:41.710 - 00:31:32.140, Speaker F: Yeah, I think just to add on that, I think there's this expectation of you for, okay, you're women, then you must be good at dealing with people or you must have really good soft skills and you add a different touch to the team that you're like a good additional. Thing to have. And so sometimes the emphasis of your skill sets that they see is like because you're women, you're more empathetic and et cetera. But while that is all true, but then that could be sometimes the focus of what they expect out of you. I think that kind of creates this reinforcement loop that psychologically could be difficult to break out of.

00:33:40.470 - 00:34:37.202, Speaker B: So we've been discussing women working in crypto, and yet there's also plenty of other ways to get involved in the industry. And the Wall Street Journal recently reported about more women taking up crypto as kind of like a trading hobby. And they reported that one in four customers who traded crypto so far in 2021 on the Robinhood app are women. However, they did say that fewer women trade crypto on Robinhood than trade stocks and ETFs. And then they also noted the statistic that over the last couple of years, Etoro said that the number of female crypto traders in the US on its platform has increased by half to about 20% of all users in the US. And these, frankly, in a way, actually are better numbers than I've seen in the past. So that is heartening.
00:34:37.202 - 00:35:01.370, Speaker B: And yet, obviously, given that women are 51% of the population, it's nowhere near their numbers in the general population. So what do you think is the cause for the increase in the number of women and yet also what do you think we can do to get more women interested in crypto?
00:35:01.970 - 00:36:36.950, Speaker D: I think I'll start I think there are more women in the space, perhaps, or more people in general, because the infrastructure has become more mature and there are more regulated venues where we can trade and where people feel safe and secure about their assets, about what they're trading. And crypto has become a lot more mainstream than last cycle four years ago. So I think that's just a general trend. And again, not trying to stereotype here, but perhaps women would be slightly more risk averse than a lot of the men who might just want to who are perhaps more inclined to trade riskier things in new platforms. But now, because there are a lot of these better known names in the space, I think Robinhood or even Coinbase that just went public, I think they gave people in general a lot of faith in this industry. And I think more women are perhaps drawn into the industry and feel like it is safe and okay for them to start trading. And I think amongst the younger generation, the Gen Z's, or even whoever comes after, I think for them, maybe it's just really embracing a new form of asset class in truly digital form, just as a lot of the things they're used to in their lives now living, talking to friends on Zoom and doing payments in digital formats.
00:36:36.950 - 00:37:16.710, Speaker D: I think perhaps for them, as a generation, it's just more accepting. And then, no matter for men or women, they are willing to try this out. So we also launched a retail facing app last year. So within six months we've gotten significant traction. And just looking at the data, it is quite interesting. I think for us on our platform, a third of the users are female and the majority of the age group is within 30 years old or younger. So I think that perhaps play into the thesis interesting.
00:37:16.780 - 00:37:20.360, Speaker B: And is your app focused on the Asian market?
00:37:21.950 - 00:37:41.838, Speaker D: It can be accessed globally. We started with very simple functions where people can buy and sell, you know, the major tokens, and then can earn yields on. So and then people in Asia, in North America, in Europe can access it.
00:37:41.924 - 00:37:56.630, Speaker B: But are the majority. I'm curious because I was going to ask if you feel that there's a difference in the gender imbalance in Asia when it comes to just general interest in crypto versus in the west.
00:37:57.210 - 00:38:36.340, Speaker D: I'm not sure about gender, but I feel like, if anything, perhaps the level of participation in Asia is more so than the west. Like, you look at Japan, Korea, a lot of the Asian countries, the crypto adoption level is much higher. I think in Korea people traded more crypto and volume than in Korean stock. Like I think more than a third of the population, the entire Korean population holds crypto. That's just something that we passed very different from the US.
00:38:36.870 - 00:38:59.100, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, but you're not sure if that extends to a greater percentage of women in Asia being interested in crypto than in the US. Or does anybody know that? Okay. And nobody else is aware of what that number might okay. Because that would be kind of interesting to look at.
00:38:59.710 - 00:39:02.140, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. I'm going to take a look later.
00:39:02.750 - 00:39:03.114, Speaker B: Okay.
00:39:03.152 - 00:39:04.380, Speaker D: At least on our platform.
00:39:05.150 - 00:40:41.858, Speaker B: And so for you, just with your friends, because I personally have tried to do this with my friends and I will just tell you that equally between the male and female friends, the lack of interest in crypto is like the same. I will say my best friend who's a woman read a draft of my book and then she actually did become interested in crypto. So I kind of got one convert, but yeah, no, a funny story I have about this is that I was hanging out with a male friend and this was during the whole sushi swap uniswap saga. And I tried to tell him the story, which to me was like the most exciting thing that had happened in the last few weeks or whatever and tried to explain it with all the drama and he kind of laughed a fake laugh and then changed the subject. Clearly I didn't get anyway, so for you when you're talking to your non crypto friends, whether it's men or women, but we're mostly talking about women. So I was just curious, do you find that there are any certain explanations or pitches or descriptions that work better with your female friends to get them excited or interested? Or do you find that there are maybe certain themes or topics that they gravitate more toward, like decentralization or a new financial system or control over your data or something else? What have you found to be an effective way to get women interested?
00:40:42.044 - 00:41:08.626, Speaker E: Yeah, I can jump in here. Yeah, what I found most effective is to literally just send them some crypto and just have them try stuff out. And it's been so interesting. I did this with my little sister who was eleven years old at the time. I sent her some ETH. This was like a couple of years ago and she went, she traded that ETH for die on Uniswap. And then after that she got the uni AirDrop and she was like, now this eleven year old with the Uni AirDrop, she's like can buy all the candy in the world.
00:41:08.626 - 00:41:29.260, Speaker E: And so then she's going and telling all her friends, like, oh, my God, I traded on this decentralized exchange and I got this token for it. And now all her friends are like, downloading MetaMask. And so just the act of sending someone a little bit of crypto and them feeling the magic themselves and then encouraging their friends and their circles is what has absolutely worked best for me.
00:41:30.670 - 00:41:32.380, Speaker B: Wow, I love that story.
00:41:33.390 - 00:42:03.970, Speaker F: I have a lot of art friends. A lot of them are actually girls. And I think recently with NFTs, that's the major thing that they're like, okay, no, I don't know, Mia, what do you do all day? What's this crypto thing? I don't care. And now it's like, oh, suddenly there's a new medium of creation, of creating new form of art. And it's like, super. Like, they're like, wow, tell me how I can make art out of you know, all of them are like VR artists, AR artists. And it's been super cool to see that.
00:42:03.970 - 00:42:39.630, Speaker F: And actually, recently we launched a new NFT platform called the PR Lab, and also with some of the really awesome female collectors. So we have Lee Kohen, she's the deputy chairwoman of Christie's, and also Wendy Murdoch from Artsy and Shanghai Bakham Museum and Shanghai like, Arts Zero till One, which, yeah, I'm also very excited to create with these ladies.
00:42:42.290 - 00:43:50.920, Speaker C: Depends on age group, right? I think a lot of my friends in my media circles are getting to this point in their career where they're making a lot of meaningfully, more so than what they were when they were much, much younger. Right? And they're thinking, how do I manage my wealth? What do I put my money in? So the conversation has changed. I think a lot of it about back then, it's like, how do I pay my student loan and what I do about taxes? Right now, it's more about like, okay, well, I have the more disposable income, how can I invest? And what are the ways I can take control over my finances? And I think a lot of my female friends are taking more an active role in this because they know financial independence is super important for them and they're more interested in learning about Amy, what is bitcoin thing that you talk about all day long, right. And they're like, what does that mean? So they're more interested from that perspective. But I think in terms of the medium of distribution, I definitely notice that if you're sending crypto to your friends, it's the easiest way. If they can download a mobile app on a wall on their phone, they don't have to go through the tedious process of onboarding, perhaps. And they are much more interested very early.
00:43:50.920 - 00:44:27.538, Speaker C: And then you explain the risk and the processes and things like that. So I feel like for those that's worked out well from just like a fundamental investment perspective, my male friends are more interested in more, like financial instrument. They're interested in the instrument elements of this asset class rather than just like the underlying right. So it's like, how do I trade options and how do I do the same thing? I used to connect to the interactive brokers. Right. They're thinking more of trading this versus my female friends are thinking more of as a form of how do I earn yield and how do I invest in underlying stuff in general. So I think there's a bit of a difference in approach as well.
00:44:27.538 - 00:44:36.562, Speaker C: Maybe perhaps just most of my guy friends are in finance. They understand this more. But yeah, so that's something I noticed across my two friend groups.
00:44:36.706 - 00:45:49.114, Speaker D: Yeah. And for me it's similar. Most of my finance friends, no matter male or female, they are looking into it as perhaps is it worth it for me to allocate a little bit within my portfolio? What is that going to look like? And they understand the risk reward profile of this new asset class and they're very open to it. And I also have some friends in art or entertainment and the draw for them is NFTs and a lot of them are asking, oh, how do I issue one for the work that I'm doing? Or have a group of artists or YouTube stars wanted to launch something of their own and how do I get started? So I think it really depends on what they do and how blockchain in general relates to their actual interest. If their interest is in art and fashion and content in general or in more finance driven fields, I do think blockchain, there are so many different applications that live on it. So I'm sure there is something for everyone. And for me, I haven't seen that, particularly to men or to women.
00:45:49.114 - 00:45:56.318, Speaker D: I think as long as they find something that's so relevant to what they love doing and they just want to jump into yeah.
00:45:56.404 - 00:46:47.070, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm finding the same that now with the NFT thing. This is the first time I can get my real friends involved are creators of some sort. And they're kind of interested, and they're like, oh, what's know? We've talked about your personal experiences, and we've talked about kind of general people taking this up as a hobby. But one other thing I want to talk about was Alexis, you're a co founder of Open and as somebody who is often looking for different people to interview, I have noticed that there just really aren't that many co founders in the space who are women. And I think it's kind of even a smaller percentage than there are women in the space in general. And so this question isn't just for you, Alexis, but it's for anybody to discuss.
00:46:47.070 - 00:47:28.330, Speaker B: But why do you guys think that even when it comes to co founders that it's an even smaller percentage who are women than of just women in general in crypto? And I think for me, what I find a little bit confusing about that is also just the fact that crypto right now is this kind of total open space where things are being built fresh. And so it's not like there's super established things. People can go out and kind of create new stuff. So what's your theory about that? And what do you also think are maybe some of the best ways to encourage more women to found new projects?
00:47:29.070 - 00:47:49.330, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's a really good question. I feel like it's kind of a general thing across startups. It is definitely like a riskier thing to do. Even when I was dropping out of school and deciding to do this, there was definitely a whole thought process that went through my head about what's the worst that can happen? And when this I was like, oh.
00:47:49.480 - 00:47:51.074, Speaker D: The worst that can happen isn't that bad.
00:47:51.112 - 00:48:16.426, Speaker E: Like, I go back to school, then it felt like a lot better and something I could do. But definitely getting over that risk hump was something for me. And I totally agree. Crypto is this minefield right now in this vast open space. And I think the more we can encourage people to take risks and be like, hey, society is not going to punish you for taking that risk. You're going to learn something, it's going to be a ton of fun. There are people going to be on that journey with you more.
00:48:16.426 - 00:49:01.938, Speaker E: We can spread that narrative as opposed to like, oh, it's this big whole thing like, no, you're starting something fun with your friends, you're going to have a good time. I think maybe that could help peel away the layers of it being intimidating or super risky and try to make it more accessible. And then the other thing, frankly, is people just being able to have the funding to do that. My co founder, Aparna got the Teal Fellowship. We got a grant from MakerDAO. So we were in a position where we were able to do these things, which was really so, you know, right now a lot of these protocols have larger treasuries and they are using them to give out grants, which is really great. And so it's an opportunity for them to enable more people to take that jump and take that risk.
00:49:02.114 - 00:49:29.778, Speaker C: And I think a lot of times we look at things as the bypass. We look at things as like the result. Right? The result is we're seeing less women as co founders in crypto as men. But if you ask yourself why that happens, it actually goes way before that, which is, I want to start a business, I need co founders. So where can I select co founders from? Who's got experiences in this industry? Which is left to begin with? Right, so I'm a female, I want to select other co founders. If I select one co founder that's male, then that's 50 50. If I select two co founders, then I'm one third.
00:49:29.778 - 00:50:08.762, Speaker C: So there's like that byproduct of starting a business. And then the question is, okay, well, if there's less people in the industry, it all goes down to how can we get more women in the industry to work? Therefore, building a talent pool of co founders potentially to partner with. Right. And then how we could then grow and see that result change. Because, yeah, you're starting your business, you want it to be successful, and you're not really thinking about, maybe I want to have an all female strong team that can go and have all female co founders. Right. You're thinking like, how can I make sure that I bridge the skills that I don't have to have a successful business? And you look at the selection pool, and it's a reflection of the industry.
00:50:08.762 - 00:50:27.000, Speaker C: So I feel like that could also be one of the observations that you see. And this goes to kind of most of the topic we're talking about today. Right. You look at the results, and it's a reflection of it's tougher. So you have to be more proactive to try harder to correct it.
00:50:27.370 - 00:50:54.678, Speaker B: Yeah, well, so speaking of that, there were a couple of different comments earlier made about hiring, and a few people made the observation that there aren't as many candidates or maybe that sometimes when there are female candidates that maybe they're more junior. Although, actually, Alexis, when you said that, I wondered if it's that does she 256 kind of have just a younger membership than another type of organization?
00:50:54.774 - 00:51:05.790, Speaker E: We definitely do have a younger membership. Like, I imagine if it's folks coming from traditional finance that have a lot of financial experience, we're looking at a completely different ballgame. But yeah, she 56 in particular does have, like, a younger audience.
00:51:06.210 - 00:51:25.094, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, well, but regardless, just when it comes to hiring, what do you guys think would be some good practices to help bring more women in or to have more strong female candidates for any position that you might be hiring for?
00:51:25.292 - 00:52:10.598, Speaker C: So I've thought about this a little bit more before. I think as a hiring manager, you have to be more patient and really understand that maybe the candidate on paper in front of you may not have been exposed to the same opportunities as their peers. Right. So therefore, if you look at things like tenure, how long they worked in certain industry, what job title they had previously, or what experience they've been given, on paper, it might seem like, oh, this candidate is better. Right. But really, I try to personally to look at what specific contribution they've made in their specific time that they were there and try to just speak to them. I think if I interview a female, can I ask them a lot more questions? I'm like, tell me about your experience at that time.
00:52:10.598 - 00:52:43.594, Speaker C: Delve a little bit deeper instead of just judging a resume so blankly. Because maybe, again, resume is just combinations of experience they had previously. And if we already know that the industry have issues around getting more women, or maybe they may not have the same experiences as other candidates for whatever reason, then I try to find out more characteristics about them rather than just looking and judging them on a piece of paper. Which means I have to commit more time in doing that. And I think I'm willing to. Right. So that's one thing I found to be helpful.
00:52:43.594 - 00:53:01.110, Speaker C: And another thing, obviously, is just doing more things like this, right? Speaking out more and getting more people out there and talk about this topic more so people feel comfortable that, hey, listen, Amy is someone who's pro this topic and then she's very adamant about it, and then maybe they want to apply for fireblocks, I don't know.
00:53:01.180 - 00:53:01.798, Speaker D: Right.
00:53:01.964 - 00:53:03.480, Speaker C: But anything I can do to.
00:53:05.370 - 00:53:52.022, Speaker D: Mean, I've spoken to Amy on this subject before, I guess multiple times as we're just chatting about our struggles and hiring in general. And for me it is, I think, a lot of the female candidate, they feel better, more assured when they see more women on the team or even like a female leader of the team. I think that gives them some confidence, I suppose. And so I think that start with having a more diverse team to begin with. Right. If you have an all male team in an all male company, then you're saying, hey, we care about women's issue a lot, then that kind of would seem a bit strange. But if you already have a very balanced and diverse team, then they will feel more inclined to join the first place.
00:53:52.022 - 00:54:32.642, Speaker D: And also just I think it is on us to really be their mentor and then making a point to tell them that, that you will have the support and the mentorship you're looking for. Because I think it should be important for everyone, not just for female candidates or for the women in the space, for everyone who's looking to continuously learn and grow. So just making a point that we tell everyone that. So I think that's at least how I feel while trying to build a team and a very global team as well. And my team is in Korea, in Japan and Hong Kong. Maybe in Europe and North America. Soon.
00:54:32.642 - 00:54:56.540, Speaker D: And just how do you balance also the cultural differences and then a different gender all in one together? So I think that's just challenging, but it's something that I love to work on to make sure that we have the right team, the right talent, and that should be both men and women. You shouldn't be discriminating against anyone.
00:54:57.230 - 00:56:02.442, Speaker B: And any other thoughts on how to hire and maybe draw in more female candidates from other industries? Because I will have to say, there are certain companies that I feel in crypto are quite good at this, but frankly, they're also the extremely well funded company. And so I think they have the time to kind of look at a lot of different resumes of people in adjacent industries and bring them in. But yeah, I was just curious if there are any other thoughts you had on? Because I do feel like, as we mentioned earlier, since crypto is a totally new space, that there's probably tons of women in adjacent industries who have skills that are transferable, who would be amazing hires, but it's probably going to be on the employers to seek them out. So any tips on finding them and persuading them to jump into this new area?
00:56:02.516 - 00:57:03.090, Speaker F: Yeah, I think the crypto culture, looking from the outside could seem like all this is just like nerdy like me on Twitter and it could seem like a little bit not what most women found really relatable with. So again, I think it goes back to my point earlier. It's about increasing visibility and also telling the narrative of crypto in a most concise and friendly way. And I think for that, I think platforms like she 56 is awesome. And actually recently I'm also thinking of putting together a class on crypto and also wanting to bring in female guest speakers and basically telling the narrative crypto by all women in a simple and concise way. And so hopefully that would attract more talent to participate in this industry.
00:57:03.830 - 00:57:27.450, Speaker B: All right, so since I imagine a number of people who are listening to the show are people or this panel are people who are either interested in working in the industry or are already working in it. And so what is your advice for women in the crypto industry to find their footing and make their way up?
00:57:27.600 - 00:58:01.874, Speaker E: This is a really good question and we've been thinking about it a lot at sheet 56. I'm definitely going to just plug Sheet to 56. Org because it's got a ton of resources for this exact thing. There's a Discord community where you can ask lots of questions. There's the job board where you can find tangible jobs. There's a beginner's guide which goes through like step by step, really good resources to start with. And so I would say start with the beginner's guide, hop into the Discord, ask lots and lots of questions and then jump in, choose your favorite protocol and do something to help contribute.
00:58:01.874 - 00:58:18.860, Speaker E: That could be as small as commenting on a governance proposal, which is actually a pretty big deal because those proposals are what make all the decisions for the protocol or just using it and giving feedback. Protocols love getting that kind of feedback and that helps you learn and start to find your footing, find what you're passionate about.
00:58:19.390 - 00:59:25.006, Speaker F: Yeah, I'm always happy to be a resource. So if anyone's on the show, feel free to DM me on Twitter or send me an email. Always happy here to yeah. And then the class that I was talking about earlier, I think it's a bull market, it's busy times, but I think it's worthwhile making the time to put out good content for people to digest because crypto goes cyclical, right? And every cycle it's a good time to attract new talent in. And if we are able to widen that funnel and make that on ramp easier for people to either just buy crypto or participate in the industry. That will be a great set up, a great grounding for the next generation and the next wave. And I think, looking across, I think we're already seeing improvements, like all of you guys, and back in 2017, we're just getting started.
00:59:25.006 - 00:59:32.638, Speaker F: And so, look, it's been only, what, two or three years, and I think we're making really great progress. So I'm very optimistic.
00:59:32.734 - 00:59:45.510, Speaker C: I think we spent a lot of time today talking about the difficulties, but I think the biggest, best thing to do is talk about the good things of why we all do this in the first place. Right. Most crypto industries is 24/7.
00:59:45.580 - 00:59:46.102, Speaker E: Sure.
00:59:46.236 - 01:00:20.562, Speaker C: But also you have flexible working hours, right. You meet great people who are risk takers and really are like, the best in their field and come out and have interesting ideas. Your job will not bore you. The fundamental thing I try to tell people all the time, right? It's an exciting industry that is growing. You're on the forefront of innovation, technology, you're disrupting all these great things. Yes, of course it'll be challenging, right? And there's things we can do to help. But fundamentally, I think if the message I hope everyone could receive is the risk is worth it.
01:00:20.562 - 01:00:45.386, Speaker C: Right? In the end of the day, you go home, you go to sleep at night, you feel like, I feel proud about the work I do. I'm happy with what I'm contributing. I met great friends. And this is the thing about crypto that is so different than traditional markets. Like, my clients, my competitors, my peers are like my actual friends because we just fundamentally understand each other on the same level versus in traditional markets. I would never go hang out with.
01:00:45.408 - 01:00:47.450, Speaker B: My competitors the same way I do now.
01:00:47.600 - 01:01:17.160, Speaker C: Right. So I think that's really great. And that's probably the most exciting thing also, about what we do. So there's resources out there to support you. But fundamentally, I think if there's one thing to focus on, it's just no matter the risk, in the end of the day, if you take the plunge, you start, people will help you. And it's always easier than you think to get through this.
01:01:18.490 - 01:01:48.318, Speaker D: Yeah, no, exactly. Very well said, Amy. And I think for anyone to succeed in this field is somebody who really believes in it. And I think for people who actually enjoy it, it could be challenging, it could be demanding, but we're all in it. And I wake up every day loving the space because there's so many things happening, so many new things. I always say there's never a dull day in crypto. Things will happen and there's so much innovation coming out of the space.
01:01:48.318 - 01:02:30.720, Speaker D: And I am in a field with the brightest minds and I just feel so lucky and I hope more people will feel. That way and for the women out there who are thinking about this, like Amy said, right, it's perhaps not as risky or crazy as you think it is. And we're all here to be your resources. And I hope we do more of this to get a much bigger community and to just make a stand to say that we are here, we're your resource. For anyone else who wants to join us, I think that's an important message by the end of the day, really. Just if you aren't just in the space, then you should give it a shot. I mean, the worst case is not so bad.
01:02:31.570 - 01:02:52.260, Speaker B: Great. Yeah. And earlier when Amy said you will not be bored, I second that. You will not be bored. It's definitely my favorite thing about crypto. That's why I can't imagine covering anything else ever again because I just am enthralled pretty much every day and I love it.
01:02:53.270 - 01:03:20.106, Speaker A: Our video cut out right as I was about to wrap up. So I just want to thank the panelists again for discussing a topic that many others are not willing to discuss publicly and also for their great ideas on getting more women interested in crypto and bringing them into the industry.
