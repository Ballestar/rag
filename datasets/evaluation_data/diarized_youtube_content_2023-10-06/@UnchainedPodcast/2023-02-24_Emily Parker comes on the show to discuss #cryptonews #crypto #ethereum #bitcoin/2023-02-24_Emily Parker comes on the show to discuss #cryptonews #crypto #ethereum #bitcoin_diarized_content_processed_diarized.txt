00:00:00.170 - 00:00:25.654, Speaker A: Look at the signals that the US. Is sending and look at the signals that Hong Kong is sending, or look at the signals that Japan is sending. We can talk about Japan in a minute, but we have the US basically doing this sort of regulation by enforcement the SEC cracking down on various players. Even if you agree with what the SEC is doing, I think most people in the crypto industry do not agree with the process. Right. They think that this is incredibly confusing. They think that it's going to scare crypto projects from out of the know.
00:00:25.654 - 00:00:43.698, Speaker A: The US. I think if you just take a step back and look at the message that the US. Is sending, it's kind of sending a message that crypto is something to protect people from first and foremost. Right? And so then you look at Hong Kong, and don't get me wrong. I don't think it's going to be easy to set up a crypto business in Hong Kong. Not at all. I think they're going to be very strict.
00:00:43.698 - 00:00:47.220, Speaker A: But you also kind of get the feeling that they also see it as an opportunity.
