So, you know, before FTX, I mean, especially before the summer when three arrows collapsed and the market really started taking a turn, it was very common that around would just be like, hey, this is my data room, which is like a deck and then kind of chicken scratch balance sheet. And then it's like, yeah, in or out, you got two days and I've already got a term sheet and I've got 20 other term sheets lined up. And now it's a very, very different environment. And thankfully that means one rounds are slower, they're more meticulous, they're more thoughtful, and it also means that entrepreneurs understand, hey, there's a diligence process that needs to take place, especially when you're writing a meaningful check, especially post.
