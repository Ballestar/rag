00:01:34.928 - 00:01:36.346, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:01:36.528 - 00:01:57.380, Speaker B: So we're here to discuss this upcoming upgrade to the Ethereum network called Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559. It will be a pretty substantive overhaul that will affect a number of things on Ethereum, including its monetary policy, security and user experience. Can you give an overview of what EIP one five nine does?
00:01:58.150 - 00:02:43.920, Speaker C: Sure, I can take that. So 1559 is, like you said, a pretty big change to Ethereum. And at a high level. What it does is it changes the way transactions are included in block from going to a spot where all of the blocks have a fixed size, and then the transaction fees need to vary a lot in order to get in that block to allowing blocks on Ethereum to have more of a variable size so that we can get better or tighter bounds on the fees that people pay on Ethereum. And that's really kind of the gist of it. And in order to get that right, there's a ton of adjacent changes that need to happen. And maybe it's worth taking a minute to explain kind of why we're going about it this way.
00:02:43.920 - 00:03:16.218, Speaker C: So if you look at transaction fees on Ethereum and bitcoin and most blockchains that don't have something like EIP 1559, they typically use what's called a first price auction. So that means people will just put in a bid, which is your gas price on Ethereum. And whoever has the highest bid gets included. And the problem with that is it leads to people overbidding. It's kind of like buying a house in a hot market where the house might be listed for a million dollars, but you really want it. So you put 1.1, somebody else will put 1.2,
00:03:16.218 - 00:03:30.560, Speaker C: and then somebody else come in, they'll put $1.5 million and they'll pay $1.5 million. Even though they could have paid 1.2 and $0.01, they would have still been the highest bid. So that difference is kind of a loss to them.
00:03:30.560 - 00:04:02.810, Speaker C: And outside of Blockchains, this problem is actually solved for the most part. Typically what people do is they'll use a second price auction. So the most, I think, popular implementation of that is stuff like Facebook and Google Ads. When people bid to have an ad show up in your Google search or your Ad feed, they'll do the same thing, right. Everybody will say how much they're willing to pay, but then they'll only pay the second highest price. So if I would have paid one dollars, tater would have paid $2, you would have paid $3. Your ad gets put in, but you'll pay Tater's $2 bid.
00:04:02.810 - 00:04:50.778, Speaker C: And this is kind of like the optimal economic way to do this. But the biggest problem is it requires a centralized party to look at all the bids and trustlessly say this is actually the highest and the second highest. And because we don't have this kind of central, trusted third party on Blockchains, we can't simply switch that model. And that's why we need to do something like EIP 1559, where instead we just have this value in the protocol, which we call the base fee, which tells you what's the minimum amount you need to pay to be included. And if more people want to do transactions on Ethereum, we simply raise that minimum. And if less people want to do transactions, we'll lower it. So this is a bit of background on how it works and kind of why we have to use this pretty special and sometimes convoluted yeah.
00:04:50.778 - 00:04:51.850, Speaker C: On Ethereum.
00:04:52.590 - 00:04:54.220, Speaker B: Taylor, do you want to add anything?
00:04:54.830 - 00:06:01.082, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that was a really good think. The I guess from my perspective, I think the biggest points of conversation right now are about more about the monetary policy aspect of it than all the other things, because as I was doing my research from a variety of perspectives, right, okay, I'm a wallet, I need to implement this perspective. But also I'm an Ethereum holder and I care about this stuff perspective. I was actually really surprised to see how much the sort of narrative behind the EIP has changed. And I don't necessarily think that that's the contributors to the EIP, the writers of the EIP, whatever you want to call them, I don't think it was them so much doing it. But yeah, for the last, like, oh, gosh, I guess for most of 2021, it's been more about the monetary policy and specifically about this idea that the inflation decreases and therefore the price of east goes up. Like, that very fomoy hyped up narrative was kind of overwhelming.
00:06:01.082 - 00:06:05.620, Speaker A: And that's where I guess some of my commentary has been coming from.
00:06:06.310 - 00:06:32.410, Speaker B: All right, so, yeah, we'll dive into all that in a moment. And first we'll just cover the basics on EIP 1559. But did either of you want to elaborate a little bit more on the other problems that EIP 1559 aims to solve? So there's overpayment or inefficiency of payments, but was there anything else that you feel this is trying to tackle?
00:06:32.750 - 00:07:40.078, Speaker A: Well, so one of the things that we see, I think any user of Ethereum has experienced this, right, is the fact that you don't actually know what to pay, period. Like, you're trying to send a transaction and you don't know what to pay. And part of the reason is because the wallet doesn't actually have all the information it needs, because you as the user, are the only one that knows what priority your transaction is, right? Sometimes I'm sending a transaction and it's like it's payroll or it's something like that, and I just want it to go through at some point today, and I want to be confident that it's going to get through. Obviously, there are all the DeFi farmers and the arbitragers and the traders who need that transaction now, like the next block. And so they're so hardcore about it that if it's three in three blocks, they don't want it, or if it's in two blocks, they don't want it. If it's not in the next block, they don't want it to go through. And so there's a lot of different issues where the user, the person behind the screen has information that the wallet doesn't have, that the network doesn't have, and it's just a mess, to be honest.
00:07:40.078 - 00:07:50.914, Speaker A: There's so many different factors, and all of those things coming together in the most elegant way is what this EIP is trying to solve. And I think it does a good job at a lot of them, actually. Yeah.
00:07:50.952 - 00:08:49.094, Speaker C: And maybe two things I'll add to that, like on the user part, specifically. One thing that's kind of neat about 1559 is it lets you say, what's the maximum you're willing to pay for your transaction? But then it gives you a refund for the difference between that and basically the market price, right? Whereas today, if I'm willing to pay ten GWe or 20 GWe or 50 GWe, I'll have to put that as my gas price, and that's like the amount I'll end up paying. But maybe I could have been included for twelve GWe instead of 20. So 1559 by default kind of gives you that refund. I think the other part that's kind of somewhat related to the monetary policy that I do find quite important is 1559 makes sure that transaction fees on Ethereum at the protocol need to be paid in Ether. And this is like a really if you start from from the other way and I tell you, there's this blockchain called Ethereum. Ethereum is like the currency that you use to transact on it, but you don't actually need Ether to use it.
00:08:49.094 - 00:09:27.330, Speaker C: That kind of sounds like a bug. So to me, it kind of fixes this bug in the economics where now after 1559, every transaction needs to pay at least a minimum part of the fee using Ether wallets and miners and whatnot are still free to abstract that to their users. There will be services that allow you to pay for your transaction and die, or we're even seeing some coming up with fiat and whatnot. But behind the scenes, whoever is including your transaction in the block actually needs to own Ether to pay for that transaction. And that's like a pretty fundamental part that I think was missing in Ethereum that 1559 brings.
00:09:27.750 - 00:10:10.686, Speaker B: Yeah, when I first read about that, I thought, who's going to use Ethereum and then try to pay the fee in something other than ETH? Just because it just seems like that would be the easiest way. But then when I was doing research, I actually came across this report that was like, oh, here's an example of such a transaction. And I thought, oh, okay, so people are actually doing this. We'll get more into this later. But essentially what will happen after this is adopted is that this fee is burned. And in order to have that fee be burned, it can only be burned in ETH. And so even if someone were to try to circumvent, eventually the miner would have to obtain enough ETH to pay.
00:10:10.708 - 00:10:12.186, Speaker A: That fee and have it burned.
00:10:12.378 - 00:10:35.720, Speaker B: So let's actually just dive into the fee issue because that's been probably one of the biggest pain points for Ethereum users for quite a while now. But before we get into the particulars on that, I just want to make sure the whole audience kind of has the baseline. So why don't we just kind of break down at a simple level how fees for transactions work on Ethereum right now?
00:10:36.330 - 00:11:32.490, Speaker A: So right now, if you want to send a transaction, most of the wallets will abstract this away in some capacity, but you have the gas price, which is the call. It like the multiplier, the priority, the speed, it's how fast the transaction. Right. The higher the gas price, the more the miner will be paid, and therefore the more likely the miner is going to include it in the block sooner. Like, the miners prioritize the transactions that pay them the most, over ones that pay them less, and then you have the gas limit, which is basically like how much computational power a transaction takes. And this is why a basic transfer of Ether costs less than doing some fancy crazy flash loan with like four different D Five protocols. Right? And so together, combined they create the transaction fee.
00:11:32.490 - 00:12:34.990, Speaker A: And that entire fee, it's like attached to your transaction. Whatever you're doing in your transaction, whether you're sending Ether, doing a contract or whatever you're doing that transaction fee is attached and then that Ether is moved from you to the miner who successfully mines the block. So from the miner's perspective they have all these transactions flying at them and they all are promising different amounts of money and they choose the ones that have the most money, obviously and they include those in the block next. And so if the block is full, which it is a lot these days, if the blocks are full, that's where you get into these crazy situations where, like, Uniswap does an AirDrop, and then everyone's trying to claim their uni and running around and racing. And the gas price goes from, say, five GWe all the way to 500 GWe in a matter of hours. And then me, I'm like, what's going on? I just want to run my payroll. I just want to buy my coffee.
00:12:34.990 - 00:12:46.180, Speaker A: And that's where the frustration is stemming. And it makes sense. It makes sense from the miners perspective. It makes sense from the protocols perspective. But as a user I'm just sitting there going like, screw this.
00:12:46.950 - 00:12:48.660, Speaker B: And Tim, did you want to add?
00:12:50.710 - 00:13:56.018, Speaker C: You know, I think that's a very good overview of the side of school. And one thing that's worth highlighting too is know. For example, when Uni makes an AirDrop more people want to use the chain. So it makes sense for the price to go up, right? Because the kind of demand for the chain is increasing and obviously the supply of block space is fixed. But what you start to see in those periods is people who get included in the same block will pay wildly different prices. And this is kind of the craziest part because except for the very first few transactions in a block which often are transactions with mev or arbitrage opportunities or things like that, after that, basically there's no difference whether your transaction is like the 50th or the 60th in a block, right? And ideally you'd want to pay the same price because you're getting executed at the same time. And if you look at the data right now we'll sometimes see like a five to ten X difference between the kind of 10th percentile transaction price and the sort of mean or median.
00:13:56.018 - 00:14:22.110, Speaker C: And this is what 1559 will help reduce is it won't make the price cheaper when everybody wants to use Ethereum at the same time but it'll make the range of prices that people pay kind of much tighter and it'll tell you, well, if you want to use Ethereum right now this is how much you should pay. And if the price is too high you're welcome to wait and wait until the Ud AirDrop is over but at least you know and you're not trying to kind of outbid everybody and then end up overpaying.
00:14:22.470 - 00:14:57.706, Speaker B: Yeah, I think of it a little bit like the Uber or Lyft price surging element. Exactly. Yeah. So one thing that I see confusion about sometimes online is people feel that maybe the price of ETH can be correlated with the fees. But as far as I understand, the price of ETH going up does not directly cause high fees. Right. It's that at that time, that's correlated at times of high network activities, which is what causes the gas prices to go up.
00:14:57.706 - 00:14:59.930, Speaker B: Is that a good explanation?
00:15:00.510 - 00:15:33.734, Speaker C: It always depends on what timescale you're looking at. Right. Like, well, if you look on a very short timescale, I would say the gas fees are correlated not with the price but with the volatility, mostly because of DFI. So if you see, say, ETH goes up 20% in a day, everybody will want to open take loans to go margin long on ether and that obviously creates demand for the platform. Similarly, if you see ETH drop 20% in a day, then people want to fund their loans and not get liquidated and whatnot. And that creates activity. Right.
00:15:33.734 - 00:16:14.900, Speaker C: So it's not the fact that the price is high or low, but there is some correlation between the volatility of the price and the gas fees. But it is worth noting though, that the gas price you pay is independent of the ETH USD price. Right. So if assume you have just the price going up kind of steadily without much volatility and the same amount of demand for the network, then the actual price in ETH would go down. Right. Like the two markets to start are decorated. But because you have DeFi, which uses kind of the ETH USD price as an input, obviously it blurs the two together.
00:16:16.870 - 00:17:12.018, Speaker A: There's a word for the relationship, but I can't remember it. It might be like oh God, it's like reflectively or one of those words, right. Where because this is happening over here, it's like causing this. And so there's like this relationship between them but they're not actually directly correlated. And the relationships are actually really interesting because you have the ETH USD price with the amount of wrapped bitcoin on ethereum. Now you also have the ETH bitcoin relationship and what Tim said is 100% correct in terms of the volatility because all the people who are trying to make moves, that becomes more and more urgent when there's a high spike up or a spike down. And then you also have to keep in mind with DeFi you have things like liquidating loans or arbitrage opportunities or these bots that actually are reacting to certain market conditions.
00:17:12.018 - 00:17:52.450, Speaker A: And again, if the price of ETH is generally stable, your loan isn't going to be liquidated, which means that the arbitragers aren't going to be doing these two things at one time to try to make money. You don't have the bots running around chasing the loans, all of those things are just not happening. And so it'll be interesting. But another thing to keep in mind is the demand for Ethereum. Technically, usually when we say about markets, it usually means higher demand for Ethereum means that the ETH price does go up as well. So that's like another relationship. And so you just have all of these relationships intertwined.
00:17:52.450 - 00:18:00.760, Speaker A: I don't think any of them are directly correlated, but they do have this whatever, reactionary relationship to one another.
00:18:01.770 - 00:18:18.060, Speaker B: Okay, so now that we've kind of just set the picture of how things work right now and kind of what some of the issues are, let's dive into more details on how EIP 1559 changes, how fees are calculated on Ethereum and we can get more granular now.
00:18:18.430 - 00:19:15.310, Speaker C: Okay, I can give like the protocol view and then I think Taylor can maybe talk through how wallets will actually show this to users. So at a very basic level, 1559 does like three main protocol changes. The first is that it introduces a new transaction type on Ethereum. So this is something that's sometimes misunderstood legacy transactions, like transactions with gas prices will still be possible. They'll still burn Ether behind the scene. But if you're using a wallet, or if you are a wallet and you don't want to update, you don't want to support 1559, it's optional, right? Like you don't need to actually change the types of transactions you send. But with the EIP, we introduced a new type of transaction which has a few benefits and basically that new type of transaction will not have a gas price like the legacy transactions on Ethereum and instead will have two components to the price paid.
00:19:15.310 - 00:19:54.570, Speaker C: One is called the max fee or maximum fee, and the other one is called the priority fee. In the past, this was called the tip. So if you hear about the tip, they're basically synonymous. And the max fee, like I mentioned earlier, is basically the maximum amount you're willing to pay for your transaction. And the priority fee is the maximum amount you're willing to give a minor for your transaction. So this is all that changes on the transaction side on the Ethereum blocks, every block will now have what's called a base fee. And this base fee specifies what's the minimum gas price basically that a transaction needs to pay to be valid in this block.
00:19:54.570 - 00:20:53.694, Speaker C: And so what this means is if you send a transaction with a maximum fee that's lower than the base fee, that transaction is no longer valid. And this is really interesting because today, for example, the gas prices today are roughly 20 guay. If I send a transaction with one guay, it's not actually invalid even though it might never be included. And this causes a lot of drag on the system because you can't put a clear line of like, oh, this transaction in and this transaction is out. So after 1559, we'll have a really clear view into the transaction pool of these transactions could actually be in the block and these could not. And finally, sorry, the last protocol change that we make is blocks go from being having a fixed size to having a variable size. So right now on Ethereum we have a gas limit which is the equivalent of the block limit in Bitcoin, which says this is the maximum amount of transactions that can go in.
00:20:53.694 - 00:21:44.710, Speaker C: And because of demand for the network, blocks are basically always full. So if you're like a wallet or an app developer or anyone who's kind of interacting with the network, your default assumption is like there's no room in the block, right? Like everything is always full. What 1559 does is it doubles the block size on Ethereum and it aims to keep it 50% full. And when blocks are more than 50% full, we simply raise the minimum price until it's back to 50% full again. And if it's less, we'll simply lower the minimum price to kind of induce demand. So that means that when you're sending a transaction on average, there's always going to be kind of extra room in the next block to include you as long as you pay this minimum price. And this is like a really nice property because today if I send a transaction, say gas prices are 20, I send my transaction and it just kind of shifts a little bit on me and it moves to 25.
00:21:44.710 - 00:22:26.090, Speaker C: I might end up waiting 510 minutes and not knowing exactly when my transaction and then I'll speed it up on MetaMask because I actually don't want to wait 510 minutes. Whereas after 1559 I could just say, look, the maximum I'm willing to pay is like 50. So even if the next block was 20 but it was full, I kind of missed that one. Then maybe the minimum price in the next block is like 23, 24 and then I get included in that one and I'll get the refund from the 50 -24 so yeah at a protocol level this is basically what it changes. And last thing, as we mentioned earlier, is obviously this transaction fee. So this base fee needs to be paid with Ether directly from the account that's sending the transaction.
00:22:27.630 - 00:22:30.940, Speaker A: Yes, that was good. That was a lot, but that was good.
00:22:32.590 - 00:22:35.550, Speaker B: And now do you want to talk about it from the wallet perspective?
00:22:35.970 - 00:23:33.550, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, I love that tim said that from a Wallace perspective, all the blocks are full all the time and yeah, that's our perspective because when the blocks aren't full, we don't have to deal with it. Like we don't get support tickets, I can pay my payroll, users can just go about their lives and if the fiasima student isn't perfect, it's fine, it's still included, everyone's happy and also people aren't paying as much, right? And that's also like happy users. Whereas when the blocks are full. Not only are they paying more, but if there's like a weird token and you're trying to send in the gas limit, estimation is off for whatever reason. There's a variety of reasons this happens, but then the transaction fails, but you still pay a certain amount for a failed transaction, and that's like a really bad experience. Back in the ICO days, people would be like, I didn't get into this ICO and I still paid you. You are the devil.
00:23:33.550 - 00:24:11.050, Speaker A: And I was like, no, it goes to the miners. I'm answering this for free. Sorry. So all of those reasons is why we're so focused on these high congestion periods. Because when everything's swimming along smoothly, we're happy, users are happy, everyone's happy. And so I think that when I look at the EIP one five nine, I'm looking at, I think, normalish times, meaning that when either the demand is stable or sorry, the base is stable, it's not increasing, everything's happy, then, yeah, we're all going to be happy. Yay.
00:24:11.050 - 00:25:12.526, Speaker A: And so then the question is, okay, so what happens when things are congested? And for wallets, another question that we ask ourselves are like, what are the edge cases? Right? Because in a world where we're responsible for even a noncustodial wallet, we still have a major impact on what people pay and whether or not their transactions are not successful. And it's like always this balance between educating and showing and giving users a choice versus abstracting everything away. Because if we abstract everything away and then the user doesn't send, the transaction fails. They pay too much, they pay more than they expected, that comes back to us. The user never even really had a choice. And so that's like sort of this big mashup of hard questions that we have to answer in the design process. And that's why I think some of my criticisms of the EIP have been the writers and stuff have been like, yeah, but like, 99% of the time Taylor is going to be fine.
00:25:12.526 - 00:26:01.422, Speaker A: And I'm like, but we already are fine during those times, too. I'm worried about these other times. And I think outside the outside perspective, people on Twitter watching us are going know, I don't understand why you're what, what's going on? So that's a little background on how wallets look at stuff. I think that how we're going to handle it in general, from a very high level, right, is currently, most wallets give you look at the USD estimate of the transaction fee, and they abstract away both the gas limit and the gas price. And then there's various levels of advanced mode if the user does want to give input on how much they're willing to pay. So if they want it to be faster or slower. And that's going to change.
00:26:01.422 - 00:27:12.790, Speaker A: Because the biggest thing is, I think for me personally, the biggest mind shift is moving from speed to priority, which we already have sort of done. It's like a brain split. Right now, sometimes we're thinking about how fast the transaction is going to be mined versus what priority it is in the block. But specifically with the CIP, we're thinking a lot more about priority of the transaction. And it's interesting that that has also come along with the CIP, with everything else, actually giving the user, I guess, that information or framing it in that way for the user so that they can also have that mindset. So that, again, they're going to have that education or that information to make the informed decision with the information that only they have. And I think that the UI specifically is probably going to remain it's going to be slightly different, obviously, but I think that in general, the user is going to be presented with some sort of selector or slider or choice, and the transaction fee is going to be displayed in USD, and it's going to be a slight estimate.
00:27:12.790 - 00:27:43.514, Speaker A: I think that now we're probably going to have a range rather than rate. Now, MetaMask and Rui both show a single value. You're going to pay about $5.83 for this transaction. It's probably going to change so that we show you're going to pay between $5.83 and ten point $79. And that's a whole nother question for me, especially because it just changes, right? Like, as a user, I can definitely make a choice.
00:27:43.514 - 00:28:33.620, Speaker A: Like I am willing to pay $5.83. Saying I'm willing to pay between $5.83 and $10.72 is like a different choice, right? So we've been going back and forth on like, do we want to give them just the highest one? But does that actually set them up for failure if they always get like half of that back? Right, so if I send a transaction every single day for a year and I say I'm willing to pay $10 and then I get $5 back, I only end up paying $5, right. And then one day I am like, yeah, I'm willing to pay $20 because I'm actually willing to pay $10, but the network is congested, so I actually pay $20, but I wasn't actually willing to pay $20. Right. Those are the UX issues.
00:28:33.620 - 00:28:46.786, Speaker A: It's a lot. And yes, it's going to be for the times of high congestion where things are rapidly scaling up, but they are hard problems to solve. Yeah.
00:28:46.888 - 00:29:59.350, Speaker B: And we're going to get into this more in a moment because there's something that I was wondering about when I was researching this, which is about there's this flexible block size, but we have these periods where there can be congestion kind of for a while. And so it's like, well, if you're trying to target this 15 million gas, what's to stop it from always maxing out at the 30? And then how do you get back down to the 15? Because maybe, what, you're just going to have miners that are mining empty blocks for a while. Or anyway, but let's talk about that right after this word from our sponsors who make the show possible. Do you want to trade gold, currencies or even bananas on Ethereum?

00:31:38.780 - 00:32:05.454, Speaker B: So I kind of asked the question right before the break, but yeah, can you just talk about this flexible block size? Because I just had the founder of Polygon on my show and he was saying, oh, even when E Two is adopted, we imagine it'll get full very quickly, and so there will still be a need for Polygon. And so I was just like, yeah, that's probably true. How are you going to keep this average block?
00:32:05.582 - 00:33:07.298, Speaker C: I think here it's helpful to differentiate between the long term average and the short term spikes. And to answer your question, it's like, why won't blocks just be full forever? The short answer there is it's the speed at which this base fee increases. Right? So right now, the base fee increases if you have a full block, it goes up by twelve and a half percent in the next block, and that takes roughly five minutes to ten x and it's exponential after that. So it means in ten minutes the gas prices are up 100 x, and in 15 minutes of full blocks, gas prices are up 1000 X. And just to put this in context and the entire history of Ethereum, we've seen roughly 1000 X variance in gas prices from the very start up to now, and that's kind of upper range. So that means that in practice, it would be extremely rare to see something like 15 minutes at full blocks because at some price people are just not willing to pay. Right? So what happens is prices is 20 GWe, and then it goes up to like 5100, 250, whatever, 500 GWe.
00:33:07.298 - 00:34:05.980, Speaker C: At 500 GWe, nobody's willing to pay the base fee or less people than half the block are. So then the gas prices start coming back slow again and it reaches kind of this equilibrium again, where what's the price? At which there's about 15 million gas worth of demand. And one thing that's that's nice about that is it means this kind of spike in usage is processed twice as quick as it would be today. Because for this short period of time where there's a bunch of people willing to pay super high fees, we have blocks that are twice the size as they are. But if you look over kind of a long term average, you might have a lot of these small spikes, but you won't just see some major spike forever. Because I think I calculated but after to fill something like 100 or 200 blocks, you're burning like 100,000 ETH, right, in terms of transaction fees. So it's just the speed at which this basically increases limits how long these spikes can last.
00:34:07.070 - 00:34:13.150, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. So basically at a certain point, it'll only be whales who will be transacting.
00:34:14.210 - 00:34:20.000, Speaker C: Well, at some point the whales have done their transaction and then it's back to everybody else.
00:34:22.050 - 00:35:15.060, Speaker A: By the way, we see this currently, right? The Uni AirDrop is one example, but also on whatever, black Thursday, black Tuesday, whatever it was March twelveTH, when the whole world collapsed or whatever and Maker collapsed. There was this chain reaction of all these things that happened from the real world to the crypto world to the Bitcoin world to the ETH world to the Oracle world. Like everyone was impacted and we saw such high gas prices because there was an insane amount of volatility, but also an insane amount of money to be made. Both if you were going to liquidate something, like you could make money, but also if you want to prevent yourself from being liquidated. So everyone was in this boat of like, I need this transaction on network in everyone else is like, I'm just going to sit here and not do that.
00:35:16.230 - 00:35:23.460, Speaker C: And this is exactly like Uber search pricing, right? Like you were mentioning earlier, it's like getting a Uber on New Year's Eve, basically.
00:35:23.830 - 00:35:53.238, Speaker A: Yeah. And you're like, I'll wait, even that period of time. We're not talking about months, we're not even talking about weeks. We're talking about days in terms of that high pricing. So it'll be interesting to see how, I guess, the base fee reacts both upwards and then downwards. Right. Because we do talk a lot about how the base fee moves up, but we don't talk about what the conditions are to make the base fee go back down.
00:35:53.238 - 00:36:16.226, Speaker A: Right. Because currently you get up to 500 G way and then black, whatever happens, and you're at 1000 G way and you're dying, and then it comes back down naturally. Now, that's actually at a protocol level as well. So I don't know, the Devs and the researchers, they're very confident in this, so I have faith in them, but I don't personally understand it.
00:36:16.408 - 00:37:03.394, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess just to touch on that the way it goes up or down is if a block is empty, it's down twelve and a half percent. If a block is full, it's up twelve and a half percent. And it's a linear curve. If you are very math savvy, you will realize that that means it comes down a bit slower than it goes up because just how fractions work. And that's like a small edge case where we'll probably change that in a future iteration of 1559. But it doesn't change, like the fundamental design where imagine you get to a spot where you've processed these thousand guay transactions, then the next block might be 25% full, right, rather than 50 with like 800 guay transactions. And so these transactions will get into that next block and then the fee will lower again.
00:37:03.394 - 00:37:58.180, Speaker C: And then maybe you're doing like the 600 GUI transactions and kind of clearing your backlog that way until you're back to the kind of normal equilibrium of whatever the gas price was before that surge. And I think I've been roughly tracking them. This is not super data driven, but it feels to me like about once a quarter we have these kind of you can't really call them Black Swan because they're so frequent. But these events where everybody needs to transact on chain right now, that seems to be roughly the frequency. So in the absolute worst case, it's also worth noting that when everybody's trying to outcompete each other to get their transaction in, in these crazy periods, that's basically the system we have today, right, where today, all the time, in every block, people are trying to outcompete each other to get included in this limited block size. So the part that I synthesize a lot with wallets is they need to keep supporting both forever. Because like you said, Taylor, this 1% is really important.
00:37:58.180 - 00:38:11.770, Speaker C: But from the end user's perspective, it's like the average case today becomes kind of their worst case 1% of the time. And then whenever that's not the case, the system is much simpler and has better guarantees around inclusion.
00:38:12.270 - 00:39:33.806, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I think that one thing to point out from me, a wallet's perspective, is that initially I was sort of looking at it like, okay, we need to, I guess, build a system that addresses, that gives the user this transaction fee range that's going to be obviously accurate in all conditions, all the time. And you have periods where it's stable, you have periods going up, you have periods going down, and how do we create the system? And stuff like that. But one thing that I guess I've sort of changed is we need to really, I guess, drill into the user's needs, right? Letting the user say what priority that they want their transaction to be included at and giving. Them some semblance of approximate price in probably denominated USD so that they understand how much they're going to be paying for this, so they can make that informed decision. And then we or the network have the information of how congested the network is, what the current base fee is. We can look at the priority, the tips, we can look at those as well and see what they've been either over a period of blocks, like the last 50 blocks, or last 5000 blocks or the last one block.
00:39:33.806 - 00:40:24.290, Speaker A: However we want to calculate it. Right now it's all the same, right? So right now we look and however people are estimating the gas price, they're looking at the past and they're guesstimating what the inclusion will be for the next block all the time. And so there's basically just this one scenario. What we're looking at now is, okay, there's not one scenario anymore. There's not a one size fits all. We only should give them this very high price range, right, the or the in those periods of uncertainty, we don't have to give it to them all the time. And that's one of the things that I think a lot of people, if they have experience, like on the wallet side, or even if they're like an exchange, right, if they're sending transactions on other people's behalf, that's a huge mind shift.
00:40:24.290 - 00:41:15.910, Speaker A: It really is a huge mind shift. I guess the range of the information that you're giving the user is tighter. It's actually directly correlated, or should be directly correlated with the volatility of the base fear, the priority fees or the network, however you want to look at it. And so again, if everything's generally okay with the network, everything's generally stable, we can potentially give them still like about $5 fee. And that will be like the 99% of the time and then catching those edge cases and the 1% probably like I mean, if it was me, right, I would be like, hey, think twice before you do this because stuff's blowing up and you might pay $50 or you might pay $100. We don't really know. Good luck.
00:41:15.910 - 00:41:22.134, Speaker A: Especially for that first Black Swan event, right?
00:41:22.172 - 00:42:03.730, Speaker B: Just be like, that would be hilarious. But actually one thing I wanted to ask about was earlier I mentioned the transition at ethereum 2.0, which obviously is an actual scaling solution and so is meant to address the congestion issue. So between the two, because we'll have 1559 first, and then we'll move to ethereum 2.0 between the two, this kind of like greater efficiency and fees and then improved scalability, do you think that maybe that will reduce the number of these kind of times when there's just like high congestion, these quasi black swans? Yeah. What's your prediction for what it will look like when the two are both adopted?
00:42:04.150 - 00:42:56.814, Speaker A: So I think the black swans are actually going to continue on or the frequency of the black swans is going to change not because of e two or because of this EIP or anything. It's going to change just in general over time as ethereum as a network matures. So e two is obviously part of that, but it's more about the maturity of the network. And we've seen this a bit with bitcoin, and you've seen, I'm sure, when people talk about the need for stablecoins and the fact that bitcoin is worthless because it's volatile and you can never buy coffee with it. And those types of arguments. I think that that over time it starts off very volatile and then over time we're going to see that curve sort of flatten. That's probably going to be, in my opinion, the biggest change with both the frequency and whether we're talking about 1000 x volatility or 100 x volatility.
00:42:56.814 - 00:42:58.870, Speaker A: Yeah, just probably time and maturity.
00:42:59.610 - 00:43:07.526, Speaker B: Wait, I'm sorry, so you're saying that because you think the price of ETH will go up, then we'll face other kinds of criticism? Is that what you're saying?
00:43:07.708 - 00:43:39.490, Speaker A: No, I'm just saying that e two isn't going to probably directly impact the frequency of black swans. It's just the fact that ethereum, as it becomes more mature, it becomes less volatile, so then there will be less frequent block swans. And when a block swan does happen, it's just less right. In my opinion, we're probably never going to see another March twelveTH again. Right? Because it's just right now they say it's going to happen tomorrow.
00:43:42.630 - 00:43:44.020, Speaker C: Famous last words.
00:43:48.710 - 00:44:18.798, Speaker A: I'm very interested to see how Esu does impact over the long term, right over like the year time period rather than the minute time period. Because I think that with both this EIP and with e two, in the short term, we will see everything will be happy for a short period of time. Right. There will be enough room in the blocks. That's how these things typically work. We saw it a little bit when we increased the max block size. Everything was happy for like a week.
00:44:18.798 - 00:44:20.910, Speaker A: It was really cool for a week.
00:44:21.060 - 00:44:24.240, Speaker B: And Tim, I cut you off earlier. What were you going to say?
00:44:25.010 - 00:45:18.020, Speaker C: Yeah, I suspect we'll probably have more and more localized black swans, if that makes sense. So the main way that we're actually scaling computation in the next one to three years is like through roll ups, right? And we're already seeing some go live. You've seen also these sidechain solutions like polygon. So what I suspect is going to happen is as more and more activity moves to stuff like roll ups, stuff like polygon, you might see these maxwans, like on this specific roll up, right? Like where, I don't know, maybe on polygon something happens and there might be some cases where it happens across the entire ecosystem. You saw the March 20 where there's just a crash across everything. So that'll be like a mega one. But I wouldn't be surprised if you just see these kind of micro black swans or something happen on different roll ups at different times just because the arbitrage opportunities are different, stuff like that.
00:45:18.020 - 00:45:41.020, Speaker C: And that kind of leads the main chain to operate a bit more smoothly. Yeah, so that would be my prediction. I still suspect though, we're nowhere near the smooth selling, at least for the next couple of years. There will be some other stuff, there will be things that happen that just create huge volatility in crypto and that's kind of part of the space we work in.
00:45:41.630 - 00:46:32.060, Speaker B: So as we mentioned before, EIP 1559 will also change ETH's monetary policy because since those base fees will be burned, that leads the potential for ETH to become deflationary, which, if people are familiar with Bitcoin, should lead to the price going up as adoption increases. So one thing that I've kind of heard about a little bit is that there are rumplings that miners aren't super excited about this because that will at least reduce kind of in absolute terms the amount that they'll take home in ETH. But I just wondered, I don't know if there have been any studies done on this, but given that the dollar value may rise in conjunction, how do you expect that this will actually impact miner revenue? And we'll say in dollars?
00:46:32.910 - 00:47:09.858, Speaker C: Yeah, I can take that one. I've spent a lot of time talking with miners. Miners have a lot of variability in their business model outside of 1559. Right? The first one you just mentioned is like the ETH USD price, right? Like if they mine two ETH worth 4000 versus worth 2000 versus worth $1,000, their expenses are like electricity and machines that they pay with Fiat. So that has a big impact. The second big factor is hash rate. So how many underminers are there so they can maintain all of their cost fixed? Their price of E can stay fixed.
00:47:09.858 - 00:47:47.186, Speaker C: But if more people mine, then it becomes more competitive and their ODS of getting a block drops, so their revenue is also effectively lowered. And then the third part, that's kind of variable in their income is transaction fees. And you can think about two classes of transaction fees. There's just like the general fees that everybody pays and there's fees for arbitrage opportunities. People call it mev minor extractable value. So this is the fee that people are willing to pay for the top arbitrage opportunities on Ethereum after 1559. Obviously we're not going to change anything with regards to the hash rate.
00:47:47.186 - 00:48:18.102, Speaker C: So that variable is kind of out of our control. The ETH USD price, I think is very hard to speculate on. So even though a lot of people make the argument that 1559 reduces the supply with every transaction and so if you have the same supply, or if you have a smaller supply, the same market cap, the price should go up. Yes, that's true. But that's true if you consider no other factors affect the price of Ether. And that's just not true in practice. Right? There's so many things that have a much greater impact.
00:48:18.102 - 00:49:38.680, Speaker C: I'm not saying 1559 will be negative for the price or positive, but it's like 1559 over the long run burns part of the supply. But in two months, or like on any short time frame, there's 1000 things that can happen that impact the ETH price to a much greater extent. And lastly, one thing that's worth mentioning is miners are paid to secure the network, right? That's kind of the whole point. They should not necessarily get more or less money based on how many people want to transact because the security needs of the network do not change based on that, right? In practice they change a bit and they will, even after 1559, get slightly more money when more people want to transact. But there's no reason for them to get all of that surplus, right? So with all that being said, it's kind of hard to estimate exactly how much 1559 will impact minor revenue because first of all, transaction fees on the network are very volatile, right? Like, if we would have had this podcast three months ago, gas prices were like 500 guay and at that point, transaction fees were actually higher on average than block rewards for the miners. So miners were upset because they were like, well, you're taking away half our revenue, right? Today gas prices are like 20 GWe. And so transaction fees are back to like a small subset of the block value.
00:49:38.680 - 00:50:15.114, Speaker C: And it's worth noting, again, it's not all of the transaction fees that will be burnt because people who still want to have arbitrage opportunities, so who are competing for a specific slot in the block, they'll still want to pay the miner a lot of money to get that slot. And the burn in 1559 doesn't change that. So there's been different estimates done. They vary from 25% of transaction fees burned to 75%. So it's extremely hard to tell you this is how much exactly we'll see burnt. It is like a pretty volatile industry to be mining. And sorry, one final comment.
00:50:15.114 - 00:50:51.180, Speaker C: Is it's worth noting also for miners, if there's some listening, mining will also be ending on Ethereum pretty soon, right? Like we are moving to proof of stake. The most optimistic people are targeting the end of the year. Maybe more realistic is like early next year. Worst case is probably, I don't know, mid next year, kind of everything goes wrong and we need to fix a bunch of things. There's not really a world where there's like proof of work for call it more than a year in the most optimistic case on Ethereum. And that also factors a lot in miners decisions to buy equipment and to get started.
00:50:52.130 - 00:51:03.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I've heard some rumblings that miners might try to keep EIP 1559 from being adopted, but does that look like a likely scenario to you at all?
00:51:04.150 - 00:51:43.174, Speaker C: So I haven't seen any kind of proposal to fork Ethereum when the London upgrade happens. If miners or part of the community wants to do that, they're right. That's kind of what's nice about Blockchains. I think one part here that's really important, though, is the power that all of the Ethereum community has to coordinate around what they want to call Ethereum. Because basically any project that relies on anything off chain needs to target a specific fork when that happens. Right. Like the most obvious example is stuff like Fiat collateralized Stablecoins.
00:51:43.174 - 00:52:20.330, Speaker C: Right. If there's a fork on Ethereum, your USDC in a bank account, like dollars that back the USDC do not double. So they need to say, this is where it's valid. Any project that uses just an ETH USD price from an Oracle also needs to say, what's the price that we're looking at? And even things like the Beacon chain deposit Contract, right? Like the Beacon chain follows one chain to credit that Ether back onto the beacon chain. And so they also need to decide which fork they follow. And so I think this is something where, look, core developers are obviously putting this upgrade out. As I see it, there's like tremendous support in the community and it seems like all those projects will rally around that fork.
00:52:20.330 - 00:52:38.362, Speaker C: And if miners or another group wants to start their own competing fork, like they're free to. And then at that point it becomes all these actors that need to coordinate about what they want to support. To be clear, I'm not aware of such a fork being planned.
00:52:38.506 - 00:52:39.200, Speaker B: No.
00:52:40.130 - 00:53:10.762, Speaker A: And it's not as easy as it used to be. I would just say it like that. But it is. Because I guess one of the things that looking back at the Dow Hard fork that I realized now that I didn't at the time was it was relatively easy to not the coordination is one aspect of it. But tell everyone that they're going to double their money, right? You're going to have two chains or even 1.5 their money, or even maybe 1.2 X their money.
00:53:10.762 - 00:54:03.962, Speaker A: That's a pretty promising promise for a lot of people, especially exchanges and stuff. But with this the risk is much higher. Because if you happen to be on the other side of the fork, I mean, just the DeFi stuff, the stable coins, the interactions between one thing and another. And even if we remove all of that, everyone right now is still battling for liquidity on one chain, right? You have all these incentives, you have subsidized rewarding, you just have all of these different things. And if there was a hard fork, you would now have all of that plus times two. You know what I mean? So it's just the amount of complexity and then the amount of risk to actually lose money, because you're not going to two extra money, you're not going to 1.2 extra money.
00:54:03.962 - 00:54:32.354, Speaker A: You might lose your money because this might happen or that might happen, or this thing that's interacting with USDC here, but USDC is on the other chain. There's so many unknowns. I honestly, at this point, think that ethereum is not unforkable. But I don't think there's a scenario where you can have a true chain split like we did in 2016. I really don't think so.
00:54:32.472 - 00:54:38.280, Speaker B: Yeah, especially because of composability on DFI. So many things would break on that side.
00:54:39.210 - 00:55:06.442, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe controversial. I think that's a good thing. If you are going to support a fork of ethereum, I don't think it should be easy to just fork the network because you see that it has like a high potential for scams. Right? And we see this with bitcoin now more than Ethereum. Funnily enough, like in 2017, it was kind of the opposite criticism. But it's very easy to fork bitcoin because it's just a set of UTXOs. So you have bitcoin gold, bitcoin silver and whatnot.
00:55:06.442 - 00:56:01.280, Speaker C: And people can just fork that to infinity and they can profit off newcomers to the space saying like, oh, this is the real bitcoin, or the better bitcoin, like the green bitcoin. Then retail gets dumped on by those projects. I think if you want to fork ethereum because you have a legit disagreement with it, I think that's fine. But being able to support sort of a DeFi collapse or having a migration path for it, to me seems like one of the many problems you will need to deal with in the next five to ten years of supporting your fork. If you can't even handle that, I don't see how your fork is going to be long term legitimate. Obviously there is like a much higher bar for forking, but I think it's because the stakes are much higher and that sort of protects newcomers in the space to some extent where there's not like a different fork of ethereum every day.
00:56:05.270 - 00:56:06.510, Speaker A: Really good comment.
00:56:06.670 - 00:56:28.578, Speaker B: So another issue that muddies this aspect of what it is that miners will earn is what's called minor extractable value or mev. And this is value that miners can earn, but they do it by reordering or censoring transactions on the blockchain. So how do you expect mev to affect minor behavior once EIP one five nine is adopted?
00:56:28.754 - 00:57:45.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So just like as a little bit of background, the reason that we have, I guess, mev is a thing and specifically a thing on ethereum and not so much on other networks is because the miners can actually get well, the people that are using Ethereum and using these DeFi protocols and using these tokens, there's this additional layer of value. And the risk and the value are very both of them are very high when you have these layers of interoperability and DeFi and just all the different pieces working together. And so what mev is, is basically someone kind of side channeling or back channeling a payment to the miner that isn't necessarily attached their transaction in this traditional way. And the reason that everyone sort of gains from this relationship is because a lot of the positions that people are entering into or getting out of or arbitraging or whatever they're doing, they have scenarios where they only want this thing to be mined under this condition. They only want it mined in this next block. But if it's not in the next block, they don't want it to be mined.
00:57:45.330 - 00:58:27.680, Speaker A: Things like that. And so because there's this whole new world with DeFi, they can actually give a higher payment to the miner in returns for sort of these additional assurances, which both increases their revenue because they can actually make these things happen, but also it decreases their risk. And so if you look at Arbitrage as a business, you do want to reduce your risk. And having a transaction fail when gas prices or transaction fees in general are super high, that's a risk. And that reduces your revenue, which reduces your profits and so on. So EIP. 1559 does affect this.
00:58:27.680 - 00:58:31.662, Speaker A: Tim, do you have insight on how it might affect it?
00:58:31.796 - 00:59:53.238, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think mev could be a whole topic for a whole show, so won't dive into that too much. But the main intersection with 1559 is how much should you pay miners to include nonmev transactions? So the way beginning, we talked about how you have your maximum fee and your priority fee or your tip that goes to the miner. The obvious reason for the priority fee is that if you burnt 100% of the transaction fees, miners would just mine empty blocks forever. Right? Why would they even bother to try and process your transaction to run a node? They could just mine empty blocks, they're not making more money and it reduce their cost. So in times when there's not huge congestions, you want the priority fee that goes to the miner to be just high enough to pay for, one, like their operational cost of actually maintaining the transaction pool, but two, the risk of their block being uncooled. So on Ethereum, because block times are shorter than bitcoin, it happens fairly frequently that two blocks are. Mined pretty close in time and then the chain forks for a short amount of time and then when the next block hits, it will decide kind of which of those two blocks was the right one and the one that isn't in the canonical chain is what we call uncooled.
00:59:53.238 - 01:00:47.450, Speaker C: And that means that those transactions don't get executed and the miners get like a much smaller reward. And because of that, miners want to push their blocks as quickly as possible on the network, right? Because once you have a new block, you want to give it to everybody so that they mine on top of you and you don't get uncooled. And the size of the block matters here because pushing a bigger block is harder than pushing a smaller block on the network. The more transactions you're going to fit into a block, the more for the miner. They need to be paid a lot for that because they risk losing it all if the block is too big. And where this intersects with mev is because like Taylor was saying, a lot of these mev transactions are time sensitive and very high value. People will be willing to pay the miner a lot of money, but only if this transaction happens now and it's included in the canonical chain.
01:00:47.450 - 01:02:11.718, Speaker C: So that means that mev kind of changes basically the uncle risk for miners. Like how bad is it for your block to not be on chain because without mev it was just a function of the block reward, right? Like you get a smaller block reward if you're not included in the main chain and it's very easy to calculate how frequent are uncles based on the size, what's the block reward for uncles and so what should the minimum tip be to kind of offset that risk? Because mev is variable, sometimes there's just more opportunities for arbitrage and sometimes not. It gets a bit trickier to figure out what's the minimum tip that you should give. We've come up, I say we credit goes to Bartabe from the Ethereum Foundation. I did not do anything in this. So Bartebe has come up with basically a fancy algorithm that looks at like, okay, what's the average mev in a block? What's kind of the nintieth percentile mev in a block? And based on that and based on how big blocks are, what's like the right default priority fee that you should put in your transaction? And it's kind of a long way of saying that over time we're probably going to have to adjust what's the minimum or the default priority fee based on the amount of mev that miners are able to extract. Once you have the formula for how to do it, it's not hard, you just plug kind of the numbers.
01:02:11.718 - 01:02:23.180, Speaker C: But it was a bit of work to actually kind of derive what's the right amount that we should compensate miners so that when they have mev transactions as a block. They don't just ignore everything else.
01:02:24.750 - 01:03:13.610, Speaker B: Yeah, and this goes to what we were saying earlier about how we don't really know how much this will affect what miners can earn because of we're not sure exactly how much will be burned of the base fee. All right, so last topic. And by the way, this also could be its own show. And for those of you who listen to a lot of crypto podcasts, I'm sure you will know that it is often its own show, but we will just touch on it very briefly. A lot of people are talking about how EIP 1559 and Ethereum 2.0 could turn ETH into what they're calling sound money. And what's interesting is, as I'm sure you're all well aware, for pretty much all of its history, ethereum's Issuance has always been higher than bitcoin's, and it looks like that might change after EIP 1559.
01:03:13.610 - 01:03:20.540, Speaker B: So can both of you talk a little bit about how you think this will change the perception of ETH as money?
01:03:21.790 - 01:04:11.830, Speaker A: I think the most interesting thing about this ETH as money or ETH as sound money or ultrasound money or whatever that narrative. I think the most interesting thing about it is that historically yeah. Bitcoin has sort of looked down on ETH as not down money whatsoever, because not only has the Issuance rate been higher, but it's been kind of unknown. Right. We can just hard work and change it whenever we want, et cetera, et cetera. That's been the perception. The fact that this narrative is taken off makes total sense in that regard, because when you're constantly being attacked for a personality trait, let's call it, if you then can change it, it's a really valid argument's, a really valid slapback.
01:04:11.830 - 01:05:03.822, Speaker A: And then to couple that with the fact that we might actually do better than bitcoin yeah, it makes sense why the narrative, especially on places like Twitter, is taking off. All that said, I think that what people lose sight of a bit is the fact that these Twitter wars or Twitter drama or like ETH first bitcoin or whatever, that's still going to exist. That's how arguments on the Internet work. It doesn't matter if we have a valid response to the bitcoin maxis, they're still going to find something wrong with Ethereum. That's how it works. I guess what I'm watching carefully is I'm more interested in how the bitcoin maximalist argument evolves in response to this. Because for me personally, I'm more interested in the narratives and the people and the interactions than whether or not any of this is actually money.
01:05:03.822 - 01:05:19.106, Speaker A: Because I think everyone has a chance to I think both bitcoin and ETH have a chance to be money in the future. Both are well on their way. We are not there yet. As much as we want to be. We are not there yet.
01:05:19.288 - 01:05:27.880, Speaker B: That's interesting. I actually think they both are money in the sense that people accept them and they have value. But anyway all right, Tim, what about you?
01:05:28.810 - 01:06:10.302, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I can take a minute to talk about the numbers behind why people say why this ultrasound money meme exists. So the idea is, like, right now, the block reward on ETH is two ETH per block. I think if you look at the number of blocks per day, that gives something around, like, I think it was 13, 14,000 ETH per day. It changes a bit based on the uncle rewards. But call it like, say, 15,000 if you wanted a high round number. It's obviously a very high issuance rate, higher than bitcoin. And as of today, it's basically only inflation, right? Like, we have no deflationary mechanism in ethereum.
01:06:10.302 - 01:07:03.518, Speaker C: So 1559, like we've talked about at length, will burn the base fee, part of the transaction fee. And that's sort of clarifying it doesn't burn the whole fee. The part that goes to the miners is not burned. So if depending on the breakdown there, that obviously changes the models a lot. But as part of the transaction fees get burned, it does add like a deflationary pressure that offsets this issuance that we have. So on proof of work, I calculated these numbers a couple of weeks ago, it might not be 100% right, but roughly right, I think a base fee of roughly 150 GWe for a 15 million gas block would offset basically the two ETH issuance in that block. So that means that if we saw consistently that the base fee was 150 GWe and we kept the same issuance on proof of work, then on average, ETH would be deflationary.
01:07:03.518 - 01:07:58.118, Speaker C: And in practice, that might vary, right? Like, maybe there's a block where it goes up higher and that block is deflationary and you can choose whatever time period you want to do that analysis, but that's based on the fact that issuance is quite high because of proof of work. When we move to proof of stake and on the beacon chain, today issuance is drastically reduced. I forget the numbers exactly again, but they're roughly somewhere between one eight and one 10th. Even if you assume that there's way more people that stake after the merge. So that means that instead of needing your base fee of 150 to be deflationary, you're probably looking at needing a base fee of closer to like 15 GWe to be deflationary. And so when people kind of say this ultrasound money narrative, this is kind of what they mean. It's like, on one hand, we're going to reduce the issuance a lot by shutting down proof of work, and then on the other hand, we're going to have this deflationary pressure that comes from EIP 1559.
01:07:58.118 - 01:08:41.490, Speaker C: That's kind of a narrative. And people like to use it in kind of the conversations against bitcoiners, as Tater mentioned. But, yeah, I think it's just worth looking at the numbers. It's worth mentioning. 1559 does not make ether deflationary kind of just by snapping his fingers, like you need some certain level of demand. And personally, I think what is really valuable is that over the long term, if more people want to use Ethereum, then yes, it does create kind of this pressure on the supply. And again, if you think about how Ethereum should work, like if you knew nothing about Ethereum, it would make sense to think as more people want to use Ethereum, there should be some way for the network to capture that value.
01:08:41.490 - 01:09:23.022, Speaker C: Right? And that's kind of what 1559 gives. It doesn't capture 100% of it. A lot of it will still go to miners to validators and whatnot, but it captures kind of some portion that means that over the long term it's kind of healthy that the network can capture that. And sorry, one final comment here. It's worth noting. People talk a lot about the ETH price and whatnot, and one way to think about the ETH price is also like the network value of Ethereum is kind of the economic bandwidth we have on the network. And because ETH is used as collateral and to fund stuff, the higher the network value, it means more USD value.
01:09:23.022 - 01:09:41.320, Speaker C: ETH can be used to open loans on DeFi to fund projects and stuff like that. So I think beyond just the fact that obviously the price appreciation is nice for holders, it's worth noting that as the total value of Ethereum goes up, we can just support more things on the network and that's a really valuable property.
01:09:42.650 - 01:10:13.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with all of that. And I find it the fact that you kind of reverted to more like facts. I find that somehow very Ethereum foundation ish because I'm sure you're well aware that for a long time they and I'm not sure how it is now, but for a long time there were edicts against talking about price too much. All right, so when will EIP 1559 be adopted?
01:10:13.970 - 01:10:48.394, Speaker C: We are June 23. As we're recording this, 1559 will go live on Robston today. So by the time people hear this podcast, it will already be live on Robston. Then it's going to go live on Gordon. Yeah, Robson is the proof of work testnet for Ethereum. Then it will go live on Gordy, which is the proof of authority multi client testnet for Ethereum on June 30 and then it will go live on Rinkabee, which is our third testnet on July 7. Because this is such a big change, we want to wait and see how it goes for testnets before we schedule a date for Main.
01:10:48.394 - 01:11:09.540, Speaker C: Net if I had to guess right now, I suspect late July to mid August is kind of the range we're looking at for deployment on Mainnet. I don't see a case where it's earlier than late July. If we found an issue and whatnot it might be delayed a few weeks the time that we fix it, but late July august is when we're looking at it.
01:11:09.910 - 01:11:23.814, Speaker B: All right, well, thank you both so much for discussing this issue. I know it's been hot topic around crypto, Twitter, and elsewhere. Where can people learn more about each of you and EIP 1559?
01:11:24.012 - 01:11:28.402, Speaker A: Yeah, you can find me on Twitter. I'm. Tayvano.
01:11:28.466 - 01:11:28.646, Speaker C: Tayvano.
01:11:28.668 - 01:12:04.100, Speaker A: And then an underscore at the end because I need to change that. That's the best place to find me, or at MyCrypto. My product is MyCrypto.com and I love Twitter, so definitely find me on Twitter. And Tim's going to give you a bunch of resources, but I will say the best 1559 resource of all the resources is actually this one called the EIP 1559 Resources List, which then has all of the other resources linked to it. Maybe we can link it in the Show notes or something.
01:12:04.550 - 01:12:05.860, Speaker B: That's a great idea.
01:12:06.790 - 01:12:36.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm on Twitter as well. Tim Baco. So at T-I-M-B-E-I-K-O So if you have any questions or concerns about 1559, you can reach me there. Yeah, I do have this Hack MD document which is a list of different 1559 resources, so just some intro materials if people want to learn about it. There's sections about miners, about UX, about econ, so whatever kind of part you're interested in, there should be something there for you. So, yeah, we can definitely add that to the Show Notes.
01:12:36.330 - 01:12:40.814, Speaker B: Perfect. Well, it's been so great having you both on Unchained. Thank you so much.
01:12:40.932 - 01:12:41.998, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
01:12:42.084 - 01:12:44.222, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Have a good one.
01:12:44.276 - 01:12:56.450, Speaker B: Thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about Taylor, Tim, and EIP 1559, check out the Show notes for this episode. Unchained is produced by me, Laura Shin, with help from Anthony Yoon, Daniel Ness, and Mark Murdoch. Thanks for listening.
