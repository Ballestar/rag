00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.298, Speaker A: I think it goes back again to the point at the beginning, like, can it be used maliciously? And it definitely can. So if the team decides to use their power for any reason, whether it's they just want to go away with the funds or they don't like where people are moving their money, they can abuse that power. And the only way to mitigate that really is again, to have these third party arbitrators or these services that basically intervene in that or have a more extensive governance process. But this is not a problem that is unique to Circle Breakers. Any project that has centralized keys can have this at any time. And it's a surprising amount. Protocols.
00:00:31.298 - 00:00:59.820, Speaker A: Like, if you go on Etherscan, anybody, you can check this for yourself as an indication of whether your protocol centralizes. You go to the address that holds the assets for the DeFi protocol and just check. Is Etherscan telling you that this is a proxy? And if this is a proxy, this usually means that there's somebody behind the contract that can upgrade it and change it to whatever logic they want, which includes moving the funds to their own wallet. And this is present in a lot of protocols. So what the Circle Breaker does here is that it doesn't add to what they can do maliciously, but it does add to what good teams can do to save.
