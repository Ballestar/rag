00:01:03.290 - 00:01:15.886, Speaker A: My guests today both lead Chinese projects that have held ICOs. Welcome to DA hong FEI, co founder of Neo, formerly Antshares, and Patrick Dai, founder of Quantum and chairman of the Quantum Foundation.
00:01:16.078 - 00:01:17.620, Speaker B: Hello, Laura. Hello.
00:01:18.150 - 00:01:27.110, Speaker A: So before we dive into the main topic, let's hear a little bit about your backgrounds. Hong FEI, let's start with you. How did you get into crypto and come to launch Neo?
00:01:27.530 - 00:02:02.334, Speaker B: Okay, I came across bitcoin in 2011, so that's almost the same with everybody else. And I started working full time in the crypto industry in 2013. And then at that time, we have a club called Bitangers Club. There are seven of us funded this club. After that, we spin off a project called nShares. So that's basically new, is the rename of nShares. So we started in 2014 to develop nShares as a platform to issue digital assets.
00:02:02.334 - 00:02:13.160, Speaker B: And then we add in the digital assets, we add in a smart contract to nShares, and this year we rebranded it to the new name New.
00:02:13.610 - 00:02:17.990, Speaker A: Okay, and Patrick, how did you get started in this space and come to launch Quantum?
00:02:18.350 - 00:02:39.322, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. Hello, everyone. Hi, Laura. Yeah, so my name is Patrick. I'm from the Quantum Foundation, founder of Quantum Project. I involved into bitcoin industry since 2012 when I was still prepared my master's degree and a PhD degree in the CAS, one of the best technology university in China.
00:02:39.322 - 00:03:11.000, Speaker C: So I joined the industry since 2012, and then I dropped out of my PhD when it's 2015, and I worked for Alibaba for six months, and then I left Alibaba and I started as a Quantum project at March of 2016. So right now, the Quantum is we released the main net a few days ago and the project is growing pretty big right now.
00:03:11.790 - 00:03:58.710, Speaker A: Oh, congrats. Congrats. Although it's kind of a crazy time, I imagine, for you. So let's talk a little bit about your ICOs. Hong FEI, when you were ant shares, you had two ICOs about a year ago and raised about 4 million. Is that I actually I saw an interview that you did with or that someone on your team did with Smith and Crown, and actually the CEO, Brian Leo and the researcher Matt Sharut. They were on the podcast a little while back, but it in the interview, the people on your team said that they felt that Western investors were more focused on the technology and they read the white papers closely, but that a lot of the Chinese were more like speculators and they tended not to read the white papers as closely.
00:03:58.710 - 00:04:09.020, Speaker A: So I just wanted to hear from you overall, how would you characterize the Chinese people who have been investing in ICOs, and how have you seen that change over time?
00:04:09.630 - 00:04:38.470, Speaker B: Yes, that statement is true, and things is getting worse in the past few weeks. There are ten ICUs every week. A lot of people, they don't understand bitcoin. They don't know what bitcoin is. They just came in and want to make quick money. And when the situation gets worse, the old ladies are investing their retirement savings. The government is stepping and stopped all the ICO in China.
00:04:38.970 - 00:04:46.870, Speaker A: So they were participating in the ICOs themselves, like buying ether and then sending ether to a smart contract and receiving tokens.
00:04:47.690 - 00:04:59.020, Speaker B: Actually, there are many platforms, ICO platforms in China, so they help you to deal with the technical issues. So you don't need to be a tech savvy to do other things.
00:05:00.030 - 00:05:06.320, Speaker A: Okay, but the concern was that people who didn't know what they were doing were getting into this.
00:05:06.930 - 00:05:07.678, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:07.844 - 00:05:20.130, Speaker A: Okay. And then, Patrick, so Quantum raised $16 million in April for you. What percentage of your investors do you think were Chinese versus non Chinese?
00:05:21.110 - 00:06:00.670, Speaker C: Yeah. So after the Quantum ICO finish, we asked a few of our partners who helped us host the ICO. So from the data, we got, like, more than 20 countries people participated in the Quantum ICO. So I think maybe 30 or 40% of people are from the Chinese investor or the Chinese participator, but the other percentage come from us. Not us, because we block all the US. IP from Canada or from UK or from Europe in Japan, Korea, and Russia.
00:06:01.410 - 00:06:03.790, Speaker A: Oh, wait, you blocked all of those countries?
00:06:04.690 - 00:06:14.370, Speaker C: No, we blocked the US. Citizens. So because we made a clear announcement, like, if you are a US. American, you cannot participate.
00:06:17.770 - 00:06:24.306, Speaker A: So the participants you were saying were from Canada and Europe and the UK. And Russia and Korea and Japan.
00:06:24.498 - 00:06:30.060, Speaker C: Yeah. Korea, Japan and yeah. Not the US. Market. Yeah.
00:06:30.510 - 00:06:40.250, Speaker A: Okay. And Hong FEI, for the neo or back when you were anchares, what percentage of your investors do you think were Chinese? Versus non Chinese.
00:06:41.250 - 00:06:56.050, Speaker B: The ICO one, the first ICO, most of them are Chinese investors. And for the ICO two, the one finished last year, half of the investments are coming from non Chinese countries.
00:06:56.870 - 00:07:07.830, Speaker A: Okay, so over time, how would you say that the atmosphere around ICOs was in China kind of maybe a year or two ago versus now? How has it changed?
00:07:08.570 - 00:07:33.040, Speaker B: I think a year ago, it's still very limited because the general public, they doesn't know what ICU is. And people attending, joining ICU, they need to have some technical background. But these days, everybody is talking ICO because lots of them made money from ICO. So the general public are investing their money.
00:07:33.650 - 00:07:45.010, Speaker A: And how do you think that change happened? Like, it started with you were saying tech savy people. Was it kind of like coders who were buying this initially and then how did it spread?
00:07:45.670 - 00:08:03.650, Speaker B: It doesn't necessarily to be coders. Those are people that are fascinated by the new technologies. They love to try new things, they love to support new things. But these days, most of them are speculators.
00:08:03.810 - 00:08:04.518, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:04.684 - 00:08:16.620, Speaker B: And there are many ICO projects. I think their goal is pointless. They're just here to make money. They're not trying to build something.
00:08:17.070 - 00:08:26.320, Speaker A: Okay, what are some of the maybe inflection points or milestones where you feel like you saw that shift happen?
00:08:27.010 - 00:08:29.710, Speaker B: I think it starts in 2017.
00:08:30.930 - 00:09:06.442, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the shift point or the change point happened like three months ago after some project being pumped so high. I think because of the influence, maybe the ethereum price, they jumped like 40 times higher. Since the march to May, the price went up like 40 times. So after people saw the price went up 40 times, then all the people, I think not only in China, all the people in the world, they become crazy.
00:09:06.576 - 00:09:40.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the shift started slowly from 2017. I think the reason is people are making money. The organization or they started ICO are making money. The people invested in ICO are making money. Looks like everybody is gaining something, so looks like it's a very good opportunity to make some profit. So everybody is very excited and they just made up a lot of ICO projects.
00:09:40.810 - 00:09:50.778, Speaker A: And does this parallel any other kind of bubble or I don't know if bubble is really the word, but any behavior in China that you've seen in.
00:09:50.784 - 00:09:59.770, Speaker B: The past, I think it's the ICO bubble is not just a Chinese thing, it's a global phenomenon.
00:10:00.450 - 00:10:39.210, Speaker A: I had read about previous bubbles in China that involved things like tea and types of wood and even the stock market. That was a couple years ago. Is this kind of something that you feel like is maybe even culturally specific? In a way? I agree with you that there is a bubble, obviously, and I agree with you it's the same in the US. Where a lot of projects that shouldn't be trying to raise money are just because it's easy to do so. But I also feel like I've read that China in particular has some kind of culture on speculation that often leads to these types of bubbles.
00:10:40.350 - 00:11:10.500, Speaker B: Yes, I think the Chinese because in China there are really very limited investment opportunities. The Chinese yuan is depreciation slowly so people want to reserve their value. But they have very limited investment channels. The money can only stay in China. You can invest in global market. So if they see some opportunity, they go ahead.
00:11:11.270 - 00:11:23.990, Speaker A: So something else that I was wondering about is when you guys were constructing your ICOs, what were the laws in China that you had to be aware of to make sure that your offerings wouldn't land you in jail?
00:11:24.890 - 00:11:30.026, Speaker C: Okay, for the question which of the law area we needed to aware before.
00:11:30.048 - 00:11:37.546, Speaker A: We do the yeah, like I'm assuming securities regulation is probably one I don't know what else.
00:11:37.728 - 00:12:30.830, Speaker C: Okay, so I think earlier in China, all the ICO area it's just unclear and gray area because we do not have very clear regulations in that area. So for Quantum, but we thought maybe in the future the Chinese government may have some regulations. So when we started the Quantum project, we registered our foundation in Singapore. But we do have a small office in Shanghai. But yeah, we have the gene. I mean, originally we come from China, but we were thinking like from the very beginning we know, okay, in the future maybe the Chinese government may do some regulation. So we choose to register the Quantum project legally in Singapore and we have a very pretty global team from nine countries.
00:12:30.830 - 00:13:33.538, Speaker C: But in China, I think in the ICO area there is a few department they take in charge like the Central Bank and the Chinese Security Committee, chinese Security Regulatory Committee and maybe sometimes Visa Insurance like department too. They both can take in charge of the ICO area. But the main regulator should be the central bank and also the Chinese Securities Regulatory Committee. They are the main role to take in charge the ICO regulation. But until right now, we do not have very clear law or any legal regulations definition on the ICO. But just like the regulator, they saw the big risk right now. So they wanted the market just become they wanted the market do not go too crazy.
00:13:33.538 - 00:13:35.940, Speaker C: They wanted to stop it right now.
00:13:36.390 - 00:13:54.360, Speaker A: Another thing I wanted to ask that is just how you guys first started hearing that the people think of China or PBOC might ban ICOs. Did you first hear rumors or how did that all start for you?
00:13:55.050 - 00:14:31.842, Speaker C: Yeah, okay, I will answer it first. Maybe Hong Fi can answer like we will keep talking to the regulator even before the regulation come out. So we know it's kind of like if you live in China, you can feel like some bubble is happening. One month know everyone want to start the ICO project. Like Hong FEI said, most of the ICO project is just meaningless. It's pointless. It's just some guy, I want to make money.
00:14:31.842 - 00:15:03.918, Speaker C: So I think I do forgot, they already forget the initial idea of the ICO. The initial idea of the ICO, it's okay, I have a good idea. I want to build an open source project and no business model, okay. I need the community to support me, to donate me some money. I think that's an initial idea since 2013 in the cryptocurrency industry. But this year kind of something crazy happened. So I think the government, they realized it's a big risk in China right now.
00:15:03.918 - 00:15:39.640, Speaker C: Also, the ICO platform, Hong FEI just mentioned, in China we have like maybe 65 platform ICO platform. They help you to do the investment to the ICO. It's kind of like the broker of the traditional stock market. It's kind of like lower all the barrier for the average people. No matter, you know, bitcoin blockchain whatnot you can invest. So that's a big risk for the regulators. I think that's the reason why the government, they made the regulation they announced like a few weeks ago.
00:15:40.910 - 00:15:58.430, Speaker A: And when you say that there are these ridiculous projects and it's just some random person who just decides to raise money with a cryptocurrency, but they don't have any real project or idea. What are some examples of some of the really crazy ICUs that you've seen or heard of recently?
00:15:59.250 - 00:16:49.360, Speaker C: Yeah, I think initially the ICO is some way you can use your money to fund some open source project, some talented developer, especially in the blockchain industry. But last few months, a lot of people come from the traditional business like, okay, because I saw a project, okay, they are moon cake. It's like a moon cake company. Okay, I want to release the ICO. I want us to sell my moon cake. So it's kind of funny because they want to do this kind of ICO to escape the regulations earlier. So that's something I think the government, they realized it's become crazy right now and we needed to stop it.
00:16:49.360 - 00:16:53.354, Speaker C: That's just one of the example. There's a lot of similar examples.
00:16:53.402 - 00:16:56.594, Speaker A: What are some of the others? That is hilarious. What are some of the others?
00:16:56.792 - 00:17:22.150, Speaker C: Yeah, there are some others. Like there are some project, okay. Blockchain is a very big innovation for the whole society, for the whole internet. But you cannot use blockchain to everywhere. It's impossible. But since blockchain is a very hot topic right now, all the people come from the traditional industry. No matter what they are doing, they wanted to build some connection or the relationship with the blockchain.
00:17:22.150 - 00:17:41.198, Speaker C: So they are just selling the blockchain concept to the average people. Because blockchain is harder for people to understand. It's like the AI, it's like the internet of things. It's some big concept. So the people, they saw the opportunity like just, okay, I'm doing blockchain business. Okay, give me your money. It's something like this.
00:17:41.198 - 00:18:06.134, Speaker C: So you cannot make money from a concept. You need to have real products. But then people realize, oh, I can sell blockchain concept and I can't get money. Then people change their initial idea. A lot of projects, they overrated. I mean, some project they raised 2000 million dollars in ICO. Some project, they raised $50 million.
00:18:06.134 - 00:18:33.220, Speaker C: I mean, for a startup, why you need that much money? You don't even have a prototype. That's still some real project. Then became like, how can I call that it's a very normal project. Or even some fake project. They wanted to raise money because they say, oh, I have some connection with blockchain. Then you can give me your money. Because the blockchain is a trend of the new world.
00:18:33.220 - 00:18:37.780, Speaker C: So something crazy people already forgot what they are doing.
00:18:38.550 - 00:18:51.462, Speaker A: Well, but I just am so curious. So aside from Mooncakes, are there any other really ridiculous traditional industries that said that they were going to have an ICO? The moon cake one is so funny. I love it. But it's just wondering if there's another.
00:18:51.516 - 00:19:10.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there is. Maybe some superstar in China. They wanted to release some coin to sell their income in the next five year or ten year. I can release a superstar coin.
00:19:10.510 - 00:19:16.366, Speaker A: Wow. That is I think a security at least in the US it would be.
00:19:16.548 - 00:20:01.382, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of you know, there's like some traditional investors, they joined the industry and they become the Is. I can feel there's a trend. Like one month ago, a lot of angel investor, they jumped into the ICO industry because the reason is like they invested into a lot of startup company. But it's very hard for only the startup they invested to go to Nasdaq or go to the Chinese stock market because only 1% of the startup they have the chance to go to Nasdaq. So that means most of the angu investment will fail. So they wanted to cash out. So how can they cash out? Okay, they ask the company they invested to do the ICO.
00:20:01.382 - 00:20:38.150, Speaker C: Then the angular investor, they can cash out that's something happened like last one month or two think because it's some like a private company and you cannot sell the shares easily in China. But people seems they figure out, oh, I can do this in the ICO ways, so I can sell my know it's not permitted in China. You cannot do this even today with current regulation, you cannot sell your shares easily in China. I mean the private company shares.
00:20:38.490 - 00:21:01.520, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, this is this is again not that different from what the perception of that behavior would be in the US. So now, out of curiosity, once the ban was put in place, what was the reaction to that? It sounds like you guys think it was pretty sensible. What was kind of like the broader reaction from the public.
00:21:02.470 - 00:21:19.000, Speaker B: I think most people think it's a good thing to stop all those Scam projects, but they still feel it is too strict. It may kill some good projects, too.
00:21:19.450 - 00:21:20.790, Speaker A: And Patrick?
00:21:21.370 - 00:21:43.260, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the public, they have some reaction. Some reaction, for sure. Yeah, I agree with Hong FEI, but still, there's some good project in China. They think, okay, this ICO, like abstract regulation, may kill some innovations in China, in the blockchain. Yeah.
00:21:43.870 - 00:22:23.494, Speaker A: Okay, so there's so much more to discuss, but we're going to take a break. We're going to come back and talk about Scams. We're going to talk about refunding investors, the closing of the Bitcoin exchanges, and some rumors we're hearing.

So let's talk about refunding investors, because that is something that kind of really piqued my curiosity. You described a lot of kind of really interesting situations where I would imagine it would be pretty complex. Are you guys doing that? And if so, how do you even do that?
00:22:58.652 - 00:23:57.462, Speaker B: Yeah, we offered actually my anchors ICO. The second one in 2016 is refundable before the main net is launched. So from the period after we finished the ICO and before the main net launched, investors or participants can ask for a refund, a full refund. We received about 15 requests and refunded 50 Bitcoins at that time. And when the ICO bank came out a few weeks ago, we decided to extend that period. So until October 17, the participants in both ICOs can still refund the ask for a refund and they will get their Bitcoin back, but they have to send back the new token. So that's the way we do.
00:23:57.462 - 00:23:57.878, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:57.964 - 00:24:03.610, Speaker A: And so you did it like you already had all their email addresses. Is that how you're doing these refunds?
00:24:04.110 - 00:24:19.150, Speaker B: No, I'm asking them to send us an email at contact@new.org and we will give them a new address. They send back the new and we will refund them with Bitcoin.
00:24:19.730 - 00:24:24.820, Speaker A: Okay, and how can you be certain that they didn't just buy on a secondary market?
00:24:25.430 - 00:24:41.880, Speaker B: Okay, so we will need them to sign the message. They have a private key for the ICO. One they have an account. So we have their email address for the ICO. Two, the user will have a private key.
00:24:42.490 - 00:24:47.160, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Okay, so they have to send it to you from that account.
00:24:47.630 - 00:24:48.380, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:48.830 - 00:24:52.620, Speaker A: Okay, but what if they've already sold their neo? Then what happens?
00:24:53.150 - 00:25:13.700, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, I don't care where you get the neo. If you invest it like one bitcoin and get, let me say, 1000 new. If there is such record, you just send back 1000 new. We won't check if it is the original new.
00:25:14.630 - 00:25:15.330, Speaker A: I see.
00:25:15.400 - 00:25:15.922, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:16.056 - 00:25:25.810, Speaker A: Okay, so you had already planned that, but for all the ICOs that haven't planned that or hadn't, how are they doing the refunds?
00:25:26.330 - 00:25:39.770, Speaker B: I think they just refunded some of the ICOs. They finished their fund raising period, but they haven't issued their token. So they just refunded all the money to the user.
00:25:40.270 - 00:25:41.114, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:41.312 - 00:25:42.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:46.110 - 00:25:52.400, Speaker A: I haven't participated in ICO, so sometimes you send the money, but then you don't get the token until later.
00:25:53.170 - 00:25:59.098, Speaker B: Yes, for that situation, they just send back the money, send back the ether or bitcoin.
00:25:59.274 - 00:26:03.570, Speaker A: Okay, but then what about other situations where the tokens were already trading?
00:26:04.150 - 00:26:19.362, Speaker B: Yeah, New is already trading, so we offered a refund option, but until now I haven't seen a request for refund because it's more profitable to sell them in the market than get a refund.
00:26:19.506 - 00:26:26.162, Speaker A: Oh, really? You haven't seen us, but it's voluntary, so it's not like it's not compulsory.
00:26:26.226 - 00:26:26.840, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:27.210 - 00:26:31.370, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Okay. And not a single person has requested a refund.
00:26:31.710 - 00:26:36.170, Speaker B: Yeah, people are not silly.
00:26:38.270 - 00:27:08.920, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, I guess it's not as complex a process as I imagined. One other thing I wanted to ask about was we were talking about the silly projects that are not blockchain related at all that were trying to hold ICOs. And I saw this one report that said the PBOC claimed that 90% of all the ICOs in China were fraudulent. Do you think that's true? And if so, what examples do you have of that?
00:27:11.370 - 00:27:13.560, Speaker B: Moon cake ICU is a good example.
00:27:13.930 - 00:27:17.058, Speaker A: Okay, why was that fraudulent?
00:27:17.234 - 00:27:27.130, Speaker B: I'm not sure what is the exact word they used. I read the statement, but I'm not sure if they use the word fraudulent.
00:27:27.790 - 00:27:46.740, Speaker A: But the way that worked was something like, let's say I am a mooncake bakery or a mooncake company, and I say, okay, I'm going to issue these tokens and then you can redeem them for mooncakes. Is that what the structure of this was?
00:27:47.190 - 00:27:50.580, Speaker C: Yeah, that's how it works in the white paper.
00:27:51.110 - 00:27:55.458, Speaker A: But why would that be fraudulent? I mean, it just seems like a stupid reason for a token, but I.
00:27:55.464 - 00:28:16.780, Speaker B: Don'T know if it's yeah, I think it's based on that. Many of the projects, they don't even have a technical person at first. When they started ICO, all they have is idea. And after they get money, they may started to hire some technical, real technical person to do that job. And they may not.
00:28:17.710 - 00:28:25.310, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Like they're just kind of marketing, hey, we're going to have an ICO, but they don't even have any wow, okay.
00:28:25.460 - 00:28:30.880, Speaker B: Yeah. They don't have any concrete architecture for the product.
00:28:31.410 - 00:28:39.438, Speaker A: Meaning that it sort of felt like they were just going to take their bitcoins and ether and then not even issue tokens.
00:28:39.614 - 00:28:59.674, Speaker B: I think they will issue tokens, but their real intention is not to build the product. Their real intention is to get the token, the bitcoin or ether from ICO and spend a small portion of it to deliver a so called product and they can keep most of the money.
00:28:59.872 - 00:29:02.074, Speaker A: Oh wow. Yes, okay.
00:29:02.192 - 00:29:04.330, Speaker C: The token is useless sometime.
00:29:04.670 - 00:29:27.060, Speaker A: And did the regulators contact those issuers and I'm not sure what they would do exactly, but bring some kind of regulatory action against them. Do you know of any particular ICOs where the regulators came in and said, hey, you're violating this or that law?
00:29:27.590 - 00:29:31.678, Speaker B: I'm not sure, I haven't been contacted by the regulators.
00:29:31.854 - 00:30:07.918, Speaker C: Patrick yeah, I think in China why the PBOC, they say like 90% of the project, it's like a scam was a very bad project. Because I read some news. Like in China we have some ICO project. The ICO, it's just a method for you to resell money. ICO itself is not a scam, but some ICO project, it's a scam. So that's a reason. But in China, people, they cannot really distinguish the difference.
00:30:07.918 - 00:30:51.600, Speaker C: Like most of the public people, most of the people, they do not really understand what's really it's the ICO and the ICO project, they think, oh, ICO is a scam or the ICO itself is a scam. I think it's a different concept. Another reason why the regulator is so angry or so striked is because in China we have some bad people, they use the ICO name to do scam stuff. Like they scam people. There is some Pongi scheme in China, maybe some fake coin or some Ponzi scheme coins. So they say, oh, I'm doing the ICO. You invest, you're giving me your money and I will pay you back every month.
00:30:51.600 - 00:31:22.870, Speaker C: I think maybe there is some amount of pounding scheme in China. In cryptocurrency world, it's like the dark side of the cryptocurrency. They have nothing. They only have a website. They do not have any experience with the blockchain industry. They do not have any experience with the development work. They just build a website and introduce it upon this game.
00:31:22.870 - 00:31:50.222, Speaker C: So their initial idea is to scam people, but they say, oh, I'm doing an ICO that's kind of like already devalued the ICO concept. In China, when people hear about the ICO, they say, oh, ICO, it's most likely the scam. But that's the reason. It's because too many bad people, they use the ICO concept in yeah, they kind of make ICO become a bad world in yeah.
00:31:50.356 - 00:31:56.450, Speaker A: And for those Ponzi schemes, did they raise a lot of money. Were they pretty successful?
00:31:58.550 - 00:32:21.270, Speaker C: I don't know too much, but from what I heard, yeah, there is a few upon this game. I think they scammed some people and they raised some money, and they also released the coin. But the coin is just like it's meaningless. You give your RMB to them or give your USD dollar to them, and then you get a coin and the coin itself is meaningless.
00:32:21.690 - 00:32:23.738, Speaker A: Wow, that's too bad.
00:32:23.904 - 00:32:39.790, Speaker C: Yeah. I think that's also why the regulator swangling why they made the most abstract regulation on ICO in China. I think their original target is not the good project in China. Their original target is the pongley scam in China.
00:32:40.770 - 00:32:50.050, Speaker A: So then why do you think they made the band so complete instead of just trying to target the bad actors?
00:32:51.910 - 00:33:31.054, Speaker C: Maybe the reason is like, because okay, the good projects also have some risk, but the bad projects, 100% totally risk. No real use. Case, no real use. So I think from the regulator's point of view, it's like, okay, it's kind of crazy. All the ICO is crazy right now. I think their idea is, like, to let the community not the community, let the trained to come down and to stop it right now and to let people think about oh, okay, well, so.
00:33:31.092 - 00:34:14.160, Speaker A: This actually is the perfect segue to my next question, because I also saw a report that said that the ban is only temporary. And I guess someone in China unfortunately, I didn't write down the name, but somebody with some authority who said that he thought that it was going to be temporary while the lawmakers hashed out the regulations. Again, all of this is just conjecture, but he also said that he thought maybe ICOs would only be allowed if the teams get licenses first. Of course, I think this is all just guesses, but do you think that the ban is temporary? And if so, how long do you think it will last?
00:34:16.770 - 00:35:02.300, Speaker C: I think it's very hard to predict the government's attitude because I think it depends on the public's reaction and it also depends on the regulators themselves, and it depends on all the financial environment in China. So it's harder to say it's a temporary wait forever. I don't know the answer, but the time will change. We will see what will. Yeah, because if the financial environment become bad in China, I think the ICO bank is forever. But if the financial environment in China become much better in one year or two year, maybe the government will change the attitude on ICO. On.
00:35:05.150 - 00:35:25.300, Speaker B: Yeah. My take is, according to the word they use, I don't think they intend to be a temporary ban. So don't expect like two months or a few weeks later they declare licensing some ICO. I don't think so.
00:35:26.170 - 00:35:31.960, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think so too. Yeah, maybe no licensing forever, no ICO forever. It's possible.
00:35:32.810 - 00:36:06.770, Speaker B: But I want to clarify one thing. Is that the China government only banned raising money from general public. They did not ban raising money privately. So you can still do a token raising in China as long as you do not pitch to the general public and there are no more than 200 investors in the project, and you do not promise a return of profit. So that will be fine. That will be okay, still perfect legal.
00:36:07.590 - 00:36:14.820, Speaker A: And do you know if some of the teams that were planning to do ICOs, are they planning to do it that way now, to fundraise that way now?
00:36:15.450 - 00:36:27.030, Speaker B: I think it's a very sensitive period. So no team in China will want to do ICO at this kind of situation, no matter it's private or public.
00:36:27.180 - 00:36:48.800, Speaker C: Yeah, but I know a team, like earlier, they wanted to do a public offering to the public, the ICO, the token. But I think right now, after the regulation came out, they wanted to do a private offering, like the angel investor. So, yeah, I know a team. They are trying to do this in China right now.
00:36:49.490 - 00:36:59.220, Speaker A: Okay, so basically, this thing that I read where someone said that the ban is probably temporary, you think that's just a rumor and probably not likely to happen?
00:36:59.910 - 00:37:00.846, Speaker B: I think it's a rumor.
00:37:00.878 - 00:37:32.662, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a rumor. Also, there is some misunderstanding. Sometimes even in China, we have different opinions from the government. I mean, not from the government. Some people, they say the ICO bank is temporary, but in some journalists from some other countries, they translated this, but it's not represented. The government the government always have the same opinion. And yeah, I think it depends on the government's attitude.
00:37:32.662 - 00:37:51.694, Speaker C: It depends on the public reactions. It depends on the financial environment. It's not a simple ICO in China. I think even this kind of regulation, it's a very high level. Very, very high level. Very high level. Guys, they made this kind of regulation.
00:37:51.694 - 00:38:04.600, Speaker C: It's not just PBOC or just one department in China. It's seven, like, most influential department in China. They made this. Yeah.
00:38:05.050 - 00:38:41.330, Speaker A: Okay. So something else I was curious about was that I read and granted, obviously I don't speak Chinese, but I read that the language of the ban made some kind of distinction between virtual currencies like Ethereum versus tokens. First of all, is that true? And if so, what is that distinction? Because Ethereum did do an ICO. It's just long before ICOs were such a big trend. I kind of am not really sure how they're distinguishing between what is legal versus what isn't legal.
00:38:42.470 - 00:38:44.210, Speaker C: I think allegal.
00:38:45.930 - 00:38:47.830, Speaker A: Even Ether now.
00:38:47.980 - 00:39:09.542, Speaker C: Yeah. Even ether. Even bitcoin. The reason is, like, okay, very few people, they know the difference, like the cryptocurrency and the token. Personally, I think even Ethereum even bitcoin, it's just a token. It's just a simple blockchain network. It's just a token.
00:39:09.542 - 00:40:11.002, Speaker C: But the token, I think the regulator, they do not know the clear definition of the token and the cryptocurrency because in the whole industry, we do not have this kind of clear mean. Even in silicon valley or even in any other countries, any other area. No one give a very clear definition on what's cryptocurrency, what is a token? What is a currency? What is cryptocurrency? No definition at all. So in China, some translation like, okay, they call it a token, but the token have a very wide definition. Even cryptocurrency is kind of a token, even bitcoin, even ethereum, it's kind of a token. But the reason sometimes even the regulators, they do not have too much technical background. It's hard to distinguish, it's even harder for us to distinguish.
00:40:11.002 - 00:40:41.538, Speaker C: What's the difference even for the experts in this area, in this blockchain area, no one give a very clear definition. But from the further action or the further move of the PPOC under the regulatory department, like BTC China, they will shut down the exchange. So that basically means no matter what token you are trading or what cryptocurrency you are trading in your exchange platform, you need to delist it in three months.
00:40:41.724 - 00:41:20.546, Speaker B: Yeah, actually I have a different opinion with Patrick. The PBOC document, they use two words. One is in Chinese, it's dai b, or you can translate it token. Or it also means substitution. It also means substitution in China Chinese. So I think it refers to those tokens that mostly are ERC, 20 tokens. They claim to have their own token, have a specific usage, but they issued before their manager is launched.
00:41:20.546 - 00:42:19.334, Speaker B: So probably PBOC is using a token to refer to those kind of virtual currencies. And they also used xuni huobi or virtual currencies. I think this word refers to the tokens that had already had their main net and is up and running. So they used two different words. And I have seen repeatedly in some official media that we need to separate bitcoin, bitcoin exchange and blockchain technology. So the government is encouraging blockchain technology and that's their stand on blockchain technology. And they also said bitcoin is legal in China and Chinese citizen can lawfully hold and even trade in person with bitcoin.
00:42:19.334 - 00:42:40.670, Speaker B: But bitcoin exchange is not legal at this moment because any centralized exchange should be licensed under the Chinese security law. So all the bitcoin exchanges are centralized exchange in China, and actually it's not legal.
00:42:41.410 - 00:43:08.886, Speaker A: I want to pick apart a few of the things that you mentioned, this distinction that you were saying that you saw in the language where they had these different words. So for the token, one, you thought that that was referring to tokens that had been issued where the main net had not been launched, and then the other word that referred to any token where the main net has already launched.
00:43:09.078 - 00:43:09.914, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:10.112 - 00:43:11.180, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:43:11.710 - 00:43:34.370, Speaker B: Okay, let me say it this way. The word token they used referred to those ICOs, the tokens issued by the ICOs and virtual currency is referred to the token that is raised, that used as a funding method like bitcoin, ether.
00:43:35.750 - 00:43:36.820, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:43:37.190 - 00:43:37.842, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:37.976 - 00:43:46.550, Speaker A: So then it doesn't matter if the token's main net has launched, it's only about what is being issued versus what is being received.
00:43:47.450 - 00:43:57.910, Speaker B: I don't know, I think there are two kinds of explanations here. Yeah, I'm not sure, I think the regulators, they don't have a very strict definition.
00:43:58.510 - 00:43:59.820, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true.
00:44:00.430 - 00:44:39.490, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. But it is kind of curious, why do they use the two different words and then which category does each token belong to? But actually when you were talking about how you felt like even ether or Bitcoin falls in those categories and how those exchanges were banned, I did want to talk about that. So right now it's Friday morning in China and yesterday here in the US. Or not yet. Well, for me it's the same day. This morning when I woke up, I saw the news about bitcoin exchanges, or at least BTCC, Bobby Lee's exchange.
00:44:39.490 - 00:44:58.970, Speaker A: And Bobby Lee actually also was on the podcast maybe about six months, but so I read that he was closing his exchange and it sounds like you're saying that the regulators are closing them all because even right now, as far as I know, I haven't seen that confirmed officially.
00:44:59.890 - 00:45:11.150, Speaker B: Yeah, it's never confirmed officially, but many media that was linked to the government had repeatedly reported all the exchanges will be closed.
00:45:11.570 - 00:45:29.190, Speaker A: Okay, and why is the government saying that the exchanges have to be closed, but that peer to peer exchanges are okay, sorry, you said this earlier. It's because they need to be registered first. So it sounds like this will be temporary that they'll reopen?
00:45:30.090 - 00:45:47.660, Speaker B: No, I'm saying that centralized exchange is you need to have a license to set up a centralized exchange and all the bitcoin exchange does not have a license and I don't think the government were licensing them.
00:45:49.550 - 00:45:54.880, Speaker A: So they all have to close and there is no chance of them getting licenses now.
00:45:55.970 - 00:45:57.200, Speaker B: I don't see that.
00:45:57.730 - 00:46:07.010, Speaker A: Okay, so then does that mean that some traditional exchanges will be able to obtain these license to trade cryptocurrencies?
00:46:08.070 - 00:46:13.540, Speaker B: No, I don't think it depends. I don't think Shanghai stock exchange will do that.
00:46:14.790 - 00:46:24.760, Speaker C: Yeah, okay, well, the Shenzhen stock exchanges, they will do that. I think no one will do this in short time, in short term, maybe in one year, two year, no one will do this.
00:46:25.530 - 00:46:31.770, Speaker A: Okay, and why do you think that they decided to do that? To ban the trading of Bitcoin.
00:46:32.190 - 00:46:55.090, Speaker B: There are many reasons. There are anti money laundry reasons, there are capture control reasons. And one statement in the official media is that bitcoin is not, there is no real use case of bitcoin and most of the use cases are trading and speculation and sometimes involves criminal activities.
00:46:56.230 - 00:46:59.314, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there are many mean.
00:46:59.352 - 00:47:03.940, Speaker A: Do you think that the PBOC was right, that that's what people are doing and nothing else.
00:47:04.630 - 00:47:10.422, Speaker B: I would say most of the activities around Bitcoin is trading speculation. That is somehow true.
00:47:10.476 - 00:47:56.290, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true, but I think they take the whole cryptocurrency currency as a narrow field. You should see the future of the currency, like the future of the money in the world. That's how the boxing people in this area, they think, okay, maybe in ten years or 20 years, the Bitcoin will become the top five currency in the whole world. Only after USD dollar RMB, most of people in the blockchain area, they still believe like, bitcoin will come sometimes in the future will become a global currency.
00:47:57.830 - 00:48:07.830, Speaker A: Yeah. So what is the reaction to this ban versus the ICO ban? Is it pretty much the same or do you think people are even more kind of disappointed or surprised?
00:48:08.510 - 00:48:11.050, Speaker C: People even more surprised and scared.
00:48:11.630 - 00:48:13.930, Speaker A: Oh, scared? Why scared?
00:48:15.070 - 00:49:23.714, Speaker C: Okay, there are some new people, they joined the industry this year, maybe just a few months ago, and they all think, okay, the Bitcoin price will always going up. So some people, they may invest a lot into the Bitcoin. And after BTC China confirmed they will close the exchange, the price just went down like 25% or even 30% bitcoin price in China. So you can see people may scared, like, oh, Bitcoin maybe become useless in the future, and I cannot sell my Bitcoin in the future anymore. So, yeah, it has some worse influence than the ICO banks. After the ICO banks, some of the people, they still think, okay, I can still trade my bitcoin, I just cannot participate in ICO anymore, but I can still take Bitcoin as a long term investment. But after the BTC China confirmed that they will close the exchange, I think that's bringing more influence in the society to the public.
00:49:23.714 - 00:49:33.540, Speaker C: People are scared, like, okay, maybe in the future bitcoin will go back to maybe $500, $1,000 again.
00:49:34.790 - 00:50:00.810, Speaker A: And so for people that own Bitcoin in China, what are they doing? Are they all now panic, selling on BTC China, trying to sell their Bitcoins before the exchange closes? Or are they holding onto it? And, you know, a year from now, two years from now, it'll still be worth more. I can keep it and I can sell it person to person. At that point. How are people reacting?
00:50:01.330 - 00:50:04.730, Speaker B: I think the newcomers, they are selling, they are panic.
00:50:04.890 - 00:50:08.906, Speaker C: Yeah. Different actions. Yeah, people have a different reaction.
00:50:09.098 - 00:50:34.760, Speaker B: The true believers, the veterans in the crypto world, they are holding their coins and even buying more buying when others are panic. But the newcomers, they want to make a quick money. They want to buy today, maybe sell next week. They find out it's very difficult to sell, maybe in the future. So they decided to sell it.
00:50:35.210 - 00:50:50.800, Speaker A: And so once there is no trading anymore on exchanges, there the way that people will both buy and sell bitcoin will just be peer to peer. Is that going to be something similar to local bitcoins or how will that work?
00:50:51.410 - 00:50:55.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I think it will be similar to Luca bitcoins.
00:50:56.290 - 00:50:58.640, Speaker C: Yeah. The OTC market. Yeah.
00:50:59.490 - 00:51:13.410, Speaker A: So I actually heard that one of the over the counter trading desks closed again. There's so many rumors, I really don't know if it's true. Have you guys heard that? And if so, do you think that that will happen to all the OTC desks?
00:51:14.070 - 00:51:33.100, Speaker C: It's true. There's an OTC company. Not a company, there's an OTC like application. The name is BCAN. So they closed their OTC yesterday? Two days ago? Yeah.
00:51:33.470 - 00:51:38.700, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Okay. And what are you guys doing? Are you selling your bitcoins or are you going to keep them?
00:51:40.590 - 00:51:42.650, Speaker C: I'm keeping all my bitcoins.
00:51:44.290 - 00:51:45.818, Speaker B: I bought some yesterday.
00:51:45.994 - 00:51:57.700, Speaker A: I love it. You're buying more? That's hilarious. Okay, well, so something else I was wondering about was in 2013, the PBFC banned financial institutions from using bitcoin. How would you say that this crackdown is different.
00:51:58.310 - 00:52:29.370, Speaker B: Actually, in 2013, they did not forbidden the financial institutions to use bitcoin. They asked them not to facilitate bitcoin trading. So many of the bank account of exchange is closed. But now they don't just close the bank accounts, they shut down all the exchange. So it's more severe. It's a harder blow.
00:52:30.130 - 00:52:39.600, Speaker A: Okay, well, so what do you think happens next? If you were going to make some predictions about where cryptocurrency in China is headed, what would you say?
00:52:40.530 - 00:53:23.838, Speaker C: I think okay, the bitcoin is not released by a central government or by any country. It's a global currency on the internet. So it's harder to ban by one country or one so because it's not released by the government themselves. So I think in the future yeah, it's going to be harder for the people who want to buy bitcoin in China if all the centralized exchange, like, BDC, China closed. Yeah. But a few of the exchange platform, I think they already have the plan to go to overseas, to go to other countries to reopen the exchange. I mean, they reopen the exchange platform.
00:53:23.838 - 00:53:55.910, Speaker C: Just a coin to coin trading. No fiat money, no R B, no dollar. Yeah, just bitcoin to Ether, bitcoin to Quantum or bitcoin to Neo. So it's just a coin to coin trading. In the future, I think it may be become mainstream in other countries. So I think for the blockchain technology in China, it's still growing, but it will take a longer time. And some of the team in China, they wanted to move abroad, they wanted to move to other countries.
00:53:55.910 - 00:54:13.950, Speaker C: I think the regulation for sure have some side effect on all the startups and all the bitcoin, all the blockchain related industry in China. But the future, I think it's still bright.
00:54:14.610 - 00:54:18.400, Speaker A: And what about you guys? How do you plan to proceed with your own.
00:54:20.210 - 00:54:57.100, Speaker C: Plan? Okay. For Quantum earlier, it's pretty global project but in the last six, last half a year, we forks a lot in China. So right now we may just change our forks to other countries, maybe to Korea, Russia, but China is not the highest priority right now. We are moving to the main development work and the forks marketing our energy to other countries. And we have the plan to open an office in Denver next.
00:55:00.770 - 00:55:06.430, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Yeah, Colorado is great. And Hong FEI. What about Neo?
00:55:06.770 - 00:56:10.980, Speaker B: Yeah, my understanding is the intrinsic reason for the Chinese government to ban ICO and exchanges is because it is somehow anti government and somehow it's anonymous and anti censorship. Yeah. And I believe it is same in other countries. So even in the United States, so I think global regulation is inevitable. There will be other countries that may step in to the ICO or even exchange. So I think anonymous or anti censorship blockchains is not the trend for the next few years. I think it's necessary for the blockchain to be compliant, to have digital identities, to make the network compatible with current legal system.
00:56:10.980 - 00:56:48.030, Speaker B: And at Neo, we are drafting a global legal framework for smart contracts running on Neo. So if they want to do a token raising, they can do it legally in most major countries. So that's what we are doing. And the same thing is we are going global. Nio is already quite global because I believe most of the new holders currently are not Chinese citizens. Many of them are in the United States. So we will organize events, meetups, conference in different countries.
00:56:49.250 - 00:56:54.500, Speaker A: Okay, well, this has been such a fascinating discussion. How can people get in touch with you?
00:56:55.510 - 00:57:17.570, Speaker B: Yeah, my email is Dahongfei@neil.org dahongfei@neo.org. And I want to add that Neil is hiring. So if you are a developer, if you are a promoter marketer, please send me an email.
00:57:17.740 - 00:57:18.970, Speaker A: And Patrick.
00:57:19.310 - 00:57:43.280, Speaker C: Yeah, so you can contact me through my email or the Skypie. It's both same. So my email is Patrick eight quantum.org qtum.org. That's the same as Skype account. Same like Neil. I think all the project is growing fast in blockchain area, so we are hiring too.
00:57:43.280 - 00:57:51.794, Speaker C: We wanted to hire some marketing director in US. So if you have some strong background, welcome to join the Quantum too.
00:57:51.912 - 00:57:56.946, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, great. Well, thank you both so much for coming on the show.
