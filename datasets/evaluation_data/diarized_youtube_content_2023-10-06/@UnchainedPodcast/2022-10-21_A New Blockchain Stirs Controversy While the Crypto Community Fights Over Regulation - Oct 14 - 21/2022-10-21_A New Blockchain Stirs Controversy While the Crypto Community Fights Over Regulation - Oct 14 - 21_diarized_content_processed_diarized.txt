Members of the UST. Restitution Group, which has about 4400 members, have named possible locations for Kwan, such as Dubai, Russia, Azerbaijan, the Seychelles or Mauritius, amongst other locations. They plan to start looking for him in Dubai since, as one member posted, Dubai is friendly to crypto, very international, he would not stand out and has limited extradition treaties in place. This person added It would seem like the best fit for the three to five hour time zone shift apparent in the data. The group even claims to have people who are very, very close to do Kwan. Their expedition to Dubai starts in little over a week.

00:01:17.272 - 00:01:18.754, Speaker B: The launch got a lot of criticism.
00:01:18.802 - 00:01:20.566, Speaker A: On crypto Twitter for not disclosing the.
00:01:20.588 - 00:01:23.334, Speaker B: Token allocation scheme, especially considering that big.
00:01:23.372 - 00:01:27.570, Speaker A: Exchanges like Finance and FTX listed the Aptos token on their platforms.

00:01:34.384 - 00:01:36.326, Speaker B: The community, raising a lot of concerns.
00:01:36.358 - 00:01:43.070, Speaker A: About the decentralization of the blockchain. Additionally, Aptos was accused of benefiting early venture capitalists way too much.

00:01:49.994 - 00:01:55.554, Speaker A: Aptos token distribution scheme is among the worst designs I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.
00:01:55.672 - 00:02:01.906, Speaker B: Foundation 67.5% Team 19% Investors 13.5% the.
00:02:01.928 - 00:02:04.290, Speaker A: Only way coins get into the community.
00:02:04.440 - 00:02:14.086, Speaker B: Lol is through arbitrary foundation and distributions, so the entire supply is controlled by a bureaucracy which will grant the coins one by one. It's also proof of stake, so new.
00:02:14.108 - 00:02:17.586, Speaker A: Coins cannot be earned by actors outside this distribution method.
00:02:17.698 - 00:02:21.740, Speaker B: I would love to hear an explanation from any person who thinks the design is good.
00:02:22.590 - 00:02:27.866, Speaker A: DC investor a crypto influencer wrote the near categorical rejection of Aptos, created by.
00:02:27.888 - 00:02:30.006, Speaker B: Ex Libra Devs as a fairly blatant.

00:02:34.164 - 00:02:35.566, Speaker B: The space, may be one of the.

00:02:58.274 - 00:03:05.442, Speaker B: But following the implosion of terra and its stablecoin UST, the crypto hedge fund went bankrupt and failed to repay the loan to Voyager.
00:03:05.586 - 00:03:08.114, Speaker A: The executives were under investigation to discover.
00:03:08.162 - 00:03:13.306, Speaker B: Whether they had failed to perform proper due diligence on the loan. However, there was no clear evidence of.
00:03:13.328 - 00:03:15.354, Speaker A: Mismanagement or fraud, making it very hard.
00:03:15.392 - 00:03:16.566, Speaker B: To prove it in court.
00:03:16.678 - 00:03:25.120, Speaker A: The conclusion was that executives settled for an amount between $1.3 million and $3 million from their personal assets and up to $20 million through insurance.
00:03:25.570 - 00:03:27.306, Speaker B: Only a few days before, a court.
00:03:27.338 - 00:03:29.918, Speaker A: Filing revealed that the top executives of.
00:03:29.924 - 00:03:32.254, Speaker B: The company were seeking legal immunity, an.
00:03:32.292 - 00:03:33.678, Speaker A: Idea which was received with a lot.

00:04:10.918 - 00:04:21.406, Speaker B: In the state of Texas. The inquiry has to do with FTX's yield bearing accounts to U. S. Customers. Regulators believe these may constitute securities and would be in violation of securities law.
00:04:21.508 - 00:04:23.982, Speaker A: According to Joe Rotunda, the Texas State.
00:04:24.036 - 00:04:33.998, Speaker B: Securities Board enforcement director. Rotunda said that although he registered as A-U-S. Resident, the FTX app offered him a yield opportunity, which could be considered an investment contract.
00:04:34.174 - 00:04:39.586, Speaker A: The probe may put in jeopardy bankman Fried's acquisition of Voyager digital's distressed assets.
00:04:39.698 - 00:04:41.378, Speaker B: After he won the auction and agreed.

00:05:00.208 - 00:05:10.794, Speaker B: Use to regulate the crypto industry. The language of the draft would exclude software developers from being counted as digital commodity brokers, which, according to Shapiro, could be a boon to slash crypto.
00:05:10.922 - 00:05:22.158, Speaker A: Still, the draft raised some concerns about its potential impacts on crypto and financial freedom. On this issue, congressman Tom Emmer wrote, decentralization is the point. If we sacrifice DeFi for legislation, we're.
00:05:22.174 - 00:05:26.638, Speaker B: Throwing away the opportunity. The Dccpa was introduced by Senators Debbie.
00:05:26.654 - 00:05:37.910, Speaker A: Sabanow and John Boozman in August and has gained support from crypto giants such as Coinbase and FTX. However, the blockchain association tweeted that the bill needs to be changed or it would create a ban on decentralized finance.
00:05:38.270 - 00:05:50.154, Speaker B: Additionally, SBF published a 3800 word industry norms manual in which he proposed enforcing regulation, including sanctions on decentralized finance protocols via their front ends, and he got.
00:05:50.192 - 00:05:55.610, Speaker A: A very negative response from the crypto community. Ryan Adams, host of bankless said to SBF.
00:05:55.690 - 00:05:57.726, Speaker B: This absolutely sucks and would eliminate the.

00:06:17.164 - 00:06:28.918, Speaker A: The Grayscale suit supporting the investment firm's claim that a failure to approve a spot product constitutes uneven treatment. The blockchain association joined other big advocacy groups Coin Center and the Chamber of.
00:06:28.924 - 00:06:35.094, Speaker B: Digital Commerce in supporting the case. The SEC's unwillingness to approve a spot bitcoin ETF has been a major concern.
00:06:35.142 - 00:06:38.774, Speaker A: In the crypto community. A spot ETF would help institutional investors.
00:06:38.822 - 00:06:43.194, Speaker B: Put money into BTC, but until now, there have only been futures ETFs.
00:06:43.322 - 00:06:47.706, Speaker A: The commission's use of a double standard to evaluate bitcoin futures ETPs and spot.
00:06:47.738 - 00:06:50.334, Speaker B: ETPs is not only bad policy, but.
00:06:50.372 - 00:06:57.730, Speaker A: Also in contravention of law, said the blockchain association filing. On a related note, another firm that is joining a lawsuit to show support.
00:06:57.800 - 00:07:00.050, Speaker B: Is Paradigm, a crypto venture fund.
00:07:00.200 - 00:07:07.346, Speaker A: Paradigm joined the Ukidao case, arguing that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, should properly serve its members instead of.
00:07:07.368 - 00:07:10.886, Speaker B: The Dao as a whole. To refresh your minds, the CFTC tried.
00:07:10.908 - 00:07:13.026, Speaker A: To serve Ukidao members in its forum.
00:07:13.138 - 00:07:19.182, Speaker B: A move widely rejected by the crypto legal community, although a judge ruled that the members had been properly served.
00:07:19.346 - 00:07:23.594, Speaker A: Paradigm added to the efforts of Lexpunk Army and the DeFi Education Fund, which.

00:07:34.628 - 00:07:44.366, Speaker B: Not enforce royalties on its platform, the debate about NFT royalties spiced up again. Magic Eden's decision to move to optional royalties was not taken lightly, according to.
00:07:44.388 - 00:07:46.306, Speaker A: The team, which argues it was the.
00:07:46.328 - 00:07:59.270, Speaker B: Best business decision at the time. Over the weekend, I teamed up with Lee Jin to debate with Haseeb Qureshi and Joshin Yin about NFT royalties in a special episode of The Chopping Block. Special emergency episode, you could say.
00:07:59.420 - 00:08:06.326, Speaker A: Basically, Lee and I argued that cutting royalties constitutes short term thinking, whereas Haseeb and Joshin said that as royalties are.
00:08:06.348 - 00:08:08.534, Speaker B: Not enforceable on chain, it was inevitable.
00:08:08.582 - 00:08:10.954, Speaker A: That marketplaces would start moving to this model.
00:08:11.152 - 00:08:20.886, Speaker B: Generative NFT artist Tyler Hobbs told Decrypt that losing NFT artist royalties would be a tragedy. Also speaking of NFTs, the US internal.

00:08:47.272 - 00:08:50.246, Speaker B: Binance delegated 13 million unitokens and was.
00:08:50.268 - 00:08:52.898, Speaker A: Able to accumulate 1.3% of governance voting.
00:08:52.914 - 00:08:55.986, Speaker B: Power, according to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams.
00:08:56.098 - 00:09:00.618, Speaker A: However, another user pointed out that Binance could have as much as 5.92% of.
00:09:00.624 - 00:09:11.254, Speaker B: The total voting power. Hayden called this a very unique situation, as the Uni technically belongs to its users. To this point, Binance responded, Binance doesn't vote with users tokens.
00:09:11.302 - 00:09:16.298, Speaker A: In this instance, about 16 hours ago, 4.6 million Uni was transferred between internal.
00:09:16.314 - 00:09:28.066, Speaker B: Binance wallets, causing the Uni to be instantly, automatically delegated. This was not our intention. Mango Markets hacker reveals his identity. The drama around the Mango Markets hack continues this week.

00:09:37.548 - 00:09:50.394, Speaker A: Involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy. Last week, following a confession, Mingo Markets announced that Eisenberg had given back to the Dow crypto assets worth $67 million.
00:09:50.512 - 00:09:52.966, Speaker B: As was agreed in a governance vote.
00:09:53.158 - 00:09:55.002, Speaker A: It looks like Eisenberg has some experience.
00:09:55.056 - 00:09:56.630, Speaker B: In hacking DFI protocols.
00:09:56.710 - 00:10:05.166, Speaker A: Earlier this year, Eisenberg was accused of being responsible for an exploit on fortress Dow worth $14 million. On a related note, this week, a.
