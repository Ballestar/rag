00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.830, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:12.690 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:17.730 - 00:00:41.330, Speaker B: Okay, hello everybody, welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto top fix of the day. So this is also I just want to announce the 400th show of Unchained. Yeah, it's amazing. We're very excited. We're officially taking over Unchained in celebration of the 400th episode. So every episode from now on is only going to be the chopping block.
00:00:41.330 - 00:00:58.570, Speaker B: So we're just to going be doing this three times a week, so look out for that. All right, team intros real quick. So first we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes. Next up we've got Robert, the cryptoconnosur and captain of compound. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet.
00:00:58.730 - 00:01:02.106, Speaker E: And then you have myself, I'm haseeb I'm the head hype man at Dragonfly.
00:01:02.218 - 00:01:07.086, Speaker B: The four of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal.
00:01:07.118 - 00:01:09.090, Speaker E: Advice, or even life advice.
00:01:09.670 - 00:01:12.514, Speaker B: Guys, it has been a pretty down.
00:01:12.552 - 00:01:13.780, Speaker E: Bad kind of week.
00:01:14.390 - 00:01:25.346, Speaker B: The main news of the week has been the merge. We were talking about it pretty much nonstop for every show for the last like two months and the merge happened. It went off basically without a hitch, as good as one could have expected.
00:01:25.458 - 00:01:28.198, Speaker E: And in my mind the outcomes, the.
00:01:28.204 - 00:01:31.946, Speaker B: Decision tree when the merge happened was either, okay, one, the merge fails, in.
00:01:31.968 - 00:01:37.574, Speaker E: Which case everything's going to dump, or two, the merge succeeds and either rallies.
00:01:37.622 - 00:01:41.178, Speaker B: And everything's great and we're all happy, or path, three, the merge succeeds but.
00:01:41.184 - 00:01:44.666, Speaker E: It was priced in and nothing happens. Instead what happened is that the merge.
00:01:44.698 - 00:01:46.714, Speaker B: Succeeded and everything just proceeded to turbo.
00:01:46.762 - 00:01:49.130, Speaker E: Dump and ETH is now in the shitter.
00:01:49.290 - 00:01:53.570, Speaker A: I only have one word for you. Taxes.
00:01:55.270 - 00:02:01.374, Speaker E: Taxes. Wait, September 15. Why september 15? It's like October.
00:02:01.422 - 00:02:03.342, Speaker D: So everyone is selling their crypto.
00:02:03.486 - 00:02:05.710, Speaker B: People are selling in anticipation of taxes.
00:02:05.870 - 00:02:28.140, Speaker D: Yeah, here's the long and short of it. So everybody made a ton of money last year. The market was up, everybody was like churning crypto, buying it, selling it, everybody filed extensions, which are due soon and people are just now realizing how much money they made last year and how much lower their crypto is relative to last year.
00:02:29.550 - 00:02:31.866, Speaker E: But why would this affect no.
00:02:31.968 - 00:02:33.546, Speaker B: Why would this affect ether more than bitcoin?
00:02:33.578 - 00:02:36.320, Speaker E: That doesn't make any sense. It's impacting everything.
00:02:37.010 - 00:02:56.546, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems uniformly across. I think the ETH thing may have been that more people were speculating for the merge, but then once it was a nothing burger, it was like a nothing burger in a good way. Sorry, I don't mean that. I'm trying to say like, nothing. And there was no excitement. Right. ETHW died immediately, basically.
00:02:56.546 - 00:03:08.470, Speaker A: So I guess that part people were hoping to probably make some carry on for whatever little time that trade existed and then now they're like oh shit, we need to pay taxes.
00:03:09.610 - 00:03:21.982, Speaker C: The best explanation I heard was basically people were long ETH spot to get the AirDrop, short perps and then just there's a ton of spot selling post merge and yeah, that's kind of why you're seeing that in the market.
00:03:22.116 - 00:03:25.230, Speaker D: But wouldn't that be offset by buying in the perps?
00:03:25.810 - 00:03:30.480, Speaker B: Yeah. And also ETH POW was so small, it was priced at like 1%.
00:03:32.290 - 00:03:48.034, Speaker C: It was a terrible AirDrop, but a lot of people were putting on the trade. Right. You see that in the funding rates and everything. The argument is like ETH is less, spy is less liquid than perps. And so that's why it's just like you see more sell pressure net and it's like so immediate because no one actually wants the ETH after that.
00:03:48.152 - 00:04:01.618, Speaker B: It seems like this trade just became so overcrowded that it no longer made any sense. Right, because presumably you're getting 1%. That's what this thing was being priced at in the IOUs. So you're taking these crazy funding rates, you're taking all this risk just for.
00:04:01.644 - 00:04:04.854, Speaker E: 1% and then you have to get out of your trade.
00:04:04.902 - 00:04:06.998, Speaker B: By which point ETH has already started dumping.
00:04:07.094 - 00:04:09.146, Speaker E: So it seems that in aggregate this.
00:04:09.168 - 00:04:11.450, Speaker B: Was a massively, massively overdone trade.
00:04:11.870 - 00:04:14.622, Speaker A: But that happens a lot in general, right?
00:04:14.756 - 00:04:15.946, Speaker B: It was just such an obvious trade.
00:04:15.978 - 00:04:16.078, Speaker E: Right.
00:04:16.084 - 00:04:20.462, Speaker B: It's so easy to explain why this trade makes sense. And there was all the story about.
00:04:20.596 - 00:04:21.950, Speaker E: Movement to the upside.
00:04:22.530 - 00:04:29.586, Speaker B: It's really unfortunate because I feel like Ethereum didn't really get a true celebration because basically the day after it got.
00:04:29.608 - 00:04:33.486, Speaker E: Kicked in the teeth, it feels really sad.
00:04:33.678 - 00:05:02.350, Speaker D: That being said, I do think Ethereum deserves a lot of credit because the merge was completely correct. It was a non event in a great way. The blockchain is running smooth ever since. The inflation rate is like half a percent a year at this point. Like in the days sense, the block speed is 12 seconds. It's like Ethereum is just better than it was a week ago and I think it deserves a lot of kudos.
00:05:02.930 - 00:05:06.378, Speaker A: Minus the deflation didn't happen component.
00:05:06.474 - 00:05:08.586, Speaker D: Yes, the argument for deflation.
00:05:08.778 - 00:05:13.294, Speaker C: Yeah, for a minute there people were pretty thrilled. But it's still materially less than it was.
00:05:13.332 - 00:05:13.726, Speaker A: Right?
00:05:13.828 - 00:05:16.210, Speaker C: That's sort of the counterargument.
00:05:16.550 - 00:05:18.206, Speaker B: Well, it's also materially less than bitcoin.
00:05:18.238 - 00:05:18.386, Speaker E: Right.
00:05:18.408 - 00:05:23.554, Speaker B: Bitcoin is like between one and 2% inflation. So Ether is now more disinflationary than bitcoin is.
00:05:23.592 - 00:05:26.014, Speaker E: Which is pretty impressive.
00:05:26.142 - 00:05:27.394, Speaker C: Yeah, very true.
00:05:27.592 - 00:05:40.306, Speaker B: Clearly there was a chart that there's been like 20 of these charts of showing at the rate at which fees are being paid and burned through EIP 1559. If the merge had been activated different.
00:05:40.348 - 00:05:42.934, Speaker E: Times, what would be the net inflation.
00:05:42.982 - 00:05:46.298, Speaker B: Rate or deflation rate in Ethereum. And there are clearly a bunch of.
00:05:46.304 - 00:05:49.034, Speaker E: Times over the last cycle that you.
00:05:49.072 - 00:05:55.074, Speaker B: Would have been net deflationary. Now, right now, we're at the bottom of that cycle.
00:05:55.222 - 00:05:57.770, Speaker E: Gas fees are super low on a relative basis.
00:05:57.930 - 00:06:03.198, Speaker B: And so, yeah, Ether is not going to be deflationary right now, but if we see another cycle come into play.
00:06:03.364 - 00:06:07.170, Speaker E: Then very likely that ETH will go through periods of deflation.
00:06:08.870 - 00:06:16.660, Speaker D: We just need more on chain activity to get people revving up and paying high gas prices. Then it's deflationary again and the world is right.
00:06:17.030 - 00:06:24.134, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to take bitcoin a while to catch up. Right, bitcoin, it's going to be like ten years, basically, until bitcoin is at the level that Ether is at now.
00:06:24.172 - 00:06:26.390, Speaker E: Even assuming no net deflation.
00:06:26.890 - 00:06:31.670, Speaker D: Yeah, we need a couple of happenings. We need another two happenings.
00:06:32.350 - 00:06:46.846, Speaker B: And there was also a great debate on this show between Eric Wall and I can't remember who the other person was, but they were talking about Bitcoin needing to have a tail emission so having to continue to be inflationary in.
00:06:46.868 - 00:06:49.946, Speaker E: Perpetuity, in which case that tail emission.
00:06:49.978 - 00:06:51.054, Speaker B: Might be on the order of about.
00:06:51.092 - 00:06:53.070, Speaker E: What Ether is doing right now.
00:06:53.220 - 00:06:55.422, Speaker B: Which again, also breaks the narrative between.
00:06:55.476 - 00:06:57.266, Speaker E: What Bitcoin and Ether would be about.
00:06:57.448 - 00:07:43.114, Speaker D: Well, we don't have to get into it on this show because it's a much broader debate and conversation about the security budget necessary to keep bitcoin safe in the end years. But fundamentally, I don't think the current model works. I think you have another couple happenings and it requires the price of bitcoin to go up for the network to be as safe. Transaction volume has never supplanted minor block rewards, as was envisioned by Satoshi in the white paper, which when I read the white paper the first time, I was like, oh, my God, that's genius. The block rewards are only there until the network is up and running. It's a bootstrapping mechanism. But transaction fees have never supplanted the block rewards.
00:07:43.114 - 00:08:14.620, Speaker D: And so there is a massive security risk to bitcoin in a having two happenings, three happenings, especially if price don't go up, that I think people are underpricing and I think bitcoin fundamentally will change. And I think it can be done in ways that are not going to violate the sort of like immutable 21 million token cap on bitcoin. I'm sure bitcoin will find ways to maintain a are you sure? All right, you want to know?
00:08:15.070 - 00:08:22.700, Speaker A: Every developer just gets run out every time they make a BIP. I don't know, I feel like Jeremy Rubin has been trying to get BIP 119 for like three years.
00:08:23.230 - 00:08:24.938, Speaker D: Can you describe 119?
00:08:25.114 - 00:08:25.502, Speaker E: Sorry?
00:08:25.556 - 00:09:12.554, Speaker A: BIP 119 is a way of doing sort of like deferred covenants so you can kind of schedule transactions and so a lot of not fully DFI, but some DFI like constructs that can be made using that. You can do sort of like hash rate derivatives and stuff like that, using it. But Bitcoiners are really against it because it brings back this Op Return debate from 2013 2014. Bitcoin and Op return was sort of like, hey, you could return an arbitrary value and it would store that. And then people started sort of taking advantage of that in a weird way. And I think basically people are still kind of feel that way about covenants. But the problem is I don't see what are you going to do half the time? People are like, oh, we're just going to use Lightning.
00:09:12.554 - 00:09:55.706, Speaker A: Clearly that's not fucking working. No one wants to run nodes. In fact, there was an amazing tweet the other day by one of the main Lightning devs bosworth, Andrew Buffett, that was like, oh, I only need like 20 gig of Ram to run in Lightning node. I thought this shit was supposed to run on your phone and you were just connecting to local nodes. And whenever Bitcoin people are like, oh no, ETH has Fat nodes, I'm like this one fucking person's. Transactions that he's routing is already bigger than probably the uniswap set from 2020, and there's no way it was anywhere near the same amount of volume. So I just sort of think Lightning is kind of a dead end.
00:09:55.706 - 00:10:19.780, Speaker A: The whole Starkware trying to do Starks on Bitcoin thing, maybe that has legs, but that's going to need things like Bitnot 119. I'm just very bearish on the developer side because it feels like anyone who isn't yelling at anyone who isn't like Bitcoin standard reader is sort of like shown the door for development stuff.
00:10:21.190 - 00:10:26.306, Speaker B: Tom, how are the Lightning metrics looking? Because I remember a while back on the show we were talking about how.
00:10:26.328 - 00:10:28.180, Speaker E: The metrics of Lightning look really good.
00:10:28.630 - 00:11:06.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I was trying to dig into this a little bit more, but unfortunately it was very hard to get data inherently because it's all like off chain, so the network capacities continue to go up, which really shocked me over the past year or two. There's more and more Bitcoin in Lightning network that can be traded, but we don't know actually what that volume looks like. I suspect some of it is probably subsidized by or it is not economically rational for some people to maintain some of these channels, but they maybe do it because they're a startup and they want to make Lightning be a thing. But yeah, I've been trying to get Lightning network data in terms of volume. I just haven't been able to find.
00:11:06.552 - 00:11:42.390, Speaker A: Anything actually, at least for the publicly indexable nodes. If you go to oneml.com, that's sort of like a reasonable place to look. It obviously doesn't have everything but this whole maxi shit from 2019 where like, oh, there's so many private channels because you can only see the open and closes on private channels, not the actual settlement just turned out to not be true. So the public channels at least give you a reasonable lower bound and you can see that it is increasing capacity wise, but it's not like the volume is actually really going up that much.
00:11:42.480 - 00:11:44.720, Speaker C: Yeah, that was the confusing part.
00:11:45.410 - 00:11:45.822, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:45.876 - 00:11:58.306, Speaker D: If you look at the network capacity, it is 4800 bitcoin, which is very small in compared to the amount of bitcoin that's wrapped and put into DFI on ethereum. And it's flying around someone who had.
00:11:58.328 - 00:12:10.040, Speaker A: Their bridge hacked and I won't mention it, who, but they were like, oh, yeah, there was more funds stolen in my bridge times three than there was in the Lightning network ever.
00:12:12.730 - 00:12:16.120, Speaker B: Kind of crazy flex, but okay, yeah, all right.
00:12:16.490 - 00:12:17.842, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a bad flex.
00:12:17.906 - 00:12:18.326, Speaker E: Bad.
00:12:18.428 - 00:12:35.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. But I thought that was like a funny statistic, right? It's like, oh, bitcoin people are like, championing the shit that has no fucking volume, barely has capacity when you think about it, relative to these bridges where people are pummeling through million dollar volume all the time. Right.
00:12:35.970 - 00:12:37.706, Speaker E: But to be clear, if any bitcoin.
00:12:37.738 - 00:12:59.010, Speaker B: Maxes are listening, we love Lightning. Tarun, please direct your IRA at Tarun, not at us. We are Team Lightning. Lightning is great and it's interesting how many Lightning startups have also David Marcus's startup is like, doing it's like Lightning oriented startup where, if I recall, it was like, we're going to figure out what the product is, but we're going to target Lightning.
00:12:59.170 - 00:12:59.638, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:59.724 - 00:13:17.066, Speaker B: And then know, there's been all these stories about how the El Salvador bitcoin push is kind of falling apart and people on the ground are not really using bitcoin or strike very, you know, because they're growing off a low base. I think the Lightning growth numbers in.
00:13:17.088 - 00:13:19.306, Speaker E: Terms of capacity look pretty good, but.
00:13:19.328 - 00:13:35.554, Speaker B: The reality is that as crypto has grown and as the infrastructure has increased, the alternatives to settling bitcoin through Lightning have all gotten better and better and better and Lightning is just not getting that much better. And unless it drastically improves in a short amount of time or there's some kind of distribution hack that sets into.
00:13:35.592 - 00:13:38.786, Speaker E: Place, I think everything else is just going to overtake it.
00:13:38.808 - 00:13:39.380, Speaker B: As.
00:13:41.670 - 00:14:17.760, Speaker A: There'S also this sort of schism between the Lightning Labs Lightning and Blockstream Lightning, because Lightning Labs added this overlay network called Taro, which has tokens and you can issue stablecoins on it, but it kind of is like its own private network. And so there's kind of this war going on between them of like you'll see the blockstream Samsung type people being like, oh, they're just like adding in this private chain, it's on real Lightning and then Lightning Labs like, no, we at least post some of the commitments. And I'm like the fact that they're still debating this shit just like, sometimes boggles my mind.
00:14:18.210 - 00:14:22.446, Speaker E: Yeah, well, okay, so coming back to.
00:14:22.468 - 00:14:44.146, Speaker B: The ethereum merge and all that, so Ethpal, I think we can pretty safely say is dead. It's now trading at $5, which is basically what is it, like 40 basis points of Ethereum. It's down 91% from inception. So it launched at like $120 and now it's trading at $5. Tarun, I remember you were telling us how you were in the private discord and you were seeing all the mayhem.
00:14:44.178 - 00:14:45.080, Speaker E: That was going on.
00:14:46.170 - 00:14:49.110, Speaker B: Give us the insider play by play of what exactly?
00:14:49.260 - 00:14:52.806, Speaker A: Well, that discord disappeared.
00:14:52.918 - 00:14:53.782, Speaker C: Disappeared?
00:14:53.926 - 00:14:54.618, Speaker B: Wait, why?
00:14:54.704 - 00:15:39.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they just were like they didn't want the negative press in general because a lot of people who were in there were writing all these tweets and stuff like that. So I didn't really follow much other than I heard about all the maker mev. Some searchers I know I talked to were just talking about how dye was sort of like the main form of mev because you could just borrow a ton of dai against ETHW collateral and they were basically running the maker Oracle on their own. And there's enough like you could just basically background the Oracle. You basically take out a really big dai deposit and then background the Oracle and liquidate your own collateral. And it was like profitable because ETHW was going down fast enough.
00:15:40.490 - 00:15:41.286, Speaker E: Oh, wow.
00:15:41.388 - 00:15:59.360, Speaker C: I was curious about that. There's actually like a good amount of EW volume on Sundar's exchanges. Like 70 mil today or something like that. Is that just like people doing mev cashing out? It just seems like a very large amount of volume on legit exchanges for something that no one is actually building on.
00:16:00.450 - 00:16:05.362, Speaker D: I wouldn't rule out the POW fork. I think that just yes.
00:16:05.496 - 00:16:05.794, Speaker B: Really?
00:16:05.832 - 00:16:36.060, Speaker D: Really? I'll be the contrarian. I'll say that I would not be surprised if in a year people are like, oh no, this thing is better than Ethereum classic. Let's just use this for our thing. And I think it's still around. I think everybody viewed it as like, oh, it's free, let's sell it. And I think if you leave it alone for long enough and we just come back to this in one year, I think its price in Ether terms is higher than it is today.
00:16:38.110 - 00:16:41.646, Speaker E: I get the feeling that people are.
00:16:41.668 - 00:16:45.834, Speaker B: Going to walk away from this. I think it's the opposite.
00:16:45.882 - 00:16:48.510, Speaker E: I think that ethpow.
00:16:49.010 - 00:16:59.474, Speaker B: There's a narrative moment, I think, for Ethpow. And that narrative moment unfortunately has passed. And I think Blockchains very often have this small moment in the spotlight. And if you mess up your moment.
00:16:59.512 - 00:17:07.590, Speaker E: In the spotlight, they don't invite you back on stage. And that feels like what happened to Ethpal. But what did they mess up specifically?
00:17:08.250 - 00:17:19.526, Speaker B: I think they messed up actually coming out and having a coherent story, having some kind of pitch to developers, to users. The only thing I have heard from anyone about Ethpal is how to sell.
00:17:19.548 - 00:17:21.562, Speaker E: It and how to trade it and.
00:17:21.616 - 00:17:27.580, Speaker B: Specifically how to trade it in a way that maximizes you making money from the ethereum that you have, to be fair.
00:17:28.430 - 00:17:43.390, Speaker A: Well, the two versions biggest fan is Justin and sun, who arguably tron, has the same sort of genesis know, the only thing people cared about was really trading.
00:17:45.410 - 00:17:49.506, Speaker B: Think the difference, though, is that I think Justin, for whatever criticism you might.
00:17:49.528 - 00:17:52.210, Speaker E: Make of him, he's clearly a very.
00:17:52.280 - 00:17:55.460, Speaker B: Engaged founder who has big ambitions to how to make.
00:17:58.070 - 00:18:03.910, Speaker E: I mean, maybe I'm missing it, but I have not seen any story about that with Ethpal.
00:18:05.610 - 00:18:13.298, Speaker B: This is part of the natural tension in blockchain, is that you do need to have some kind of leadership team for a blockchain to really be viable.
00:18:13.474 - 00:18:14.794, Speaker E: Unless the tech speaks for itself.
00:18:14.832 - 00:18:15.786, Speaker B: And it's very hard for the tech.
00:18:15.808 - 00:18:17.802, Speaker E: To speak for itself in 2022.
00:18:17.936 - 00:18:30.894, Speaker B: All right, let's move on. I think at this point, it's depressing enough to talk about ether dumping and ethpow being a nightmare. Let's talk about other different depressing topics. So one of the big news of the week, of course, has been our.
00:18:30.932 - 00:18:33.166, Speaker E: Good friend Doe Kwan, who was on.
00:18:33.188 - 00:18:35.118, Speaker B: The show before Terra collapsed.
00:18:35.134 - 00:18:38.020, Speaker E: And the vibe around Doe Kwan, really.
00:18:42.150 - 00:18:44.500, Speaker A: That'S just like a funny way of saying it.
00:18:46.310 - 00:18:52.062, Speaker B: I can't talk about Do Kwan now without feeling look, I've met Do Kwan in person multiple times.
00:18:52.216 - 00:18:53.142, Speaker E: He's a nice guy.
00:18:53.196 - 00:19:02.394, Speaker B: I mean, I know that he's kind of a dick, and he's a lot more of a dick online than he is in, but yeah, like, I don't I it's weird the fact that I know him personally, and he is now.
00:19:02.432 - 00:19:05.834, Speaker E: One of the most famous people in crypto, period, ever. Right?
00:19:05.872 - 00:19:09.238, Speaker B: Just like Satoshi. And then, like, doquan like Satoshi Vitalik.
00:19:09.254 - 00:19:10.794, Speaker E: Doe Kwan is probably the know of.
00:19:10.832 - 00:19:11.802, Speaker B: Most famous crypto people.
00:19:11.856 - 00:19:36.366, Speaker A: You know, I think the ultimate NFT of this last cycle that I will cherish forever is being followed by these accounts that basically are under siege in the sense that they're like doe Sue Kyle, where those accounts might be orphaned at any point. But whoever their followers are, you get to keep them forever. If you're followed by them, you're followed.
00:19:36.398 - 00:19:37.198, Speaker D: It'S like an NFT.
00:19:37.294 - 00:19:46.854, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an NFT. It is a sort of NFT of the last cycle if you're followed by them, which I thought because their followers haven't changed. They haven't been adding followers very much.
00:19:46.892 - 00:19:49.162, Speaker B: They've just kind of like, yeah, they're too busy too.
00:19:49.216 - 00:19:49.820, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:19:52.350 - 00:20:20.434, Speaker B: No, it's weird. Anyway, so Do Kwon, the news basically is that Korean authorities have now put out an arrest warrant for Dokwon. We don't have a ton of details on exactly what is in the arrest warrant, I believe, but it's something around some financial something something they're seeking to void his passport to prevent him from traveling. They've now also issued an interpol red notice to try to prevent him from kind of hopping country to country. Do Kwan claims that he is not.
00:20:20.472 - 00:20:22.914, Speaker E: On the run, which is a kind.
00:20:22.952 - 00:20:36.694, Speaker B: Of on the run thing to say of like, oh, no, I'm not on the run. I'm totally cool. But I don't know, at this point, it just seems kind of sad. This whole episode seems very sad, where, to be honest, personally, again, having met.
00:20:36.732 - 00:20:37.670, Speaker E: Do Kwan.
00:20:39.530 - 00:20:40.358, Speaker B: How he is as a.
00:20:40.364 - 00:20:49.010, Speaker E: Person aside, I think the criminalization of the failure of Terra is a dangerous precedent.
00:20:49.170 - 00:21:08.466, Speaker B: And now, again, we don't know all the details. They haven't released a whole lot of information about what exactly are the nature of the charges. It could be that they did absolutely heinous stuff, especially going to the Terra collapse, as a lot of people have speculated. Right now, we don't have any hard data to know one way or another whether or not they lied or misrepresented things to people, or if they misappropriated funds from the Lunar Foundation Guard for.
00:21:08.488 - 00:21:09.822, Speaker E: Themselves, no one knows.
00:21:09.886 - 00:21:12.530, Speaker B: So anything along those lines is really speculation.
00:21:12.870 - 00:21:16.926, Speaker E: But assuming that his crime was failing.
00:21:16.958 - 00:21:18.740, Speaker B: And losing people a lot of money.
00:21:20.150 - 00:21:24.690, Speaker E: This feels like a kind of dark and sad outcome for this whole Terra saga.
00:21:24.770 - 00:21:26.598, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys have any reflections on this or if you.
00:21:26.604 - 00:21:29.190, Speaker E: Know anything that I didn't already relay.
00:21:29.610 - 00:22:48.702, Speaker D: Well, I only know things that are already in the public domain, but I would suspect he's not being charged with losing people a lot of money. It's most likely to do with the public statements that he was making about the soundness and the safety of the system, which really is potentially what was causing the harm to the users of the blockchain if it was misinformation in some way. You don't get in trouble for losing people's money. You get in trouble for doing fraud or doing misinformation that loses people money. Like other situations where a huge amount of money gets vaporized and then it forks between crime and not crime is like Archegos, the hedge fund that imploded, like, $20 billion very quickly that veered into crime because they were deceiving banks and the people lending them money, lehman or AIG vaporizes $100 billion. And it's like, oh, no, it's no crime because they were a regulated business. And I really think it just comes down to whether or not somebody is playing by supervised rules or not in deciding.
00:22:48.766 - 00:22:56.358, Speaker B: It's also just how sympathetic they are. Right. The reality is that if you want to throw the book at somebody, you're going to go find something, and if a judge or a jury is not.
00:22:56.364 - 00:22:59.480, Speaker E: Going to be sympathetic, then you can get it done.
00:23:01.050 - 00:23:10.966, Speaker B: Again, I don't know. So I'm totally, wildly speculating, but whatever, it's our show. We can speculate. It feels to me like it needs.
00:23:10.988 - 00:23:13.066, Speaker E: To feel like someone did something, and.
00:23:13.168 - 00:23:18.186, Speaker B: Issuing an arrest warrant is like, the most something that you could possibly do, even if the actual substance of a.
00:23:18.208 - 00:23:21.626, Speaker E: Case is pretty thin. And that's what this smells like to.
00:23:21.648 - 00:23:32.094, Speaker B: Me, is that you're absolutely right. I'm sure that they can throw things from Twitter feed that says misrepresented the stability of the but also, it's all in the docs. You can see exactly how it works.
00:23:32.212 - 00:23:33.818, Speaker E: They talked about desk piles.
00:23:33.834 - 00:23:40.750, Speaker B: That's why they raise money to protect against it. And if they didn't raise enough money, that's on you as an investor to decide whether that's enough money to defend the peg.
00:23:40.830 - 00:24:08.490, Speaker A: But I will say the foundation guard and sort of some of the custodial entities involved in the middle may have misrepresented. And those are in my mind. If I were to guess, the Luna foundation guard probably is where all the legal liability lies. And I forget if they're a Singapore Nd or a Korean Nd, but the accounting and stuff that they were saying, that feels like the thing, that's where the liability exists.
00:24:08.830 - 00:24:42.200, Speaker C: Yeah, I was about to say the same thing. I think when we were talking about this on the show. Initially, I was saying, let's not criminalize failure. And very much in this camp of, like, Luna was an experiment, but it was all open source and honorable, and it's sort of on you, and it does feel like LFG funds. The rumors they were misused the Basis Cash thing as well kind of very much rubbed me the wrong way and kind of changed my perception. So I don't think there's anything necessarily criminal about what happened with Luna, but it's the stuff on the periphery that I think maybe is getting caught up.
00:24:42.730 - 00:24:52.246, Speaker B: Why do you say basis cash? So, by the way, just for quick people who don't know, so Basis Cash was the pseudonymous implementation of the basis protocol that was actually launched secretly by Doequan. He was anonymous.
00:24:52.278 - 00:24:58.460, Speaker E: When he launched it, it failed, and that was that. Why does that fact rub you the wrong way?
00:24:58.990 - 00:25:32.630, Speaker C: Something about, I don't know, missing disclosure around the fact that this was happening to Luna investors? I don't think there's anything actually in the legal system that would put them behind bars for this, but it's more optically not sort of disclosing this fact while you were running Luna seems pretty, I don't know, very strange. I don't think we'd really accept that of most other founders, especially if it imploded the same way Basis Cash did. I just think it's, like a very optically poor decision.
00:25:33.530 - 00:25:40.774, Speaker B: I see what you're saying at the same, like, I don't know anybody who didn't know that Basis Cash failed, who actually understood how stablecoins worked.
00:25:40.812 - 00:25:41.490, Speaker E: You know what I mean?
00:25:41.580 - 00:25:43.850, Speaker D: But nobody knew that it was doquan's project.
00:25:43.920 - 00:25:47.146, Speaker B: Right, but is the problem with basis Cash doe quan, like, mismanaged it?
00:25:47.168 - 00:25:49.340, Speaker E: Or is it that the fucking model doesn't work?
00:25:50.110 - 00:25:54.746, Speaker B: That seems like the takeaway is not that, like, wow, Doequan really mismanaged Basis cash? Yeah.
00:25:54.768 - 00:25:56.126, Speaker E: Basis cash didn't work.
00:25:56.308 - 00:26:06.800, Speaker C: Maybe it's more of an argument that having concrete evidence of the fact that this model doesn't work and then going in public and chilling Luna which is effectively the same model, arguably even worse, feels very off.
00:26:07.670 - 00:26:17.458, Speaker B: I'm going to do Team Luna right now. I totally disagree. What they did was they went and raised Luna Foundation guard a bunch of bitcoin to prevent exactly what they saw with Basis Cash.
00:26:17.544 - 00:26:21.254, Speaker E: Right? So to me, Basis Cash was completely public.
00:26:21.452 - 00:26:41.998, Speaker B: All of us knew about Basis cash. I mean, none of us were Luna investors, but all of us knew about Basis Cash and understood, hey, this is yet another example of this model not working. It's not the exact same as the Terra model. It's different. Terra was a full layer one. They had some applications that were using Luna, and Luna was getting integrated, and USD was getting integrated in different blockchains. So I think the story that they.
00:26:42.004 - 00:26:44.286, Speaker E: Were presenting was a coherent one, right?
00:26:44.308 - 00:26:45.566, Speaker B: And people fucking knew that.
00:26:45.588 - 00:26:47.930, Speaker E: Most other senior shares coins have broken.
00:26:48.090 - 00:27:03.954, Speaker B: So I understand optically, it's a terrible way to learn that story, right? Like learning that, oh, Basis Cash was launched as, like, a little experiment by Doe that blew up and he didn't tell anyone. And then we learned that the day.
00:27:03.992 - 00:27:06.478, Speaker E: After Terra blows up, it all ends.
00:27:06.494 - 00:27:14.386, Speaker B: Up looking really bad. But practically speaking, unless you're going to impugn the ability of a founder to launch something pseudonymously, or maybe the argument.
00:27:14.418 - 00:27:16.470, Speaker E: Is like, look, Luna's so big that.
00:27:16.620 - 00:27:20.258, Speaker B: You shouldn't be okay for you to launch something pseudonymously. If this is an experiment that you're.
00:27:20.274 - 00:27:21.814, Speaker E: Trying to learn from, you should allow.
00:27:21.852 - 00:27:22.826, Speaker B: The rest of your community to learn.
00:27:22.848 - 00:27:24.906, Speaker E: From it too, and understand the way.
00:27:24.928 - 00:27:27.020, Speaker B: You'Re thinking about the lessons that come from this.
00:27:27.790 - 00:27:31.210, Speaker E: But it feels to me like more that it was sensational rather than that.
00:27:31.360 - 00:27:32.986, Speaker B: There'S a clear reason why it was.
00:27:33.008 - 00:27:35.266, Speaker E: Wrong for them to have launched Basis Cash pseudonymously.
00:27:35.398 - 00:27:44.606, Speaker A: I do think it's sort of weird in the sense that it is sort of like making a competitor to your main protocol and under and on. Yeah.
00:27:44.708 - 00:28:02.338, Speaker D: Yes, there are multiple instances in DeFi of that. Obviously, we will not name names, but there's obviously quite a few projects where a team has gone out and built another project to the side or on top or adjacent, especially with anon projects.
00:28:02.514 - 00:28:06.966, Speaker E: I think it's more common than people think. Yeah, there was the famous story of.
00:28:06.988 - 00:28:16.026, Speaker B: The McCullough Now brothers who made the curve fork on Solana and ended up getting a bunch of attention. But I'm sure they're just the tip of the spear when it comes to.
00:28:16.128 - 00:28:19.050, Speaker E: DeFi founders getting cute with their ecosystems.
00:28:19.470 - 00:28:52.322, Speaker B: But anyway, moving a little bit away from Terra and Doe Kwan, there was another story that was just announced last night that the House, the US. House of Representatives is right now contemplating a bill that will involve the banning of algorithmic stable coins for two years. This seems I don't know. So the bill just had a bunch of random crap in it. So if I. Can just quickly kind of skim through it. Okay, so to place two year ban on coins similar to terra USD, it'd be illegal to issue or create new, quote, unquote, endogenously collateralized stablecoins.
00:28:52.322 - 00:28:58.802, Speaker B: Now, to be clear, this effectively grandfathers in currently endogenously collateralized stablecoins. So it only says that you can't.
00:28:58.866 - 00:29:04.666, Speaker E: Make a new one or issue a new one for two years. In that time, they want there to.
00:29:04.688 - 00:29:30.398, Speaker B: Be some, I think, like the fed to investigate UST and how it works and how to create a safer version of this or something. I don't know why they think the fed is the right organization to do that. And they're also going to be allowing banks and non banks to issue stablecoins, which you would need to get approval from the OCC in order to actually issue such a stablecoin. And then there's some other kind of random stuff in the bill. It seems like a total non starter bill to me. It seems so half baked that I.
00:29:30.404 - 00:29:33.102, Speaker E: Think there's just no way this thing is going to see the light of day.
00:29:33.236 - 00:30:22.702, Speaker D: Well, I think these changes are ridiculous, and I think these changes make the bill less likely. If you ask me a month ago, I would have said, oh, the stablecoin bill. There has a lot of broad bipartisan supports of regulate stablecoins. Now it's like, getting weirder. And a lot of that is reactionary to I think terra has scarred or freaked out a lot of people from staffers who are the ones writing this legislation to the people that will vote on it. But I think it's crazy. I don't anticipate in its current form it'll pass, but the part that's mind boggling to me is that I never could have imagined a year ago having a bill in the house that says, no algo stablecoins.
00:30:22.702 - 00:30:23.938, Speaker D: You will go to jail if you.
00:30:23.944 - 00:30:25.490, Speaker A: Make an algo stablecoin.
00:30:26.630 - 00:30:42.540, Speaker D: That's the surprising part. And I don't know if the fed needs to study it. I mean, I've traded almost every algo stablecoin that's ever been created, most of them unsuccessfully. I know a lot about algo stables at this point, and there's not that much to learn.
00:30:46.430 - 00:30:51.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I tend to agree. I think this seems like a well, it's a very understandable reaction.
00:30:51.722 - 00:31:28.034, Speaker A: Wait, can I actually pull the others on the show? What percentage of luna and or UST. And or I'm including consider what percent of that do you think was US. Investors versus, like, Korean versus Singapore? I'm just kind of curious to get a sense of how much if it's like, Americans lost a billion dollars, then, yeah, I could kind of see this getting through. If Americans lost $100 billion, probably not. You know what I mean? I'm just kind of fired a gate. Where do you guys fall on that spectrum?
00:31:28.162 - 00:31:36.810, Speaker D: I think it was completely spread out everywhere. I think it was like 50 50. I mean, everyone I knew was obsessed with terra I don't think that was like a US.
00:31:36.880 - 00:31:37.066, Speaker B: Thing.
00:31:37.088 - 00:31:47.082, Speaker D: I don't think that was like an Asian thing. I think everybody caught up in this because it was like the easiest way to make 20% until it collapsed.
00:31:47.146 - 00:31:48.158, Speaker A: 20%?
00:31:48.244 - 00:31:48.494, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:31:48.532 - 00:31:50.000, Speaker D: 20%. Yeah.
00:31:52.850 - 00:32:03.060, Speaker A: I'm just more curious about the net damage to US. Citizens because I kind of just roughly think the probability of success of these bills is like proportional to at least.
00:32:04.390 - 00:32:05.778, Speaker E: I understand the point you're making is.
00:32:05.784 - 00:32:41.950, Speaker B: That, okay, if the US. Bore the brunt of the losses, then that makes it more likely that this regulation is going to pass? I actually don't think that's correct. I think that as a legislator, you have such low fidelity in actually being able to understand the impact of economic damage. It's much more about the sentiment and the storyline that ends up trickling up into your constituents and into your general agenda than it is like a clean distillation of exactly where the damage was. And the other thing too, of course, us. Is much wealthier than any other country, right? So even if we took more of the damage on a percentage basis, it might be much lower.
00:32:42.100 - 00:32:48.850, Speaker E: And of course, the other thing is that, remember at the time the terra collapsed, the market cap of crypto was 1.5 trillion.
00:32:49.750 - 00:32:58.514, Speaker B: Terra between Luna and UST. On the whole had about $40 billion of market cap. And if you assume that was wiped out completely, which it basically was, then.
00:32:58.632 - 00:33:01.686, Speaker E: You lost 40 billion out of a $1.5 trillion base.
00:33:01.868 - 00:33:08.026, Speaker B: It's not actually in absolute terms, it's not that much. It was the fact that it brought down all the other crypto assets so.
00:33:08.048 - 00:33:11.580, Speaker E: Much and spooked the out of everybody.
00:33:12.030 - 00:33:17.770, Speaker B: That was actually the broader impact, was just the narrative and the fear.
00:33:18.190 - 00:33:42.974, Speaker A: I agree, but I kind of also think that if there were a lot of American losses, the stories you would get in the news would be like, as bad as they are in Korea or Singapore. This Korea and Singapore stories, if you read them, even just like Google translated the sentiment is like a hundred times worse than what they are here. So I guess my question is that's why I'm asking kind of where you think the US. Falls in the lost?
00:33:43.022 - 00:33:49.106, Speaker B: If I were to rank, I bet there's a big confounder here, which is that Korea has a much higher savings.
00:33:49.138 - 00:34:01.778, Speaker E: Rate than the US. So I suspect that a lot of these countries ultimately anchor was a savings product, right? So if you have a very high savings rate, then it's much more likely.
00:34:01.794 - 00:34:16.426, Speaker B: That you're going to put a lot of your wealth into this product. Whereas in the US. Because we're such a consumption driven economy, some guy loses twenty K and he's like, oh, that sucks. But I don't have that much savings to begin with because I have a ton of debt and I'm living off credit cards.
00:34:16.458 - 00:34:22.526, Speaker E: And a lot of people probably lost their unemployment checks on Terra, which in.
00:34:22.548 - 00:34:25.194, Speaker B: Absolute terms they lost a lot of their wealth. But they didn't have that much wealth.
00:34:25.242 - 00:34:29.762, Speaker E: Because we're such a credit driven economy. It's just kind of different, I think.
00:34:29.896 - 00:34:33.362, Speaker B: I don't think there'd be nearly as much desperation from people who lost money in the US.
00:34:33.496 - 00:34:36.626, Speaker E: Compared to clearly you can see it, right?
00:34:36.648 - 00:34:41.538, Speaker B: I don't see anywhere near you're, right. The density of stories that you saw coming out of Korea and different parts.
00:34:41.554 - 00:34:44.440, Speaker E: Of Asia than relative to what you saw in the US.
00:34:44.970 - 00:34:59.900, Speaker A: Which is also, I guess, maybe including all of that. Then it does feel like these types of bills are not going to pass because I feel like they need that kind of breach of negative sentiment to get the level of action you see you're seeing in Korea and supposedly Singapore soon.
00:35:00.910 - 00:35:19.854, Speaker D: And this is speaking extremely broadly, but I feel like a lot of the attitude, at least domestically, is one of self reliance. And it's like penny stocks are legal and most people are smart enough not to lose money on penny stocks. We don't have to criminalize them and make it illegal to create a penny stock.
00:35:19.902 - 00:35:22.546, Speaker E: Right. Most people don't do it.
00:35:22.568 - 00:35:55.870, Speaker D: And your parents tell you not to buy penny stocks. Right? I don't think we have to criminalize making an algo stablecoin. I think what we would be better served by doing is educating people that most algo stablecoins are horrifically stupid ideas and that they're going to lose all their money just like they would with a penny stock or playing blackjack. I think the better outcome is directing resources towards education instead of trying to criminalize something just because there was one really dumb implosion.
00:35:56.210 - 00:36:04.702, Speaker C: Are US entrepreneurs even making algo stable coins? I don't get the sense that it just feels very this is not exactly.
00:36:04.756 - 00:36:23.400, Speaker B: A hot area anymore after Terra, and there was a moment but this is the thing. Regulation of this kind is always so backwards looking, right? Like nobody wants to launch an algo stable right now. Nobody wants to buy algo stables right now. This is a problem the market solved for itself because it saw the most catastrophic dramatic failure in history.
00:36:24.090 - 00:36:25.286, Speaker E: And so it's kind of like, okay.
00:36:25.308 - 00:36:29.702, Speaker B: We'Re going to make this thing illegal that nobody wants to do. It's like, okay, great, awesome. We're glad you're here to save us.
00:36:29.836 - 00:36:34.890, Speaker D: Although I think I've seen an algo stablecoin, like pitch deck recently. I think there's still like one or two people.
00:36:34.960 - 00:36:55.810, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a few new ones. Angle was like the last one I saw that got funded and it's now like, oh, you can get all these angle safe yield vaults, but they're all just basically trying to be like, oh, they're all going sort of like for the FRAX model, effectively.
00:36:57.030 - 00:37:06.630, Speaker B: I think there's been more convergence around the FRAX model, which is basically like as minimally algo as possible and super super high collateral ratio, which is basically.
00:37:06.700 - 00:37:08.742, Speaker E: Just like, what's the point?
00:37:08.796 - 00:37:10.578, Speaker B: Semi full reserve banking.
00:37:10.674 - 00:37:12.082, Speaker E: It's very safe.
00:37:12.226 - 00:37:17.906, Speaker B: Or just banking with a very high reserve ratio. So, like 80%, 70% reserve ratio banking.
00:37:17.938 - 00:37:21.206, Speaker E: Which is very safe for obvious reasons, I guess.
00:37:21.228 - 00:37:23.706, Speaker A: The other I mean, not always.
00:37:23.888 - 00:37:24.874, Speaker E: Not always.
00:37:25.072 - 00:37:27.562, Speaker B: The other thing, I think that makes it particularly sensitive in the US.
00:37:27.616 - 00:37:30.762, Speaker E: Is because we still remember the GFC, right?
00:37:30.816 - 00:37:32.954, Speaker B: And it happened here. It happened on our watch.
00:37:33.072 - 00:37:34.078, Speaker E: And so I think there's a lot.
00:37:34.084 - 00:37:36.014, Speaker B: Of sensitivity around financial wait, wait.
00:37:36.052 - 00:37:40.240, Speaker A: Come on. It affected the whole world. We caused it.
00:37:40.850 - 00:37:45.518, Speaker B: We caused it. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying, right? If you're in Korea, you're like, yeah, GFC sucked. But it wasn't our fault.
00:37:45.534 - 00:37:48.498, Speaker E: It was Americans'fault. Americans screwed everything up for everyone else.
00:37:48.664 - 00:37:59.074, Speaker B: And I think for that reason, we have this kind of collective scar tissue that makes us particularly sensitive to terra, even if there wasn't actually that much.
00:37:59.112 - 00:38:01.118, Speaker E: Direct impact on Americans from terra.
00:38:01.134 - 00:38:04.118, Speaker B: I mean, obviously there were some, but it clearly wasn't as pronounced as it.
00:38:04.124 - 00:38:05.490, Speaker E: Was in some of these other countries.
00:38:05.650 - 00:38:23.782, Speaker A: Speaking of scar tissue, because I remember that whenever we talk about luna too much, we start getting people tweeting being like, this sucks. Stop talking about should we probably hit our cap on luna stuff. But we should talk about the other scar tissue, which is winter Mute.
00:38:23.926 - 00:38:25.338, Speaker E: Oh, yeah.
00:38:25.424 - 00:38:26.574, Speaker D: This is a sad one.
00:38:26.692 - 00:38:41.970, Speaker B: This is really sad. So winter mute. For those of you who don't know, winter mute is one of the most highly regarded market making firms in crypto. They're very DeFi native market making firms. They do a lot of stuff on chain in DeFi through DEXs and other DeFi platforms.
00:38:42.470 - 00:38:43.678, Speaker E: They ended up getting hacked.
00:38:43.694 - 00:38:51.618, Speaker B: So the backstory was that there was a revelation by the one inch team that there's a tool used to create vanity addresses called profanity.
00:38:51.714 - 00:38:52.998, Speaker E: So, vanity address, for those of you.
00:38:53.004 - 00:39:16.254, Speaker B: Who don't know, normally, when you create an address on a blockchain, you just generate some randomness, and it creates an address which is basically the equivalent of your public key. And this address is just a bunch of random bits. But what you can do is you can grind to try to find a basically try to generate more and more addresses one at a time until you get an address that has some kind of nice prefix that you want. So you might have a prefix that.
00:39:16.292 - 00:39:19.262, Speaker E: Says dead beef, and that's cool because.
00:39:19.316 - 00:39:38.066, Speaker B: It just kind of looks cool. It might cost you a bit of money to generate that by repeatedly trying millions or billions of combinations until you finally get one that has the right prefix, but with some mathematical certainty, you can do this. So there are a lot of tools to generate these vanity addresses. One of these tools was called profanity. And profanity, the one inch team revealed.
00:39:38.098 - 00:39:39.698, Speaker E: That there was a bug in profanity.
00:39:39.874 - 00:39:58.374, Speaker B: Or not a bug, but an implementation flaw that profanity. Normally an address has 256 bits of entropy, but they were doing something very stupid where basically they seeded this algorithm with 32 bits of entropy and then did some key derivation that was deterministic to extend it out to 256 bits.
00:39:58.422 - 00:40:01.134, Speaker E: Which basically meant that the entropy of.
00:40:01.172 - 00:40:04.846, Speaker B: Anything generated by profanity was basically 32.
00:40:04.868 - 00:40:08.750, Speaker E: Bits, modular, with some extra kind of grinding on top.
00:40:08.820 - 00:40:49.814, Speaker A: And to give people who don't think in binary, it's a rough proxy. 32 bits has 4 billion into numbers. 4 billion operations is not a lot, especially when the only thing you're really doing is doing a couple of elliptical curve multipliers or adds, depending on your belief in the poll. That vitalik. And Dan had a site over on Twitter, but it's actually a very small set of things, right? Whereas 256 bit integers is roughly ten to the 80th. So one followed by 80 zeros, 83 zeros. And that's slightly more than the number of particles in the known universe.
00:40:49.814 - 00:40:57.200, Speaker A: So 4 billion is a very tractable number. Ten to 80th is not a very tractable number. And that's sort of like the problem.
00:40:58.690 - 00:40:59.390, Speaker E: That's right.
00:40:59.460 - 00:41:08.158, Speaker B: With 4 billion potential addresses, or seeds rather, with 4 billion potential seeds to try to iterate through. You can do that on commercial.
00:41:08.334 - 00:41:09.986, Speaker E: You don't even need fancy hardware in.
00:41:10.008 - 00:41:37.674, Speaker B: Order to go through 4 billion possibilities. So what ended up happening was that when one is disclosed this, there was a bunch of folks who realized that they had these profanity generated addresses, vanity addresses that had already gotten hacked in the past, but everybody started trying to migrate their profanity addresses away because of course, they were now known to be insecure. And Winter Mute, I didn't actually catch the details of what they were doing because there was some kind of multi SIG or something that their profanity address was on.
00:41:37.712 - 00:41:40.298, Speaker E: And they so Winter Mute, by the.
00:41:40.304 - 00:42:22.374, Speaker A: Way, has had a couple fuck ups that have been epic, and they generally tend to come from the fact that when you look at the top tier DeFi trading firms like the SVPs of the World, they never make dumb mistakes like this. So I think this is actually Winter Mute's sort of technical incompetence. I would not qualify this as kind of like, oh, we should feel totally bad, and oh, it was great that they gave us the truth on Twitter. That's not true. This is like, there's a CVE out. Like you should be changing your systems and monitoring stuff. So Winter Mute's first up was when they were supposed to be a market maker for optimism, and they didn't initialize the Gnosis safe on optimism as they did on Mainnet.
00:42:22.374 - 00:43:10.154, Speaker A: And then someone figured out, again, kind of like a way where you could figure out what the sort of private key was more efficiently, or you deploy to that address and you own it. Right? They kind of up on the cybersecurity stuff, like left and right. There's a bunch of examples with them. So this is actually them being kind of like incompetent. Trading firms normally are structured in the normal markets where okay, if I'm starting HFT firm and I trade futures at the CME or I trade equities at Nasdaq and I colo there, if Nasdaqs up some cybersecurity thing and someone breaks in and changes my net margin or balance and gets me liquidated, I threw the shit out of, right? But you can't do that here. There's no reversion function here. And that means you have to be thinking about red teaming your code.
00:43:10.154 - 00:43:54.994, Speaker A: You can't just have this yolo attitude towards cybersecurity stuff. As a trading firm, you actually have to act like a cybersecurity firm, to some extent, auditor. That's why some of the best DeFi trading firms are actually people who are auditors first and traders second, whereas the people who are kind of like keeping up like Winter Mute are mainly traders who treat it like it's centralized trading. And that's very irresponsible, especially when you have other people's money, in their case. And so I actually don't think of this as like, oh, sad story. I think this is a cultural up on their part for not actually taking the cybersecurity and tech side seriously, because this is a huge CVE. So the index finance hacker in fact got his address drained.
00:43:54.994 - 00:44:21.210, Speaker A: It was like Robin Hood, I guess. And I thought that was kind of funny. But there were so many things in the world that were happening post this post by one inch, and there was a bunch of other people who validated different ways of emulating it. And you have a set of wallets with $100 million in it, and you're not reading these CVEs. That's your incompetence. You shouldn't be trading on chain. Just stick to centralized.
00:44:21.210 - 00:44:22.970, Speaker A: You should never be trading on chain.
00:44:23.130 - 00:44:28.210, Speaker D: Well, especially that much money in what amounts to like an EOA.
00:44:29.270 - 00:44:37.138, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why I'm saying all these people giving them compliments on Twitter, I kind of disagree with fundamentally, they should just stop.
00:44:37.304 - 00:44:45.494, Speaker B: Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing. I understand your point, and clearly, look, this was revealed. The one inch disclosure was like, two weeks ago. It was a while ago.
00:44:45.532 - 00:44:47.574, Speaker E: This is not like the moment that it happened.
00:44:47.612 - 00:44:50.934, Speaker B: And then they got got. That being said, the one thing that.
00:44:50.972 - 00:44:53.474, Speaker E: I will give wincher Mute credit for.
00:44:53.532 - 00:45:05.326, Speaker B: Is that one, they owned up to it, right? You said, okay, SCP and some of these other guys, they don't have these kinds of colossal well, they're also a lot quieter, right? So you don't necessarily see what they have made. We don't know what mess ups that.
00:45:05.348 - 00:45:06.254, Speaker E: Other firms have made.
00:45:06.292 - 00:45:07.598, Speaker B: I guarantee you everybody who's been doing.
00:45:07.604 - 00:45:11.086, Speaker E: This long enough has made massive ups. So that's one, right?
00:45:11.108 - 00:45:14.034, Speaker B: Like, just the velocity of stuff that they're doing. They're going to mess things up.
00:45:14.072 - 00:45:16.740, Speaker E: Crypto is hard, everybody has messed up.
00:45:17.270 - 00:45:21.746, Speaker B: Some in bigger ways than others but I agree with you.
00:45:21.768 - 00:45:38.710, Speaker A: But the reason I say this is Winter Mute has had very recently some clear big and that shows a cultural problem that shows I would not want them market making any protocol at all ever. They should just get out of DeFi trading.
00:45:39.450 - 00:45:53.962, Speaker B: I don't disagree. And look, the magnitude of this failure is so big that there's a good possibility that they wiped out all their profits from DFI potentially since inception. I have no idea but that seems plausible to me that basically they're like net down on DFI after having lost 160,000,000 of their own money.
00:45:54.016 - 00:45:58.480, Speaker E: Now that being said, the thing I'll give the credit for is that it's their money, right?
00:45:59.010 - 00:46:00.798, Speaker B: Although they are market makers, they have.
00:46:00.804 - 00:46:19.606, Speaker A: These loans, they have these loans from protocols that is very different. That's why I'm saying you actually have to right, they're covering it with their own money right now. Yes, but they actually did technically lose a protocol's assets the same way they lost optimism's assets. It shows that I believe they said.
00:46:19.628 - 00:46:22.194, Speaker B: That they're going to pay back the onchain debts.
00:46:22.242 - 00:46:33.022, Speaker A: No, they're going to pay them back but my point is if you are custodying these assets that are given to as a loan, you should be treating them with like the type of security custodian custody?
00:46:33.106 - 00:46:37.718, Speaker B: No, that's not custody man. They're in debt. That's not custody.
00:46:37.894 - 00:46:44.230, Speaker A: When you're in a market making loan these things are kind of half custody, half pure debt because yes in a.
00:46:44.240 - 00:46:47.578, Speaker B: Market making loan, yes in a market making loan, yes, but not the on chain borrows.
00:46:47.674 - 00:46:52.560, Speaker A: But you have SLAs that you sign up and you're basically not guaranteeing them.
00:46:54.130 - 00:47:09.014, Speaker B: Let's give them the time to see whether they actually pay everybody back and make these whole it's pretty clear. Look, Winter Mute, they plan to be running for a long time. They have a big enough balance know if guinea said that look, we have a bunch of positive equity, we're going to be fine.
00:47:09.132 - 00:47:09.986, Speaker E: This hurts.
00:47:10.098 - 00:47:19.874, Speaker B: Clearly that's a lot of money to lose for anybody and there's also the possibility of getting some remediation because it is a lot of money to try to move through DeFi, especially with tornado.
00:47:19.922 - 00:47:21.462, Speaker E: Now in some way.
00:47:21.516 - 00:47:35.914, Speaker A: Well the hacker was pretty smart. They put it in the curve pool, that was the first transaction because the only thing you can do that is freeze the whole pool. And I think whoever did this actually was quite competent.
00:47:36.042 - 00:47:46.266, Speaker B: Yes, they were smart but you can still see that doesn't prevent it's not cashing out, right? Like you still need to somehow cash out. Sure, somehow out of crypto and it's pretty easy to follow in a post tornado world.
00:47:46.388 - 00:47:48.386, Speaker E: So I think there's a good chance.
00:47:48.408 - 00:47:54.338, Speaker B: For recovery for at least some of the assets and finance they announced that they were on it, but I feel.
00:47:54.424 - 00:47:58.114, Speaker E: Like, look, losing 160,000,000 sucks, and for.
00:47:58.152 - 00:48:05.782, Speaker B: Sure, I agree with you. Look, we don't need to yell at them. They're going to learn this lesson. They've already learned a good chunk of it. The fact that they are not a.
00:48:05.836 - 00:48:10.794, Speaker E: Fund, they're a market maker. They raise equity capital, but they run their own money.
00:48:10.912 - 00:48:13.126, Speaker B: So for me, it's like, look, there's.
00:48:13.158 - 00:48:15.626, Speaker E: No principal agent problem here, right?
00:48:15.728 - 00:48:17.798, Speaker B: These guys are facing 100% the brunt.
00:48:17.814 - 00:48:21.958, Speaker E: Of the losses that they took, and it's on them to fix it, remediate.
00:48:21.974 - 00:48:23.530, Speaker B: It, and do things right.
00:48:23.600 - 00:48:39.026, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I'm more pointing out from the perspective. I have a protocol, a new onchain protocol, and I'm like, hey, which market maker should I go to? If someone I invest in is like, what market maker? I would just basically tell them, never go to interview. They've proven that this is, like, a problem.
00:48:39.208 - 00:48:53.238, Speaker B: I don't know. You could argue that, look, you shouldn't work with Jump because Jump lost all this money and Wormhole and blah, blah, blah. But then Wormhole like, Jump put the money back in wormhole, and it's all good. So to me, that's actually the strongest sign of strength. If you up for 160,000,000 and you.
00:48:53.244 - 00:48:55.298, Speaker E: Make good on all your debts, that's.
00:48:55.314 - 00:48:56.934, Speaker B: A strong sign that, okay, these guys.
00:48:56.972 - 00:49:13.900, Speaker A: Are this is different than wormhole. This is like there was an active CVE for multiple weeks. This is not like there was like a niche bug in this complicated software stack that happened. This was like something where there were so many this is more like, incompetence than it is.
00:49:15.730 - 00:49:39.190, Speaker D: I agree with that in that if you're running a hot wallet with $160,000,000 of funds or more that it manages, you better be really careful about managing that hot wallet, especially if it's a vanity hot wallet. I mean, I wouldn't use any address creation tool ever to make a wallet that stores a lot of money. Like, maybe for a couple of NFTs, it's fine.
00:49:39.260 - 00:49:39.494, Speaker E: Right.
00:49:39.532 - 00:49:47.206, Speaker D: But let alone using an address generating tool. You have a hot wallet that has $160,000,000.
00:49:47.308 - 00:50:13.118, Speaker A: I was just going to say, if you talk to any custodians who are generating entropy for an NPC ceremony or they literally will have a laptop in a room that's like a Faraday cage and absolutely no connectivity to generate the initial entropy. And then here we have the Yolo entropy. Right? And this is the kind of thing I'm saying. Exchanges and custodians are very, very careful about this type of stuff.
00:50:13.204 - 00:50:19.394, Speaker B: And they built their business defense in the defense of Wintermeade, right? So they said the reason why they.
00:50:19.432 - 00:50:22.146, Speaker E: Used profanity was not because they wanted.
00:50:22.168 - 00:50:33.426, Speaker B: To look cool and generate this cool address. The reason why they did it was because they generated an address that had a large number of prefix zeros, which actually is more gas optimized. And their whole thing is that, look, we did this not for vanity.
00:50:33.538 - 00:50:36.594, Speaker E: But for optimization, and of course premature.
00:50:36.642 - 00:50:39.020, Speaker B: Optimization is the ed, right?
00:50:40.910 - 00:50:52.910, Speaker C: I saw a good chart that was like, they saved like 16K in gas on the address and then they lost $160,000,000. Maybe not positive EV on that, unfortunately.
00:50:53.410 - 00:51:04.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, also we don't know that they didn't take profanity and go run it inside Faraday cage. It's a client side thing, right? So they still have to generate the entropy client side.
00:51:05.330 - 00:51:08.500, Speaker E: But yeah, look, Tarun, you make a good point.
00:51:09.350 - 00:51:11.154, Speaker B: The good thing here is that they.
00:51:11.192 - 00:51:13.474, Speaker E: Lost their own money. So that's the most you can hope.
00:51:13.512 - 00:51:14.898, Speaker B: For when somebody messes up is that.
00:51:14.904 - 00:51:17.202, Speaker E: They are completely internalizing the cost of.
00:51:17.256 - 00:51:20.374, Speaker B: Their mistake, which you can't say for.
00:51:20.412 - 00:51:21.858, Speaker E: Many other failures in crypto.
00:51:21.954 - 00:51:23.398, Speaker B: So for that reason, that is the.
00:51:23.404 - 00:51:27.698, Speaker E: Reason why for me, I think it's very, very different than something like Terra.
00:51:27.874 - 00:52:18.458, Speaker A: And I think the interesting thing that this has shown if we looked over the last two years is the new type of trading for when electronic trading started, say, pre reg NMS. So like 2000, when it was really starting to heat up, it was like, oh, these new types of people entered finance who looked very different than the old fuel, right? Like the 90s was like the math and physics PhDs, but then the 2000s was like all the hard. Well, 2000 was really like software engineer, like low level software engineers and then 2010s was like hardware engineers. And there's kind of at each stage of finances kind of increase in history, it adds one new technical skill that the next generation of trading firms have to have. And clearly this has shown that the cybersecurity OpSec type of thing is the next high demand finance job. That would be my guess for the.
00:52:18.464 - 00:52:58.130, Speaker D: Next ten years, unless there's startups and platforms that abstract it away for people, you should be able to plug in or trade in DFI without having to become the world's best at cybersecurity. I think this is the gap and there's obviously a lot of startups that are attempting to fill this gap and I'm bullish on this, but I guess my view is you shouldn't have to be having hard science inside a trading firm. You should be able to plug in to someone that can incredibly securely give you access to any smart contract without private key management.
00:52:59.270 - 00:53:01.638, Speaker B: As long as these things are turning complete, there's just no way we're going.
00:53:01.644 - 00:53:04.086, Speaker E: To get there anytime soon. It's kind of like you could say.
00:53:04.108 - 00:53:11.114, Speaker B: Like, well, why is it the trading firms need to have hardware engineers working on optimizing FPGAs and all this other stuff?
00:53:11.152 - 00:53:13.306, Speaker E: It's like, well, in some sense you.
00:53:13.328 - 00:53:16.426, Speaker B: Can'T be too prescriptive about what finance should and shouldn't be.
00:53:16.448 - 00:53:18.218, Speaker E: Finance is always going to find some way.
00:53:18.384 - 00:53:39.470, Speaker A: Finance also likes to vertically integrate, right? They don't like people at each firm like to silo and not. And I feel like that's what's going to happen. That's kind of what will end up happening here. But it's good. It's like a good evolution. Like people having these events means that people realize that they have to start by focusing on these things. But there's always someone who takes a huge loss.
00:53:39.470 - 00:53:48.450, Speaker A: There's always the LTCM of every new kind of financial world. So maybe hopefully this is the maximum of that.
00:53:48.600 - 00:53:49.730, Speaker B: I kind of doubt it.
00:53:49.800 - 00:53:51.046, Speaker E: I mean, every time I put that.
00:53:51.068 - 00:53:55.266, Speaker B: In crypto next week, there's an even bigger one. Yeah, someone else is going to lose.
00:53:55.298 - 00:53:56.920, Speaker D: A lot more money at some.
00:53:59.050 - 00:54:06.666, Speaker B: There. If there is one bet to make in crypto, this is one thing that Kyle simani says a lot, is that the number one lesson in crypto is.
00:54:06.688 - 00:54:11.900, Speaker E: That basically people have the memory of goldfish and nobody ever learns anything. Really.
00:54:12.430 - 00:54:14.686, Speaker B: If you can bake the lesson into.
00:54:14.788 - 00:54:18.958, Speaker E: The software, then maybe you can solve it, but if you can't do that.
00:54:19.124 - 00:54:21.134, Speaker B: You'Re screwed to repeat history.
00:54:21.332 - 00:54:23.294, Speaker E: And I think that's probably the case here.
00:54:23.412 - 00:54:31.090, Speaker D: Well, I learned this specific lesson in 2013 when I tried to use a website to make a bitcoin paper wallet.
00:54:32.230 - 00:54:33.858, Speaker B: Like siphon your address or what?
00:54:33.944 - 00:54:41.750, Speaker D: Yeah, never generate an address unless it's in a faraday cage or it's on hardware.
00:54:42.250 - 00:54:42.950, Speaker E: Got it.
00:54:43.020 - 00:54:53.514, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. Well, it's been a week full of just kind of depressing bad stuff. We haven't talked about anything positive. Has anything positive happened to any of you guys in crypto in the last.
00:54:53.552 - 00:54:55.260, Speaker E: Week that we can end the show on?
00:54:55.710 - 00:55:03.222, Speaker D: Well, the merge was a success and the merge, the ethereum blockchain is humming along. It's incredible.
00:55:03.286 - 00:55:05.774, Speaker E: So that's the silver. That's great.
00:55:05.892 - 00:55:25.346, Speaker B: Yeah, I was up super late that night. I was on the east coast, and so it was like 03:00 a.m. That the merge finally went through. And I was watching the live stream of all the e devs in Berlin and they were all just like everybody was like, oh my god, I can't believe it's really happening. And I got really choked up. It was like a really special moment. And then markets had to go on.
00:55:25.368 - 00:55:32.840, Speaker E: All of it the next day. But we can't have anything nice in crypto for longer than longer than a few hours.
00:55:33.530 - 00:55:49.078, Speaker A: That's not true. You're just like wallowing in the bear market. We should be excited about all the new technologies people are working on instead of new dog coins. Yeah, there's no new dog coins coming out right now, which is that's positive.
00:55:49.174 - 00:55:50.060, Speaker B: That's good.
00:55:50.770 - 00:55:55.790, Speaker D: No, I actually saw that there was winter mute enu was actually a token.
00:55:58.450 - 00:56:11.666, Speaker B: Why must you do that to them? We got to get if guinea on the show. We got to get of guinea on the show. I agree. I think we need to get if guinea and tarun one on one, get.
00:56:11.688 - 00:56:13.346, Speaker E: Them to hug it out because it.
00:56:13.368 - 00:56:15.554, Speaker B: Felt like there was I didn't mean.
00:56:15.592 - 00:56:48.320, Speaker A: To just take out just. On them. I've seen a bunch of these trading firm mistakes and then you see the SCP, then you see the people who are there's only one trading firm who's ever done a JIT attack. JIT is a just in time liquidity attack where you add a bunch of uniswap LP position right in front of mean all these people say attack. But this is a trade, really opportunity. But you can't flash loan it. So you have to put up capital and it's actually quite hard to execute because you have to hedge the price movement that happens.
00:56:48.320 - 00:57:08.806, Speaker A: And the people doing that, you can see that they're churning addresses and doing all sorts of crazy stuff to hide themselves. And I think there are some people out there who are extremely competent at OpSec stuff, really very competent. And I think those people will be the firms that kind of win in the long run.
00:57:08.988 - 00:57:10.086, Speaker E: That's true.
00:57:10.268 - 00:57:27.820, Speaker D: To end the show, I'd like to ask Tarun a hypothetical question. If you had a protocol with a treasury and you had to pick who to send it to, either Wintermute or Three Arrows Capital in their Treasury Management program circa one year.
00:57:30.350 - 00:57:39.706, Speaker A: And someone today had a shirt that on the front said Three Arrows Capital Treasury Management. On the back said Three Rows Capital Risk Management. So I thought that was pretty funny.
00:57:39.898 - 00:57:40.686, Speaker B: That's pretty good.
00:57:40.708 - 00:57:42.522, Speaker A: As long as we're talking about cool shirts.
00:57:42.586 - 00:57:45.154, Speaker C: I got to rep my shirt a little bit right now.
00:57:45.192 - 00:57:46.622, Speaker A: I guess probably the camera.
00:57:46.686 - 00:57:47.300, Speaker E: Nice.
00:57:47.910 - 00:58:00.200, Speaker A: No, actually it looked great. Yeah. Look, if I only had those two options, I would say Winter Muse. But honestly, I'd rather pay up for the people I know who win the liquidation wars because those people are clearly the best.
00:58:00.650 - 00:58:02.918, Speaker B: But they're not going to take your money, that's the problem.
00:58:03.084 - 00:58:06.280, Speaker A: Well, no, they'll do protocol, market making. They're fine with that.
00:58:06.810 - 00:58:07.318, Speaker E: Sure.
00:58:07.404 - 00:58:08.706, Speaker B: I'm taking they don't take external capital.
00:58:08.738 - 00:58:09.960, Speaker E: Is what I mean.
00:58:13.150 - 00:58:17.580, Speaker B: It's either Three Arrows or you have to take what you can get, man.
00:58:18.110 - 00:58:18.762, Speaker E: Anyway.
00:58:18.896 - 00:58:30.250, Speaker B: All right, so to wrap up this real quick, just because this show has been such a downer, one thing from each of us that you're excited about. I'll go first. I'm really excited about Zkvms coming to Mainnet.
00:58:30.410 - 00:58:31.840, Speaker E: Tom, what are you excited about?
00:58:32.690 - 00:58:43.060, Speaker C: This is kind of random, but Internet game launched this week and I've been playing and it's super fun. It's like the most fun I've had playing a crypto game. So everyone should check it out. Yeah, it's been great.
00:58:45.430 - 00:58:46.180, Speaker D: Game.
00:58:46.550 - 00:58:50.502, Speaker C: It is not. It is a game that you play in your browser, which makes it fun.
00:58:50.556 - 00:58:57.222, Speaker A: It's good. Is this the thing where you win NFTs? It's like HQ type thing?
00:58:57.276 - 00:59:09.980, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes it high stakes because it's like, I bought this ticket and I want to win the NFT. And so there's skin in the game and people are getting really competitive about it and yeah, it's a cool energy.
00:59:10.450 - 00:59:12.142, Speaker E: Robert, what are you excited about?
00:59:12.276 - 00:59:16.734, Speaker D: I'm excited about Compound V three. It's running. It's pretty sweet. It's going to grow.
00:59:16.932 - 00:59:17.674, Speaker E: It's humming.
00:59:17.722 - 00:59:18.318, Speaker D: It's new.
00:59:18.404 - 00:59:20.990, Speaker E: Nice. Exciting. Tarun?
00:59:22.210 - 00:59:35.200, Speaker A: I'm excited about features in lending protocols like Compound V Three, where the supply side and demand side rates are adjustable separately because that will change some of the capital efficiency in D Five. Quite.
00:59:35.690 - 00:59:36.102, Speaker E: Okay.
00:59:36.156 - 00:59:39.494, Speaker B: No, leave it to Tarun to find the most esoteric detail to get excited about.
00:59:39.532 - 00:59:39.894, Speaker E: That's great.
00:59:39.932 - 00:59:40.870, Speaker B: I love that.
00:59:41.020 - 00:59:41.382, Speaker E: Cool.
00:59:41.436 - 00:59:48.580, Speaker B: All right, well, that is it for this week. Thank you, everybody. We'll be back next week. I'm sure prices will be a lot higher than they are today. Not really. I have no idea. Thanks, everyone.
