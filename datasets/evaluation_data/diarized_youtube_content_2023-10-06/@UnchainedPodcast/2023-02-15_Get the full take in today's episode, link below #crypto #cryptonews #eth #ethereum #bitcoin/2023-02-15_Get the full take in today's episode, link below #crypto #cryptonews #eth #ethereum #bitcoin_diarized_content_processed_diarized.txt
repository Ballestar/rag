They don't realize how much of a benefit it is to portfolio companies. A lot of the times, a lot of investors are saving Porto's asses, honestly, by actually participating in governance. Sometimes it's not through the best process. Sometimes it doesn't look good, sometimes they're self interested, sometimes they're not. They are really helping their port goes. And so if you look at it from a 16 Z's perspective, they often hold, like, more tokens than anyone else.

So what's a 16 Z's defense against this? Well, they could say, we're going to hold fewer tokens. They have no interest than doing that. So what they're going to do instead is they're going to say, let's delegate some votes. Why are we going to delegate?
