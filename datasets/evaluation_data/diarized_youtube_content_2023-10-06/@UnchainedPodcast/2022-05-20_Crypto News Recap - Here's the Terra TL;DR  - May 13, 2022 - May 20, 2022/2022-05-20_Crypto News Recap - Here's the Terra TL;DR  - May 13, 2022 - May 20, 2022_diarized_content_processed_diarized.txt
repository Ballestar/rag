However, some validators are not fans. Allnode CEO Constantin Boyko Romanovsky said to the bloc, the whole governance process of this proposal looks like a dictatorship model.

00:07:28.998 - 00:08:26.880, Speaker A: In light of Coinbase's announcement that the exchange would retain user assets in the event of a bankruptcy, officials from Joe Biden's administration are pressing Congress to demand cryptocurrency exchanges keep their customers'money separate from corporate funds. Don't think you actually own your tokens when you go into a digital wallet, said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, Gus Koldebella, partner at Trueventures, tweeted that the Biden administration's logic gets a lot wrong. Koldebella thinks the problem is how bankruptcy law treats exchange wallets. For this reason, a legitimate fix that forces cryptocurrency exchanges to keep their customers'money separate from their own corporate funds is no fix at all. It's not the source of the problem, and it doesn't solve the legal issue, he wrote. On a related note, SEC Chair Gary Gensler testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government this week and asked for a bigger budget to control the crypto space.

Apparently, the only ones that lost millions of dollars in the Terra Luna fiasco were retail investors.
00:10:06.922 - 00:10:47.610, Speaker A: According to some tweets and press releases. Major VC firms and investment funds have confirmed that they had no or very little exposure to Luna. Among these companies are Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Multicoin, Dragonfly Framework and Anjuno, which disclosure is a sponsor of my shows. On Wednesday, after saying nothing for more than ten days, galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz broke his silence. He said Galaxy has no exposure to algorithmic stablecoins.

Everyone I talked to says they are okay. Somebody must be lying, he said, laughing in agreement with Haseeb, kevin Zhou, the Chopping Block guest, added, there is no way that's true. But what would be even more harrowing is that if it was true, it would mean that the insiders dubbed on retail and got out unscratched eventually. A few companies admitted to having exposure to Luna. Delphi Digital said on Thursday it has a large unrealized loss, and Hashed Wallet, a venture fund, sold $3.5 billion, according to Onchain Data.
