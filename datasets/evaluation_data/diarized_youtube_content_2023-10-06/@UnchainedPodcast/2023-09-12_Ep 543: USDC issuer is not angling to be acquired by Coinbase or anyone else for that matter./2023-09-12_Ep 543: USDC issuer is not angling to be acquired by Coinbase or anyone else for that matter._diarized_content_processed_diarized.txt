00:00:00.410 - 00:00:33.270, Speaker A: We're definitely on the path to be an independent public company. We've had the benefit of having a number of strategic investors in the company over the years. More recently, BlackRock took a minority stake in the company as part of a broader strategic partnership between the firms. That was last year. Having a stake in a company can create really good product and value alignment. And that's really key me and it's important. I want to make sure that Coinbase has a stake in our long term success in addition to being able to make money from USDC.
00:00:33.270 - 00:00:59.260, Speaker A: I think that's like a win win, but as a company. Just to be clear, it's our ten year anniversary, so it's a fun year for us, and I say this often, but when we founded the company ten years ago, I made it very clear to my investors and employees that this is a multidecade journey to really realize the vision of the company.
