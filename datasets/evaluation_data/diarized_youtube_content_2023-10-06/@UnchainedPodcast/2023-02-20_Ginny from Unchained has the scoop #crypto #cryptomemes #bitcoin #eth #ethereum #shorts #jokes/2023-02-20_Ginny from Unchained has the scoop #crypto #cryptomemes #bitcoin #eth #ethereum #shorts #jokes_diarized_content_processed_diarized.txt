00:00:00.250 - 00:00:39.026, Speaker A: On a recent CNBC podcast episode, worldwide web creator Tim Berners Lee referred to crypto as dangerous and compared it to the bubble, which feels unfair to me because the.com bubble at least has the decency to be over. Listen, I believe in anyone's right to criticize anything, but is this not a little bit of a Frankenstein and his monster situation? If he wants to take credit for all the people who got laid because of Tinder, he's also gotta accept responsibility for whatever happened at NFT Miami. Tim Berners Lee also wanted listeners to know that he is dissatisfied with the way that his original vision for the Internet played out. We know. Have you been on the Internet recently? It's all pop up ads. No shit.
00:00:39.026 - 00:00:59.370, Speaker A: He didn't intend for that to happen. I don't mean to be too hard on Berners Lee. He is doing his best to write the Internet. For instance, he created a startup with the aim of giving people more control over their data. Only problem with his startup is that named it Interrupt, which I have to imagine is supposed to evoke images of disruption within oneself. To be honest, I'm just thinking about that time that I ate four Fiber One bars in one sitting.
