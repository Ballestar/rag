00:01:31.872 - 00:01:33.370, Speaker B: It's a pleasure to be here.
00:01:33.520 - 00:01:39.498, Speaker A: This week, your company made an announcement that will surely be interesting to my crypto audience. Tell us about your news.
00:01:39.664 - 00:01:51.022, Speaker B: So we're very excited to have announced that we've launched cryptocurrency into the 401K. This is something that we've been working on for a while, and we're thrilled to finally have the word out.
00:01:51.156 - 00:01:59.118, Speaker A: And so what does that mean for employees at companies who use for us all as a 401K provider?
00:01:59.294 - 00:02:37.902, Speaker B: Yeah, so let me back up if it's okay, and just start by just saying why we even did this in the first place. Over the last few years, there's been an absolute revolution in the financial services world. And we've seen institutional investors like Harvard, Brown, Yale making use of cryptocurrency as part of their endowments. 60% of all professional managers actually now say that cryptocurrency has a role to play in their portfolios. Average Americans mostly invest and get exposure to the market through their 401 KS, and nobody was making this available. So we have now brought cryptocurrency into the 401K. So here's how this will work.
00:02:37.902 - 00:03:30.906, Speaker B: Employers that have our for us all branded four one k, their employees will be able to log in. They'll have their traditional mutual fund options right there. There'll also be an option for cryptocurrency, and they'll be able to transfer part of their balance over to the cryptocurrency window, where they can buy and sell tokens ETH bitcoin up to 50 different cryptocurrencies available through the window. They will also be able to set it up so that every time they contribute to the 401K part of their portfolio, part of that contribution will go directly into Bitcoin if that's the way they want to set it up. So we're really excited to bring access to cryptocurrency into the it's not just access. We've thought very carefully about how we provide the guidance, education and guardrails to help people make good prudent use of cryptocurrency as part of their portfolios.
00:03:31.098 - 00:03:32.960, Speaker A: And when you say that, what do you mean?
00:03:33.750 - 00:04:11.370, Speaker B: Well, there's educational content available. What is cryptocurrency? How does it fit into a portfolio? Common pitfalls to avoid that's delivered via online and through webinars. And then there's guidance. We believe that as part of a diversified portfolio, it may be appropriate to have somewhere between zero and 5% in your retirement portfolio allocated to cryptocurrency. And we'll help people figure out where they fit in that spectrum. But there are also guardrails and in this, I mean that there's a limit to how much we'll let you transfer over into the crypto window. Right now that limit is at 5%.
00:04:11.370 - 00:04:37.030, Speaker B: So people will be able to transfer up to 5% and be able to contribute on an ongoing basis up to 5%. And should those portfolios grow as we expect they will and the position exceeds 5%, there's proactive, monitoring and alerts that goes out and encourages them to rebalance. Lets them know that their crypto position has exceeded what we think is a prudent threshold and that it might be a good time to rebalance into the traditional mutual funds.
00:04:37.850 - 00:04:53.158, Speaker A: But it won't force them. So if it ends up, as some of my listeners have told me, where their crypto portfolio ends up being something like 90% of all their net worth, it won't kind of force that rebalancing.
00:04:53.334 - 00:05:17.890, Speaker B: We're not forcing rebalancing. It is a self directed crypto window. So in the end, the individual will make the decision whether or not to sell that position. But we will cap how much they can put in there. And if it goes to 90% of their portfolio, well, we think that's an extremely aggressive position to take and we would strongly encourage them to take some of those gains and rebalance them into their traditional funds.
00:05:18.310 - 00:05:30.862, Speaker A: And what are the advantages to buying crypto in a 401K as opposed to just keeping it in a regular crypto account on an exchange or withdrawing and putting it in your own hardware wallet?
00:05:31.006 - 00:06:03.882, Speaker B: Yeah, well, so there's a lot of real good reasons to do this in the let's start with the people that are already investing in cryptocurrency. The obvious reason that people use 401 KS in the first place is for the tax advantages. And many people don't realize this, but in a 401K you can put in money on a pretax basis, which is what most people do. You can also put money in on a post tax basis, a Roth contribution. So you pay your taxes at the moment that you've earned the income, it goes into the 401K. You can then invest that into cryptocurrency, among other things. And at that point, you've already incurred the taxes.
00:06:03.882 - 00:06:39.210, Speaker B: All of the gains are tax free. Even at retirement, when you take that money out, it is tax free. So it's a huge advantage to be able to reduce and mitigate your tax liability. And I think that that's not just on the taxes. What we've seen in the past when there was some periods of extreme volatility and people would buy a position, see it go up, sell the position, roll that into something else. Let's say they sell Bitcoin, they put that into ETH, they've now incurred a big tax liability. If that ETH then goes down, they may or sometimes have to sell at a loss to cover the tax liability that they had.
00:06:39.210 - 00:07:14.870, Speaker B: So in a 401K, all of this goes away, the tax issue is solved. So that's one. But here's the second thing, and that is we believe what we know, there's a ton of people that are what I will call crypto curious. And for them, the ability to use their four hundred and one k to dollar cost average in, in small incremental ways, get help and guidance, not have to open up another account, not have to worry about keys, not have to think about which platform I should be with, simplifies this tremendously. So we think this is actually a huge step for bringing more and more people into the crypto ecosystem.
00:07:15.610 - 00:07:32.230, Speaker A: And just to ask about the Roth 401K, as far as I understand, I don't think that's a super popular option. But is that something that all the small businesses that use for us all can offer to their employees?
00:07:32.390 - 00:07:55.794, Speaker B: Absolutely, yeah. So that's a standard part of all the 401K plans that we work with, because we do think actually it isn't as well utilized, I think, as it should be. It makes a ton of sense. And when you're dealing with something like cryptocurrency, it's even more important to consider. Now we don't provide tax advice, but it does make a lot of sense for a lot of people. And we think that it's unfortunate that perhaps it's not more widely used.
00:07:55.992 - 00:08:23.740, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to draw that out a little for people, if you qualify to have a Roth account, then at that time it's because your income is below a certain threshold. And so one could imagine you would be in a lower tax bracket. And if the crypto assets were to go up in the same way that they had the last few years, then of course, yes, the tax savings by the time you withdraw the money would be tremendous phenomenal. Right.
00:08:24.110 - 00:08:43.410, Speaker B: And frankly, that's one of the things that prompted us to really explore this is we were talking to a lot of people in the crypto community that were doing incredibly difficult trying to find ways to help mitigate some of their taxes. And when we talked to them about maybe being able to do this in, the response was incredibly enthusiastic.
00:08:43.750 - 00:08:55.046, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. So up until this point, why haven't most Americans been able to invest in crypto assets through their 401 KS? Or why have most 401 KS not provided it?
00:08:55.228 - 00:09:30.306, Speaker B: Well, so the 401K industry, Laura, is notoriously slow moving. I do believe it's inevitable. I think that we will see this more and more, but there's really a combination of two things that you have to get comfortable with. There's regulations and then there's integrations. And on the regulation side, 401K world is governed by a body of laws called ERISA. It is a very specific set of rules that give a lot of people pause. We worked very, very carefully to make sure that we understood exactly how within that framework we could do this, and it's very clear that we can.
00:09:30.306 - 00:10:03.610, Speaker B: And so we were able to solve that. But the second is that most 401K providers simply don't have a cryptocurrency platform to work with. So what we had to do is we partnered with Coinbase. So we're using Coinbase for both custody as well as for transactions. We've integrated that into our 401K platform. And maybe one of the reasons we were able to do this so quickly is that we've been building integrations with 401K providers and platforms and payroll companies for the last several years. So we're not a traditional 401K company.
00:10:03.610 - 00:10:15.200, Speaker B: We're a 400 and K tech company. Doing the integration was therefore very much in our DNA. So bringing Coinbase in, integrating it with a four and k platform, we're able to provide something that nobody else is.
00:10:16.050 - 00:10:35.622, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss other comparisons when it comes to retirement accounts.

Back to my conversation with Jeff Schultze. So there have been a few bitcoin IRAs that have also come out in recent years. How is the Alt 401K different?
00:11:48.610 - 00:12:27.610, Speaker B: So that's a great question. I'd say that the Alt 401K is different from self directed IRAs for a couple of reasons. It's maybe two or three primary things. A self directed IRA is a great vehicle, but that's for an individual and there are limits to who's eligible and how much you can contribute to that. But mostly that's a great solution for a person that is proactive to go out and find it and take advantage of it. The 401K allows you to contribute substantially more to it. It's available through your employer and therefore it's a lot easier and more accessible for most people.
00:12:27.610 - 00:12:59.346, Speaker B: I'd say the other key thing is in the 401 world, we are providing institutional pricing. So the cost of this through the 401K is substantially less than the self directed Iris that we've seen out there. So you can contribute more at a lower cost. And this is maybe the most key thing with a 401. You can do the ongoing contributions with every paycheck. That's just not something that you can do as easily in a self directed IRA. So we think those are some important differences.
00:12:59.346 - 00:13:05.480, Speaker B: But I have tremendous respect for the folks that are also doing this in the self directed IRA world, and hats off to them too.
00:13:07.530 - 00:13:31.262, Speaker A: One thing that listeners have heard me talk about is early on I had been pitched a bitcoin IRA, and the fee on that was 15% of the assets that you transferred over. And that really struck me as being outrageous, frankly. So what are the fees when it comes to the Alt 401K?
00:13:31.396 - 00:13:57.750, Speaker B: Yeah, so first of all, for the employer, there's no extra fee. For employees that choose to use it, there's a 1% platform fee per year, so that's 8.3 basis points a month, and then there is a 50 basis points transaction fee. So we've worked really hard to try to keep the costs we think, very low and competitive. And we think that that's part of the reason why doing this into 401K makes sense. Institutional pricing.
00:13:58.490 - 00:14:08.058, Speaker A: And so who is this available to? Is it available only to employees at companies that use for us all as their 401K service provider today?
00:14:08.144 - 00:14:34.914, Speaker B: Yes, it's only available to companies that choose to hire for us all as their 401K provider. We're thrilled to see so many people doing that. 60% of all the people we talked to have said that they want to have cryptocurrency as part of the 401K. But certainly we are looking at how we can expand that. And we have some exciting plans in the future that I'd love to come back and talk to you about some other time. But right now the Alt 401K is the only place to get this.
00:14:35.032 - 00:14:39.080, Speaker A: And so how many companies is that and how many employees does that cover?
00:14:39.770 - 00:14:52.140, Speaker B: So today we reach over 70,000 employees across hundreds of different companies, and we'll be turning this on for our customers starting in July. We expect that we'll see broad adoption across all of them.
00:14:52.590 - 00:15:02.278, Speaker A: When you went to create this, was it because you were seeing demand from those companies, or was it just you were looking to service what you believe will be upcoming demand?
00:15:02.454 - 00:15:32.198, Speaker B: It's really a combination of both. I mean, I'd say a really big part of this was just observing what's going on with professional and institutional investors. And I'd say that part of the reason we started the company in the first place was to give average americans some of the same access and help that the professionals do. That's really why the company has been called for us all. It really came out of that ethos. So when you start just looking around at what's happening and you recognize that people like the Yale Endowment are putting well beyond I mean, they're putting 50, 60, 70% into alternative investments. And then you look at what's going on in.
00:15:32.198 - 00:16:04.462, Speaker B: The part of the reason they're doing that, Laura, is the pool of publicly traded companies, which is what the mutual funds are all invested in, has been shrinking over time. There's actually fewer publicly traded companies today than there were 1015 years ago. So you see the institutional investors, they're doing this. They're making good use of this for a good reason. That was one of the first clues. The second is we started talking to employers, and as I mentioned, 60% of all the employers we talked to said, I want to do this, and they wanted to do this for a whole host of reasons. But we also started talking to the employees, and employees also said, I'm extremely interested.
00:16:04.462 - 00:16:45.854, Speaker B: In fact, you look today, 49% of millennials are already using cryptocurrency, and they're asking us, why can't I do this in the 401K? Frankly, it was everywhere. I mean, the real question is, why hasn't anybody done this before? So once we started seeing all of those pieces and it just reached, well, okay, you have to figure out how you do it with the regulations, you have to figure out the technology. But we could do all that because of what our background is. So it was really a combination all around. I expect that over time, the interest in demand for cryptocurrency will continue. I mean, this is to me, we have crossed the rubicon. It is absolutely irreversible, and there's going to be some, I think, really key benefits to incorporating into the 401K.
00:16:45.854 - 00:16:52.880, Speaker B: We're the first. We expect that this will become commonplace over a period of time. 401k industry doesn't move that fast.
00:16:55.350 - 00:17:02.530, Speaker A: As I'm sure you know, the saying goes, not your keys, not your coins. How is the security for these crypto assets?
00:17:04.890 - 00:17:42.430, Speaker B: Are there's no separate account that they're creating and there's no keys that the folks have to keep track of? It's all on the coinbase prime platform assets are held in cold storage, except for those moments when they're being traded, in which case they're briefly moved into a hot wallet. So when we were looking at who the potential partners were, security was clearly one of the key things we had to evaluate. And making sure that we could do this in a way that was both really simple, easy, and convenient, but also extremely secure was critical.
00:17:44.050 - 00:17:51.202, Speaker A: So you're starting with 50 cryptocurrencies on offer. How are you determining what to offer and how will you determine which new ones to add?
00:17:51.336 - 00:18:35.726, Speaker B: That's a great question. So we're certainly not making everything available that's, you know, not everything on Coinbase will be available. One of the roles that we play as a fiduciary to the 401K plan is to review and evaluate and monitor which tokens cryptocurrencies will be available in the 401K. We have an investment committee that has a process that they run to make that determination and it really comes down to a combination of factors. In the end, though, I would say part of it is market cap weighted, part of it is coin utility. Things like doge will not be available. So we're clearly applying a screen in a subset and then we'll evaluate that on a quarterly basis and make determinations as to what to include going forward.
00:18:35.828 - 00:18:41.710, Speaker A: And can you elaborate on that? Like why doge? Because I was going to ask you if you were going to offer Doge.
00:18:41.870 - 00:19:24.770, Speaker B: No, it's a question that comes up a mean this would be a better question for some folks of our investment committee to answer. But when you look at Doge, this is a coin that clearly was created as a novelty. It's a meme, it's got entertainment value, so it's not something that we think is appropriate. Now what we're looking at is developing a screen that is very sort of objective in nature. And when we apply that certain, as I said, novelty tokens like Doge, they just don't make the cut. Despite how big that market cap might be today or how popular it is, there's a level of prudence that we have to exercise over 401K portfolios.
00:19:25.590 - 00:19:37.106, Speaker A: Well, just out of curiosity, so would you allow trading in something like GameStop or AMC or whatever the new I guess trading should have been in the.
00:19:37.128 - 00:20:14.434, Speaker B: Word, but no, I understand. Are we going to allow trading in GameStop and AMC? So any of these sort of name stocks, right? No, we're not doing that right now. Not through well that's not what we're talking about really. This is the alt window, and I should elaborate the alt window, I call it that because it starts with cryptocurrency. But we do anticipate adding other types of alternative investments over time. We're not catering to every Whim on the internet. There's an appropriate use of cryptocurrency in the 401K world.
00:20:14.434 - 00:20:22.466, Speaker B: And the job of the investment committee is to make sure that we apply a screen that protects the employees as well.
00:20:22.648 - 00:20:36.070, Speaker A: And so if a bitcoin ETF and other ETFs representing other crypto assets came out, how would buying those differ from holding these assets directly in a 401? And which do you expect would be more appealing to investors?
00:20:36.810 - 00:21:05.854, Speaker B: So this is a good question. So a bitcoin ETF or a cryptocurrency ETF? At some point, someone will get one of these things approved and it'll become an option. But I think there's a couple of issues with what we've seen anyway. The first is that many of the ones that you even just mentioned focus on one. It's truly a bitcoin ETF. What we've seen is that there's a real interest in being able to hold a diversity of altcoins. So we wanted to make sure that they had a choice.
00:21:05.854 - 00:21:58.126, Speaker B: That's part of why we decided to work with Coinbase. The other is that what we've seen so far is some of these products do have an issue where they're trading at a discount to their NAV and they're quite expensive. So we believe that that's a reason why in some cases, these products are perhaps not the best option for employees at all. But I think really the key thing is it has to do with the fiduciary risk. And the we're providing with a cryptocurrency window does not increase the fiduciary risk to the employers. When you choose to make an investment like an ETF available in the 401K, that's a fundamentally different decision for the employer than choosing to make an alt window available. Making an alt window available is what's called a settler decision.
00:21:58.126 - 00:22:12.680, Speaker B: It just means it's like an administrative decision. Making a mutual fund available, that's an actual fiduciary decision. And because of that, we think that most employers are going to prefer a solution where they're not taking that fiduciary position. Does that make sense?
00:22:13.050 - 00:22:29.500, Speaker A: Interesting. I don't know if I fully understand that distinction. I mean, they're both going to be available, but you're just saying by virtue of the fact that the ETF is focused on one crypto, is that what the fiduciary decision is?
00:22:29.870 - 00:23:06.610, Speaker B: No, what I'm saying is I'm sorry, let me attempt to say it slightly better. Choosing to make a mutual fund available in the 401 is a fiduciary decision. When you choose to make a fund part of the lineup, that's a fiduciary decision. Choosing to make a self directed crypto window available is a type of decision. Exactly. And so by making this a self directed window that the employees ultimately choose to use helps reduce the risk for the employers. Really, it's a different type of decision.
00:23:06.610 - 00:23:12.010, Speaker B: And so that's one of the reasons why we think that this is the right approach for retirement plans.
00:23:12.350 - 00:23:21.178, Speaker A: All right, so you've kind of hinted that you have plans to go deeper with crypto. Can you give us a sneak preview of what those other crypto features might be?
00:23:21.344 - 00:24:05.900, Speaker B: Well, what I will just say is sure, there's two things that I think we're very excited about today. What we're going live with provides education, guidance, and help for employees. We will be introducing a solution that we can actually manage it for them. So if people want exposure to crypto but they don't want to make the decisions as to exactly which coins to buy, we will have a managed solution for them. And then I think what we really look at is really it's about trying to provide access as broadly as possible today. We're very excited to make this available through the for us all four hundred and one k. I think we'll be looking at how we can go beyond that and possibly being able to make this more broadly available without having to switch your four one k plan to us.
00:24:06.590 - 00:24:12.086, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, I look forward to seeing your future news. Thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed.

First headline el Salvador adopts bitcoin as legal tender On Wednesday, El Salvador passed a bill that would make bitcoin legal tender within the country.
00:25:04.510 - 00:26:23.266, Speaker A: The decision comes only days after president naive bukele announced his intention to send such a law to el Salvador's congress via video message at the Miami bitcoin conference and just hours after posting the proposed law on twitter. The bitcoin law regulates bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender and makes el Salvador the first country to adopt cryptocurrency in such a manner. In addition, the new bitcoin law would allow for tax contributions to be paid in bitcoin exchanges in bitcoin without capital gains tax prices to be expressed in bitcoin but accounted for in USD. What's more, in article seven, the bill mandates the acceptance of bitcoin for goods and services, saying, quote, every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service. In article eight, El Salvador effectively backs the risk of accepting bitcoin as payment by offering its businesses instant convertibility of bitcoin to USD if they wish.
