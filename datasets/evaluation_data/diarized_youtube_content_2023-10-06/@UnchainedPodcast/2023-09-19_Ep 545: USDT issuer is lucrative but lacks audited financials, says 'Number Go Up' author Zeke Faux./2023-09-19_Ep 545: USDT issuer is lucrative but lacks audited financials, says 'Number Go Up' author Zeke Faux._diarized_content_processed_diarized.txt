00:00:00.410 - 00:00:58.746, Speaker A: Midway through my reporting, I found that Tether had invested a lot of its assets into Chinese commercial paper. And there's kind of like this conflict of interest at the heart of Tether's business model, which is that if you give your money to Tether, you want them to keep it really safe. So it's there when you go to cash in your Tether tokens, but Tether doesn't pay any interest. And the way that Tether makes money is they can take the money that you trusted them with and they can go invest it. And so there was this theory that especially when interest rates were very low, they might be doing weird things with your money in order to earn higher profits. So I found that they were doing some unusual things that included the Chinese commercial paper and also making loans to crypto companies like Celsius and others. So to me, that seemed like that's kind of risky.
