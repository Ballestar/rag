00:00:00.090 - 00:00:55.980, Speaker A: Enemy V is called minor extractable value or maximal extractable value. Now that there are no miners, it's basically the maximum amount of money that the Validator miner or any kind of privileged actor or set of privileged actors in a system is able to extract if they kind of act maximally in their own self interest, maximize their own profit. One way to formally define this in is you look at a Validator, you look at a block, and you say, like, of all the things the Validator can do in the world, how much can the Validator increase their ETH balance during this block? That's kind of the definition that's in the clockworks finance paper, and it's maybe my current working definition, although there are many, many others. Why do I like this? Because I think it kind of indirectly captures any behavior that someone would be willing to kind of pay an ETH bride to this actor to, assuming this actor can only receive information through the channel of that.
