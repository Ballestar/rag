00:00:00.170 - 00:00:19.758, Speaker A: So I learned a lot in prison in general. I still had a staff, and the same staff from before has continued throughout till today. They used to joke that I was in the New Jersey office. My prison was in New Jersey. We didn't have corporate office there. So I had people helping me, assistants sending me books, family members, great friends. They would just send me.
00:00:19.758 - 00:00:41.330, Speaker A: I had so many books. I couldn't read them all or store them all. I would have to lease space from other inmates. I would give them cookies and food and stuff like that. And they would hold in their lockers gigantic number of books about crypto, including your book, which I didn't get a chance to finish in prison, but many other books about crypto and other things. And I would get white papers and things like that in prison.
