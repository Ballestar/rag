00:01:27.270 - 00:01:43.230, Speaker B: Today's topic is legal issues with DAOs. Here to discuss are Aaron Wright, co founder of OpenLaw and professor at Cardoza Law, and Ross Campbell, core developer at SushiSwap and contributor at Lexdow and OpenLaw. Welcome, Aaron and Ross.
00:01:43.570 - 00:01:49.562, Speaker A: Happy to be here. Yeah, thanks so much for having us, Laura. Excited to dig in before we dive.
00:01:49.626 - 00:02:05.780, Speaker B: Into this very intellectually meaty episode that has actually kind of been a flashpoint for the crypto community over the last year or so. Let's start by having you each describe your experience in crypto and with crypto legal issues. Aaron, why don't we start with you?
00:02:06.390 - 00:02:33.790, Speaker A: Sure. So thanks again, Laura. I'm a professor at Cardo's of law. I fell down the bitcoin rabbit hole very early, about 2011. Have a background in law and technology. Before joining Cardos's faculty, I started a company and sold it to a for profit sister project to Wikipedia called Wakia. So fell in love with open source technology, fell in love with bitcoin, was fortunate enough to play a small role helping to launch Ethereum.
00:02:33.790 - 00:02:54.574, Speaker A: I co authored a book on blockchain law and policy that Harvard published about a year or so ago. And then I've been building out some tech along with Ross and others called OpenLaw, which is trying to kind of bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional legal contracts, and that's called open law. So that's a bit of my background. And Ross.
00:02:54.622 - 00:02:55.620, Speaker B: What about you?
00:02:56.150 - 00:02:56.946, Speaker A: Sure.
00:02:57.128 - 00:03:52.626, Speaker C: So I started in crypto coming from, I guess, a corporate legal background. My first real job out of school was as an associate attorney with a law firm called Andrews Kerth, now hunting andrews Kerth after two mergers, that's a whole nother story. But in terms of the canonical crypto rabbit hole, I think it started with me studying risk around ransomware attacks, and then I learned about Ethereum smart contracts. And then from that point, I actually kind of fell into open law, worked for consensus for, I think, about two years on that project. I had the opportunity to also work with Aaron on the launch of the Lau, which I hope we cover on this call, and generally just thinking about how smart contracts can be used for company formation to improve deal flow and transactional efficiency. And then more recently kind of working with DeFi contracts with SushiSwap as a solidity developer. So that's kind of my journey.
00:03:52.626 - 00:04:01.340, Speaker C: It's been kind of let along the nose through curiosity and probably overwhelming professional FOMO. It's very interesting work, I'd say.
00:04:02.110 - 00:04:57.286, Speaker B: Great. So, yeah, why don't we start with maybe one of the more recent, what I would call kerfuffles in crypto. And this one involved curve. Last month in the governance forum for Curve, which is an automated market maker, there was a governance member who asked whether the DeFi project should try to enforce its intellectual property in court, and it specifically mentioned that Saddle Finance had been accused of copying Curve's code wholesale. Although, by the way, some people did point out to me that I think Saddle's code is in a different language, so it's not like directly copy pasted. And in the Curve forum, 67% of the 64 poll respondents said that they thought Curve should assert its IP rights against infringers. So what do you guys think of this proposal?
00:04:57.478 - 00:05:00.860, Speaker C: Aaron, I know you have an IP background. Do you want to lead on this?
00:05:01.310 - 00:05:52.586, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I think all these issues as lawyers or other folks that have been in and around the crypto space have kind of prophesized for a while. They eventually come to roost, right. So issues related to intellectual property, issues related to securities laws, issues related to liability, issues related to enforcing rights. It's not surprising that as we see crypto continue to mature and continue to push into the mainstream, that these are beginning to come to fruition. Related to the claim at hand. This is a vexing problem even outside of the crypto ecosystem for all open source, right? If you have open source code and other people use it, they have the ability to create forks, to create modifications, and depending on the underlying license, that will really dictate whether or not they have the right and ability to do that.
00:05:52.586 - 00:06:49.934, Speaker A: What I think makes this story the most interesting, though, is that it kind of goes to this route about DAOs and what Curve is as an organization, right? And it's a bit in Kuwait right now as to what Curve is like legally. So they call themselves a Dao. Depending on which jurisdiction looks at it, let's say the US. Or possibly another jurisdiction it's probably going to be considered a partnership of some sort and partnerships can enforce their rights. So if Curve wanted to do this, not advocating that they should or not, it opens up these interesting questions about how these online groups that likely will be considered partnerships in some sort of way can enforce their rights. And there's the second question of whether they should enforce their rights given that it's an open source project, right? Maybe what Saddle is doing is fair game or many folks that really believe in open source technology would consider that to be fair game. Those are questions that are above kind of my ability to comment on.
00:06:49.934 - 00:07:11.590, Speaker A: But I do think that they raise some really interesting challenges and it's not limited to Curve. Right. We've seen this also open source licensing issues begin to emerge in the uniswap ecosystem. We've also seen kind of Dao related legal questions emerge in the maker ecosystem. So some of these questions are really coming to fruition as the ecosystem continues to mature.
00:07:12.170 - 00:08:16.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess if I could append to that, I agree with Aaron that using legal tools like IP enforcement rights will force these Dows or these right now, sort of loosely coordinated groups to actually choose a legal identity. I assume that there is some sort of centralized group developers, they might even have a legal name, maybe Curve Labs. It might become more apparent how things are centralized in their system if they choose to use legal tools like enforcement rights. So it feels premature for a lot of these organizations, in my opinion, to make those hard choices, but they will be forced to. And the least we can do as sort of crypto lawyers and people in the space is to provide templates to make that a bit easier, more predictable. I don't know if this is a good segue into Wymingdao and sort of statutory frameworks for having code based organizations and rights enforcements that are kind of typical to traditional companies, but I think we are trying to make it a bit easier. Once DAOs face these questions, they want to avail themselves of legal rights and off chain enforcement.
00:08:16.090 - 00:08:23.238, Speaker C: What is the least intrusive way to do that? That's still, you know, cypherpunk. So definitely something we're watching.
00:08:23.424 - 00:08:24.846, Speaker A: But I think things are a bit.
00:08:24.868 - 00:09:05.494, Speaker C: Better now in that I do think that they can achieve a legal identity and not lose their sense of an open organization. But yeah, culturally I think it's also very problematic in that Dows attract talent by being open source champions. They're very permeable, merit based. You can rise in the ranks of Dao by the work you do. And I think a lot of people that want to contribute to DAOs and kind of grow this economy on ethereum, they are wary about people being protective about code because that can constrain kind of the growth of this system. So it's very political as well. So I think I can see how curve might want to kick this to the community and see how they want to proceed on legal rights.
00:09:05.494 - 00:09:27.074, Speaker C: We see that with uniswap as well. And that seems like a way to have it both ways that you can still monetize code and support talented coders, but you can also allow people to make it easier to use if there's, like, community spirit there. So that's something I'm watching as well. Do we want to talk about wyoming, the context here?
00:09:27.112 - 00:09:32.398, Speaker B: And maybe not just yet because there's so much more I want to ask about curve.
00:09:32.494 - 00:09:33.010, Speaker C: Yeah, sure.
00:09:33.080 - 00:09:53.990, Speaker B: But I first of all wanted to ask. So it's not clear exactly what entity would sue, but let's say that Curve really was a true dow, then is it possible for a Dow to sue? Like, can a dow own IP?
00:09:55.290 - 00:10:29.682, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if a group of folks and just to caveat it, I think a lot of this discussion will be very us. Centric. And there may be different jurisdictions that view it differently. It gets too complex. So just for simplicity's sake and rase, I know your roots, at least legally, are in the US. But maybe we can constrain it to, you know, from a us. Vantage point, curve and possibly many other Dows presumably would be considered a partnership of some sort if they're viewed as a group of people that are working together to make some sort of profit.
00:10:29.682 - 00:11:00.174, Speaker A: So I guess there's a question as to whether or not all the Curve token holders are trying to make a profit. Let's just assume that they are. At that point, they'd be considered an implied partnership. And partnerships are a recognized entity, and partnerships can avail themselves of courts. So it's conceivable, assuming somebody had the ability and agency to bring a cause of action, that Curve could walk into a us. Court and assert that they probably wouldn't. I don't know a ton about the saddle team.
00:11:00.174 - 00:11:18.738, Speaker A: I don't know if they're in the US. Right? There's lots of nitty gritty questions that lawyers would have to sort through about where to bring a cause of action, whether to bring a cause of action, whether they could enforce. But assuming that those issues were sorted out, I don't see conceptually why they wouldn't be able to enforce their rights if they so chose.
00:11:18.914 - 00:11:26.760, Speaker B: Well, if Curve then went that route, then would that make CRV or VCRV. Its governance token a security?
00:11:27.450 - 00:12:03.022, Speaker A: So that's an open question. This is one of the vexing questions around DAOs and some of the legal issues is what is an interest in a Dow itself and folks that have been around the crypto ecosystem for quite some time, this will bring back memories of questions about what a utility token was. Are they securities? Are they not securities? Which are really fun conversations. I think we've gotten some clarity, not as much clarity as many folks would hope. And when it comes to Dows, I think the answer is going to be, again, not surprisingly, very loyally. It's going to depend. Right? There's some interest in Dows that likely would not be considered securities.
00:12:03.022 - 00:12:57.590, Speaker A: They'd be considered either commodities or not really even representing potentially some sort of right in an entity. And then I think depending on the structure of what the folks want to do together and to the extent that there's fees that are being distributed or some profits that are being distributed or other forms of distributions, those interests are likely going to be considered securities. There's a whole line of cases in the US. That courts will lean back on involving partnerships and limited liability companies and interest in partnership and limited liability companies can be considered either as securities or not securities depending on whether or not there's folks that are in charge. If there's a group of managers that are in charge, LLC and partnership interests are more likely to be considered securities. If there is not a manager in charge, then they're less likely to be considered securities. But frankly, it's a little bit of a gray area.
00:12:57.590 - 00:13:18.154, Speaker A: It's something that courts have sporadically addressed in narrow contexts. And these are the types of questions that I think we'll start to see navigate through US. Regulatory bodies, foreign regulatory bodies, and ultimately courts. Just like we did with some of the token related questions from the halcyon days of token sales in 2016 to 18. Okay.
00:13:18.272 - 00:13:39.186, Speaker B: Actually, from what you said earlier, where you said when I asked you if it's possible for a Dow to sue, you said, well, if they're a partnership and they I can't remember how you phrased it, but essentially the goal of that is to make a profit, then it does sound like then the tokens associated with curve would be a security.
00:13:39.368 - 00:14:12.474, Speaker A: Right? It again depends. Right. It's going to depend on partnerships can make a profit. Right. So if you have a partnership interest where there's no manager, there's folks that are actively participating, the information is freely available, then there's arguments that can be made that those interests are not securities. That would be drawing on some of this case law and other folks that have looked at characterizing and classifying partnership interests. If there's a manager, if there's a board, if there's more hierarchy, then it's more likely to be considered a security.
00:14:12.474 - 00:14:58.300, Speaker A: The reason for that is the kind of core fundamental purpose of securities. It's about narrowing information. Asymmetries Laura, if you were a manager of a company, you're going to have all this information that you may not be sharing with other folks that are stakeholders or investors or participants in that company. And that's what securities laws fundamentally are trying to target, how to get information that's being held closely that could be important to other folks more widely available. So flatter structures I think, have a better shot. But these are very unfortunately like nuanced questions and that's going to drive developers mad. But that's in many ways kind of how the US approach to these questions has historically been applied and I imagine will continue to be applied for the foreseeable future.
00:14:58.910 - 00:15:01.178, Speaker B: And Ross, you were going to add something?
00:15:01.344 - 00:16:10.638, Speaker C: Oh yeah, I was going to kind of go to this issue of management and what is actually providing value to token holders. If in the Curve context we see licensing and the defense of the license by a sort of core team or a centralized entity, that value creation by defending the license could be suggestive of securities. And I obviously don't want to give a legal opinion on a podcast, but these are the trends we see in that if you hold an instrument and it's expected to increase in value because of the efforts of others, that's a fact pattern that applies to tokens like any other instrument or a ticket to an orange grove or something. So these legal tools, like I said, can pose these sort of related legal problems in that you are identifying value streams that almost necessarily have to be centralized. We are seeing, like I said, cool examples where the permissibility of a license and grants of a license are put to a community vote and in that sense, management of that sort of value source the IP is distributed. In a more flat way. And I think that is helpful for teams to consider not trying to retain the crown jewels and a core team, because that can be suggestive of management.
00:16:10.638 - 00:16:24.198, Speaker C: Another kind of interesting aspect of the law is that it gives and it takes, right. There's always extra considerations and this is why crypto law is becoming a robust profession. Probably unanswerable questions that are context driven. Right.
00:16:24.364 - 00:17:00.900, Speaker B: I know when I was researching this I was like, wow, this is quite the rabbit hole within the rabbit hole. Well, one other thing I wanted to ask about was at the top of the contract source code for Curve, it says License copyright Curve Fi 2021. All rights reserved. So who is it that has that copyright? Is that the Dow or is it like maybe some kind of LLC that represents the company behind Curve? Or is it individual devs or what does that say to you? And is that a typical thing for a DeFi project to do?
00:17:01.830 - 00:17:42.270, Speaker C: I mean, Urine Finance. The name of their token, I think, is Urine Finance. It's a hyperlink. I think that is a way to kick the can on responsibility in a know from the contract to deployer to maybe people that are running a website and a product. But I think good practices if there are legal entities associated with these things is to put them in the privacy disclosures on the website itself. Those are the rabbit holes that they're kind of forcing us to follow to determine if they say this is licensed and has restrictions, who's going to enforce that? It seems like they didn't quite have a name they wanted to associate at that point. But yeah, I do think that's typical in DeFi, that they don't want to think too much beforehand about the legal structure they want to apply.
00:17:42.270 - 00:17:50.610, Speaker C: They just know that they want to sort of plant that flag. So yeah, there is a bit of digging involved in DeFi I think we're seeing.
00:17:50.760 - 00:18:06.518, Speaker A: But the copyright yeah, lord on the copyright owner question. So in the US. Again, the person or groups of right. You can have more than one person. That creates IP. The folks that create it. And once it's fixed in a tangible form.
00:18:06.518 - 00:18:53.362, Speaker A: Which would mean saved on a computer. And there's copyrightable work, which generally means something that has a modicum of creativity and is not functional in nature. That group of folks would be the copyright holders with the license that you put together. Assuming that all those initial creators are kind of captured by Curve phi, that would kind of vary those initial copyrights. Copyright is a very complex part of the law as well, so there's lots of questions that kind of need to be answered. But that's the general framework. So I'm assuming there was some group of software developers, either one or more, that wrote the initial smart contracts and or related software that helps power Curve and those folks would own the copyright.
00:18:53.362 - 00:19:19.710, Speaker A: They may have buried it with an open source license of some sort which give people the rights to use it, and they would have to assess based on their ownership rights and that license, whether or not they have a cause of action. That may be with the Dow itself, to the extent that the Dao has some rights in it, it could be with those individual developers to the extent that they retain some rights. Those are complex questions that would have to get sorted through by competent counsel.
00:19:21.410 - 00:19:48.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, one other thing about this. Just to go back to the copyright and the IP issues here, I saw somebody tweeting that if Curve were to try to go to court to enforce these, that Curve should then also be subject to money transmission laws and that requires projects or companies to go to every state to get a license. What's your sense of whether or not that's correct?
00:19:49.690 - 00:20:44.618, Speaker A: I mean, that's a whole nother body of law, right? But to the extent that they want to be recognized or avail themselves to certain courts, then it could open up a whole other can of worms. So even though they may have the right to do that, they may choose not to for other reasons, possibly reasons related to what we were discussing before. What are the interest in Curve and what should they be classified as? Questions related to AML know your customer? That's a very big issue when it comes to DeFi. It's a very big issue when it comes to crypto more generally. We're seeing FADIF get more involved and are beginning to kind of meander towards clarifying rules related to that. It's just a huge can of worms. So legal issues with Dows is a rabbit hole of a rabbit hole like you described before, but there's plenty of other rabbit holes that get opened up when you begin to dig into some of these projects and issues that they face.
00:20:44.784 - 00:20:46.700, Speaker B: And Ross, did you want to add anything?
00:20:47.150 - 00:22:08.242, Speaker C: Oh sure, yeah. I think kind of what the legal system is still trying to get acquainted with is this idea know, money robots know that developers can create almost fully functioning exchange or market and then kind of leave it and not have any overhead and just walk away. Who is transmitting value in that case code? Or is it the LP providers who are facilitating those markets? It's so complicated that it feels really like a knee jerk reaction to just say like the people who have doxed themselves, usually developers, we should just make them get all these licenses. I know this is more an aspirational notion versus legal reality which has precedent, is very structured and requires research based on state by state. But kind of more of the point is that I think that the legal system is maybe trying to move too quickly in assumptions about responsibility and control and that kind of goes to this issue of not understanding how this technology really functions for markets. So, yeah, I would be reluctant to make any sort of firm opinion about money transmitter license requirements, but that seems like a misplaced regime, especially for what we see happening in the space with Curve and AMMS and Ross.
00:22:08.306 - 00:22:16.918, Speaker B: Actually, I just wanted to ask for Sushi. How do they do a copyright, if any, or any licensing at all, for the project?
00:22:17.084 - 00:23:24.350, Speaker C: That's an interesting issue. Of course for SushiSwap at least what we consider core contracts, the SushiSwap organization on GitHub that's all MIT and more recently we're using GPL licenses so it's open source, free to modify. But we do have outside teams that we've funded with grants that have used licenses on their code and that has been interesting. In terms of unifying this idea of Sushi swap as a completely open source exchange BentoBox is a product that we're using for our lending contracts and there is some licensing involved with that. So that's more the Sushi swap perspective of like you can have a plan among a developer group to open source the code and see where that goes. But sometimes you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube if something's already licensed in some ways or you don't necessarily hold the rights there. So yeah, it can be difficult in expanding rapidly to coordinate the legal regime, which I'm sure anyone appreciates in a high growth startup regardless of it being blockchain related.
00:23:24.350 - 00:23:26.746, Speaker C: But we have good outside counsel.
00:23:26.858 - 00:23:49.480, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, let's now also talk about uniswap because and this directly relates to what happened with Sushi Swap back in March when Uniswap launched its V Three, it launched it under what's called a business Source license. Can you explain what that means and why this caused a little bit of a stir in the crypto community?
00:23:50.250 - 00:23:50.662, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:50.716 - 00:24:01.542, Speaker C: So I mean uniswap released v three under the business licensing. The immediate reaction is, what are you worried about in terms of releasing Ross?
00:24:01.606 - 00:24:05.818, Speaker B: Can you just define what that is for people who maybe don't know?
00:24:05.984 - 00:24:06.694, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:24:06.742 - 00:24:48.410, Speaker C: So it's like commercial with a plan to open source. So in their system, I believe it's a two year time period before it automatically converts to GPL, and then anyone can use and modify it. But right now, if I want to use any of the license code from Uniswap V Three, I would have to get an exprs permission from them or we'd have to have a commercial license. So, yeah, it's a blend of open source and commercial. I guess that's helpful. And Aaron, you're actually a professor for these things, so you probably have a better, more scholarly way to describe this. But for me, it's open source, but with an immediate sort of pause.
00:24:49.630 - 00:25:31.990, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's super fascinating, and I think it really kind of hits at this core that many developers are trying to balance when it comes to crypto, DeFi or blockchain projects. Right. They want at some point for the code to be managed by a whole bunch of stakeholders. I personally believe that's a very healthy exercise to have a whole bunch of different folks that are maintaining it, managing it. And I do strongly believe in the open source ethos, but there's windows where that's difficult to do. Right. You need to have a dedicated team that's focused on it to push it forward, to make sure the quality is high enough and to make sure that you have the opportunity to test out the market.
00:25:31.990 - 00:26:34.394, Speaker A: And so I think Uniswap was trying to blend those two competing ideas together and did a pretty good job doing that, obviously, with the looming fear of a roving band of Sushi fanatics that may decide to take some of that innovation and apply it into their ecosystem too. So I think it's great that and I don't know who on the Uniswap team, if there's their outside council or their internal council, but I do think from my vantage point, it's wonderful to see that form of innovation. I know that may bristle with some folks that are true open source believers and a little bit more religious in their approach, but I think it's a fair trade off overall. We want to incentivize teams to develop new things, to work on it, to feel incentivized to do that while at the same time knowing that as it's mature, once people feel secure about it, that stakeholders or other folks that are part of it can begin to support and make sure that it's operating and developing in a productive way. Yeah.
00:26:34.432 - 00:27:16.600, Speaker B: And just to be totally clear, for people who missed it, this is probably a direct response to what happened last, kind of, what was it, summer, late summer, early fall, when SushiSwap basically forked the code and then launched a liquidity mining scheme that involved Uniswap to get users from Uniswap over to SushiSwap. To my mind, this is pretty much their way of being like, let's make sure that doesn't happen again. But Ross, since you are part of the Sushi team, I just wondered what's your reaction to this move?
00:27:17.690 - 00:28:11.820, Speaker C: Yeah, to clarify, my earlier comments were meant as criticism, but more to maybe help explain the reactions of the crypto industry at whole. I know there was a lot of criticism to licensing for Uni P three, but personally, I'm agnostic to what is going to make ethereum development sustainable and secure over the next decade. It's a very young industry and there's clearly different stakes at play with open source code that also controls financial assets. So if Uniswap wants to try and innovate and have it both ways, I don't necessarily want to discourage that, I want to have more examples in the wild, more boats in the water to test things out and see what developers really congregate around. And it's an open market. Some people see that as a moat and that's respectable for their tokenized community. Others might see that as a sort of challenge to growing Ethereum as a whole.
00:28:11.820 - 00:29:14.926, Speaker C: But like I said, it's not clear to me what approach wins the day or provides the most value to Dex users. So, yeah, maybe that's a lawyerly answer in of itself. I don't know, having it both ways, but I respect that they're trying to protect their Uniswap community and product using what some might call lawfare, but I just see it as kind of normal for any startup to do. And they are very open about being a startup. They have universal navigation inc. I believe it's a Delaware corporation, they're based in York, they have a clear physical presence, offices, they have a founder who has an identity, reputation at stake, as well as most of their developers are also doxed, as they say in the industry. Sushi is trying to do maybe something different there by being a bit more impermeable for developers, allowing people to have an omnipathy, if I can pronounce the word right.
00:29:14.926 - 00:30:08.080, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think there's definitely some competitive advantages to being fully sort of crypto anarchist, but I don't know if that's necessarily what we need to have over the course of the decade. So, yeah, I think we definitely appreciate that the licensing was a response to SushiSwap the vampire attack. It also was quite clear that there was migration tools provided to go from SushiSwap to Uniswap, very similar to how SushiSwap was launched to migrate from Uniswap to Sushi. So in my mind, people see that as negative competition, but. For me, it's like, yeah, let the best exchange win and let the best legal regime win. It's all kind of code that we're trying to improve, right? So if people are creating modes and they're open about it and it's obvious how we could change that mode through governance, which Uniswap has done. That seems interesting, too.
00:30:09.650 - 00:30:49.242, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss a little bit more about the Uniswap license issue.

Condor opens access to the global financial market for Ethereum by allowing for permissionless user created synthetic assets. Condor allows you to create, borrow, and trade synthetic assets which track the value for any conceivable asset, real or abstract, using any price feed you want. Asset creators are able to earn fees on every mint and scale revenue with direct use for their assets. Synths are minted by providing Ether to collateralize the asset as 0% interest loans.

00:32:28.970 - 00:32:58.150, Speaker B: So just out of curiosity for this license that Uniswap has its V Three code under since it lasts for two years, I just wondered, is that kind of, like, effectively the time period in which anyone might actually want to use the code for business purposes? Because with the pace at which this technology is advancing, I just thought, is this going to kind of COVID all potential competition?
00:32:59.530 - 00:33:25.550, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's like 100 years in my mind of crypto. That's like several growth phases or something. So I think effectively you're right that they see this as covering the concentrated liquidity idea as they've implemented it, which is fine. I think it's all arbitrary, but anything past maybe a couple of months is probably far in the future in a lot of crypto people's minds.
00:33:26.610 - 00:33:42.930, Speaker B: And I wondered just for this particular license, it's not something I'm super familiar with, but is this something that has ever come up in court before? Like if someone were to fork the code and test this license, do we kind of have a sense of how the courts would decide?
00:33:43.270 - 00:34:51.118, Speaker A: I don't know if this is the singular use case of that license, that's hard to know if that came up from the Uniswap team or maybe they leaned on another example that may have emerged somewhere else, some other former precedent. When it comes to questions around open source licenses, courts move very slow. So even widely used licenses like Ross mentioned a couple before, like an MIT license or a GPL license, not many courts have addressed issues related to the validity of those licenses and the scope and questions related to it. So at least in this instance, it's not like this is a license that's been well litigated. Number one, at most, if it went to a court, I imagine courts would have to look at the kind of sporadic cases involving open source licenses to a affirm that it's enforceable, and b define the scope and boundaries related to it. I think more practically, I imagine why the Uniswap team did this was not to walk into court at some point. I know that that's in many ways like how non lawyers view it, but it's just a little impediment, right? So whatever folks are thinking about possibly using that code, they may pause.
00:34:51.118 - 00:35:52.886, Speaker A: And that pause may just give them enough time to see if this idea works, which they obviously built and obviously put a lot of thought and time into it. And hopefully that gives them a little bit of space to grow the ecosystem or support the ecosystem in a way that they think is appropriate. Competition is always good. I mean, I think in many ways what we're seeing, this dynamic between Sushi and Uniswap, outside of being very dramatic and entertaining in different ways, is also kind of one of the advantages and really one of the reasons why governance tokens are important. I think the fact that Uniswap did have a vampire attack by Sushi, which introduced a token, I imagine that that fact probably weighed in the minds of the initial developers when thinking about that. I think it also points to the value why tokens are important to kind of rally people around a project and have them feel like they have a say and can actively participate in governance to improve the ecosystem. I think that's healthy.
00:35:52.886 - 00:36:23.270, Speaker A: And I think even here, when we're dealing with new updates or improvements and enhancements, I think my view it's reasonable for teams that come up with that to have a little bit of breathing room to test it out before it gets immediately copied, I think that creates kind of perverse incentives for innovation. If you want to optimize on that front to say that a team that develops something shouldn't be able to at least try it out, see if it works, at least get some recognition, if not more, for that, I think that's healthy and pretty reasonable.
00:36:24.010 - 00:36:30.220, Speaker B: All right, so now let's talk about the Wyoming Dow law. What does this law do?
00:36:31.150 - 00:37:22.730, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. So DAOs are really interesting as a concept. There's different types of DAOs. DAOs have kind of animated the bitcoin and in particular the Ethereum ecosystems for quite some time. Just to give like a quick history lesson there, dan Larimer of EOS fame, I think is credited with the first reference or kind of article talking about DAOs. He fashioned them as a decentralized autonomous corporation and the notion was, how can we use Bitcoin and an emerging project on Bitcoin called Colorcoins at the time to represent a bitcoin as, let's say, share of stock in a company? And he posited, and I think he's right that by doing that, using blockchain technology to represent interests and organizations, we get a whole bunch of different efficiencies. The Ethereum Ecosystem in particular kind of took Dan's concepts and vitalik and others kind of ran with it and it played a prominent role in the concept.
00:37:22.730 - 00:38:20.582, Speaker A: Around the Ethereum white paper, there was lots of use cases, but one prominent one was DAOs. And so the Ethereum Ecosystem has kind of been geeked out about DAOs for quite some time. And because of that, there's been lots of conversations about how can DAOs operate in the real world. So these conversations started way back, even before Ethereum launched, at events that MIT put together, where we began to think about legal issues related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology more broadly. This notion emerged that one possible path forward would be to wrap a Dao in a limited liability company, to use a limited liability company, which is a structure in the US. That many businesses use to account for certain risks that emerge when you mush people together and they try to do something productive. What the Wyoming Dow bill does is it extends Wyoming's LLC act and enables you to create a Dao and it attempts and aspires to do that in a way that will work with what some developers want to do with DAOs.
00:38:20.582 - 00:39:07.030, Speaker A: So it never was intended to be kind of like a universal solution. Its intent is to A, provide legal recognition to this new emerging structure where we're seeing a lot of excitement around and a lot of folks that want to innovate around. And two, it was to align existing laws a little bit closer to how people are actually operating within these Dows. So one way that I like to think about a Dow. It's like an online group with a bank account and lots of rules that are related to it. And under the existing law, as an example, if you form that and that group of people wanted to do something productive, like make a profit or build something or engage in some sort of commercial activity, it'd be considered a partnership. And you'd have to owe what lawyers call fiduciary duties to all the other members of the Dow.
00:39:07.030 - 00:39:34.818, Speaker A: Fiduciary duties is a fancy legal word that basically means like, a heightened responsibility. Like, you owe more than you would other folks when you're engaging with them. But in my mind, that's insane. Like, imagine if you're part of an online community and some synonymous person that you don't know that you're communicating with, you owe some heightened obligation to. That makes absolutely no sense. But that's the way the laws are currently written under the Wyoming bill. We soften that and you're permitted to do that in the US.
00:39:34.818 - 00:40:23.106, Speaker A: So we waived these fiduciary duties to the extent permitted by law. We addressed issues related to conflicts because it's presumed, as Ross mentioned before, that Dows will be more porous in nature, that people will go in and out. And we also streamlined the process. So you only have to really have one document instead of a handful of documents that are necessary today if you want to kind of explore this structure. So the idea is to legal recognition, to kind of align it with what we're seeing right now with Dows and a little bit forward leaning there too. And then also to kind of hopefully over time lower the cost. And that's exciting, right? I think we've seen tremendous amounts of growth with DAOs, whether that's DeFi related protocol Dows, some of the investment Dows that folks are forming, or more service based Dows, which are really interesting as well.
00:40:23.106 - 00:40:59.470, Speaker A: And that's exploded over the past year. It's gone from about $10 million in assets in these Dows in February 2020 to today, depending on who's counting. It's either roughly a billion dollars or even more than that. And it's gone from having thousands of people participating in these structures to up to 200,000 people participating in these structures. Rough, right? It's hard to get clear metrics on blockchain. And so I think it's admirable that Wyoming is taking the first step forward and trying to really tackle and recognize these entities. But there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.
00:40:59.470 - 00:41:30.138, Speaker A: There's valid criticisms that came up even beforehand related to the bill structure. Some of those issues were known beforehand but were products of the political system. Others kind of emerge from comments, but I think you'll see this as a first step and then over time, either additional legislation or additional amendments to kind of clarify and make sure that it's in a really good spot. But I do think it is really a notable moment. And hats off to the folks in Wyoming for helping to push this forward.
00:41:30.304 - 00:41:48.320, Speaker B: And before this Wyoming LLC or Dow LLC law. There were other Dows that were organized as Delaware LLCs. So what can a Wyoming LLC Dow do that a Dow organized as a Delaware LLC cannot do?
00:41:49.730 - 00:42:42.074, Speaker A: So they're very similar, right? The concept was if you wanted to put together a wrap dao, so you wanted to root a dao in a legal entity, let's say like a Delaware LLC. To do that today, you would have to, in all likelihood, pay a lawyer tens of thousands, if not more, dollars to put together a structure that would work for the project. It's incredibly expensive, and that's not something most developers can afford. That's not something that most developers, since they're focused on software, actually are equipped to kind of manage the nuance related to it. There are some folks that can, and that's awesome, but most folks can't do that. The idea was to set the default rules in a way that was a little bit closer to how people are actually operating such that the costs over time can go down. So you don't have to pay lawyers tens of thousands of dollars to do something that is more and more routine.
00:42:42.074 - 00:43:24.670, Speaker A: And so, not surprisingly, when lawyers saw that that occurred, they got grumpy. Lawyers like to take their cut out of lots of these projects and are not happy about that. But in reality, it shouldn't cost tens of thousands of dollars to set up an entity. It shouldn't cost tens of thousands of dollars to set up a Dow. And so this is a framework that enables that incentive structure and the cost related to it to eventually go down. But in many ways, it kind of preserves that same spirit, which is using a limited liability company. It's kind of like a shell to defer to software based systems for governance and for member managed structures to the extent that that applies for various different use cases.
00:43:24.670 - 00:44:03.398, Speaker A: The other thing that is contemplated, although I do think the language will change. You can start to clarify which portions of your organization are going to be run by an algorithm, like which Smart Contracts are going to be. Used, which I think is important for the public to know if you're going to be building and intend to aspire to build something that's really meaningful, I think it's nice to have a public Identifier. That people can refer to, like the smart contract address or some other public Identifier. The code that you're using. I think that's a nice thing to have an additional reasonable requirement that we kind of put in place. And the other thing that you can do with the Wyoming law that you can't do with Delaware is call yourself a Dow.
00:44:03.398 - 00:44:21.440, Speaker A: And I know some folks may not want to do that, and I know it's very subtle, but it's a big deal lots of folks want to call themselves Abcdao. They don't want to call themselves ABCD LLC. It just kind of has a different feel to it. So that's another important difference as well.
00:44:21.890 - 00:44:42.630, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I actually wanted to ask about the algorithms. So as you mentioned, the Wyoming bill does mention these algorithmically managed dows quite a lot, but I don't quite know what that means, because if a Dao is managed by an algorithm rather than the members of the Dao, then how is that a Dao?
00:44:43.610 - 00:45:10.446, Speaker A: Sure. So it contemplates two different things. By default, all the DAOs are member managed. What that means is by default, unless it's varied by the agreements, there's not going to be imputed a manager of some sort. I think that aligns with what we're seeing with lots of DeFi projects. There's not some central group or central persons that are in charge of it around the edges. There may be a software development team, there may be folks that serve more ministerial functions, but there's not like a centralized leader in some sort of way.
00:45:10.446 - 00:45:25.746, Speaker A: You can, though, under the existing law, decide to elect to be an algorithmically run dow. And I don't think we've actually seen these forms of dows yet, but it's something that's been contemplated and theorized by legal scholars for quite some time.
00:45:25.928 - 00:45:29.830, Speaker B: What does that look like? I mean, since we don't have one, I was kind of like, why?
00:45:29.980 - 00:46:17.314, Speaker A: Well, we have prototypical dows of that, which would be something like Bitcoin. So many folks have analogized that Bitcoin itself is a Dao or Dao like structure and they've gone through the mental exercise. How could a bitcoin or bitcoin like project get launched? And how could it get launched in a way that would align with US. Law? There's a scholar from the University of Southern Florida named Sean Bynum who's theorized and put this together and thought about this exact question. And the way that he thought it could all get lined up would be first you form an entity that has members. So those members form it, they begin to develop it, and then they assign over into that entity all the intellectual property related to the algorithm. And then they quit, they leave.
00:46:17.314 - 00:46:49.854, Speaker A: And then at that point you have a legal entity that only has an algorithm sitting at its core. And that fact was something that the legislators and other folks that provided commentary wanted to account for. Whether that has manifested yet or whether or not that's a perfect analogy. It's too soon to tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see more and more structures over time that begin to resemble that. And because of that, that's why it was put into the law. Is there any group trying to create.
00:46:50.052 - 00:46:52.350, Speaker B: An algorithmically managed dow?
00:46:53.330 - 00:47:41.210, Speaker A: I think that there probably will be groups that try to create this. We saw groups try to create an algorithmically managed dow or something that is pretty close to that in bitcoin. And that is something that folks wanted to account for. Bitcoin in many ways is an algorithmically managed dow. It has a core software protocol that's run it's operating and you can participate in it, but the core governance is in the algorithm itself. So it's a way to kind of position that type of a project and one way to do that and you possibly could do know today in Wyoming using this legislation. Like if Satoshi didn't want to be anonymous, if you wanted to set up something where you really are putting at the center of the organization a set of software, you would have the ability to do that under the Wyoming dow legislation.
00:47:41.210 - 00:47:41.920, Speaker A: Today.
00:47:43.990 - 00:47:54.130, Speaker B: In bitcoin, what is the algorithm that manages bitcoin? Is it the shaw 256? What algorithm manages bitcoin?
00:47:54.790 - 00:47:56.900, Speaker C: Proof of work. Right, yeah. Sorry.
00:47:57.430 - 00:48:01.606, Speaker A: It's the core software. Yeah, it's the entire package that you.
00:48:01.628 - 00:48:03.174, Speaker B: Need to run proof of work.
00:48:03.372 - 00:48:36.398, Speaker A: It's more than proof of work. It's the entire node and the software that's dealing with validation. It's the software that's dealing with everything that manages bitcoin. It's a core group of software. So you could imagine that being owned by an entity and that entity having no members. And while that may seem kind of like an OD construct, it's something that's accounted for in the law and something that we wanted to account for since a, we're starting to see prototypical examples of it in things like bitcoin, and b, it was something that legal scholars in the US. Have contemplated.
00:48:36.398 - 00:49:11.514, Speaker A: And since it takes some time to put together laws, it takes time to pass them. We wanted to make sure and do our best to try to future proof it in some sort of way. So if there's some folks that don't think that that future is going to come to pass, doesn't really matter. You are by default a member managed entity, so you can decide who is going to be in charge of this operation. If that idea of an algorithmic dow doesn't fit for your project, no worries. It's really no harm off your bat or off your back. If, however, you want to explore something that's a little bit more future leaning, you have the ability to do that.
00:49:11.514 - 00:49:47.954, Speaker A: And I think that that's an important thing to kind of contemplate. Okay. Even beyond that, just to give a full picture, some of the language related to that piece is something that folks have flagged. And even before the law was passed, there was a handful of amendments that were hopefully going to get put into the original bill. But due to different reasons, including some issues related to Wyoming parliamentarian issues, those amendments look like they're going to come in a second bill that hopefully will go through the appropriate committees and get presented to the Wyoming house and senate.
00:49:48.002 - 00:49:49.160, Speaker B: And what are those?
00:49:49.770 - 00:50:50.182, Speaker A: It's a cleanup bill. Yeah. So it will clarify some of the language related to designating yourself as either a member managed entity or an algorithmically managed entity. It will clean up a couple definitional issues that folks flagged and then also clean up some other minor points that people have identified or provided feedback on since the bill was presented and proposed. It's a process, right? Legislative process is not a one time thing and then the bill is done particularly at the state level, there's usually opportunities to clean things up and tighten them and amend them. But it's notable that we were able to get something there to A, recognize DAOs, to B, give people the ability, hopefully, to form these at much less cost than they would if they wanted to set something up in delaware. And C, we've begun the conversation around this to start to have some of the productive conversations that I think are necessary to make sure that at least in the US.
00:50:50.182 - 00:50:52.750, Speaker A: We have kind of the right approach here, right?
00:50:52.900 - 00:51:13.780, Speaker B: So for the manager managed Dows which under this new law that you can't have a manager managed Dow, some people were interpreting that to mean that a Dow could not be managed a foundation which is by a foundation which is how some of the Dows started out. So why is that?
00:51:14.710 - 00:51:29.270, Speaker A: Why can't they be managed by a mean they could conceivably just decide to be an LLC? At that point I don't think it's contemplated that Dows will have managers. So I was trying to account for kind of that reality.
00:51:30.090 - 00:51:38.826, Speaker B: But people are saying that a lot of dows do start out with a foundation managing. And so they're saying this sort of doesn't account for they could form as.
00:51:38.848 - 00:51:48.766, Speaker A: An LLC and when they feel like their structure is in place or they could form as a software company, they could convert into this dow, or they could designate themselves a dow. At that point in time I was.
00:51:48.788 - 00:53:18.410, Speaker C: Going to say that I also don't think that manager managed really speaks to the use case of Dows and that they are almost entirely about being flat and real time with membership management. So I can appreciate maybe Dows that have managers might not be the best use case to design around or to promote but there are a lot of protocols that are bootstrapped by foundations which are really core teams of developers. I don't think a lot of these developers really thought carefully about making a Dao or the implications of token governance. So maybe things like Bill Co deference approaches that can make this bit simpler. But there is an advantage though to conversion and like Aaron said that if you're situated in a jurisdiction and they have an escape hatch into a more Dow fied version, that seems like an immediate advantage. And kind of my idea with the Dow bill know, kind of a celebration of LLCs which is like a celebration of maybe libertarian notions of how we should own businesses together if DAOs existed way back when, I assume we would have something like the Dao bill before we would try to do an LLC bill. Because I think anyone who's exposed to this technology or has been in DAOs, they see these are actual real systems versus a traditional company, which is whatever the government and your bank and all these other third parties can agree upon.
00:53:18.410 - 00:54:27.326, Speaker C: So it's very much, I think, in the train of the experiment that Wyoming had originally with LLCs and promoting something that's more flexible. I also lined just automating lawyers out of a job, and I think there's probably too much histrionics about code deference and how difficult that is. So I think it's worthwhile to have experiments at the legislative level as long as we can also promote private organizations that try to use operating agreements. There are templates for that. But I think my biggest pain points in terms of Dows and LLCs and these sort of statutes is how do we really celebrate smart contracts and digital currencies? How do we remove the need to pay fiat to the state? How do we avoid the need to hire a registered agent that merely just receives mail that's very alien to a Dow? Like noticing a Dow because somebody sent some mail to it feels very archaic. So there's aspects of company formation as a whole that I think we're leaning in here, and I think it's going to be an iterative process. And a lot of sausage is involved with getting something passed.
00:54:27.326 - 00:54:59.802, Speaker C: So I think that's probably why there's controversy. And I definitely think that lawyers as our job, we're meant to criticize that's almost like how we get our supper. But I think this criticism has been productive for Ethereum in that as a culture, as a community, we're very experimental and we are able to upgrade and fork and do things that are necessary. So I'm optimistic, though, on the normalizing impact of Dow bills, or at least anyway.
00:54:59.856 - 00:55:22.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. No, but I think it's a good one. Ross. I think it is that experimentation one. It's the validation, which is notable, right. It's nice to be able to actually have an entity that's recognizable. So going back to even what we were talking about before, if Curve was organized as a wrapdow in some capacity, and there's lots of reasons why they may not choose to be that, but there's good reasons for them to do that.
00:55:22.322 - 00:56:04.942, Speaker A: If they wanted to walk into court, that would be a lot easier for them to do that. If they wanted to get tax ID numbers and start paying taxes, they can normalize and actually grow to something that's not kind of on the backwaters of the Internet, but really front and center and prominent and mainstream. They have an avenue and a path to do that. And beyond that, I think for existing structures, this may not work. Right? Maybe you've formed a private foundation before and converting into this may not work, but you can always start as a member managed entity, which could be a group of software developers that are managing some open source project or something else like that. And then you can convert that. You can amend your documents and decide to have that entirely run by an algorithm if you want.
00:56:04.942 - 00:57:03.602, Speaker A: Or once these amendments pass, you can have some sort of hybrid of the two and just articulate that. And I think that's great. And then to Ross's point about automation, what I'm hoping we do see is lawyers or other folks increasingly come up with standard off the shelf documents that teams can use so that they don't need to pay a handful of crypto lawyers $60,000 or more than that to put together a Dow. I think that that's just wrong and I don't think that that's the direction that we should be pushing towards. It should be just as easy to set up a Dow, if you want to, as it is to set up a company for venture capital financing, or as it is to set up a small business, which it shouldn't cost tens of thousands of dollars to do that. And hopefully this lowers the requirements to do that. And we can continue to see experimentation to make sure that the different forms and shapes and structures of Dows that I imagine we'll see over the next couple years increasingly are accounted for in different ways.
00:57:03.736 - 00:57:38.640, Speaker B: Kane Warwick of Synthetics wrote a great blog post on how DAOs should finance themselves and in it he wrote this description of a Dao. DAOs also forego reliance on external courts of law. The Dao controls itself from the inputs of Dao members alone. It is by definition self contained and need not rely on any external arbiter to determine control. Of course, there will always be the necessity of meta governance, but the Dao handles this through stakeholder inputs controlled by its own internal rules. What did you think of his description here?
00:57:39.250 - 00:58:17.302, Speaker A: I think there's a point to it in many ways. He's just describing private ordering, which at least in the US and in parts of Europe, there's strong historical vestiges and support for that notion. The idea is that different parties can agree to order their affairs if they're deciding to order their affairs using code as opposed to legal agreements. I think that there's a strong argument for that to happen. Unfortunately, law doesn't disappear. Governments don't disappear. The course of impact that governments have doesn't disappear just because you've self proclaimed yourself a Dow and just because you've decided that stakeholder holders have decisions.
00:58:17.302 - 00:58:52.486, Speaker A: If the activity of what you're doing is unlawful, if the activity hurts other people, you will be held accountable for it. We saw glimmers of this with the original the Dao and its implosion. Fortunately because of the ethereum hard fork and because of the fact that ethereum ramped up in value after. That fact, people were not wiped. But if they were wiped, I am sure that we would see one or more of those members enforce their rights in courts. So even though there the folks that put that together said, hey, this is entirely run by code. It's code as law in its purest sense.
00:58:52.486 - 00:59:22.542, Speaker A: And many folks are cheering that on. In reality, something goes wrong, people get hurt, they get grumpy, they go to court, they hire lawyers. And people that are involved will be held accountable for it. In structures that don't have a legal backing in some sort of way, they will likely be viewed as partnerships. And the way partnership law tends to work is that partners have to account to one another if there's some sort of damage in some sort of way. And your liability for any damage that's been caused is not limited. So that means the deepest pocket is going to be responsible for it.
00:59:22.542 - 00:59:54.518, Speaker A: So if some of the venture capital funds that have backed these projects want to participate in governance, if folks that do have deep pockets because they've acquired a number of digital assets over the years want to participate in Dows, they can definitely do it. And I'm sure that many of them will not run into issues. But there will be some that get knotted up in some nasty situation involving a Dow that isn't organized, that doesn't have any limited liability protection, and they'll be on the hook for it. And that's going to probably push more and more folks as they mature to begin to explore these types of structures.
00:59:54.614 - 01:00:24.370, Speaker B: Yeah, let's kind of flesh that picture out a little bit more. So let's say that there is a Dow kind of more the way that Kane described it here, where they're not an LLC. And maybe let's say there's venture backing or it doesn't have to be. It could be. You know, I imagine that for the foreseeable future, we are going to see this range of will, you know, become LLCs and others will not. So let's say that we have two. They're doing the exact same thing.
01:00:24.370 - 01:00:38.258, Speaker B: The same blow up happens. It's parallel universes, like sliding doors or whatever. And after the blow up, then what happens to the Dow that's not an LLC, and what happens to the Dow that is an LLC?
01:00:38.434 - 01:01:13.486, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's say that there's some damage that somebody can quantify. Let's just put numbers on it. $100 million in damage, which is not unheard of. The individual members, if it's an implied partnership, would be responsible for making that party whole. And if one party was brought and ordered to make the damaged party whole, they could turn around and then seek an accounting from the other folks to get their money back. So it creates an incentive, when you have a pure partnership, to find the deepest pocket to bring a cause of action against the partnership.
01:01:13.486 - 01:01:59.262, Speaker A: And that deep pocket to pay for it and then to turn the partners internally so that they can deal with the internal accounting on who should fully pay for this. So it creates a huge mess. If it was a legally wrapped entity, then only any amounts that were contributed to that entity in general, with certain exceptions, would be at issue. So the entity itself would only be responsible for the damage. You as an individual member or owner or participant likely would only be responsible for your individual contributions to it. So all your other assets are not put at risk. And that's a big difference, right? If you have a lot of assets, if you're a mature player, if you're a traditional player, you're not going to likely want to participate with some of these Dow structures until you have the certainty of limitation of liability, until you have the certainty of legal recognition.
01:01:59.262 - 01:03:03.990, Speaker A: So right now, as we see DeFi kind of scaling up, it's awesome, right? Like we can stay as an insular community. But if you believe in this vision that blockchain technology, ethereum bitcoin at some point is the norm, it is mainstream, you cannot avoid the fact that traditional actors and players are going to need to participate and play around with these structures. So at some point it's going to have to get sorted out, right? You're going to need some of these protections, this legal recognition, in order to move forward. And that's why it's important because it's not just going to be an insular bubble forever. At some point the weight and gravitas of what's happening in this ecosystem will become large enough that it's going to have to pull in the rest of the world and it's going to need some of these legal protections to do that. So I applaud Know for pushing and kind of taking what I call like the more Wild West approach, but at the same time, unless you lay down the foundation with what's happening in Wyoming and other places, ETH and the crypto ecosystem just going to hit a wall. It's not going to be able to get the adoption that I think many folks are aspiring for it to achieve.
01:03:04.970 - 01:03:52.246, Speaker C: Yeah, and if I could add there, I would say that there could be an intermediate step for Kane's version of a Dow and maybe what corporate bodies should be adding a simple membership or constitution to the mix. That at least makes it predictable how Dao members will treat each other in the case of disagreements I think is always a very positive step and we're seeing open sourcing of templates for that. But yeah, there is this issue with private ordering through smart contracts, which smart contracts are, like, almost the end goal of private ordering, which is, like, true enforceability by agreements, code is then, you know, private ordering still has externalities. Of course. The agreement I make with Aaron I can't know. Aaron, you and I agree that nobody else can sue us based on what we're doing together. That's not exactly how the law works.
01:03:52.246 - 01:04:23.034, Speaker C: The law is a remedy system for the things people do that affect each other. However, smart contracts, while they're good for private ordering Dow member to Dao member, the state provides these public ordering things like LLCs, where we can then coordinate with other people that aren't in the Dow and try to reach some agreement about who holds the bag if there's an issue. These are kind of tools and fictions made up things the state provides us so we can actually coordinate and make productive businesses without losing our house every time.
01:04:23.092 - 01:04:23.458, Speaker A: Right?
01:04:23.544 - 01:05:27.150, Speaker C: So there is kind of this reality that I think is a very important addendum to Kane's, I would say pure and very idealistic vision of DAOs in that Dow members are humans and what they decide to do on the blockchain will affect people off the blockchain. And we have to grapple with that reality if we want mainstream adoption. People are grappling with it by going full crypto anarchic and going private using tornado systems to hide value flows. But I can't see that being the immediate adoption point that feels like it will always be an area for people to do maybe more censored businesses, but there's more ordinary use cases for ethereum like fundraising for startups that we want to make sure that it's predictable who can get sued if we decide to do these things. So mostly just rephrasing what we just talked about. But I think it's important to also understand that we shouldn't rely entirely on smart contracts. We should try to define our relationships amongst each other as Dows.
01:05:27.150 - 01:05:56.030, Speaker C: And then if we want to have a relationship with the public, we want to own businesses or put up billboards and do cool stuff off chain. It's very helpful to have a coordination mechanism with the public, like an LLC. So that's kind of where I see Coda's law and law's code. Converging is like it's a coordination technology ultimately, and trying to get people to not go full vigilante if they have a bad business deal. We want people to be civil, right? That's ideally the goal of all this is that people cooperate.
01:05:57.890 - 01:06:44.026, Speaker A: Right? And part of cooperation is taking risks. And that's why limitation liability is so important. Right? So that's one of the core innovations of a corporation which folks like Sam Altman and others have commented that that may be the greatest innovation of all time. This legal innovation of creating a way for people to limit their liability just to the actions of what's going on inside of an organization that's enabled so much human output, human creativity, to kind of meet its most efficient endpoint. And that's what's missing with Dows right now. When they're partnerships, you have unlimited liability when you participate in them. So that means you put your personal assets at stake for anything that's going wrong in those groups.
01:06:44.026 - 01:07:17.606, Speaker A: Arguably. And being able to have Dows that have a limitation of liability means that more folks can participate. Having Dows that are legally recognized and you can call yourself that, gives them an actual degree of validation, which means that they can interact, they can acquire land. Right. They can start to move into areas that are outside of crypto, which is in the long run, going to be important, being able to articulate that you're going to have part of your organization not managed by contracts, but by software. It's subtle but important. There's nothing precluding that.
01:07:17.606 - 01:08:05.346, Speaker A: But having that clearly stated, I think is helpful and hopefully can resolve disputes. And then beyond that, you can start to get things like tax numbers. You can begin to interact with the real world, and that's going to make regulators and other folks that are worried about crypto understand this technology a thousand times better. So if Uniswap wants to be as large, if not the largest exchange ever, how is it going to do that? If it can't interact in any way or talk in any way to the traditional world, they're just going to be skeptical. They're going to have their backs up, and it's not going to fulfill that vision. But maybe through these structures or some innovation on these structures, we can get to that point where we can really see crypto emerge and become the global force that many developers and advocates and other supporters really believe it can be. So we're taking steps in that direction.
01:08:05.458 - 01:08:19.546, Speaker B: Yeah. So we'll have to see how all this pans out. I feel like we could have gone another hour to discuss the many other issues that pertain to this subject, but I'll have to do that in another episode. So where can people learn more about.
