First headline Ethereum's Lenten hard fork hits main net On Thursday, Ethereum's long awaited lenten hard fork went live, bringing with it five Ethereum improvement proposals, each featuring code changes aimed at optimizing the network. Notably, Linton includes EIP 1559, which has two components. First, it adds a base fee to every transaction on Ethereum, intending to make gas fees less volatile and perhaps just slightly less expensive. Secondly, EIP 1559 has begun burning those base fees, sending ethereum to an inaccessible address, leading to an Ethereum first, as tweeted by Alexander Fisher, quote we just had our first deflationary ethereum block. Block 1296-5263 had a block reward of two ETH but burned 2.78
00:00:58.062 - 00:01:59.460, Speaker A: ETH. ETH is ultrasound money. Fisher's excitement about Ether as ultrasound money stems from the belief that by taking ETH out of circulation and therefore limiting supply, ether's investment thesis as hard money, or what many in the Ethereum community are calling ultrasound money, will be very appealing to investors, especially in light of Bitcoin's dominance as a hard capped asset. Such deflationary pressure on the asset, one could argue, is likely to be good for those long ethereum. Or as Jeff Benson from Decrypt put it, quote the less of something there is, the higher price it should be able to fetch. And indeed, it appears investors were buying the Ethereum Hype in the days leading up to London, with Ether gaining about 17% over the past week, shooting up from the two two hundreds to the two seven hundreds in the seven days prior to the main net launch.

In a blog post, he proposed that Zcash ditch its proof of work consensus algorithm in favor of proof of stake, just as Ethereum plans to do with a shift to Ethereum 20. Zuko wrote, quote While there are many who prefer proof of work, I believe that proof of stake would make Zcash more valuable to more people. The benefits are great, and they far outweigh the drawbacks and risks. He cited lower security costs, energy benefits and reduced selling pressure on miners as reasons for the change, amongst others.
