00:01:16.104 - 00:01:17.922, Speaker C: Today's guest here with me at DevCon.
00:01:17.986 - 00:01:20.754, Speaker B: In Osaka, Japan, is Deborah simpier, COO.
00:01:20.802 - 00:01:22.594, Speaker C: And co founder of Althea Network.
00:01:22.722 - 00:01:23.746, Speaker B: Welcome, Deborah.
00:01:23.858 - 00:01:25.894, Speaker F: Thank you so much for having me.
00:01:26.012 - 00:01:30.060, Speaker C: What problem are you trying to solve and how does Althea Network address that problem?
00:01:30.510 - 00:02:07.822, Speaker F: So we're trying to solve the problem of big telecom being highly monopolized. And right now we see that legacy Internet users are paying high prices for slow speeds because last mile networks are siloed by ownership and have long lock in. When you have Internet service to your home, you're locked in with just one device and one Internet service provider. But with Althea, instead of one company owning all of the infrastructure of the network, althea software lets us leverage existing homes and businesses in an efficient way. And then we can build out decentralized internet service providers where neighbors pay neighbors for bandwidth.
00:02:07.886 - 00:02:15.750, Speaker C: And so you live in an area where people are using this. Tell me about where you live and why you guys don't have easy to access Internet.
00:02:16.090 - 00:02:45.010, Speaker F: Yeah, so I live in Katskenai, Oregon, which is a rural community. That's typical. Like many rural communities where there's this cross population, there's some lower income folks, blue collar people, and some challenging geography. And many people there see megabit per second speeds as their normal home Internet. And cost is also a barrier. But that's not like the whole story. There actually is fast, high speed Internet through the center of town.
00:02:45.010 - 00:03:12.026, Speaker F: It's not well coordinated to be able to reach the people that don't have good Internet service. This is why we set up the decentralized Althea network there. And it's pretty exciting to see now that we have people that own like a farm or a business or a house, or setting up some antenna equipment and forwarding bandwidth to their neighbors and getting paid automatically for doing that.
00:03:12.128 - 00:03:14.070, Speaker C: And this also uses ethereum.
00:03:14.230 - 00:03:34.958, Speaker F: Oh, yes. So basically people get Ethereum from the coinbase app or any kind of app for exchange on your phone, and then they get that into the router by scanning a QR code on the dashboard. And then once it's actually in the router, it bridges to XDI. So it has a stable component.
00:03:35.054 - 00:03:36.370, Speaker C: I don't know what Xi is.
00:03:36.440 - 00:03:42.210, Speaker F: So Xi is a stable coin on the Poland network.
00:03:43.430 - 00:03:43.890, Speaker B: Okay.
00:03:43.960 - 00:03:44.674, Speaker C: Oh, interesting.
00:03:44.792 - 00:03:57.586, Speaker F: So this allows people to buy the easily available ethereum using their debit cards, but still have that stabilize out in their router so that their Internet bill doesn't fluctuate between twenty dollars to forty dollars based on the price of Ethereum.
00:03:57.698 - 00:04:02.342, Speaker C: Okay, so they're basically paying each other in dollars using the stablecoin.
00:04:02.406 - 00:04:11.414, Speaker F: Yeah, it feels very much to the end user, like they put $20 on the router and that pays their neighbors for the bandwidth.
00:04:11.542 - 00:04:19.854, Speaker C: And so physically, what is the setup and where do the different players on the network get their hardware or equipment and how do they pay for it?
00:04:19.892 - 00:04:20.766, Speaker D: Do they have to pay it up.
00:04:20.788 - 00:04:23.726, Speaker C: Front and then they wait to get paid back by the neighbors or how.
00:04:23.748 - 00:04:41.906, Speaker F: Does that part work? Yeah, so we also realize that in the Internet service providing space, there's kind of a need for if something goes wrong, you're going to call somebody or maybe you need some help installing equipment or someplace to buy the equipment from. And so we have also another incentive for what we call the group of organizers.
00:04:41.938 - 00:04:42.182, Speaker D: Right.
00:04:42.236 - 00:04:53.306, Speaker F: So in this particular network in Oregon, it's a cooperative and they're there to help people get installed. And also there if there's questions and that kind of thing as basically but.
00:04:53.328 - 00:04:56.620, Speaker C: They have to pay it upfront and then they get paid back.
00:04:57.070 - 00:05:17.794, Speaker F: Yeah. So for people that want to participate and resell bandwidth, they buy their equipment and then the network organizers help them set it up. And then, for example, we have one relay. Her name is Linda, she lives on a farm and she hosts a connecting antenna and a couple of sectors, antennas that connect her neighbor up.
00:05:17.912 - 00:05:21.810, Speaker C: And a relay is what? Somebody who's giving Internet access to others.
00:05:21.880 - 00:05:22.162, Speaker B: Okay.
00:05:22.216 - 00:05:28.950, Speaker F: Yeah. So they're taking bandwidth from the sort of high speed fiber backhaul and then they're connecting their neighbors up.
00:05:29.020 - 00:05:34.434, Speaker C: And the backhaul is like where kind of your little community connects to the main Internet.
00:05:34.482 - 00:05:56.800, Speaker F: Is that that's a good description. Yeah. So Linda, now that she has her hardware set up, her router in her home is like a normal consumer router, but it's running out via software. So as her neighbors, her connected neighbors use the bandwidth, she gets paid automatically to her router wallet. So about once every couple of months, she cashes out her $150.
00:05:57.250 - 00:06:12.820, Speaker C: Okay. And is the payments is that per usage or is that a monthly payment? And if I'm using it and I'm not a relay, do I have to manually pay it or is it automatically done?
00:06:13.270 - 00:06:31.334, Speaker F: Yeah, so that's the key is that users load their routers up with they buy Ethereum and they load their routers up with token. And as they use it, then as they use bandwidth on a per gigabyte basis, then the routers automatically compute the billing and pay the upstream relay.
00:06:31.462 - 00:06:32.090, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:06:32.160 - 00:06:34.026, Speaker C: So it's like pay as you go, basically.
00:06:34.128 - 00:06:57.470, Speaker F: Yeah, absolutely. And this allows different relays. Now, one thing I did want to mention really briefly is that one of the key components of Althea is what they call a price aware routing protocol. So that if you're an end user and you're connected to more than one upstream provider, our protocol will switch automatically second by second to the cheapest link, so adds in that sort of automatic competition.
00:06:57.630 - 00:06:58.194, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:06:58.232 - 00:07:01.182, Speaker C: So the neighbors can like or the relays can charge different amounts?
00:07:01.246 - 00:07:02.098, Speaker F: Yes, exactly.
00:07:02.264 - 00:07:05.266, Speaker C: Oh, interesting. Okay, well, so then they're incentivized to.
00:07:05.288 - 00:07:17.026, Speaker F: Like yeah, we have one relay that will go every weekend with a bottle of wine to his neighbors and see if they want to get connected to his relay. So it adds also that kind of viral growth.
00:07:17.138 - 00:07:18.678, Speaker B: Oh, that's cute, that's funny.
00:07:18.774 - 00:07:28.380, Speaker C: And then what about privacy issues? Because if I'm using somebody else's Internet, essentially, is that something that could be a security issue?
00:07:28.830 - 00:07:54.354, Speaker F: Yeah. So first I want to just make sure I clear up any kind of miscommunication. It's not a WiFi hotspot. So when users connect to your neighbor, you're using long range antenna equipment on your roof, so you're not using the WiFi hotspot of your home connection. And then also we encrypt all of those links in the local network using WireGuard, and then that's decrypted at a server in a data center.
00:07:54.552 - 00:07:57.766, Speaker C: And how much are people generally earning from this?
00:07:57.948 - 00:08:12.970, Speaker F: So Linda is a good example. She has about six or seven connected people and she offsets her own usage. So her own usage is basically free for her, and then she'll make maybe $100 every two months or 150, something like that.
00:08:13.040 - 00:08:13.434, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:08:13.472 - 00:08:15.558, Speaker C: Okay, so she's not paying for her usage?
00:08:15.654 - 00:08:18.378, Speaker F: Yes, she's not paying, and then she's also making some money.
00:08:18.544 - 00:08:21.530, Speaker C: Okay, and how many users do you have overall?
00:08:21.970 - 00:08:23.646, Speaker F: So we have around 40.
00:08:23.828 - 00:08:24.270, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:24.340 - 00:08:31.358, Speaker F: Yeah, we got started about March of this year, and we're also rolling out with some new networks coming soon too.
00:08:31.444 - 00:08:32.078, Speaker B: Oh, cool.
00:08:32.164 - 00:08:34.980, Speaker C: Well, so tell me how you even got started doing this.
00:08:35.750 - 00:09:22.720, Speaker F: Well, I had been in the net neutrality and Internet freedoms kind of space for a while and then in a legislative perspective, trying to move regulation to protect the freedoms of our Internet and also just a mesh networking enthusiast. Really excited about that. But I had been doing that for a while and realized that I wasn't able to make traction that way. I wasn't able to affect change to protect our key freedoms or change the sort of monopoly big telecom has. And it was at that time that I met the other two co founders, johan Trembeck and Justin Kilpatrick, who had been working on Althea before me. And I had a company at that time called Cascadian Meshnet, and that's when we started working together.
00:09:23.090 - 00:09:30.690, Speaker C: All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk about how Althea got started and where they're going next. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:09:57.920 - 00:10:51.210, Speaker E: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat? Are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

00:10:53.306 - 00:11:08.020, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Deborah simpier. So when you were saying you got involved in this, did you kind of just recently move to the community and then realize, oh, they have this problem, or how did you guys figure out that this could be a solution for you?
00:11:09.270 - 00:11:51.246, Speaker F: So I had moved to the community about 13 years ago, so no, I had been there for quite some time and had always envisioned that a community network and a sustainable network like this would be the answer. But before the technology, even to run a wireless Internet service provider would not work well in this community because of actually some of the geographical challenges. The way that the network would have to be configured around a centralized tower would not make physical sense. Althea allows us to set this up in an agile, kind of decentralized way that allows us to get around some of these physical barriers even too, that was not possible. So really, it was Althea's technology that made this network possible.
00:11:51.348 - 00:11:53.082, Speaker C: And what were the physical barriers.
00:11:53.226 - 00:12:40.734, Speaker F: So A Klutzkanai lies in a valley, and there's these large hills. So if you have one tower on one hill, you would not be able to see under the shadow of that particular hill. And it's pretty much just a bunch of hills and valleys and also large trees. And so these relays, then maybe they can see four or five houses around that corner, and then they bounce to another house. And in fact, we have one link, if you don't mind, I'd love to share with you that it bounces from the central it goes from the central part of the town to out in the valley to up on the hill to another relay up on the hill. And then from up on the hill, another 3 miles out to where the river is to connect up someone out there. There would not have been any way possible to connect that person up before.
00:12:40.852 - 00:12:41.390, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:12:41.460 - 00:12:51.570, Speaker F: They went from having a megabit per second DSL connection to 40 to 50 megabits per second of broadband Internet, because that was possible.
00:12:51.720 - 00:12:52.738, Speaker D: Oh, that's great.
00:12:52.824 - 00:12:58.440, Speaker C: Yeah, there's something very Rube Goldbergian about it, but it works.
00:13:00.010 - 00:13:12.040, Speaker F: Yeah, a little bit. I think that our networks coming online, we have some urban networks, and they may look a little bit more standard than the network we have in Katsk and I. There's definitely some challenges there.
00:13:13.150 - 00:13:23.514, Speaker C: Before we get to your expansion, I'm curious, when you were trying to explain the crypto aspect to the users on your network, was it something that was easy to do or kind of what were the difficulties in doing that?
00:13:23.632 - 00:14:07.146, Speaker F: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's really kind of interesting aspect. So of all those users that we have, I think maybe one of those had any experience with the cryptocurrency at all before, and many of them are senior citizens. I'd say about a third of our network is senior citizens. And I think that the reasons why we had such success. And I feel like it actually has been pretty successful and pretty overall frictionless is that we do spend some brief ten minutes of one on one time with someone kind of walking through the process. And then we've also found that using words like digital currency instead of crypto and a payment app instead of an exchange is more accessible for people.
00:14:07.328 - 00:14:10.060, Speaker C: Interesting, but otherwise they seem to get it.
00:14:10.430 - 00:14:54.234, Speaker F: Yeah, I don't necessarily think they need to understand all the inner mechanics of it to be able to use it. Like how most people don't necessarily need to understand the inner mechanics of Icloud in order to benefit from it. I think in that perspective, they do. And just if I can briefly, I think what is kind of interesting, though, when we talk about decentralization and what it actually looks like originally we set this network up selling people on the idea of faster and cheaper internet and they bought into that. But I'm also now hearing that they're excited about the ideals of ownership and choice and resiliency and all these sort of values that we think about about decentralization that just kind of came into the equation as well.
00:14:54.352 - 00:14:56.058, Speaker C: Oh, interesting. That makes sense.
00:14:56.144 - 00:14:57.690, Speaker F: Yeah, it's really cool.
00:14:57.840 - 00:15:32.418, Speaker C: Yeah. And I love what you said about how all they need is just like something that works and they don't need to understand how it works. And actually that's why I wanted to interview you because I was kind of like, oh, this is like a really interesting little experiment where it seems kind of separated from what a lot of people might talk about here at the conference. But this is like usage and adoption and actual real people benefiting from blockchains and cryptocurrency. Why don't you then tell me about how you guys are expanding and where you're expanding? Is this only for rural areas or can you play in urban areas?
00:15:32.514 - 00:16:12.434, Speaker F: Yeah, so we're excited about some of this new network starting. We have one in an urban area south of Seattle called Tacoma, Washington. And this is a community of about neighborhood of like 12,000 people. So it's very urban within a couple of blocks there. And what we did with this list is we started what we call an althea hood. So the organizers there went and they did some canvassing and they pre registered people that pre committed to this when it rolls out. And so we've already have 80 people pre committed to using this system in their community and they should looks like be rolling out shovel in the dirt in about a month.
00:16:12.434 - 00:16:21.042, Speaker F: So that's very exciting. We do have another rural network in the Napa Valley in California also coming on online and in Abuja, Nigeria.
00:16:21.186 - 00:16:22.086, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:16:22.268 - 00:16:29.286, Speaker F: So developing world as well. So that'll be interesting to see, I think, how that traction happens and how.
00:16:29.308 - 00:16:30.918, Speaker C: Did you even connect with that community.
00:16:31.084 - 00:16:49.166, Speaker F: So we do organize our seeing. So people come to us and say, I think this is a good fit for my neighborhood. And then we have a training program that helps them learn about it and start networks. And if it sounds like it's a good fit, then they continue to move forward with it.
00:16:49.268 - 00:16:52.590, Speaker C: And in what situations would it make sense for urban populations?
00:16:53.410 - 00:17:16.200, Speaker F: You know, we think of urban populations as all having high speed Internet access. And one of the things about being in that community in Tacoma was every maybe six households didn't actually have any Internet access or they were only using mobile and it wasn't very accessible to them. And this was also a lower income area so that we could compete on price.
00:17:16.730 - 00:17:17.480, Speaker C: Okay.
00:17:19.050 - 00:17:37.934, Speaker F: We do find that a lot of people are upset about their Internet service provider currently, but that isn't enough to gain enough traction. You have to have some clearly better value proposition. So in this network, it was having a community rent network that also can be competitive on the price and how.
00:17:37.972 - 00:17:40.106, Speaker C: Does it compare to typical prices?
00:17:40.298 - 00:17:47.026, Speaker F: So in that neighborhood that folks are paying about $70 a month, and our network will be able to come in around 40.
00:17:47.208 - 00:17:56.818, Speaker C: Okay. Wow. Saving $350 a year. Okay, well, is there anything else you.
00:17:56.824 - 00:17:57.938, Speaker D: Want to say about your experience here.
00:17:57.944 - 00:18:00.578, Speaker C: At DevCon or what's going on with Aldia?
00:18:00.674 - 00:18:12.282, Speaker F: Yeah, I think there's some really exciting things coming, and I'm so excited to see people working on UX and user facing applications, and I'm excited to be here. Thank you so much for having me, and thanks again.

00:19:13.626 - 00:19:17.774, Speaker B: This one is titled upcoming Crypto Trend the Air Tax.
00:19:17.972 - 00:19:19.998, Speaker C: And I also like my tagline for.
00:19:20.004 - 00:19:24.320, Speaker D: The newsletter, which is you get a tax, you get a tax, you get a tax.
00:19:24.710 - 00:19:27.506, Speaker C: Greetings from Osaka, Japan, where it is.
00:19:27.608 - 00:19:30.690, Speaker D: Almost 04:00 a.m., and I have not.
00:19:30.760 - 00:19:32.594, Speaker C: Been on Japan time at all this.
00:19:32.632 - 00:20:04.622, Speaker D: Week except for, like, one day. But thankfully, I'm leaving in just a few hours ahead of Typhoon Haggibus, I think it's pronounced. So my body will soon be reunited with the time zone that it just flat out refused to give up. All right, so before I get to the headlines, I just wanted to say make sure to listen to this week's episode of Unchained with David Nlfato of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He had a very pragmatic approach, which I found both refreshing and frustrating. When I asked him about the possibility of the US.
00:20:04.622 - 00:20:53.866, Speaker D: Dollar losing its global reserve status, he said, who cares? So I wasn't really expecting a Federal Reserve economist to be that blase. But anyway, it's getting a lot of interesting comments on Twitter, so I think people are finding it really fascinating. Also, you just heard my interview with Deborah simpier of the decentralized Internet service provider Althea Network. I was searching out examples of how ethereum is being used in the real world, and I really found it fascinating to learn about how her community in rural Oregon uses Ethereum. And I apologize that the interview may have sounded a bit rushed. It was not easy finding a quiet place to record, and even when I did, it was also really difficult keeping people from barging into the room. So I basically just tried to race through the interview.
00:20:53.866 - 00:21:39.850, Speaker D: All right, first headline this week new tax guidance on hard forks and airdrops. Not entirely clear. So the IRS released more crypto tax guidance and it caused a bit of a ruckus. It did clear up at least some accounting related questions, but then there were these other rules around taxing airdrops and hard forks that people thought would be either difficult to implement or based on misconceptions. And so the difficult to implement part is that you can receive cryptocurrency via AirDrop, not be aware of that and still have to pay taxes on it. So as Coins Center put it, quote It's like owing income tax when someone buries a gold bar on your property and doesn't tell you about it. It's absurd and impossible to reasonably comply.
00:21:39.850 - 00:22:37.834, Speaker D: The other wrinkle that they pointed out was that they feel the IRS did not use the terms AirDrop or hard fork correctly and that the agency sometimes conflated the two on crypto Twitter. Coin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenberg also pointed out that actually one of the scenarios that the IRS used in its guidance is something that has never happened. And Blockchain President and Chief Legal Officer Marco Centauri said that the guidance seems not to take into account the possibility of receiving an AirDrop into a self custody wallet. However, on the opposite side of the spectrum, crypto lawyer Patrick Merck did express the unpopular opinion that the hard forks and AirDrop's guidance actually makes sense. Next headline ethereum. Lots of Ethereum news this week. Ethereum released more details on the transition in 20, in the middle of Defcon Five and the myriad other adjacent events.
00:22:37.834 - 00:23:19.580, Speaker D: Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin managed to publish two posts addressing some of the bigger questions overhanging the shift to 20. One addresses what exactly developers will need to do for a smooth transition, which is mainly increase gas costs and download the code to implement the upgrade. But otherwise, he says, the changes for applications and users will be quite limited. The other question he answered via a blog post is whether applications will be able to talk to each other once Sharding is implemented. And surprise, surprise, he says, yes, we will see how that actually turns out. It's all TBD. Next up, the SEC denies Bitwise's bitcoin ETF application.
00:23:19.580 - 00:24:22.974, Speaker D: All I can say about this is at least they gave it careful consideration. The SEC released a 112 page rationale for the disapproval Bitwise's Matt Hogan released a statement saying, quote what matters is continued progress and the investment of time from regulators. And that's what we see here. And the company also tweeted, quote, historically, the journey to approval for first of a kind ETPs bonds gold, non transparent leverage has taken multiple years. It's a good thing that they have that perspective, because Compound General Counsel Jake Trevinsky tweeted, quote, at this point, it's reasonable to assume that Jay Clayton's SEC will never approve a Bitcoin ETF. Next story MakerDAO Multi Collateral will die to Launch as questions around governance continue, MakerDAO made a slew of announcements at DevCon, including the launch date for multicolateral die, which is November 18. You guys, if you did not listen to the two interviews I did with CEO Rune Christensen earlier this year, we do cover how multicolateral die works.
00:24:22.974 - 00:25:11.786, Speaker D: You should definitely check those out. Honestly, I really find this system very fascinating, and I think you'll enjoy those interviews. But just before DevCon, Bloomberg also published a piece on MakerDAO, and it went into more detail on some of the governance issues that have been docking the project. And I felt that it really raised questions about how compliance with the existing regulatory system and the ideals of decentralization can coexist. All right, now, time for some think pieces. Placeholder wrote a piece on why protocols are not businesses. So Chris Berniski of Placeholder Ventures yes, he wrote this great post on why protocols are not businesses and instead says that what they do is provide structure for businesses.
00:25:11.786 - 00:26:05.422, Speaker D: He says, quote they are systems of logic that coordinate exchange between suppliers, meaning businesses and consumers of a service. An Aliyaya of a 16 Z crypto had a Tweet storm on why he does not believe that there will be one dominant blockchain. As he puts it, quote, the tradeoff space that blockchains inhabit is far too large and high dimensional for a single blockchain to span all of it. I found both pieces really interesting, or at least the latter was a Tweetstorm. You guys should definitely check those out. And you didn't think you were going to get away with no Libra headlines, did you? Because I did find one wired piece I found interesting which showed that Libra Association members largely have ties to Facebook. So this graphic shows the ways in which more than half the Libra Association members have direct or indirect ties to Facebook.
00:26:05.422 - 00:27:12.646, Speaker D: In particular, investors DST and Andreessen Horowitz seem to be huge connectors. And the last headline will put one of the bigger sagas of the year to rest, hopefully quadriga CX Widow to Pay $9 Million to Customers. CoinDesk reports that Jennifer Robertson, quote, will be turning over all assets except for roughly $162,700 in personal assets, which include cash, her retirement savings, a 2015 cheap, some jewelry, personal furnishings, clothing, and some outstanding shares of Quadriga and affiliated entities. And finally, I always round out my newsletter with what I call fun bits, and this is one where you just have to look at the photo, but I propose a new Bitcoin price tracker, which is Winces Casares'hair Zappo CEO winces Kasares spoke on a panel while sporting basically a huge fro and Viche Boyapati tweeted. Quote I personally cannot wait to see what Winces hair will look like when bitcoin hits one hundred k. So that's it for this week's News.
