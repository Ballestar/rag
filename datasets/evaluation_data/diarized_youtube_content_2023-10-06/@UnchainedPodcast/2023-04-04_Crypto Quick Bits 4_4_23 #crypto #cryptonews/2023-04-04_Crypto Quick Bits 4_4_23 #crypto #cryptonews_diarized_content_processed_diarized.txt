00:00:00.250 - 00:00:05.642, Speaker A: A validator on Ethereum has been slashed by the network after draining funds from Me V bots.
00:00:05.706 - 00:00:50.620, Speaker B: Blockchain data shows that the rogue validator extracted 25 million from sandwich bots on Flashbots. A sandwich attack refers to a type of frontrunning where the Mev bot places a trade right before and after a large pending trade and benefits from the artificial increase in price. The validator in question likely planned ahead for the attack, funding a wallet through a confident Credential transfer through Aztec more than 18 days ago. Although the validator was penalized by being slashed from the network, to some users it seemed like a small price to pay compared to the profit earned in the attack. Developers later disclosed that the attack was possible due to a relayer bug, and a patch for the vulnerability has been deployed already. Was this actually a malicious attack, or was this validator just beating the Mev bots at their own game? You it.
