00:00:00.410 - 00:00:33.730, Speaker A: Where they kind of went off the rails is they said that is true unless there's a smart contract. If you use a smart contract then now this is an intermediated activity and therefore you know, you're potentially under the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act which like maybe if you think what a smart contract is, is like an exchange, like an onchain exchange, that's what a smart contract is. But of course smart contracts do everything under the sun. Smart contract is the most generic possible description of anything. Smart contract could be a multi SIG. It could be just like a literal ERC 20 transfer. That's a smart contract.
00:00:33.730 - 00:00:58.330, Speaker A: Like everything in crypto is a smart contract. An NFT is a smart contract. Mini wallet, many wallets are smart contracts. Exactly half the wallets in crypto are smart contracts. And so if you are claiming that anything that's a smart contract is not a peer to peer transaction it's just like you don't understand smart contracts are so it's very disappointing to see this coming from treasury, which is supposed to be responsible for regulating all this stuff. Not understand a very, very basic.
