00:00:00.090 - 00:00:56.250, Speaker A: The CFTC alleged that Binance Has willfully evaded US laws. In a complaint with documented internal text change between company executives, the US Commodities Future Trading Commission has charged Binance and its CEO with violating trading and derivatives regulations. In a lawsuit filed on Monday, the CFTC alleged that Binance unlawfully operated a derivatives trading exchange in the US and still elicited orders from customers in the country. Despite publicly stating its intent to restrict US customers, binance has taken a calculated approach to increase its presence. Instead stated the complaint. As part of this effort, the CFTC alleged that Binance aided US based users in circumventing its compliance controls by encouraging them to use VPNs. However, unlike the previous media reports of investigations refuted by Finance, the 74 page CFTC complaint cannot easily be dismissed.
