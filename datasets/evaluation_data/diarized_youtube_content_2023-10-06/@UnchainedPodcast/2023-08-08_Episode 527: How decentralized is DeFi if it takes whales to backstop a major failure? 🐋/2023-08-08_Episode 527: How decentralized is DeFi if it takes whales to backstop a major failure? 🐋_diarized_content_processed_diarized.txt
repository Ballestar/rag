And first of all, I think that if the lending systems other than Fraxlend, for example, incorporated more things like fraxlen's innovations like time dependent interest rates and actually were more autonomous, this whole thing would overall just kind of fix itself, right? It would oscillate to the right kind of market system. And a lot of it was just because, for example, MIM has fixed rate interest rates. They have to just actually go in and change interest rates. Ave has to vote on them per recommendations of like, their I think it's gauntlets safety reports and these kinds of things.
