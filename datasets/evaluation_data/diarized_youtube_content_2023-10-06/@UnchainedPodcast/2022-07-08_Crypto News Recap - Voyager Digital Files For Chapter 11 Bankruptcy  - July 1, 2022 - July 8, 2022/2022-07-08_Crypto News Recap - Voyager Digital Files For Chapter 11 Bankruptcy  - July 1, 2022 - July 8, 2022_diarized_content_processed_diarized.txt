00:00:00.250 - 00:00:21.262, Speaker A: You. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap. Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy. Crypto Broker voyager Digital filed for Chapter eleven bankruptcy. By applying for this type of bankruptcy, Voyager will be able to stay in business while it restructures its obligations and reorganizes its assets and liabilities. The company has $1.3
00:00:21.262 - 00:01:23.042, Speaker A: billion in crypto assets and $350,000,000 in cash held at Metropolitan Commercial Bank, according to the statement released by the firm. Last week, Voyager halted all activities from its platform, including withdrawals. It also issued a notice of default to crypto fund Three Arrows Capital as the latter failed to repay a loan worth $650,000,000. Voyager's financials were extremely debilitated by its exposure to three AC. Stephen Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager Digital, pointed to Three Arrows Capital as the trigger for its bankruptcy. We strongly believe in the future of the industry, but the prolonged volatility in the crypto markets and the default of Three Arrows Capital require us to take this decisive action, Ehrlich said. If the restructuring plan gets passed by the court, customers with assets in the platform will receive a combination of crypto in their accounts, proceeds from the three AC recovery, common shares and Voyager, or VYG Tokens.
00:01:23.042 - 00:02:13.558, Speaker A: Matt Levine from Bloomberg estimated that if the VYG Token has no value and three AC doesn't recover at all, users could expect $0.72 on the dollar. Customers have been hit hard and are blaming Voyager for deceitful marketing. I interviewed Jess Archer, a Voyager customer who has $70,000 locked in the platform, she said on June 20, they reached out to a bunch of partners and entered into these NDAs to try to bail them out. And six days before that, they sent an email out to us, meaning the customers, reassuring us that they didn't have any exposure to Celsius. They never engaged in DFI lending. In fact, the Wall Street Journal reports that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is investigating Voyager's claims that the dollars in its customer accounts were protected up to $250,000 by FDIC Insurance.
00:02:13.558 - 00:03:22.958, Speaker A: By the way, late Wednesday, TPS Capital, which long dubbed itself the OvertheCounter trading arm of Three Arrows, tweeted a statement that it was independent and had separate management. TPS is an independent legal entity and its operations are separate and distinct from those of three AC, it said. FTX bails out BlockFi FTX Sam Bankman fried's crypto trading platform has closed a deal to lend struggling crypto lender BlockFi $400 million in revolving credit. The deal includes an option to buy Blockfly at a variable price up to $240,000,000 max. Zach Prince, BlockFi CEO, explained what he believes led to this deal crypto market volatility, particularly market events related to Celsius and three AC, had a negative impact on Blockfly. The Celsius news on June twelveTH started an uptick in client withdrawals from Blockfly's platform despite us having no exposure to them, he said. Last Friday, it was rumored that FTX was going to buy Blockfly for just $25 million, a mighty fall from July 2021, when Blockfly was valued at $4.75
00:03:22.958 - 00:03:57.666, Speaker A: billion. So if it is sold for $240,000,000, that would mean a $4.5 billion loss from its peak valuation. This is not the first credit line that Blockfly has secured with FTX since the start of this bear market two weeks ago. FTX provided Blockfly a $250,000,000 credit line to help Blockfly navigate the market from a position of strength. According to Bankman Freed, blockfly is just one of many crypto lenders that have been struggling in the past few days and weeks. Coin Loan announced on Monday it would be reducing the withdrawal limits due to market conditions.

00:05:09.870 - 00:05:49.322, Speaker A: These funds will help HVB to grow its businesses and support its existing ones. After creating the vault, the bank will post real world assets as collateral, which include a variety of loans like commercial real estate, industrial and government guaranteed loans. Maker will receive some interesting benefits as well. The first is additional yield. Second is a more diversified portfolio, which reduces risks.
