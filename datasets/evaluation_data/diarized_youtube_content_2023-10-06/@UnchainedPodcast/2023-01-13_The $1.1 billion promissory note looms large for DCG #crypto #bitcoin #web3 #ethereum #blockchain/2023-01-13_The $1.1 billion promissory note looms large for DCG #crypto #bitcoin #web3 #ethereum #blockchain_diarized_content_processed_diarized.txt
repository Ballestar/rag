00:00:00.170 - 00:00:47.570, Speaker A: At a risk manager and somebody who's kind of worked in fixicum for a long time. Asset liability matching is a big thing and that has big implications from that regard. And it's pretty clear at this point that that hole cannot currently be filled because that promissory note is a ten year promissory note and then not anything shorter than that. If I can add to that, I think it's worth noting that we know that DCG has been trying to to sell off some of their assets. And I think it's worth thinking about what does that really mean? Part of that could really mean that they're conscious that they might have to plug a hole and they might need to make that payback that 1.1 billion sooner than later. Or actually monetize, for example, that loss from three AC by covering it up with other assets and liquidity.
00:00:47.570 - 00:00:58.060, Speaker A: Now, I think the reality is that we're going to be in a position where DCG and Genesis are going to have to empty their pockets and see what really makes sense.
