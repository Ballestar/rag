00:00:00.330 - 00:00:55.500, Speaker A: We met Alameda first, before they started FTX, sometime in 2018, late 2018, or early 2019. And I actually distinctly remember talking to them about accounting systems, and this is, you know, before FTX existed. So this is just for Alameda's accounting systems. And, you know, what they were saying is that, yeah, you know, at the end of the day, you know, we do our best to try and reconcile. We spend, you know, some time, half an hour or a couple hours, I forget exactly how much time they said, but they spent some amount of time at the end of every day to try and reconcile the records. But then they're like, at the end of the day, sometimes you just can't get to the right number. And if it's plus or minus ten grand, 100 grand, which back in the day was a lot of money, right, they said, well, just move on to the next day, right? So I think, looking back, there were so many different signs like that, that I think, in retrospect fact, were sort of clear warning signs and signals for the risks that were to come.
