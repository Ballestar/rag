00:00:00.250 - 00:00:39.650, Speaker A: South Korean prosecutors are in the process of freezing assets tied to former TerraForm Lab employees. They have estimated the value of criminal proceeds to be â‚©414.5 billion, or $314,000,000. Kwan alone has been tied to an unlawfully obtained $69 million, say local prosecutors. They have also been actively seizing the assets of Terra employees ahead of an impending trial. Kwon, however, has already sold all his assets in Korea, and prosecutors believe they are being held on a crypto exchange overseas. The local authorities have already established contacts with Binance, asking them to block any attempts by Kwon to withdraw his funds.
