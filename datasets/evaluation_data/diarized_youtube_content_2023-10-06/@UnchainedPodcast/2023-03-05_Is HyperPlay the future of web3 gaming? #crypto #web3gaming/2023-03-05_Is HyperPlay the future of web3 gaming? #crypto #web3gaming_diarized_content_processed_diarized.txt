00:00:00.250 - 00:00:02.682, Speaker B: How do you think Hyperplay is going to benefit users?
00:00:02.746 - 00:00:55.920, Speaker A: We think that the most inspiring Web Three bot models are carrying assets from one game world to another game world, or using these for reputation or using these as collateral in a D Five protocol. And in fact, when I was at MetaMask, the the largest growth was coming from players who were onboarding countries like the Philippines or Vietnam, Nigeria. These were places where people were historically locked out of the financial system and they were onboarding to play games, but then they were discovering the whole decentralized finance ecosystem and they were becoming able to leapfrog the traditional financial system and getting power and community. And for Hyperplay, we want to use gaming and the fun of gaming to bootstrap a new economic system that's more ethical and more sustainable and that gives power back to its community. I know the three features inside of their game.
00:00:58.610 - 00:01:12.074, Speaker B: This is Jeff Benson for Unchained and I'm at ETH Denver. Jacob C. ETH, a former operations lead with Ethereum Wallet. MetaMask just released a new game launcher for Web Three alongside the Dow game Seven. So, Jacob, what is hyperplay?
00:01:12.122 - 00:01:31.730, Speaker A: Hyperplay is a Web Three native game launcher. It aggregates the Epic Store, GOG, and our own game store and allows the player to connect their MetaMask, or Wallet connect wallet into our native desktop application and passes these wallets directly into desktop games.
