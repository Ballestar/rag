00:01:17.852 - 00:01:28.418, Speaker A: My guest today is Jonathan Zepatini, international Ops lead and chief evangelist for Decred, and also known as Decred Jesus. Welcome. Jay Z. Hi, Laura.
00:01:28.434 - 00:01:29.946, Speaker C: It's a pleasure to be with you.
00:01:30.128 - 00:01:48.826, Speaker A: So, listeners, there is an announcement about Decred today. This is maybe the second time I've done this on the show, which is kind of fun. It's not easy to do with the podcast, but before we get to that, we need to start with the basics. So you even know what Decred is. So, Jay Z, tell us what is decred?
00:01:49.018 - 00:02:12.600, Speaker C: Sure, Laura. So before the big reveal suspense. Decred is a community directed digital currency with built in governance to make it a superior long term store of value. So what that means basically, and as my buddy Chris Berniski likes to say, Decred's killer feature is good governance. And with governance, you can have any feature you want.
00:02:13.210 - 00:02:27.786, Speaker A: So what does that mean? So it's that you will be a currency, but that people will be able to help decide what features the currency will have.
00:02:27.968 - 00:02:45.570, Speaker C: Sure, exactly. So if we think about Bitcoin as revolutionizing banking, be your own bank, decred takes it one step further and says, hey, you can be a central banker and help make kind of monetary policy, not necessarily monetary policy, but decide on features.
00:02:46.390 - 00:02:55.170, Speaker A: And you also said that it would also be a store of value. So it would both be used as well as have features similar to digital gold.
00:02:55.990 - 00:03:26.110, Speaker C: So the way we think about this is that the first issue you need to tackle is being a store of value. I mean, so much of this space is about speculation, and I think that applies to Decred equally. But before you can go and have that medium of exchange property, you need to be proven as a solid, secure store of value. And if people want to hold your currency and they feel that it has a long term future, they'll be willing to use it as a medium of exchange eventually.
00:03:26.770 - 00:03:41.140, Speaker A: All right, so we'll talk a little bit more about the full vision in a while. But as you mentioned, governance is a huge part of Decred, and I think that is really key to the origin story of Decred. So how did Dcred get started?
00:03:41.910 - 00:04:34.900, Speaker C: That's really a great question. It's super interesting because there were basically two groups that came together to found Decred. One of them was Jake, our project lead, and his team at company zero, who were previously working on bitcoin. So they built something called BTC suite, which is a full node implementation in Go. So their idea know bitcoin's this cool technology, it's going to be a money protocol to make it more secure. It's good to have multiple implementations, right? So if there's a bug, let's say, in bitcoin core and half the network goes down, well, if there's other implementations, it'll just keep churning along. And what they learned was that while bitcoin was a lot fairer than the banking system in terms of the transparency of the rules, there were still issues with how you organize people and how you get new features proposed and pushed forward.
00:04:34.900 - 00:05:04.110, Speaker C: And that kind of plugs into the second group that founded Decred. So there was someone who goes by the name Taco time, who founded Monero. And Taco Time's big idea essentially, was a white paper called Memcoin two, where they propose a governance system so that you could have all the awesome properties of Bitcoin proof of work, but on top of that, have it so coin holders can make decisions about how the protocol is upgraded.
00:05:04.530 - 00:06:12.254, Speaker A: So Jake wasn't available for today, but I have interviewed him in the past and he told me about that period when he and I guess some other developers were trying to get into Bitcoin. And he described what he called challenging interactions with the bitcoin core developers, saying that they were incredibly hostile, adversarial and rude. And he also said that I guess one of the developers he was working with, as you mentioned, they had written this other implementation of the bitcoin client. And he said, quote, rather than see this as a positive development, that the ecosystem is diversifying, that now there's a second option, they saw it as a threat to their power and they responded by trying to disenfranchise us and sideline our project. And I think these feelings led him to write a blog post in November 2015, which I feel like actually this was shortly before he announced Decred. And you can kind of see how his criticisms of bitcoin kind of led to Decred. So I will link to this in the show notes.
00:06:12.254 - 00:07:16.774, Speaker A: But just to summarize, he called the way that bitcoin was governed then an oligarchy. And he called out some issues that he saw, such as that he says consensus in bitcoin is defined as 100% agreement and that requires unanimous consent. He said another issue is that development was completely donation driven. He saw there was a conflict of interest in the fact that a majority of the bitcoin core developers were involved in the founding of Blockstream, and that there was a conflict between Blockstream's business model of sidechains versus the block size debate. And he also said that bitcoin businesses, miners, developers of non bitcoin core infrastructure and users have no vote when it comes to future decisions regarding bitcoin. And he ended up summarizing the problems this way. Quote the current governance model of bitcoin does not admit multiple stakeholders and is geared towards stagnation because of the way consensus among bitcoin core developers works.
00:07:16.774 - 00:07:44.190, Speaker A: Beyond this structure being built to stagnate, even a conversion from a unanimous bitcoin core developer consensus model to a weaker one, for example, one with 66% majority required for changes would be subject to a veto from Blockstream by merit of their employment of so many bitcoin core developers. Additionally, all of us who participate in the bitcoin ecosystem who are not bitcoin core developers have effectively zero say in the matter. End quote.
00:07:44.850 - 00:07:46.098, Speaker C: Wow, there's a lot there.
00:07:46.184 - 00:08:14.300, Speaker A: Yes. So this very long blog post actually, it wasn't that long. It basically ends with what he identified as the top two problems with bitcoin. One, the lack of funding for development, and then two, the fact that proof of work miners have too much power. And as far as I can tell, these really were some of the key design decisions for Decred. So can you expand on these design features of Decred and how it attempts to resolve those issues?
00:08:14.910 - 00:08:54.758, Speaker C: Indeed. So we really look for three things with decred make it as secure as possible, make it as adaptable as possible, and make it as sustainable as possible. So that would address those three broad points to start with. The third, sustainability. I think that one's the easiest to attack just because it makes sense that if you want to have a currency and you want to have this piece of software that needs to be able to adapt and integrate new features and fix bugs, you're going to need people working on it, right? You need to be able to pay people. Some of us are lucky. We've been in the space a long time, caught bitcoin early on and can do whatever we want now.
00:08:54.758 - 00:09:39.540, Speaker C: But that's not a big help to new talent that comes into the space, right? Most people can't afford to work full time on a project just out of passion. So one thing we realize is we need to be able to pay people, and that pay needs to be independent. It can't come from VCs, it can't come from people who invested in an ICO or anything like that. It can't be having strings attached to it. So the idea for Dcred was we'll have a treasury, it'll be decentralized and 10% of the block reward is going to flow into that. So that we have this self renewing pile of money that we can use to pay people who only care about Decred. And that's pretty much how we do that.
00:09:40.150 - 00:10:02.678, Speaker A: Wait, I want to ask you about that. When you said that there was no ICO because you didn't want strengths attached, I think a lot of the theory for a lot of the people who had ICOs was that then they're sort of creating these user owned networks. So what was the thinking there around? Because I think for them, they thought, oh, then the incentives are aligned. But you guys saw it differently.
00:10:02.854 - 00:11:10.146, Speaker C: Yeah, we saw it the exact opposite way, actually. So for us it was, look, if we say we're going to build something and then you give me a pile of money, where's my incentive to actually deliver? Right? And in the case of a software product like Decred, if a bunch of people get this preferential access in like an ICO or a pre ICO, there's a lot of other issues. Is it a security afterwards? So we didn't want to raise any external money. We figured if the product idea is good, if it has value in the market, if the market gives it value, the treasury will have value and then it'll become self sustaining. If the market thinks it's terrible, it'll be worthless and it won't be able to sustain itself. So no external capital, no strings attached. And the other problem with ICOs is a lot of these coins sell so much in pre ICOs to a small group of preferred people, and then those people who actually participate in the ICO are underwater from, like, day one, pretty much, and you just have this sustained selling pressure to people who got this kind of sweetheart deal.
00:11:10.146 - 00:11:54.690, Speaker C: So our view is like, treat everybody fairly, everyone gets the same opportunity. And one of the things we did when we started Decred is we gave away part of a pre mine so that we could bootstrap the network with individuals who owned coins for free and that they would actually be the people making decisions in the beginning, the early days. So everyone pretty much just had to say, hey, I got one of these. I just had to sign up and give my Twitter and say, I'm a real person, look at this. And everyone who did that got 282 coins, which is worth about $7,000 today. And if they staked those coins and participated in our governance as we intended them to do, that'd be worth probably about like 42,000 US today. So not a bad return for just being able to prove you can fog a mirror.
00:11:55.110 - 00:12:03.220, Speaker A: So you talked about the origins of Dcred and where did you come into the picture and what were you doing before?
00:12:03.910 - 00:12:54.820, Speaker C: Sure, so I was a futures and equities trader for about ten years, and I kind of discovered bitcoin in 2010, fell in love with the idea of having being able to have this kind of sovereignty over your own money. And then my investor mindset was follow the smartest people in the space from that point on. And that's kind of how you know the guys from company zero, jake and his team working on bitcoin. I thought these were to be able to re implement bitcoin in a different language. You have to know it like the back of your hand. You have to be able to literally take apart the old system, analyze every piece, and put it and recreate it from scratch in a new you know, these were kind of like the foremost bitcoin experts in the space. I would argue that outside of the satoshi team, there's probably no team out there that knows bitcoin as well.
00:12:54.820 - 00:13:44.146, Speaker C: So that was kind of my reason for following them so closely. And I kind of watched how things evolved and found out about taco times menpoint two paper and thought, this is amazing. I wish bitcoin could have something like this. So when the two teams merged and decided to create a currency based on some of these ideas, I thought, for me, I got the same feeling I got when I first discovered bitcoin. Like, wow, this is revolutionary, and this is a no brainer bitcoin hedge. I think everyone who owns Bitcoin is going to want to have this as a hedge in your portfolio, just because it's got so many of the fundamental things that make Bitcoin amazing baked into it. And then it's got this novel system on top of it that bitcoin can never have because it's ossified, which is great in many ways, but means that it can't progress in other ways.
00:13:44.146 - 00:13:48.630, Speaker C: Everything has to be soft, forked in and done off chain.
00:13:48.970 - 00:13:54.470, Speaker A: And you think that the dcred developers know bitcoin even better than the bitcoin core developers?
00:13:56.410 - 00:14:19.150, Speaker C: Honestly, I'd say that would be really tight. I think. So the work that they did, I mean, writing it from scratch the way they did was quite the feat. To be able to reproduce bug for bug, how the consensus rules work requires an understanding that's really unparalleled.
00:14:19.810 - 00:14:44.200, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to clarify for listeners, I think the main bitcoin core client is written in c or c plus plus, and they had written in go language, which is obviously different. And it is true to recreate a functioning client in a completely different language, you definitely need to understand the protocol well, but I have a feeling there would be a lot of people who would disagree with you.
00:14:45.290 - 00:14:49.450, Speaker C: They're welcome to I want to be a little controversial.
00:14:50.110 - 00:15:11.310, Speaker A: Okay, well, I think you've definitely staked your claim there. So yeah, why don't we go into how the governance system in decred works? And actually, before we get into the details, can you just sort of start with the overall philosophy around governance of crypto networks.
00:15:11.810 - 00:15:32.242, Speaker C: Sure. For us, philosophy is skin and the game. So if I asked you who's in charge of bitcoin? Well, I guess you kind of know who Jake thinks is in charge, and you might have a different opinion. And that's valid in my view. And I might have a different opinion. So the big three that people usually point to know miners. The other one would be node operators, and some people say developers.
00:15:32.242 - 00:16:00.734, Speaker C: Right. But just the fact that we can have this debate means that it's not clear. Right. So they've made a clear choice of making no choice. So their governance is pretty anarchic, which is fine because bitcoin has certain properties to it that make that okay. First mover advantage is one of them. But for us, the main issue we wanted to solve right off the bat is who's in charge? So if you ask me who's in charge of decred, I can give you a clean answer, and I can explain exactly how that works.
00:16:00.734 - 00:16:08.770, Speaker C: And the answer is stakeholders. People who own the coins, the people with the most skin in the game. So if you own Dcred, you're in charge.
00:16:09.510 - 00:16:13.154, Speaker A: Okay, so why don't you then describe how the system works?
00:16:13.352 - 00:16:38.794, Speaker C: Great. So basically, people take their Dcred, and once they own some, they can actually lock it up into what we call a ticket. And there's a pool of tickets. Now, the target for this pool is about 40,960, and if you own one of these, you're called in a lottery. So much of the way, bitcoin is a lottery on hash power. Proof of work. Right.
00:16:38.794 - 00:17:18.658, Speaker C: We're choosing random miners who are playing this lottery to validate blocks. Proof of stake is kind of a lottery on these tickets where you get pulled out. So we work a lot like bitcoin in terms of the proof of work side. So we have two validation systems in our blockchain proof of work and proof of stake. The proof of stake miners create the new blocks and they get added to the blockchain and then the proof of stake system, the ticket holders participate by verifying that they accept the block to the system. So it kind of acts as like a second authentication factor on the chain. So every time a block is proposed, five randomly selected tickets are included to vote on the validity of the prior block.
00:17:18.658 - 00:17:26.122, Speaker C: And if three of those five approve it, it gets added. And we can actually use that to upgrade the network as well, which we can get into a little bit later.
00:17:26.256 - 00:17:33.920, Speaker A: And why do you have this hybrid proof of work proof of stake system? Because a lot of other networks choose one or the other.
00:17:34.370 - 00:18:34.206, Speaker C: Sure, exactly. So we found that each has its own weaknesses and each has its own strengths. So one of the main problems with proof of stake is how do you start up, right? So for a project that's just taking people's money, like an ICO, it's easy, I take your money, I give you some coins, right? But there's no mechanism after for distributing the coins other than that. Right? So we think proof of work is an awesome way of not only creating security, but also coin distribution. So it's not a few people in Decred who are able to acquire all the coins in the beginning, who hold power forever because new coins are always being produced and proof of work is producing twice as much as proof of stake, thus diluting all the people who happen to be lucky and get in earlier. So they work together in a symbiotic relationship where proof of work is basically producing blocks as a service to the network. We're not asking them to tell us where they want to go in terms of features or this or that.
00:18:34.206 - 00:18:47.640, Speaker C: It's block production as a service. They package those transactions, they make sure they're secure, they make sure they conform to the consensus rules, they broadcast it and they get paid for doing it. And that's all we want from them. We really don't expect anything else.
00:18:48.330 - 00:19:05.020, Speaker A: And then you briefly touched on tickets as part of the Decred governance system and this actually took me a little while to wrap my head around, but why don't you just describe more in full what tickets are for, what people do with them, how they function in the system.
00:19:05.390 - 00:19:41.366, Speaker C: Cool tickets are basically for voting, so they actually let you do three main things. And it's really interesting because two of those things have to do with voting. One of them is every time a block is produced, you have those tickets being called to say whether or not they want to add it to the chain. Right? So most of the time that's pretty straightforward. Everything gets added to the chain. If it was a misbehaving miner, like a miner who was mining empty blocks, we could create a rule saying, you know what, if a miner mines empty blocks even though it's valid and performs the consensus rules, we're going to reject that. So we could create a rule like that.
00:19:41.366 - 00:20:44.890, Speaker C: But the other two things that we really vote on is that when these blocks are created, if we want to have a consensus upgrade, we actually pre program all that code into the system and we actually vote on that. And if that vote passes, it can essentially be activated automatically. So it's not a signaling mechanism, it's actually a selection for a hard fork that will take place if there's a supermajority. And then that third thing is off chain voting system. So the ticketing system does the on chain voting for blocks and for consensus changes, as well as an off chain system, which we call Politea, which is for signaling how we want to allocate budgets, that 10% treasury that we have, and for signaling which features we want to build so people can make proposals. Or if we want to hire a PR firm or if we want to hire a new development team, all that kind of stuff can be signaled on Politea. So the idea is decred is really adaptable and we're not ideologues about stuff.
00:20:44.890 - 00:21:00.990, Speaker C: Everything doesn't have to be on chain or off chain. We're super pragmatic about these things. Some stuff belongs on chain and some stuff belongs off chain. We find that for things where there's a lot of little decisions being made, it's not super sustainable to have it all being dumped on the chain.
00:21:01.730 - 00:21:15.650, Speaker A: And just so I understand, can you use the tickets then simultaneously for the off chain and the on chain governance, or do you have to use them just for one or the other at any given moment in time?
00:21:15.800 - 00:21:52.110, Speaker C: No, you use them for both. So if you have a live ticket when an on chain issue is being decided, it'll be valid. And if an off chain issue is being decided at the same time, that will also be valid. If I can give you an analogy, which I really like, this one, actually. It's really interesting about kind of like a factory. So imagine that there's a toy car factory with miners acting as machines that make toy cars, right? And every time a toy car is produced, five quality inspectors that get randomly selected look at that toy car and decide whether or not it's valid. Good, right.
00:21:52.110 - 00:22:35.390, Speaker C: And if three of them approve it's good, and it gets added to the chain. Now, in terms of how that works for consensus changes, if we decided that we wanted to turn the car factory into a boat factory, that would be like a hard fork, right? Well, then 75% of the inspectors over a one month period would need to not only approve those cars, but also say, hey, you know what, I want to switch to boats. And if that happens and we get to that 75%, it automatically changes to a boat factory. And then, because everyone's agreed supermajority that we've switched, it's going to be pretty impossible to find enough people, three or five inspectors, to approve the old toy cars once we're all on boats.
00:22:36.130 - 00:22:47.940, Speaker A: And in order to participate in that, I need to stake my decred. So during that moment in time, I can't be using it to purchase things or pay somebody or whatever.
00:22:48.550 - 00:23:25.582, Speaker C: Correct. It needs to be locked up. That's a really important part of the skin in the game aspect. And I'm glad you brought it up because compared to other coins, we're asking something pretty big of stakeholders in that they're locking their coins up for an average of 28 days, let's say. But a ticket could be called to vote in as little as one day about or as long as like 142 days. So you're talking about up to four months there. So when you lock your Dcred up, you're going to have to deal with the consequences of your votes and be tied in to this system for potentially up to four months.
00:23:25.582 - 00:24:10.140, Speaker C: So you need to really be cognizant of what's going on and be really measured in the kind of things that you vote for because you're stuck with your decisions. And we think that's really important, that Skin the game is really important because it doesn't allow people to do hit and runs like, oh yeah, I'm going to vote for this because I think it's going to make the price go up. And then boom, went up, I'm gone. We really want people to have a long term vision and be in it for longer. And to me, four months isn't that long. My plan is to be here for decades from now, and Decred is actually designed to last for centuries. Everything we've built is with an eye towards being adaptable enough to make any change necessary to deal with the unknown unknowns of the future.
00:24:10.770 - 00:24:20.110, Speaker A: And at the moment, about 50% of Dcred is staked, which that seems fairly high to me. What do you make of that percentage?
00:24:20.690 - 00:24:43.702, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been steadily increasing. I think it's fantastic, actually. It just shows that there's a couple of incentives to stake, right. We can't ignore. The big one is you're getting paid to stake to some extent, so you receive part of the block reward for staking. So, I mean, it is profitable, but I think even aside from that, there is an incentive for people to actually participate and help make Decred better. Right.
00:24:43.702 - 00:25:22.498, Speaker C: So if I can give you an example, we had a vote last week and there was a developer that did some work. He built some tools in Python, basically a Decred toolkit in Python, and finished the work and then put it up on our proposal system, Paulitea, and said, hey guys, I've built these cool tools for Dcred. Are you guys willing to pay me for know it's all open source code? It's all out there. So if we say, no, he's not getting paid, we got the work. Right? It's under a permissive license already. And what stakeholders did is they voted on whether or not we should pay this person $8,000 for these hours and hours of work that they did. And it passed with 94% and they got paid.
00:25:22.498 - 00:25:36.520, Speaker C: So we're able to organize labor and compensate people. So it doesn't always work that way where people do the work first, but often you'll find that people do a little bit of work and get paid in their ears, and it's really an interesting way of being able to sustain the project.
00:25:37.130 - 00:25:50.814, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to keep talking about, I was going to say Bitcoin's Governance, Decred's Governance and its new feature in a little bit. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

00:28:15.264 - 00:28:34.000, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Jay Z. So one thing that we haven't really dived into is that Dcred has a pretty high inflation rate, 28%. And when you combine that with the staking rewards, doesn't that incentivize more people to just stake Dcred rather than actually use it?
00:28:34.610 - 00:29:15.918, Speaker C: I mean, Staking certainly helps offset some of that inflationary effect. As we discussed earlier, a lot of that's by design, so the curve is very similar to Bitcoin. So imagine where Bitcoin was in year three. That's pretty much where we are. So, yeah, it does help a little bit, but again, you're still being diluted by design because we want new people who show up to be able to have a voice. So compared to like, a pure proof of stake coin where you can get a foothold on the governance if you were there first, if you had 51% coins from the start, you're always going to have 51%, right? Well, compared to that, new coins are always being produced so that new people can have their voices heard. So we.
00:29:15.918 - 00:30:00.522, Speaker C: Think that's a real positive, but over the long term it'll stabilize and level off. One thing that we find which is really interesting is that stakers tend to take the coins that they get from proof stake and restake them and even proof of work. Miners, a lot of them actually, they mine decred because they want to stake it and then participate in the ecosystem. They're not necessarily mining it and then just blowing it out because it's another asset for them. So we think that's a really positive development. There's a lot of people who view this contention between miners and developers in other cryptocurrencies and we just haven't experienced that at all. We find that because we have this clearly defined set of rules, it makes conflict rails resolution easy.
00:30:00.522 - 00:30:04.106, Speaker C: And because everyone knows what the rules are, there isn't a lot of fighting.
00:30:04.298 - 00:30:14.350, Speaker A: And you talked earlier about the different kinds of voting that you can do when you have tickets. So what percentage of people are participating generally?
00:30:14.770 - 00:31:13.474, Speaker C: That's actually a great question. So I'm actually surprised how high it is. So for that super important stuff, those consensus rules, where it's like, hey, do we want to raise the block size? So for the on chain stuff, we find that like 50% of people will usually cast a vote on those. So about half of the people, the other half are abstaining, which doesn't really matter because they still receive proof of stake rewards, they're just not expressing a choice. So if, let's say, I don't have a lot of time to follow what's going on in terms of consensus rules, and I feel I'm not educated enough to make a specific decision about this rule at this time, I can abstain. But if I decide I want to vote and I educate myself and hear from different developers what they think are the advantages of a specific rule, I get to vote. So 50% participate in those super important ones and then on the polite side for managing the treasury, hiring people and whatnot, it's a little bit lower because those votes are happening really often.
00:31:13.474 - 00:31:35.690, Speaker C: So there's at least, I think, two going on right now. And last week there was a bunch. It's kind of consistent. There's rolling votes. We usually see about a third of voters can participate in that. It can go higher depending on how exciting something is. But sometimes people just don't bother, which is fine.
00:31:35.690 - 00:32:07.720, Speaker C: But I think the important distinction to make is there's no delegation in decred. So when you're voting, you're actually voting it's you expressing a choice. You can't just be like, oh yeah, I'm going to delegate my vote to Jay Z and let him vote and then pump up the numbers by virtue of everyone just delegating so that they can get paid. The people that are voting are actually making a conscious decision to participate and they're not saying, oh, I'll let someone else handle it, which I think is important.
00:32:08.250 - 00:32:33.520, Speaker A: Wow, that's amazing. I actually wasn't aware that it was impossible to delegate because as you probably know, there are so many of these other systems do enable that. But then that also, I guess, requires that if for whatever reason because here's the thing. So if you're going to stake, you need to be online the whole time, right?
00:32:33.970 - 00:33:09.622, Speaker C: Yeah. We actually have a really interesting way of dealing with that. So for people who are a little technically savvy, they'll have a machine, a server that will answer when those votes get called. Right. For people who are less technically savvy or just don't want to deal with the burden of that, what we have is something called stake pools. And what a stake pool does is it lets you create this multi signature transaction whereby the pool can cast the vote on your behalf, but not spend your coins. So you could say to the pool, I want to vote yes to this proposal to fund this code being written.
00:33:09.622 - 00:33:40.450, Speaker C: And then when your ticket gets called as part of that normal process over the next four months, that pool will say, oh, this is Laura's ticket. What did she want? Oh, she said she wanted to vote yes for this, and then she'll go ahead and have that vote cast and receive your reward for that, but not necessarily have to have your machine online so the coins will flow back to an address that you provided. The pool never touches your money, but you get to participate in the governance.
00:33:40.950 - 00:34:18.366, Speaker A: And one other thing I wanted to ask about what you said earlier is you mentioned that we talked about how there's 50%, roughly, of Dcred staked at any given time. And then you were saying that the participating, I guess, ticket holders for the big consensus changes are at about 50% overall. That ends up being about 25% of the network. Okay. And then, so if it's a third for the softer proposals done through Politea, then I guess that is what is that? That's like 17% or something?
00:34:18.468 - 00:34:18.926, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:19.028 - 00:34:32.050, Speaker A: Okay. And I guess potentially the remaining half of the network that hasn't staked their Dcred, they're potentially like, using it or trading it or whatever they're doing.
00:34:32.120 - 00:35:07.530, Speaker C: Is that sure, they could have it on exchanges, they could have it on a paper wallet. I mean, it's much like Bitcoin, right? People will store it in all sorts of different ways. Having your decred participate in staking puts it on the machine. Essentially, that needs to be able to be online purchase tickets. For some people, their security model is such that they don't want their coins exposed. That way everything's going to go on a hardware wallet or everything's going to go on a paper wallet. So there are different things we think we can do longer term to kind of accommodate that in terms of security, because we're all security nuts.
00:35:07.530 - 00:35:15.470, Speaker C: We want to make things as secure as possible. But for now, we're pretty pleased with the levels of participation that we're seeing.
00:35:15.620 - 00:35:26.150, Speaker A: And I know that you guys also talk about how Dcred is supposed to be resistant to contentious hard forks. So can you talk a little bit about that, how the design discourages contentious hard forks?
00:35:26.570 - 00:35:55.040, Speaker C: Sure. So basically what we're doing is we're allowing people to devote on these hard fork rules. So imagine we want to increase the block size to two megabytes or what have you. What basically happens is there'd be a multipronged process. First, a developer would know, I'm willing to undertake this. I'm going to write a document out that explains how this is going to work. That'd be a DCP, which is very similar to bitcoin bits, right.
00:35:55.040 - 00:36:26.290, Speaker C: So the decred change proposal would be written describing exactly how this is going to happen. And then they would go put that up on Polite, the off chain voting system. Now, that would be a great signaling mechanism for the community to come in and say, hey, do we want this? Do we not want this? Now, if it can get 60% of the vote on Politea, it's a pass, right. So they could say, hey, I need some money to do this. This is what we want to do. And if that passes, that would then give them the signal to go write this code. Now, when they write that code, what we would do is we would automatically put it into the client.
00:36:26.290 - 00:36:56.894, Speaker C: It wouldn't be active, though. So next time when you upgrade your decred software, you're going to have this new agenda in there, this code that upgrades to two megabyte blocks. And what that does is when we start this voting period, everyone's going to get to see that. And if you're a stakeholder and you have tickets, you're eventually going to be voting on this. Now, when you're voting on this, you're not signaling as you were on Polite that you want this done. You're voting on code that is written. It's in the client, and it's ready to turn on once the vote passes.
00:36:56.894 - 00:37:25.974, Speaker C: If it does, we give it a grace period of 30 days after that, so people have time to upgrade if they're laggards. But that's pretty much how that works. So if 75%, so the bar is higher for consensus changes, 75%. So you have a significant supermajority there. If 75% agree, that new code activates and everyone who's got it in their clients is now using those new rules. Right. Now, in order to protest, you would need to start using older software.
00:37:25.974 - 00:37:59.350, Speaker C: Now, what you're going to find is if you're using that older software, is there's no miners mining those blocks and there's no validators proof of stake. People validating those blocks. Right, because they've all moved on, as we saw with the toy car factory. If we've moved to a different factory and they're producing different things and you're calling for inspectors, no, one's going to show up because they're all gone. So the probability of a minority fork being able to succeed becomes really slim. So we call it minority fork resistant as opposed to fork proof because forking is controlled, but we do it in a way that allows things to happen really smoothly.
00:37:59.850 - 00:38:26.970, Speaker A: Yeah, I found that super interesting when I read about it. I mean, obviously I think it doesn't prevent somebody from just copying the code base and being like I think decred should be designed differently and don't want to go through this whole thing to try to change the network. But in this case, if there's some kind of divisive matter, then yeah, the losing side, it would be much harder for them to take the minority chain and keep that alive.
00:38:27.130 - 00:39:18.250, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head there in terms of that. I mean, we don't mind if people want to take open source code and go do their own things, but what this is really to do is to keep the community together. We always say that you can fork code, but you can't fork a community, right. People are going to choose one side or the other and you can't copy people. And what has a lot of value in decred is the people, the community making all these intelligent decisions and writing all this great code and having a mechanism to stay together. Cohesively because what you find out is that when you have a method of expressing yourself and a fair system to do it, people aren't so angry when things don't go their way because there's a process that they've already bought into. So if I could give an example, like when we wanted to activate the primitives for Lightning network, we had these huge discussions in the community, oh, is lightning good, is lightning bad? Is on chain better than off chain? And people were kind of fighting.
00:39:18.250 - 00:39:35.540, Speaker C: But what we found out is when that people voted on the actual change, that it passed with over 98% support, which basically told us that the loudest people kind of can dominate conversations, but they're not necessarily representative of what the average person wants.
00:39:36.650 - 00:40:30.920, Speaker A: I would love it if we could translate that to our overall online communities and political system because I feel like I see that happen all the time. We're the loudest people don't represent what everybody else wants. But anyway, one other thing that I wanted to reference about some of your earlier remarks was that actually I did have a question where I was going to ask you because I didn't actually fully understand that Politea and the hard fork changes were used in conjunction with each other. And I was thinking, oh my gosh, you have to write the whole code first and then it gets decided on because what if you do all this work and you don't get paid? I was a freelancer for years and years and I was just like, what? But okay, so that answers a big question because otherwise I was like, who in the hell is going to do that?
00:40:32.090 - 00:40:49.100, Speaker C: One of our cornerstones is we don't expect people to work for free. I mean, I'm a volunteer. I've been volunteering full time for like, three years now. Our project lead is a volunteer, but we have 75 people who are paid. We pay them. Half of them are full time, half of them are part time about and we're all about paying people to do good work.
00:40:49.550 - 00:41:19.910, Speaker A: All right, so we have been referring to Politea throughout, but I'm going to ask you a question and I think through this also. If you have anything left about Polite that you want to add, you can do it. But one thing I also wanted to talk about was how the Decred block reward includes well, basically it's split 60% to miners, 30% to stakers, and 10% to the Decred development pool. So if you could just fill listeners in on what that is and maybe even also how it works with Polite, et cetera.
00:41:20.250 - 00:41:48.362, Speaker C: Sure. So this treasury is basically a huge pile of money that's been collecting over the last three years. Last I checked, it was $15 million or more that's piled up of Decred there. And it's constantly being refilled because every block, 10% of that block award is going there. And we're pretty conservative with the spending. So the new stuff that's being produced pretty much covers the monthly burn rate. So this pile of money is there and growing, and it's obviously dependent on the price of the cryptocurrency.
00:41:48.362 - 00:42:33.340, Speaker C: So in the depths of alt winter, as we are now, that's not that high. But if the price goes up, we have more money to work with, so contractors are able to come work for the project and get paid in Dgrid. And that process is organized on this off chain proposal system called Politea, which is where people can make proposals and get paid. And we have multiple ways of doing, you know, regular independent contractors that can come. And you could be like, hey, I'm a dev. I want to start hacking on Decred. And it's a pretty informal process to get someone hired that know, if a couple people who are your peers yeah, you know, Laura's great at writing code.
00:42:33.340 - 00:43:15.114, Speaker C: We've looked at her know, let's start paying her. And that would just be two people who are already contractors would endorse you and you'd start working. But if you want to do something big, you're like, I got my own devs. I want to build a big feature on Decred. You could become a corporate contractor and say, I'm going to build X, Y and Z if you guys want. I need a million dollars to do it over the next six months and propose that on Politea and have a draw schedule and we'd be able to look this over, get it peer reviewed. If there were consensus changes necessary, it would obviously have to have appropriate documents and fight it out and discuss it, whether this is a good price, whether or not we want this feature built, and then we get to vote on that.
00:43:15.114 - 00:43:30.110, Speaker C: And that's really the unique thing about polite is it lets us vote on all these little things that aren't like super important long term. I mean, they're not going to make or break the network like consensus rules will, but it's still important to have finality to be able to make decisions.
00:43:30.690 - 00:43:45.300, Speaker A: Yeah. So decisions. There is a new decision that's been made, which is what we're announcing today, and it's basically about a new privacy feature that you guys are launching. So why don't you tell us about that?
00:43:45.910 - 00:44:20.206, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Yeah, this has been about two years in the making. So, I mean, as you know, Decred is super conservative and has a very iterative approach and we don't like to do something just because it's trendy. We're not trying to win blockchain buzword bingo. But when we think a feature actually is important, we work really hard to bring the best possible option forward. And that's kind of what we've done with privacy. Two years have been spent analyzing everything that's been written on it in terms of academic work and analyzing all the other implementations are out there.
00:44:20.206 - 00:45:13.630, Speaker C: And we've come up with something that's very unique in its approach, which is? Well, the privacy feature is actually based on something called a Dice Mix. So Dice Mix is kind of the follow on to some work that was done by academics. They originally modeled it on working on the Bitcoin system, but it applies very well to Decred for a number of reasons that we can get into. But it's actually really interesting because it's super simple. The math, everything behind it is really straightforward and well understood. It's only a few hundred lines of code that we've written to implement this, so it's going to be easy to audit, low chances of fatal errors. It's kind of a little bit reminiscent of the way Bitcoin is built.
00:45:13.630 - 00:46:00.478, Speaker C: It's all these existing pieces in terms of cryptography and game theory that are just put together in a unique way as opposed to something that's like totally off the wall. It's a creative use of existing technology and then it's also nice and adaptable because there are places we can pivot and go to different places with this to make it better. So the way Dice Mix works is basically it's a mixing process with a server that basically allows people to take coins, send them to these special addresses where they're mixed, and then have clean coins come out. And we can get a little bit into how that works if you like.
00:46:00.564 - 00:46:01.694, Speaker A: Well, can you?
00:46:01.892 - 00:46:45.546, Speaker C: Sure. I'll describe it maybe technically first and then describe it more basically. I'm kind of like a high level guy, so like I'm not really into the super nitty gritty stuff, but I'll do that a little bit. So basically what it's doing is it's just allowing peers to do these mixes together. The server is centralized in terms of you need to talk to that specific server to be able to go into this transaction, but it at no point holds custody of the coins or anything like that. So there's no risk there. So peers are going to subscribe to these sessions that are going to take place, these mixing sessions, and then there's like a specific time window whereby you subscribe.
00:46:45.546 - 00:47:32.550, Speaker C: So let's say every 300 seconds, I believe it is, it's like five minutes, people will be able to say, hey, I want to mix some coins. And what you do is when you do that, you're going to be exchanging some public keys and creating these secret keys. And then peers are going to take these addresses and obfuscate them and then send that to the server. And then the server takes all that data together and solves a bunch of fancy math equations to get these anonymous payout addresses. And then essentially a mixing transaction takes place where there's a huge transaction aggregated, where all the peers verify it and sign that transaction and then everything gets spit out. So that's a really long winded way of saying we take a hat. Like we break down our coins into small denominations.
00:47:32.550 - 00:48:13.930, Speaker C: Like, let's say you have 100 and I have like ten coins. We'll break them down into ones. We'll dump them in the hat, we'll shuffle them up. We'll make sure that we each get back an appropriate amount of coins, verify that in those little lots, agree to that transaction, and then the person controlling that will spit them out. Broadcast that transaction to the network, and we'll have shuffled coins. The way this works really well with decred particularly, which is super interesting, is that originally the idea was based on Bitcoin. But as we talked about, people don't really hold Bitcoins live, right? They put them in paper wallets, they store them offline a lot.
00:48:13.930 - 00:48:53.560, Speaker C: What we have with Dcred is we have this transaction flow from the proof of stake tickets, right? Money is always moving. Tens of thousands of decred every day are flowing back from tickets that have voted and going back into tickets that are being purchased. So what we have is that we can enable people who are purchasing tickets to do so through this system whereby they're providing anonymity for people who want to then go and mix coins. So when you're mixing your coins, let's say that you want to mix, you're going to be mixing them with everyone who's buying tickets and has this enabled. And that has a bunch of really interesting advantages that we can talk about.
00:48:54.250 - 00:49:08.346, Speaker A: Actually, before we get there. I just wanted to understand, you said that the mixing happens via a server, so it sounds centralized. So who's in control of that? And can that be hacked? And can people kind of find out who was using it?
00:49:08.528 - 00:49:31.598, Speaker C: Cool. All good questions. All valid questions. Yeah. So for our first cut, what we've done is we've essentially used a centralized server. Because our view is that if you over optimize this, you're never going to release anything and you're just going to create complexity. So these features were developed in secret because we didn't want someone else scooping us and taking our code off GitHub and doing an ICO, saying, oh, we invented a new privacy coin.
00:49:31.598 - 00:50:03.600, Speaker C: So they were done in secret for the first cut to get this stuff out there. But because the server is just used for coordination, basically it lets you and I talk to each other, but we're basically doing our own thing. It's not a huge risk. Now, you're right that someone could try and censor you by, let's say your ISP blocked access to that server. They didn't let you connect to that IP. You might need to use Tor to get around that. I mean, in theory, the server could be Dos, so it's not a perfect solution yet.
00:50:03.600 - 00:50:25.838, Speaker C: The Iterative approach is that longer term, that server is going to be built into the Dcred daemon so that every single person running Dcrd running their own node is actually going to be able to participate in that transaction, and it'll be fully peer to peer. But for the first cut, we've kept it really simple and made it a centralized server.
00:50:26.014 - 00:50:36.646, Speaker A: And one other thing I wanted to ask about, kind of how you guys were working on this secretly. So did the community not have any input onto this, or did they decide this?
00:50:36.828 - 00:51:01.226, Speaker C: That's a great question. So what happened here is because everything's community driven, right? If this required money and it did, community would have to approve it, right. So it wasn't appropriate to use community money to build something in secret. So two interesting things are Jake and his team. Well, Jake bankrolled this out of his own pocket. He figured this is something that we feel is super necessary. We're all privacy advocates.
00:51:01.226 - 00:51:37.494, Speaker C: We believe that to be a currency, you need fungibility. Right. It doesn't make sense if you go buy a cup of coffee and then I'm able to figure out your net worth based on, hey, that went from that wallet to that wallet, and hey, there's millions of dollars of decredit or bitcoin in that wallet. So for us, it's fundamental to be able to have privacy, and this is something that we thought we're really going to need. So those guys essentially built this for free. And because it doesn't require consensus changes, when people download this, they can download this and start using it right away. At first, it's just going to be CLI.
00:51:37.494 - 00:51:41.798, Speaker C: So it'll be for the nerds like me who'd like running their own CLI tools.
00:51:41.894 - 00:51:43.014, Speaker A: What is CLI?
00:51:43.142 - 00:52:08.210, Speaker C: Oh, command line. So there won't be a pretty interface to it so that people can use it from their mobile wallets and their graphical wallets yet. But we figure that in a few months from now, we'll integrate it into there. So first, again, it's an Iterative approach. We start testing it with all the people who are really hardcore, making sure everything's perfect, and then integrate it into the graphical user interfaces so that people can use it really simply and protect their anonymity.
00:52:08.550 - 00:52:16.920, Speaker A: All right, so now yeah, let's go back. There was a point where you were going to dive into the details on how this works. Why don't we do that now?
00:52:17.790 - 00:53:01.222, Speaker C: Sure. So a basic way to explain how this transaction is happening is a secure sum example. And the way this works is let's say you have three people, alice, Bob and Carol, and they wanted to know together how many coins they have. Right. The total. Now, without revealing to any single party what their total net worth was. Well, what they could each do is then split those coins up into three parts, three unequal parts, give each of the other two counterparties one of those parts, and each person would do the exact same thing.
00:53:01.222 - 00:54:01.106, Speaker C: And what that would do is essentially everyone would be holding a share of their coins and a share of the other two people's coins. And what they could do with that information is add all those numbers up themselves, broadcast that number, and then take those numbers that have been broadcast and add all those numbers up and know what the actual sum of all their stuff is together, without revealing anything to each other about their net worth. Right. That's basically what's happening. And the server is just acting as coordination for creating these transactions, signing them without revealing anything to each other or the server, and then solving this big math puzzle and broadcasting it. And one of the things we think is super important and this is an advantage, so there may be drawbacks to having a centralized server, but there's also a super advantage is that none of this stuff, none of these encrypted bits are hitting the blockchain. So if you look at like a Monero or a Zcash, you have this chain being bloated by all these encrypted transactions.
00:54:01.106 - 00:54:30.660, Speaker C: Right. And you have this danger that if one day someone's able to break this encryption, they'll have the keys to the kingdom, they'll be able to see everything that was sent to everyone. Right. Whereby here, since you're only getting the final transaction of everything being distributed after it's mixed, breaking the security really has no value unless you were capturing somehow, you controlled the server and you were capturing what was happening on there as well. So for us, we see it as very scalable, which is amazing.
00:54:31.030 - 00:54:36.786, Speaker A: So one thing is that for now, all it does is hide who is sending coins to whom.
00:54:36.978 - 00:54:37.526, Speaker C: Correct.
00:54:37.628 - 00:55:03.430, Speaker A: And so transaction amounts are exposed. So obviously, just as would happen in any transaction where you're, for instance, paying in cash, there will be change from those transactions. So how do you handle the change so that people can't kind of work backwards to figure out how much people were spending and who was sending money to whom?
00:55:03.590 - 00:55:25.138, Speaker C: Right? That's a great question, actually. And it's a super problem. So our view is that eventually we'd like to get the transactions being hidden as well. It's on the roadmap. In theory, it's going to require confidential transactions and consensus changes. But for a first cut, again, we're pretty much doing it kind of like the way Monero did it. Monero didn't have this transaction hiding until much later.
00:55:25.138 - 00:55:52.110, Speaker C: So we think the most important part is the sender and the receiver. So when you get that change, it's important that the wallet takes it and puts it into another pile to be remixed in the future. So it's not going to come back to you in a way whereby, oh, I can spend this by mistake, and then link all those transactions together. The change will go back into the mixing wallet and get down mixed in future transactions. So we need to be super careful with the way the change is carried, because you're right, this is a big risk.
00:55:52.690 - 00:56:12.686, Speaker A: And one other feature that Zcash and Monero have is a viewing key, where for auditing purposes, or really any purpose, you can always reveal what happened in that transaction selectively to whoever you'd like. Is there going to be such a thing for your privacy feature?
00:56:12.878 - 00:56:46.110, Speaker C: Well, what's actually cool is we've obviated the need for that viewing key because you're actually having a transparent on chain transaction at the end. So I can show if I need to, hey, look at this transaction. You give me an address and I can show you, oh, all these inputs got sent to this address. So we don't really need to have the ability to de obfuscate a transaction on chain. It's all clear there on chain. And again, what's nice about that is that it leads to a much cleaner chain that can be pruned. Right.
00:56:46.110 - 00:57:10.162, Speaker C: So it's not these blobs of encrypted data that we don't know what they are. We have to basically make everyone download all of them. They can choose what they want to download. So it's an opt in system, and we think that confers a lot of strengths to the system. It's also much less complex. Right. So when you have systems like Zcash or Monero, there's a chance for things like stealth inflation.
00:57:10.162 - 00:57:44.366, Speaker C: But because everything's transparent on the chain, if someone breaks this encryption, they're not able to mint decred secretly. Right. So that's kind of like one of those big concerns that a lot of people have with Zcash in particular. Whereas if they screwed up the trust setup, it's one of those things where it's like we're in cryptocurrency because we don't. Trust anybody. But now you got this big event happening where you have to trust these people that they did things right, and if it got screwed up, someone can secretly create unlimited money for us as a store of value. Protecting those store of value properties are the most important thing.
00:57:44.366 - 00:57:59.122, Speaker C: So we want to make sure that people know. 21 million coins. It's never going to be more than that. And we can prove that on chain. It's all auditable, and that ties back into our proposal system. If we're paying you through the proposal system, we need to be able to audit that. Anyone needs to be able to audit that.
00:57:59.122 - 00:58:08.150, Speaker C: They don't have to have a special view key they can see. This group did this work. The treasury paid them this amount of money, and it was all transparent on chain.
00:58:08.730 - 00:58:31.550, Speaker A: So throughout we've been talking about features that Dcred wants to add to its system. Even just with the privacy feature just announced, obviously you're going to keep flushing that out. And iterating, as you've mentioned, adding privacy and transaction amounts. And it sounds like also at a certain point in the future, will it be less centralized?
00:58:32.370 - 00:58:51.846, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's the goal. The idea is once we have this stuff working, get rid of that centralized server, have it integrated into the daemon and go from there. Have the confidential transactions as well, so that you don't know about the actual number, the transaction size, and then be able to take it to the next step.
00:58:52.028 - 00:59:31.650, Speaker A: Yeah, and this is sort of a theme I noticed in the research, which is that in general, it sounds like kind of an overarching goal that you have is for even the governance mechanisms to also become more decentralized and autonomous. And in some of your materials, you also refer to something called decentralized autonomous entities. So at the moment, you even talked about how just to roll out this feature, there was a centralized aspect where you guys worked in secret. So how do you imagine transitioning to that sort of more decentralized autonomous version of governance? And what does that look like?
00:59:31.800 - 00:59:58.694, Speaker C: Yeah, that's actually a great question. It's something we're struggling with constantly because our view is decentralize all the things. Right. But there's a big difference between saying it and actually doing it because there's technology that doesn't exist yet. Right. So we had to invent Politea to do all these different things off chain because before that, it was just literally like a small core group of people deciding, this is going to get funded, that's going to get funded. We needed a way to be able to pull all the stakeholders and have these binding votes.
00:59:58.694 - 01:00:37.174, Speaker C: And even today, there's still an area that can be improved in that when Politea payments are going out, that's still a centralized process. Someone is taking. A bunch of people are having these multi SIG addresses and signing that transaction and sending them out. So that's not great. I mean, as a stakeholder, I should be part of that process right, of making those payments. And that's actually the next step that you referred to, to have real, decentralized autonomous organization whereby we actually control the money on chain to release these payments after we voted for this or that. And that's actually a really complex problem.
01:00:37.174 - 01:01:11.060, Speaker C: And we had someone who got a proposal passed to start working on that and it's being worked on. And we're hoping that by the end of this year we'll have made significant headway to that there. It's a good problem to have that our decentralized treasury isn't totally decentralized because most projects don't have a treasury at all. But it's still a problem that needs to be addressed because we don't like any single point of failure. So if someone gets hit by a bus, if someone decides they want to rob us or whatnot, that's not good. We literally want to have to trust no one.
01:01:11.430 - 01:01:56.366, Speaker A: It does seem, as we've mentioned, some of these stats, like around 50% of the coins being staked and these high participation rates on some of the votes. It does seem that you guys have a pretty engaged community. And yet at the same time, the number of monthly active addresses has been going down. And then simultaneously, the NVT ratio, which is basically the network value divided by the daily transaction volume, has gone up, which if that goes up, it kind of can indicate something is overvalued, although your network is nowhere near what some of the other coins are at. But anyway, why do you think the monthly active addresses have gone down? And how do you plan to get decred more widely adopted?
01:01:56.558 - 01:02:25.574, Speaker C: Right. That's interesting because one of the things that Dcred does by default is literally uses a new address for everything. So I think these things kind of EB and flow naturally. I wouldn't read too much into the active addresses because again, every time you're buying a ticket, a new address is being generated. Every time you're going to receive coins, a new address is being generated. We're really against address reuse for the privacy reasons behind that. So I think that's just natural fluctuations.
01:02:25.574 - 01:02:59.890, Speaker C: The number that I really focus on more is percentage of coins and stakes as you alluded to. Right. So when that's going up, it means people are engaged. And to your point about overvaluation, it's not something I'd worry too much about. I'm an investor myself, and in the short term, I see these markets as a casino, and in the long term, they're a test of patience, discipline and focus. And we're just at the beginning of really intelligent investors starting to get involved in this space heavily. And I'm very encouraged by what we're seeing around the decred ecosystem.
01:02:59.890 - 01:03:08.940, Speaker C: I mean, decred is essentially ruled by the people that own the coins. And we got some of the smartest people in the space taking interest. So I'm very bullish on the future there.
01:03:09.310 - 01:03:18.620, Speaker A: And for adoption and getting more usage of Decred, how do you or how is the community thinking about how to make that happen?
01:03:20.350 - 01:04:10.070, Speaker C: That's the beautiful thing about the community. There's so many opinions and we can actually take different approaches to it. So my view is I still see Decred as an amazing store of value. The properties that it has, the improvements that it makes to Bitcoin to make it different, not necessarily better, because, again, Bitcoin's got these unique advantages from being the first mover and dominating the most pervasive hashing algorithm out there. But the things that make it a little bit different give us unique security guarantees. So hybrid proof of stake, proof of work that we have makes it so that at 5% of Decreds, of a Bitcoin's hash rate, let's say we get the same level of security. Because not only do you have to be able to control mining to take over Decred, but you need to actually control all these tickets.
01:04:10.070 - 01:05:02.666, Speaker C: So these unique security properties kind of make Decred a natural store value, and a lot of people see it as a hedge to Bitcoin. So if you're going to own a bunch of Bitcoin, you want to address tail risks like, oh my God, what if something goes wrong with Bitcoin, right? It's probably not going to happen, but as any good investor will do, is you're going to try and predict everything that could possibly happen. And we see this store value market as the only area in cryptocurrency that's really well proven as a use case. So there's a lot of cool stuff out there, like various smart contract platforms and whatnot. But the only use case that's really shown real use and picked up momentum over the years, it seems, has been this kind of store of value narrative. And that's the most basic type of smart contract, transferring value from one person to another. So that's kind of like one of my views on it.
01:05:02.666 - 01:05:39.050, Speaker C: And the other is we want people to use it as a currency as well. So we'll do everything possible there. And polite is one of those great things where people can come wallet, developers can come and say, hey, we'd like to integrate Decred into our payment processing product or whatnot, and we need some money to do it. And because we have that money, we can actually bring on new developers to do that work. So it becomes kind of a virtuous, self sustaining cycle of new. People can get paid, can come into this space and have a place where they can work and learn and earn. And what that does is just grow the demand and the use cases for Decred.
01:05:39.470 - 01:05:49.210, Speaker A: All right, well, it's been super fascinating learning about Dcred and hearing about your new privacy feature. Where can people learn more about you and Decred?
01:05:49.870 - 01:05:55.840, Speaker C: They can go to Decred.org. I'm sure they can find me on there, and they'll find all sorts of interesting information about the project for sure.
