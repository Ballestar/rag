00:00:00.410 - 00:00:53.290, Speaker A: Well, I think this is an inflection point. The last number of months, especially in the wake of the collapse of FTX and Celsius and Genesis and Three Arrows Capital and BlockFi and like that whole mess, you know, the attitude in the industry, from my perspective was, hey, this is scary. And regulators are just cracking me in would whip because they don't know what else to do and there isn't necessarily a strong basis to what happens next. Legislation is not coming, this industry is in trouble and today I think, marks an inflection point where in my opinion, that narrative changes and that the rule of law is triumphing and I think it's going to lead to legislation, inflation to actually clarify these things that were uncertain.
