00:00:00.090 - 00:00:33.878, Speaker A: There was a moment when some of these things were getting some traction or people were excited about Synthetics, people were excited about mirror, and they all kind of fizzled out. And it does seem like this is probably the best theory for why, which is that there was nobody on chain who actually wanted to make sound financial decisions. And that basically the part of your portfolio that you were acting like an adult with. You were not bringing on chain, you were keeping that in your brokerage account or whatever. And the stuff you bring on chain, you're like, hey, yo, I'm here to gamble, I'm here to farm, I'm here to do whatever. But I'm not here to buy some Apple stock and hope that the Oracles works.
00:00:34.044 - 00:00:51.200, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I think it's also sort of the same reason why we haven't seen like on chain index funds work. It's like no one's trying to diversify their portfolio on chain. They're trying to go 100 x long. Pepe it is a very different sort of mindset. They diversify with apes and malady. S right.
00:00:51.970 - 00:00:56.270, Speaker A: True. Which actually is where that diversification actually may have worked out.
00:00:56.340 - 00:00:59.130, Speaker B: What is the 60 40 portfolio of NFTs?
