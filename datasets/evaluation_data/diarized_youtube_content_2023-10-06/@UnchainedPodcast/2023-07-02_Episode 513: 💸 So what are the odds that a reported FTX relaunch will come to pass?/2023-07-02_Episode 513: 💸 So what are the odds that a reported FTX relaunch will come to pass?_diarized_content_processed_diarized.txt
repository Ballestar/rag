00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.822, Speaker A: The thing is, we buy claims. So I never want someone to think I'm, like, chilling for my for, like, oh, it's all going to be death and destruction, and so you should sell me the claim for nothing. So it's hard for me to say without someone, so take it with a grain of salt. I think the ODS are pretty low, but look, if somebody comes up with an unreasonable bid, like, hey, I'll pay 250,000,000. Let's relaunch everybody that's a creditor is going to get $0.60 on the dollar, and they're going to get 80% of the new Co Equity, and we're going to get 20% for our $200 million that we pump in. Like? Sure.

I just don't think, looking back at Voyager and looking back at Celsius, what some of the offers were, I just don't think you were going to get there. Why would someone not pay a lot for some of those customers and then pay a lot for FDX? I mean, I guess some people say, oh, FDX is a lot more profitable because it just had a I don't know, like, better customers. And all the offshore derivatives were profitable.
