00:00:53.370 - 00:00:56.110, Speaker A: Welcome, Gil. It's nice to see you back in crypto.
00:00:56.690 - 00:01:07.634, Speaker B: It's great to see you, Laura. We've been talking for many years, and you've done such an amazing job covering the crypto space, and I'm really glad to be back and talking to you about it again.
00:01:07.752 - 00:01:27.250, Speaker A: So for those unfamiliar with Gil, he was the first Wall Street analyst to cover bitcoin in December 2013, and today's topic is going to be the Coinbase upcoming stock listing. However, I think people probably would be interested in a bit of your background. So can you tell us about your previous coverage of bitcoin?
00:01:27.410 - 00:01:58.030, Speaker B: Sure. So I was a Wall Street analyst covering payments companies, PayPal, Square, Visa, those kinds of companies. And in 2013, when I encountered Bitcoin, I just lit up. I read the white paper, I talked to people, and I realized that this has a lot to do with where we're headed in the future. Such an interesting topic. So cross disciplinary economics and finance and culture and mathematics, computer science. So I really got engaged.
00:01:58.030 - 00:02:50.450, Speaker B: Published that very first Wall Street report about bitcoin in 2013. Later on, opened the very first institutional account on Coinbase. Was the first at the time, I was at the first firm that accepted bitcoin for research, then picked up GBTC so I could have a price target on bitcoin, so I could have a fundamental analysis based price target on bitcoin. Had a blast doing all that, fortunately. Unfortunately was promoted to head up the research department, at which point I stopped publishing research exactly four years ago. And I've been mostly focused internally on helping other analysts with their research. But when the Coinbase IPO got closer, I just decided I had to participate in this moment.
00:02:50.450 - 00:03:02.310, Speaker B: It's such an important moment for crypto, for financial services, for this community, that I dove back in and initiated coverage of Coinbase ahead of its direct listing.
00:03:02.650 - 00:03:10.460, Speaker A: And so your research note on Coinbase is titled introducing Crypto's Amazon Moment. What do you mean by that?
00:03:11.710 - 00:03:51.350, Speaker B: In May of 1997, Amazon went public. Up until then, the Internet was an interesting thing that people toyed with, used, were trying to figure out once Amazon went public, everybody realized this is going to be a huge business and it's going to impact every other business. That was the real milestone and inflection point. And it feels like the Coinbase listing is going to have the same effect. Obviously, crypto is already huge. It's a trillion dollar asset class, so much interest in it. But it's almost gone on a parallel path to traditional finance.
00:03:51.350 - 00:04:13.520, Speaker B: When Coinbase becomes public and trades at $50 billion or more, those worlds will come together and the traditional world of finance and crypto going forward will be intertwined as a huge business in crypto becomes a publicly traded security.
00:04:13.970 - 00:04:22.030, Speaker A: And you gave Coinbase, which will be listed under the ticker Coin on Nasdaq, a buy rating. What factors led you to that rating?
00:04:22.530 - 00:04:58.182, Speaker B: Well, we have partial information. This was the first iteration of the S One. The company isn't listed, they haven't disclosed all the financials, they haven't provided forward guidance. So we took what we had, which is to say they're at least on track to generating 2 billion of revenue this year, likely higher, but we don't know that yet. And given multiples that other high growth, standard bearer type technology companies are getting, it's pretty easy to justify 20 times revenue. So that's where we started off. Private market transactions may be at lower or higher prices.
00:04:58.182 - 00:05:12.670, Speaker B: Those will matter a lot less until we actually get the listing, at which point we'll also have better information about current period results, forecasts, guidance from the management team, and we'll be able to use that to reevaluate that price target.
00:05:13.330 - 00:05:29.430, Speaker A: And so at this moment, you were able to look at partial numbers from Coinbase, but I'm sure you also have a sense of where Coinbase kind of sits amongst its competitors. Who would you consider Coinbase's main competitors and what factors would you say separate it from the competition?
00:05:30.090 - 00:06:16.194, Speaker B: Well, I'd say grayscale. Michael Zanenshein business within Barry Silbert's DCG is probably the most important competitor and comparable because they are also now gaining from the institutional move to crypto. They're also a very well managed firm that was there at the beginning has grown gradually and wisely and thoughtfully. So I'd call them the closest competitor. Then you have the pure play cryptos that are regulated like Kraken and Gemini, that are also very interesting, relevant. And on the traditional side, you have the digital wallets that are really competing for crypto usage. And first and foremost, square.
00:06:16.194 - 00:06:29.180, Speaker B: They were early, then PayPal, now Robinhood, those are to me the real key competitors to Coinbase from the more traditional digital wallet side, and on the other side, the Pure Play crypto side.
00:06:29.710 - 00:06:36.650, Speaker A: And so when you look at Coinbase in comparison to those, what would you say distinguishes it from its competitors?
00:06:37.070 - 00:07:19.894, Speaker B: Well, Coinbase, when I say gold standard, I mean the following from day one, from when I opened the wallet in 2013, the user experience was terrific. I felt secure and I was very well aware of how much they had spent on compliance because again, I was coming at it as an analyst testing a technology, and I was so impressed. Their app worked better than PayPal's app. I think it still hired. One of their very first hires was a very high profile compliance person. They understood that was key. They invested a lot in security and safety.
00:07:19.894 - 00:07:59.274, Speaker B: They understood that was important. It was a well funded, well thought out, well led startup at the time, and they've continued to develop from there. And it's not a coincidence that today they're well respected by the traditional financial community as well as within the crypto community. Not everybody in the crypto community loves them because of what they represent and how intertwined they are in the traditional world of finance. But everybody respects them, and that's their lead. That's their lead to lose. And especially as you get institutional money in institutions already see this as a very risky endeavor.
00:07:59.274 - 00:08:12.890, Speaker B: They want to go to the gold standard. They're going to feel comfortable. The company that's been around that's done a good job with security, that has good user experience. And again, to me, between Coinbase and Grayscale, that's a lot of where this is headed.
00:08:13.550 - 00:08:38.740, Speaker A: And so, as I'm sure you're well aware, in the crypto community, there's a lot made of this so called Fat protocol thesis, which hypothesize that an investment in the crypto assets themselves would be more productive than an investment in the applications on top. But I was curious, how would you say an investment in Coinbase stock would compare to an investment in crypto assets themselves?
00:08:39.910 - 00:09:09.706, Speaker B: Well, if you're investing in crypto assets, you have to decide who the winners are, which is really hard. I think we know how well Bitcoin is doing. We think we're all very excited about the developments on Ethereum. There's so many other tools now. There's DeFi tokens. You have to do a lot of work to figure out who's going to win. Again, I come from the digital world of finance where we do an unbelievable amount of work to figure out if stocks are going to go up or down.
00:09:09.706 - 00:09:57.980, Speaker B: It's even harder for crypto assets and tokens. And so if you're going to invest in crypto assets token, you have to do a lot of work to get that right. If you invest in Coinbase, what you're getting is you're letting them figure it out and not in a portfolio way of, oh, I'll just buy a little bit of everything. Coinbase will be trading tokens regardless of who wins. It could be a different token or crypto asset that does better. They're going to be trading them anyway, and they're going to be taking the commission into the fees anyway. And that's what makes it interesting as a public company investment, is they're going to win regardless of which crypto asset is the best one, or does the best, where if you're investing directly in the crypto assets, you actually have to figure out who's going to win.
00:09:58.830 - 00:10:17.714, Speaker A: So in a moment, we're going to discuss the Coinbase stock price. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com is giving away four Teslas. To enter the lucky draw, download the Crypto.com app and buy at least $100 of Bitcoin before March. Eigth new Crypto.com

More details can be found in the show. Notes back to my conversation with Gil Lauria. You gave Coin a price target of $195. How did you reach that number?
00:10:46.510 - 00:11:39.818, Speaker B: To me, there's a category of stocks it's thin air, but there's a category of stocks that are gold standard market leading in an open ended growth category. So it's companies like Zoom, Snowflake, Tesla, CrowdStrike, okta, these are companies that teladoc, that have a huge category that's growing very rapidly and could grow for a long time and are the market leaders in that category by being the gold standard, the standard bear in that category. That's where these guys belong. Now, valuation wise, that could take you anywhere from ten times the revenue to 70 times revenue. Because the information on Coinbase is still partial. We're still piecing it together. I used 20 times revenue as a starting point.
00:11:39.818 - 00:12:00.660, Speaker B: But again, as we get more information, as we get a better sense for the revenue, we could revisit that and see if they could justify a higher or lower type of multiple. And again, on what revenue base? I've extrapolated from 2020 results into 2021, but it's just my extrapolation. The company isn't quite period. They're not giving guidance yet.
00:12:01.670 - 00:12:13.270, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I was going to ask next about that extrapolation. Can you give us some insight into how you made this projection that by year's end at least they would bring in $2 billion in revenue?
00:12:14.330 - 00:13:04.422, Speaker B: Yeah, I used what I would consider conservative assumptions. I assume this quarter, the March quarter that we're in, is going to be even better than the December quarter, just based on what crypto assets have done, the level of activity, et cetera. But then I assumed for my calculations, because there's no guidance and we're still here in March, that it actually goes back down to lower levels of activity for the rest of the year. And even based on that, I get them growing from a little over 1.2 billion of revenue in $2020 to $2 billion of revenue in 2021. If this level of crypto asset prices continues through the rest of the year, if this level of activity and volatility continues through the rest of the year, they could achieve a much higher level of revenue than that.
00:13:04.556 - 00:13:20.540, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely want to emphasize that it does seem that you went the conservative route because I'm sure you're well aware that Coinbase shares have recently been reported to be trading at $373 on Nasdaq private market. So I wondered what you thought of that.
00:13:21.150 - 00:14:12.074, Speaker B: What we've learned in similar situations ahead of IPOs, of Square's IPO, Facebook's IPO, that these private company transactions are interesting. They're indicative of where some of the price discovery is. But you really have to get the stock listed before you know where people are willing to pay. You really have to put it in the marketplace with all the supply and demand to get a better sense for what the price is. So it's an indication of where the price could go on that first day. But realistically speaking, the last real price we have is from the raise they did in 2018, which actually puts them at only $39 a share. There's no doubt that they will list at a much higher price than that, but until they list, we have to go with that in order to anchor the current market price.
00:14:12.074 - 00:14:19.070, Speaker B: But we won't have to wait for long. I would expect within the next one to five weeks for the listing to occur.
00:14:19.410 - 00:14:24.930, Speaker A: And what did you make of the fact that 96% of Coinbase's revenue comes from transaction fees?
00:14:25.910 - 00:15:15.614, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean that's the business, that's the business they've always had. I think what's interesting is that the subscription type businesses they're getting into are growing even faster. And that's really going to be very important for Coinbase. For their revenue to be more recurring, for their stock to get valued based on a recurring level of revenue as opposed to the ups and downs of crypto asset prices and crypto volatility, they're going to have to grow that line much faster. So there's things in there like custody for institutional accounts. I would expect that line to grow very quickly because again, the level of institutional activity on Coinbase is now far outstripping the level of consumer activity. And those institutions are not going to be bothered with private keys.
00:15:15.614 - 00:15:42.810, Speaker B: They're going to pay somebody to custody their assets. The other interesting one that I found is staking. If we do move more to proof of stake from proof of work, again, institutions are not going to want to manage their own staking. Enthusiasts will. True crypto believers and participants will. Institutions will not. They're going to want to pay somebody to manage their staking.
00:15:42.810 - 00:15:48.060, Speaker B: And Coinbase is particularly well positioned to do that for those.
00:15:50.430 - 00:16:00.480, Speaker A: So talk a little bit more about this trend that we've seen where we're seeing more institutional trading volume on Coinbase and less retail. How much bigger do you think it could get?
00:16:01.330 - 00:16:38.762, Speaker B: Oh, much bigger. It could operative word could get much bigger. We're hearing very large asset managers talking about what percent allocation they need to put into crypto assets. If they all just put a percent of their allocation into crypto assets, obviously we're talking about an unbelievable influx of capital. We don't know that that's going to happen. Crypto assets could roll over again, and we could get into another quiet period like we had between 2014 and 16, like we had last year. Those things could happen.
00:16:38.762 - 00:17:19.510, Speaker B: But if institutions see this as an asset class, that they need to have exposure. Right now, most institutional capital thinks of the world as real estate, stocks and bonds, maybe some commodity. Increasingly, they all realize they've missed the boat on that run from $0 to a trillion dollars of asset class over the last ten years. And they don't want to miss the move from a trillion dollars and up. And so they understand they need a certain allocation. To the extent this happens broadly, that's a tremendous influx in capital, and that could be the next wave of growth for crypto assets.
00:17:20.170 - 00:17:25.930, Speaker A: All right, so then what would be your expectation of what would happen to the price of Coin on the day of their direct listing?
00:17:27.310 - 00:17:55.066, Speaker B: It's so hard to tell. It's so hard to tell. What I can tell you is that it's going to be interesting, volatile, exciting. I think the last comparable event is Facebook's IPO. If you remember how that transpired with very high expectations and then some, then you know, Facebook has obviously done tremendously well since then. We may get all that wrapped up in one day. There's going to be a lot of activity.
00:17:55.066 - 00:18:09.910, Speaker B: There's a tremendous amount of enthusiasm. Again. Everybody Loves Coinbase. Everybody respects coinbase. Not everybody loves Coinbase. Everybody respects Coinbase, thinks very highly of them. We're going to see that come to the market when they list.
00:18:09.910 - 00:18:20.518, Speaker B: And so I would expect there to be a lot of activity. And again, I expect the stock to do well in its first day or days when it becomes listed.
00:18:20.694 - 00:18:40.820, Speaker A: And so, while I have your attention, I couldn't help but want to ask you a little bit about GBTC to hearken back to your previous days. Did you notice that as of last week, GBTC no longer is trading at a premium and instead the price actually has fallen below the price of bitcoin? Do you have any theories as to why?
00:18:42.230 - 00:19:13.822, Speaker B: It is very interesting. I always assume that when ETFs come to market that that premium would be reduced. It may be an indication that people believe the ETFs are close. I can tell you ETFs have been close to the market since 2013. I remember reading Diligently, the Geminis one, in 2013, where they were trying to generate to get an ETF into market. And here we are, it's 2021. We do not have an ETF yet.
00:19:13.822 - 00:20:05.280, Speaker B: So whenever the premium in GBTC goes down, I imagine that has a lot to do with the expectation for an ETF, which obviously trades at the value of the assets, and there wouldn't be a premium there. It could also be related to the Coinbase IPO. If people are trying to free up funds in order to buy coinbase and think that that's a different use of that capital that influences GPTC. But again, GPTC is just one aspect and one particular security that was very well timed and has served us very well in the market for the duration of its existence. What form it'll take going forward. If there's ETFs, we'll find out. It doesn't really take away from what Grayscale is doing on a bigger scale, which is gathering assets in the trust.
00:20:05.650 - 00:20:13.840, Speaker A: And so what about you going forward? Can we expect to see more from you on crypto? Whether it's bitcoin or coinbase or whatever it might be?
00:20:14.770 - 00:20:31.574, Speaker B: I'd like to stay involved. To the extent that the community wants to talk to me, that folks on Wall Street want to get my opinion, I'm happy to stay involved. It was hard staying away for the last four years. I'm glad to be back and I hope to stay involved going forward.
00:20:31.772 - 00:20:47.180, Speaker A: Great. Well, it's been so great talking to you again. I really was shocked. I remember when you wrote me and you said you were not going to be covering it anymore. I was like, what? So welcome back and I look forward to talking to you more in the future.
00:20:47.630 - 00:20:50.694, Speaker B: Great to see you, Laura. Great talking to you. Thanks for having me on.
00:20:50.832 - 00:21:47.790, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap.

He lists three main ways NFTs can change creator economics one, the removal of middlemen two, the transformation of customers to owners and three, the allowance for what he calls granular price tiering, which is like how Kickstarters enable creators to make more money from especially enthusiastic supporters than they can from the everyday fan. If you're interested in more of the A 16 Z crypto investment thesis around NFTs, you can hear A 16 Z general partner Katie Hahn discussing NFTs eloquently on a recent Tim Ferriss podcast. James Beck, director of communications and content at Consensus, penned a long blog post this week lauding NFTs for providing a challenge to what Internet ownership is and might be.
