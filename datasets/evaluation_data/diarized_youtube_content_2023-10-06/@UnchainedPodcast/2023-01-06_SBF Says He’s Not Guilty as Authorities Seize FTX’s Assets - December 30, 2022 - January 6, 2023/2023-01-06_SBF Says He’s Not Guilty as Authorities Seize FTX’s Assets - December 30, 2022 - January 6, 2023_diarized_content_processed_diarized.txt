Federal prosecutor Danielle Sassoon told the court that Bankman Fried had worked with foreign regulators to transfer assets that FTX's U. S. Management had been attempting to seize. As the process plays out, SPF is not gaining more allies. Reuters reported that Daniel Friedberg, FTX's former chief regulatory officer, provided information to US. Prosecutors, the FBI, the Southern District of New York court and the SEC about the activities of FTX and its sister trading firm, Alameda Research Bankman.
00:01:21.874 - 00:02:06.858, Speaker A: Fried, who was released on a $250,000,000 bail bond, will remain under house arrest at his parents home in California. However, his bail conditions have been amended to prohibit him from accessing or transferring any FTX or Alameda associated assets. Notably, though, twelve SPF linked wallets transferred $144,000 worth of assets to different destinations, which included transactions on January 2 and January 3, raising suspicions from industry watchers, regulators in the US. Seized FTX's stake in Robinhood. The US. Government seized 56 million Robinhood shares worth about $450,000,000 from FTX. The shares ownership is being disputed by FTX Blockfly and Creditor.
00:02:06.858 - 00:02:46.654, Speaker A: Jonathan Ben Shimon. The Department of justice believes these assets are not part of the bankruptcy estate and may be subject to forfeiture proceedings. The DOJ is also trying to seize FTX assets held in accounts at Silvergate Bank. Speaking of the crypto friendly bank, the Wall Street Journal reported that during their recent market downturn, Silvergate was forced to sell assets at a loss in order to meet $8.1 billion in withdrawal requests. The bank also reduced its staff by 40%. An affidavit signed by Bankman, freed in an Antika court in December revealed that he used funds borrowed from Alameda Research to purchase more than 7% of Robin Hood's stock.
00:02:46.654 - 00:04:01.226, Speaker A: Additionally, the Southern District of New York created an FTX task force to trace and recover lost funds belonging to customers of the collapsed exchange. As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the debtors of FTX will request the return of seized assets worth $296,000,000 from the Bahamas Monetary Authority.

The suit alleges that the fraud occurred between 2018 and June 2022, when the exchange froze withdrawals. The Attorney General is seeking to find Machinsky, impose monetary damages and bar him from working in the securities industry or leading a company in New York. Moreover, bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn ruled that the tokens deposited in Celsius's interest bearing accounts belong to the company.
00:04:01.226 - 00:04:59.350, Speaker A: This means that Celsius can use its $4.2 billion in crypto assets as it sees fit. The decision affects 600,000 holders of high interest accounts at Celsius who are now considered unsecured creditors. The ruling could also settle a key legal issue in the insolvency cases of Celsius and other companies that went bankrupt last year, including FTX and BlockFi, since it determines the ownership rights of crypto assets at digital exchanges, trading firms and other platforms. Many customers had argued that their crypto assets were not the property of the Celsius bankruptcy estate, but the firm argued that its terms of use granted ownership rights to Celsius. Judge Glenn mentioned that he has not yet made a decision regarding the legal ownership of approximately $700 million worth of cryptocurrency assets used as collateral for fiat loans to individual customers.

He also alleged that DCG used tactics similar to FTX, misleading investors and attacking Three AC while avoiding questions about its own financial standing. It looks like Zhu's usage of Twitter backfired on him and his cofounder Kyle Davies, following unsuccessful efforts to contact them.
00:05:39.130 - 00:06:35.660, Speaker A: Liquidators ultimately served the Three AC founders subpoenas in a tweet tagging their frequently used Twitter accounts.

Stefan Uye, CEO at Front Financial, told the bloc There is a view that, okay, the regulators have made their point and they will leave Coinbase alone for now.
00:06:35.660 - 00:07:43.210, Speaker A: Binance US's deal to acquire Voyager's assets is questioned by the SEC the US securities and Exchange commission filed a limited objection to Binance US's proposed $1 billion acquisition of Voyager Digital.

In response, Celsius agreed to have all of its mining rigs shut down, but insisted that the 37,000 affected rigs were its property. That should not be considered part of the bankruptcy estate. As Bitcoin miners keep struggling, Marathon decided to deleverage and finish 2022 with $103.7 million in unrestricted cash after paying off all of its revolver borrowings in December.
