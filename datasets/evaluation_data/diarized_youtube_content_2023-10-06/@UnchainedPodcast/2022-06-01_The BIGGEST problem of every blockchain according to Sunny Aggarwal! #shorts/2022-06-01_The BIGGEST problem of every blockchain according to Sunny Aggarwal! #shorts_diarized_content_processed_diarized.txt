00:00:00.330 - 00:00:37.510, Speaker A: One of the biggest issues I've had with every blockchain up until today is how you have to pay fees in the native token of that chain. And I always thought this was just, like, terrible. UX. A couple of years ago, I was showing one of my friends how to use Dai for payments. And this is back when ETH gas costs were reasonable and we could foreseeably use Dai as payments. But what I did was I made him open a wallet and stuff and I sent him some dai, and I'm like, Cool, try sending it back to me. And then he tries sending it back, and it's like, it's not working.
00:00:37.510 - 00:00:45.842, Speaker A: And it's like, Wait, what's wrong? And it's like, oh, you don't have ETH for the transaction fee. And it's like this is a very silly UX.
