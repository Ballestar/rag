00:00:00.250 - 00:00:50.246, Speaker A: You. Thanks for tuning in to this week's News recap. Blockfly has a $1.2 Billion Exposure to FTX and Alameda Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi accidentally revealed financial documents that showed it had over $1.2 billion worth of assets tied to the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its sister company, Alameda. The extent of Blockfly's exposure to the change was not previously known, as the financials had been censored as of January 14, the documents show that Blockfly assets connected to FTX are worth almost $416,000,000, while loans to Alameda amount to about $831,000,000. This is significantly higher than the previously reported figures of $355,000,000 in assets on FTX and a $671,000,000 loan to Alameda.
00:00:50.246 - 00:01:37.318, Speaker A: The document also reveals that Blockfly's 125 active employees are being paid generously, with a combined compensation of $11.9 million a year. Bloomberg reported that Blockfly is selling off $160,000,000 in loans backed by about 68,000 bitcoin mining machines as part of the company's bankruptcy proceedings. Some of these loans have already defaulted and may be under collateralized. Given the decline in the price of bitcoin mining equipment, the entities bidding for the debts will likely be debt collection businesses buying for cents on the dollar. US seizes $700 million of FTX assets. US? Authorities have taken possession of $700 million worth of assets linked to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman Fried.
00:01:37.318 - 00:02:33.418, Speaker A: According to a report from CoinDesk, the government is seeking the forfeiture of these assets on the grounds that they are not the property of the bankruptcy of State. The assets in question include $525,000,000 worth of Robinhood shares, which Bankman Freed purchased with money borrowed from Alameda Research, and $171,000,000 in cash from bank accounts tied to FTX related entities. The government seized these assets and more in early January and is now seeking their forfeiture. Furthermore, the DOJ seized $50 million in assets linked to Bankman Freed. This sum was held in Farmington State Bank, a small, one branch institution based in Washington that primarily focused on providing agricultural loans to farmers. The bank had a mere three employees at the time of Bankman Freed's account creation and had been serving the local community for over a century. Additionally, on Wednesday, FTX's long awaited creditor list was revealed, albeit with millions of customer names redacted.
00:02:33.418 - 00:03:24.542, Speaker A: It turns out the bankrupt exchange owes money to a wide range of companies and individuals. Tech companies include Apple, Netflix, Meta and Amazon web services and crypto firms such as Chainalysis Coinbase, Ugalevs and Binance Capital Management are all owed money. Publications include the Wall Street Journal, CoinDesk and Benzinga. And athletes like Tom Brady and David Ortiz were also on the list, as was Supermodel Giselle Bunchon. Sam Bankman Fried invested $400 million into Modulo Capital. According to the New York Times, modulo Capital, an obscure crypto trading firm, received $400 million from Bankman Freed prior to the FTX collapse in November. The firm was founded in March 2022 and received one of SBF's largest investments, drawing the attention of investigators the transactions took place in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.
00:03:24.542 - 00:04:08.922, Speaker A: The founders of Medulla Capital reportedly had close ties to SBF. One of them, Xiaoyan Lily Zhang, had previously allegedly been romantically involved with bankman freed. Medullo is now a key focus of the investigation by federal prosecutors into bankman freed and the exchange. Genesis Says It May Resolve the Bankruptcy Soon Crypto lender Genesis Global Capital expressed confidence that it will be able to resolve its disputes with creditors this week with a goal of emerging from Chapter Eleven bankruptcy by the end of May, according to Reuters. During a hearing in Manhattan, Genesis lawyer Sean O'Neill said Sitting here right now, I don't think we're going to need a mediator. I'm very much an optimist. Brian Rosen, a lawyer for creditors who are owed $1.5
00:04:08.922 - 00:04:52.054, Speaker A: billion in claims, agreed we are getting closer. The company filed for bankruptcy protection on January 21, two months after it halted withdrawals and new originations. The company listed just over $5 billion in assets and liabilities in its bankruptcy filing and said that it owed more than 100,000 creditors at least $3.4 billion. Gemini Lays Off More Employees Gemini, the crypto exchange battling Genesis, laid off 10% of its staff, according to an internal memo seen by the information. This is the third round of cuts at the company in the past eight months. The cofounder of Gemini, Cameron Winklevoss, informed the staff known as astronauts about the layoffs via a message on Slack.
00:04:52.054 - 00:05:18.142, Speaker A: He stated that the persistent negative macroeconomic conditions and unprecedented fraud in the industry left the company with no other choice. Gemini employees are not the only ones affected by Genesis's fallout. Luno, a digital currency group, owned a crypto exchange, also laid off 35% of its workforce. Bitcoin. Jesus gets sued. Genesis is suing Roger Vere for $20.9 million in damages.
00:05:18.142 - 00:05:59.838, Speaker A: Vera, the CEO of Bitcoin.com, has also been long known as Bitcoin Jesus. The lender claims Veer failed to settle crypto options transactions before the expiry date. This is not the first lawsuit against Veer, as CoinFLEX, a crypto exchange, also filed a lawsuit against him in July for failing to repay the debt on his margin position. In a reddit post, Veer stated that he has enough money to pay the debt, but that he does not feel obligated to do so. Celsius Plans to Issue a Token to Repay Creditors Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius is planning to pay back creditors by issuing a new token, according to a recent report from Bloomberg. The attorney for Celsius, Ross M.
00:05:59.838 - 00:07:14.018, Speaker A: Questeniat, informed a bankruptcy court that the new token would be part of a payout plan from a reorganized company that is properly licensed. However, this plan needs to be approved by a creditor committee before it can move forward. According to CoinDesk, the proposed token is called asset share token. Creditors who are owed an amount of crypto above a certain threshold would receive AST, which they can either retain for potential dividends or sell on the marketplace, the platform's remaining customers would be given a one time distribution of liquid crypto assets. The lawyers for Celsius also stressed that despite the recent ruling that assets in Celsius's earn program are the property of the exchange's estate and not of customers, earn customers would be treated like everyone else in the eventual recovery of assets. Additionally, the mining division of Celsius plans to temporarily house 20,000 rigs that it is currently retrieving from Core Scientific, which could put the troubled firm founded by Alex Machinsky in a better position. Finance makes a Mistake in its Accounting Finance, the world's largest crypto exchange, acknowledged that it made a mistake in storing token reserves and customer funds in the same wallet.
00:07:14.018 - 00:08:17.434, Speaker A: As per a Bloomberg report, the reserves for nearly half of the 94 tokens issued by Binance, known as B tokens, were stored in a single wallet called Binance Eight. According to the exchange's website, this wallet contains more assets in reserve than are required as collateral for the issued B tokens, indicating that it also contains user assets. Binance issues its own version of ETH USDC and USDT to be used on the BNB chain, which are supposed to be backed by one to one reserves of the currencies they are based on. However, mixing of B token collateral with customer assets is against Binance's own guidelines. Earlier this week, Binance also announced that its swift banking partner, Signature Bank, will no longer support transactions under $100,000 in value. This change comes into effect on February 1 and will not affect credit and debit card purchases of cryptocurrencies or payments to and from third party exchanges. Signature bank is imposing this new transaction threshold to reduce its exposure to the digital asset market.
00:08:17.434 - 00:09:04.374, Speaker A: Meanwhile, Binance is on the hunt for a new Swift partner to help facilitate its US. Dollar transactions. Shanghai upgrade is closer Ethereum Core Developers announced the successful deployment of a Shadow Fork, which supports staked ETH withdrawals, as a test for the network's upcoming Shanghai upgrade. The shadow fork went live on Monday, and developers plan to test the upgrade's resilience by deploying evil nodes on both the execution layer and consensus layer. The final version of the Shanghai upgrade is set to go live on the Ethereum main net in March. It will also allow Validators to withdraw the $26 billion worth of Ether that sits in the deposit contract. Additionally, the team at Liquid Staking Derivatives Protocol Lido proposed a plan to support staked Ether withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade is activated.
00:09:04.374 - 00:10:02.970, Speaker A: The process will be asynchronous and will have two modes a turbo mode to unstake requests quickly and a bunker mode as an emergency plan, which will be activated under mass slashing conditions. Moreover, Decentralized Autonomous Organization Index Co op launched a new structured product that will give investors exposure to the ETH liquid staking derivatives market. Wormhole hacker levers up on Staked Ether as Shanghai comes closer, the crypto community is getting excited about the potential for staked ETH withdrawals. However, it seems that the hackers are also interested in this new development. Blockchain security firm Certic reported that the wallet address associated with the wormhole hack, which occurred in February 2022, moved $155,000,000 of ethereum this week. The funds were moved to the OpenOcean Decentralized Exchange and then converted into Lido finance's staked ether and also wrapped staked ETH. The hacker then used the Steeth as collateral to borrow, stablecoins and repeat the process.
00:10:02.970 - 00:10:47.402, Speaker A: This was the largest movement of these stolen funds in recent months. Speaking of exploits, the FBI announced that the Lazarus Group, a cybercrime organization sponsored by the North Korean government, is responsible for the theft of $100 million in crypto from Harmony's Horizon Bridge in June last year. The Lazarus Group has a history of orchestrating cyberattacks and is considered one of the most dangerous organizations in the world. Time for fun bits. Eric Wall Immortalizes His Enemies Have you ever heard of the saying keep your friends close, but your enemies closer? Well, one crypto enthusiast has been taking that phrase to a whole new level. Eric Wall, one of the best writers and analysts in the industry, is not only keeping his adversaries close, but is also etching their faces onto tungsten cubes. That's right.
00:10:47.402 - 00:11:17.278, Speaker A: Eric is building a collection of cubes made of the extremely dense tungsten metal, each engraved with the face of a defeated crypto enemy. But why tungsten, you may ask? Well, it's said to be virtually indestructible and extremely resistant to scratches. Kind of like Eric's arguments. As for why he's doing this, who knows? Maybe it's just his way of saying, don't mess with me. Or perhaps it's simply a reminder of his past victories. Thanks so much for joining us today.
