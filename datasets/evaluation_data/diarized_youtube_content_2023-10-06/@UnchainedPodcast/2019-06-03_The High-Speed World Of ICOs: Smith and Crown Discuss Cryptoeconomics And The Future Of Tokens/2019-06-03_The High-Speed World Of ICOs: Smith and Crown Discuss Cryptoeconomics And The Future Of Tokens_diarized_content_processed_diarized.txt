But that also gave me the perfect opportunity to talk with ICO sites Smith and Crown because they are based here. So today on the show I've got CEO Brian Leo and head of research Matt Sharut. Brian and Matt, welcome to the show.
00:01:13.880 - 00:01:15.794, Speaker B: Thanks for you, great to be here.
00:01:15.912 - 00:01:19.574, Speaker A: So let's talk first about what it is that you guys do.
00:01:19.772 - 00:01:23.318, Speaker B: Sure, I'm happy to give an overview there.
00:01:23.404 - 00:01:25.686, Speaker A: And just to be clear, this is Brian talking?
00:01:25.788 - 00:01:52.222, Speaker B: Yes, this is Brian. So Smith and Crown first and foremost is a research group. We've been around for over four years at this point and we study the breadth of the blockchain space. Right now a lot of our research is focused on new assets that are coming online and part of that is understanding how they issue tokens and waiting deep into the world of token sales and ICOs, as it were.
00:01:52.356 - 00:01:54.770, Speaker A: I had no idea you had been around for four years.
00:01:54.920 - 00:01:57.346, Speaker B: Yes, we've actually been around for quite some time.
00:01:57.528 - 00:01:58.722, Speaker A: How did it start?
00:01:58.856 - 00:02:51.778, Speaker B: So this was one of those things where I have another company that is a design and strategy group out of New York and one day came across bitcoin as many of us had and realized that this was something that was going to be what I worked on for the foreseeable future and got so excited about. It started to put together a team slowly over the last few years and we spent a lot of time looking at where it was that we could really make an impact in the space. We were super passionate about it and we wanted to figure out where our unique set of experiences and talents could do the most good and make the largest impact. So over time we built a team, we refined our vision and then we started to publicly publish research just over two years ago or so.
00:02:51.944 - 00:02:55.870, Speaker A: Okay, and Matt, how did you get involved with Smith and Crown?
00:02:56.030 - 00:03:30.026, Speaker C: Brian and I have known each other since 8th grade and this is our second startup together. Second company. So at some point Brian pitched me on joining to help with their research efforts and a lot of the content development, applying new analytical methodologies to the crypto financial space. And I was a little skeptical. First. He was earlier to the crypto and bitcoin scene than I was, but the more and more I started reading about it, the more and more I got really excited about it. And so I started shifting more and more of my attention to working on this, to learning and to understanding what Smith and Crown's role in this emerging.
00:03:30.058 - 00:03:35.380, Speaker A: Industry would and see. This was your second startup together. What was your first?
00:03:37.430 - 00:03:45.618, Speaker B: So we actually worked on a documentary travel series together a number of years ago called Jets Zero.
00:03:45.704 - 00:03:46.434, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:03:46.552 - 00:03:48.338, Speaker C: Very early days of web TV.
00:03:48.434 - 00:03:50.502, Speaker A: Did you travel around? Where did you guys go?
00:03:50.636 - 00:04:02.470, Speaker B: We went all around the world. We actually started in Seattle and then we traveled to Vietnam, japan, South Korea and Turkey.
00:04:02.630 - 00:04:03.466, Speaker A: Oh, nice.
00:04:03.568 - 00:04:04.026, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:04.128 - 00:04:05.226, Speaker A: Wow, that sounds amazing.
00:04:05.328 - 00:04:09.466, Speaker B: It was. It was quite an experience. It was successful. That's laughing for its own right?
00:04:09.568 - 00:04:12.682, Speaker A: He's like giggling and snickering. What's so funny?
00:04:12.826 - 00:04:15.600, Speaker C: I just apologize to Brian for bringing that.
00:04:16.370 - 00:04:25.370, Speaker B: It was quite an adventure. Not our most profitable endeavor, but certainly one rich with experiences.
00:04:25.530 - 00:04:30.242, Speaker A: Yes, I'm very familiar with that, having once been a travel writer, so I totally know how that goes.
00:04:30.296 - 00:04:31.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure you do.
00:04:33.910 - 00:04:38.082, Speaker A: What were you guys doing? But you said that you had a design firm.
00:04:38.146 - 00:04:58.822, Speaker B: Sure? Yeah, I still do. It's been quite a successful firm. It continues on. We brought on new partners that are handling a lot of the day to day operations. It's called the Bright Iron Group. So yeah, it was great. It gave us a real insight into user experience, design, interface design, digital strategy and products and so forth.
00:04:58.822 - 00:05:14.738, Speaker B: And it kind of helped us understand role that we might play in the space we kept looking across. We were very excited about bitcoin in the larger industry and we were trying to figure out where can we play an important role to make an impact here?
00:05:14.904 - 00:05:19.378, Speaker A: But I don't see the connection, like design. And then now you're kind of doing research.
00:05:19.544 - 00:06:22.870, Speaker B: Right? So two things there. So one is that when we were first in the space, it was still very much in the days where there were a lot of people who thought bitcoin is the one and only bitcoin, forever and ever, and that is the end. And we really saw this as a space that we were just scratching the surface of and it was going to be far more complex, far more dynamic and far more strange than anyone expected. And so what we really saw as one of the critical pieces that we didn't see being addressed in a place where we could really help is how do you even wrap your head around it, even in the early days of it. So we saw the idea of high quality intelligence and then a platform with which to interact with that intelligence as the place where we could really play that role. And we worked for a lot of different companies of various sizes, and even in the traditional financial markets, we were really dissatisfied with the quality of interfaces and work that was out there, how people interact with intelligence reports, analysis, information. So it was a problem that we had wanted to tackle for a while, just in terms of the interface and design side.
00:06:22.870 - 00:06:31.574, Speaker B: And then we saw this need not just for really compelling research, but also for accessible interfaces so that everyone could interact with it.
00:06:31.692 - 00:06:38.262, Speaker A: And so Matt, what was your background when you said he brought you on to do the content and research? Do you have more of that analytical background?
00:06:38.326 - 00:06:47.102, Speaker C: Yeah, a lot of my background has been research into emerging technologies. So I spent a number of years in the Valley, in Silicon Valley with a group called Institute for the Future. They do?
00:06:47.156 - 00:06:48.062, Speaker A: Oh, I know them.
00:06:48.116 - 00:07:09.702, Speaker C: Yeah. Futures research into emerging technologies. Did that for a while. I did some grad school work and focused a lot on smart cities and how cities are adapting emerging technologies. And those are two big areas at a couple of years doing economics consulting, which ended up helping quite a bit. And that was when I made the pivot to this space.
00:07:09.756 - 00:07:11.110, Speaker A: And when did you join?
00:07:13.930 - 00:07:21.974, Speaker C: It's a good question. It was a gradual transition into the team and then went full time early last year.
00:07:22.092 - 00:07:24.378, Speaker A: Okay, and how many employees do you guys have now?
00:07:24.464 - 00:07:27.866, Speaker B: There are ten of us now and we're hiring as fast as we can.
00:07:28.048 - 00:07:36.880, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so I want to talk about that. Let's dive into the details on how you guys do your work. So how do you get your information?
00:07:37.570 - 00:08:28.670, Speaker B: Sure, it's every possible source when we first came into the space again, and still to this day is that if you want to provide information in the space, there just aren't consistent and reliable sources for the most part. So a lot of the research and sourcing we do has been through a very hands on process. So one of the things that we've done is take pretty extended research trips across the US and internationally as well. We'll actually head out to a region and do three, four weeks plus. And every day is meeting new organizations and individuals in the space, kind of building relationships and connections and learning what we can just on the ground. So we've done some pretty extended trips in Israel and the surrounding areas all over Europe, extensively in the US. And we have some upcoming ones planned to Asia as well.
00:08:28.670 - 00:08:51.030, Speaker B: But essentially is that it's a combination of every possible channel and news site and information source and forum online, combined with a couple hundred people that we know around the world that help us vet information, that feed us information that we can talk to about trends. So it's really kind of every possible channel that we can access, we combine.
00:08:52.570 - 00:08:53.046, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:08:53.068 - 00:09:44.882, Speaker C: No, I'll expand on that a little bit because it is very important how we arrive at what we're doing. Early on, when we started researching ICOs and token sales, we knew that this was like we saw the long term potential of this method of distributing a token, raising money, advertising onboarding new users for a protocol. But at the time, if you wanted to learn about them, you were crawling through bitcoin talk and reddit and reading through white papers of varying levels of sophistication and objectivity. And the barrier to information to access any of these opportunities was so, so high. And we saw that as a place where we could start to stitch together information from all these different sources talking to the teams, talking to other teams that were doing something similar to try to create a coherent story about what these opportunities and what these companies and what these protocols actually are that would make sense to a third party.
00:09:44.946 - 00:09:50.854, Speaker A: What percentage of the things that you write about do you actually talk to the team in person for?
00:09:50.972 - 00:09:52.330, Speaker C: Oh, almost 100%.
00:09:52.400 - 00:09:52.890, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:09:52.960 - 00:10:14.202, Speaker C: For the stuff that we do that's a little bit longer form, there's a couple of projects where we will just write a very small amount, and sometimes we don't speak to the teams, but those are just summaries of existing information for stuff that's a little longer form. Or if we're looking across markets at a number of different types of applications or a number of different industries, we'll talk to most of the teams.
00:10:14.266 - 00:10:22.322, Speaker A: Okay, but for ones where you're just kind of grabbing info from their website or whatever, what percentage of the site is that?
00:10:22.456 - 00:10:36.946, Speaker B: We write on a pretty small percentage of the token sales that contact us. The inbound at this point is truly overwhelming. There's so many, so it's really just a small subset of them that we go into depth and correct analysis.
00:10:36.978 - 00:10:37.126, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:37.148 - 00:10:45.478, Speaker B: So anything that we write about, typically it's a group that we speak to, but the ones that we list, that's just to make that information accessible.
00:10:45.574 - 00:10:49.434, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's what I'm asking. What's the breakdown between what you write about and what you list?
00:10:49.552 - 00:10:50.986, Speaker B: The percentage that we write about at this point?
00:10:51.008 - 00:10:51.306, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:10:51.328 - 00:10:52.474, Speaker B: It's a relatively small percentage.
00:10:52.522 - 00:11:34.758, Speaker C: It's changed remarkably over time. We think of a number of different eras in ICO history. The beginning when it was started, mastercoin is usually seen as the first official ICO in 2013, and there was an explosion of ICOs that included mastercoin, ethereum, NXT, number of protocols that are still around today, and then the long winter in the whole industry after the bitcoin price crash. And after Mount Gox, ICOs and token sales also really fell out of favor. No one was really doing them. And then we saw a pickup early last year. You saw a couple more protocols and the emergence of more applications, the more app tokens at the application layer and it started to become more and more popular.
00:11:34.758 - 00:11:38.422, Speaker C: And then about four months ago, the space absolutely exploded.
00:11:38.486 - 00:11:38.858, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:38.944 - 00:12:21.190, Speaker C: So now I would say 5% to 10% if I were to ballpark of the entire market. If you define the market as a project that announces some intent to raise funds through a token sale that we write about, we try to list everything. Our philosophy there is that there's not really a good place online where you can find a list that isn't a promotional or advertising platform. And so we don't charge projects to list on our Smith and Crown dashboard. We want it to be an open public information source that anyone can come and do their own research and then we select a couple of those to go a little more in depth on, write about it, illustrate what they're doing with their token, with industry.
00:12:22.090 - 00:12:29.478, Speaker A: When you do that, are you intending it to be sort of like a quality marker, that this is something people are aiming for to be written about on Smith and Crown?
00:12:29.574 - 00:12:58.820, Speaker C: Not necessarily. Sometimes we pick projects just because they're doing something very novel or very ambitious. Even if the chances for success seem slimmer than many other projects. We'll sometimes pick projects that not a lot of other people or sites or places are writing about because we think what they're doing is actually very valuable. So we don't think about it as just a proxy for all the top sales.
00:12:59.190 - 00:13:09.522, Speaker A: So how do you decide if some of them are just kind of more novel and then there are certain ones I'm sure you just have to write about because they're highly anticipated. What are all the factors that go into deciding?
00:13:09.586 - 00:13:55.320, Speaker B: Sure, yeah, it's a variety of factors. I mean, it's relatively subjective is that it's ones that, as you mentioned, if there's a lot of community interest around a project, that increases the chances that we'll write about it because we think providing additional information and context will be particularly useful there. Sometimes it's a project where it happens to correspond with research we're doing internally. We're doing a bunch of research on a particular methodology or mechanism or attribute, and this project happens to incorporate those. So it's just an area of interest for us at the time. So yeah, it's not intended to be an endorsement or a recommendation. Largely we figured the more research, thoughtful research that we can put out there that's accessible to people, the more good it does and the more people can take that and then build from it.
00:13:56.010 - 00:14:04.042, Speaker A: Do you ever interview people and then not do a longer write up about them? If you're sort of feeling like maybe this team isn't going to pull it off.
00:14:04.176 - 00:14:07.302, Speaker C: Sure, occasionally, but it's rare.
00:14:07.366 - 00:14:26.650, Speaker B: Yeah. And then in terms of the formality of the interviews, too, I mean, we're at a place where there are days where we could end up talking to three or four teams. So in terms of we get exposed to a lot of projects and we talk with a lot of teams in different levels of formality. So yeah, we talk to far more teams than we end up writing about.
00:14:26.740 - 00:14:34.722, Speaker A: And actually to go back to the travel piece, why don't you just do those interviews by phone? Why do you go to these regions to talk to them?
00:14:34.776 - 00:15:22.850, Speaker B: Sure, a lot of the interviews we do now are by phone, but sometimes in order to kind of expand our network and actually meet people, you have to be on the ground. Even in this highly effective virtual era we live in, it doesn't replace face to face conversations. And a lot of this too is to really understand what's happening at the edges of the space, what's coming next. You have to sit down with people, you have to have a coffee or beer or whatever and win their trust and get their real thoughts on what's happening and get their introductions to other people that are not known in the community or are not active players that don't have Twitter accounts. So we found in each one of these exercises that we've done, we've met incredible people, we've gotten a lot of really amazing insights, and the only ways that that would have happened is to be on the ground meeting people one day at a time.
00:15:22.920 - 00:15:58.862, Speaker A: Yeah. So in that sense, your job and my job is very similar, but yet you choose to live in Portland where I really don't think there's a lot of activity going on here. So for me, I moved to the Bay Area a little bit over a year ago and one of the factors was there's a lot of activity there. And I'm not going to lie, I actually wanted to move to Portland because I've got a ton of friends here. I love the city and yeah, I mean, I like the Bay Area as well, but there was something about my heart was telling me go to Portland, but then I was like, this just makes no sense on any rational level. So I made that choice. So why do you guys choose to be based here?
00:15:58.916 - 00:16:33.226, Speaker B: Sure, a lot of it was how logistics worked out at that time. I've mostly been based out of New York for the last eight years, but Matt and a few other members of our team actually ended up being based in Portland. And so it made sense. The majority of the team was know, let's spin something up. But also we found in terms of looking forward and building out the company is we're working on some of the most complicated and interesting problems that exist in the world today. And when we're talking to new analysts or team members, whoever that may be, they're from every corner of the world. And when we're come, come move here.
00:16:33.226 - 00:16:53.278, Speaker B: We like Portland because very high quality of life, very low comparable cost of living. So we see it as a really good place to build and expand our research practice. And then in terms of location to projects, this is such a geographically dispersed place, it would be really hard for us to find a location that was centered at the heart of it, so to speak.
00:16:53.364 - 00:16:55.806, Speaker A: You don't think the bay area has an advantage? I definitely do.
00:16:55.908 - 00:17:02.722, Speaker B: I think that there are a lot of projects in the bay area, but I think that there are just as many interesting projects, so many other places in the world.
00:17:02.776 - 00:17:03.630, Speaker A: But not Portland.
00:17:03.710 - 00:17:10.998, Speaker B: But not Portland. Yeah, Portland is a great place to do research from and when you're traveling 80% of the time, it's a very nice place to return to.
00:17:11.084 - 00:17:12.998, Speaker A: Oh, you're traveling that much?
00:17:13.164 - 00:17:13.686, Speaker B: Yes.
00:17:13.788 - 00:17:42.590, Speaker A: Wow, okay, well, kudos to you. I can't do that. Let's talk a little bit about how your work has changed over time. You guys were talking a little bit about that, about how there were very few ICOs kind of even less than a year ago and then all of a sudden it's just like sped up to 1000% really quickly. So in the beginning, how were you finding these projects? Were you like seeking them out and did they not know about you guys or how were they coming to your attention?
00:17:43.170 - 00:18:31.806, Speaker C: In the very early days, a lot of it was discovery on bitcoin talk. It was the platform of choice for announcing these and that's we'd usually discover them. Sometimes they'd reach out to us, sometimes we'd spend time on the forums and understand we could encounter them in Twitter conversations. But there weren't enough in any given month for us to feel like we were missing a really big piece of the action of what was going on. Teams were usually very accessible and open and they still are, but then it was just very willing and excited that someone that had a little bit of a platform and a portal to the broader world and the broader industry wanted to talk to them. And so that ended up being a really big piece. And then as we put our nose to the grindstone and kept doing a lot of this work because we were really passionate about it.
00:18:31.806 - 00:18:45.550, Speaker C: Over time, we grew as terms of a following, in terms of popularity, in terms of people referencing us. And now it is much more people come and ask to be listed, asked to be researched or interviewed.
00:18:45.630 - 00:18:52.040, Speaker A: Do you want to put an estimate on how many emails and Twitter messages and everything else you get in a day or a week or a month?
00:18:52.490 - 00:19:01.010, Speaker B: It's hard to say. It's really increased. I mean, some days it can be a dozen, two, three dozen inbound just on getting project listings.
00:19:01.090 - 00:19:03.930, Speaker A: And so when did you kind of notice that things were changing?
00:19:04.350 - 00:19:23.870, Speaker B: Sure, I think we started to see the signs of it maybe between six and eight months ago, is when it first started to pick up. And then really, it's been the last four months or so where things have really continued up on that trajectory. But yeah, I think as early as eight months ago we really started to see that things were diverging from where the trend line was originally.
00:19:24.450 - 00:19:28.500, Speaker A: Was there like any moment when you were just like, whoa, this is going to be huge?
00:19:28.950 - 00:20:07.722, Speaker B: What it's kind of interesting for us is that this was kind of what we planned on. We always expected there to be this level of growth. I think it just happened sooner than we thought it was going to. If you look at the space, there's still a lot of challenges in terms of onboarding accessibility and usability across a number of key areas. And so we expected that to be a slightly larger barrier over the long term. But in terms of the excitement, it just grew really fast and we noticed it in a few different formats. So we don't just study token sales, we really study the entire breadth of the blockchain space, all assets, all projects.
00:20:07.722 - 00:20:42.050, Speaker B: And so that's kind of what the token sale practice came out of. But in the work that we're doing, we started noticing these trends where we would start to get a lot of calls from hedge funds or institutional investors or big financial organizations. And so pretty early on, we started to notice, hey, there's some key groups here and we're getting a lot of calls from a lot of high level people looking for information, being very interested in the space. So we started to adjust some of our estimates of how fast this was going to grow because a lot bigger players than were publicly revealing themselves were being very interested in the space.
00:20:42.140 - 00:20:52.570, Speaker A: And that sort of clues you in that there was a lot more money coming into the space. Like not even just people who've made big gains on their earlier crypto, but new money, fiat money coming in.
00:20:52.640 - 00:21:27.382, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, it's one of the reasons why we go and travel and spend as much time as we do on the road meeting people is that we're in a very interesting position where we get to have a lot of conversations with everyone from institutional investors and people who own investment banks all the way through to crypto anarchists. And everyone's got a different interesting view on this. And by combining all those conversations together, you can start to piece together the puzzle of who's interested, what are the levels of engagement, what are the things that hold people back, what are people really excited about? And you kind of stitch that together into a picture of where things are going.
00:21:27.436 - 00:21:35.066, Speaker A: And so those institutional investors, when they were calling you, what is it that they wanted? They wanted kind of like more information than what you were putting on the site.
00:21:35.248 - 00:22:01.278, Speaker B: Yeah, it's one of those things where I think it was pretty interesting. You have a lot of people who we were talking to, a lot of people who are used to being able to understand whatever new industry they weighed into. Here's a new sector. This is the next one that we're going to put venture behind or incorporating a hedge fund or whatever that happens to be. People with decades of experience are used to being able to figure things out very quickly. So they thought, blockchain, this is the next hot space. We're going to get involved.
00:22:01.278 - 00:22:36.380, Speaker B: And then they spend a couple of weeks on it and they say, whoa, whoa, still don't get this. And then they start looking at it. Do we hire an analyst? Do we build a team of analysts? How do we even begin to wrap our heads around this? And then we'd get those calls around, how do I start? What is this space? Help me get me a handle on what's even going on here, how we participate, how we move forward. So a variety of level of questions, but people understanding that this is an important thing to be aware of, to be involved in, and then this realization that you can't just get up on it in a week or two.
00:22:36.770 - 00:23:15.162, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I definitely agree with you there. Okay, so we're going to take a break now for an important word from our sponsor, Onramp. With so many companies vying for people's attention now, it's important to stand out from the pack. If you're starting up a new, decentralized project and want to help spread the word about it, check out Onramp, a full service creative agency that helps projects maximize awareness, gain traction, and accelerate growth. Onramp has helped numerous organizations do everything from create their branding and identity to redesign their existing website. Plus, they've helped blockchain startups and projects. Whether you're launching a new project, repositioning an existing organization, or just want to freshen your company's look, onramp can come up with a tailored design project or a strategic marketing plan that ensures your lead in the market.
00:23:15.162 - 00:23:21.558, Speaker A: Learn more and see examples of its work@synconramp.com. So how do you guys make money?
00:23:21.744 - 00:24:12.700, Speaker B: It's a great question when we get often so when we first started this and we said, we're a research group. We're going to study the breadth of the blockchain space, we're going to build a platform and tools around intelligence. And people thought we were nuts. People in the industry thought we were nuts because why do you need an intelligence platform when it's just bitcoin? And then people outside of the industry thought we were nuts because they said, what bitcoin? That's nonsense. So this is something that we've bootstrapped ourselves for years at this point and with the idea of being able to very independently pursue the specific vision that we had. So our vision for how we make money is largely centered around the idea of launching an intelligence platform. So kind of like a Bloomberg for crypto or so the idea really is to make a platform that's as accessible as possible to people.
00:24:12.700 - 00:24:52.678, Speaker B: When you look at the tools that are out there today in traditional markets, they tend to be very, very expensive and tailored for this kind of financial elite. One of the things that's really exciting about the whole blockchain space is accessibility and inclusion is that everyone all around the world will be able to access the assets and tools and utilities that the blockchain space provides. And so our vision really is for an intelligence platform that everyone can use that provides information, analysis, analytics in a way that's accessible and can act as an on ramp. And then on top of that, we will build access to increasingly sophisticated features.
00:24:52.694 - 00:24:54.458, Speaker A: For the people who need like a freemium model.
00:24:54.544 - 00:25:25.922, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And it's one of the reasons why we publish so many of these reports online and so much information just to make it accessible. Right. There's been no shortage of people that have come to us and said, your model should be publishing nothing and charging banks a lot of money for these reports and you have listened to nothing that we've said that is antithetical to kind of our vision for this. So we want to make information accessible exactly. And provide some base level of utility, much like we do on the site to everyone and then for people who need more sophistication to allow them to pay a subscription fee for that.
00:25:25.976 - 00:25:31.318, Speaker A: So what are some of the different premium things that you're going to offer and charge for? Have you started doing that?
00:25:31.404 - 00:25:36.934, Speaker B: So this is something that we'll have a private beta for later this year and we'll roll out publicly early next year.
00:25:37.052 - 00:25:37.430, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:37.500 - 00:25:37.782, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:37.836 - 00:25:40.570, Speaker A: Okay. Do you want to talk a little bit about what you're planning?
00:25:41.390 - 00:25:42.522, Speaker B: We'll get to that.
00:25:42.656 - 00:25:48.140, Speaker A: Okay, you'll give that to me as an exclusive or something? I'll write it up.
00:25:48.590 - 00:25:49.754, Speaker B: That sounds very good.
00:25:49.872 - 00:25:52.160, Speaker A: Awesome. That's a great deal.
00:25:52.530 - 00:26:26.738, Speaker B: In addition to that, kind of in the meantime, we largely see our efforts right now and concentrating in three big areas. So one is continuing to build out the platform. We've spent years building out tools and processes and analytics beyond what we're publishing. And the goal is to use the platform to open those up and make them accessible to people. So that's where we're spending a lot of time and effort. The second area that we spend a lot of time is on general advocacy and education. Again, we got in this space because we're really passionate idealists about the positive transformative power of the blockchain.
00:26:26.738 - 00:26:52.874, Speaker B: We think. This is something that we can't even begin to imagine, its potential for changing the state of the world, reshaping industries and so forth, but for how excited we are about its positive potential. With the growth that we're seeing right now. This is a delicate time. Things are happening very fast. Things can break, mistakes can be made when things happen so fast and there's so much capital involved. And so right now we see this as an area where education is so critical.
00:26:52.874 - 00:27:33.542, Speaker B: So we're spending a lot of time trying to go speak at conferences, trying to go give private talks, have dinners with people that are looking at the space, who are going to bring in significant resources or attention. We're going out to DC and trying to wave our hands around and provide education to regulators, you mean? Yeah, we're doing some work with the Chamber for Digital Commerce and trying to help provide education. So we're putting a lot of effort just into general industry education where we can because we feel with all the attention on the space right now, people getting reliable quality information that's free of hype or a sales pitch or fear is just so important for new established players that are getting in to understand it and to make good decisions.
00:27:33.606 - 00:27:40.442, Speaker A: And to go back to earlier when you were saying that you go around and you give talks and stuff as well. What exactly are you educating people on in those talks?
00:27:40.506 - 00:28:16.042, Speaker B: Sure, the idea is to just generally provide an overview of this is the industry, this is its potential, these are the concerns of the industry, this is where we see it's going. It's very hard. A lot of the stuff that gets written about the industry tends to capitalize on one sensational point or another and there's a lot of nuances and a lot of complexity there. So even if you're just trying to follow along with a lot of the headlines, it can be hard to get a sense for what's really going on. So it is a really wide variety of topics but having time where we can sit down with people and give them that overview and then really answer more in depth questions around how things work.
00:28:16.096 - 00:28:30.240, Speaker A: And earlier when you were talking about kind of like the mistakes and risks and stuff like that, do you also do what we were talking about before the podcast about how people are throwing silly money in and they probably shouldn't and stuff like that, do you give any advice like that?
00:28:30.770 - 00:29:19.194, Speaker B: A lot of what we say is, look, there's a lot of lessons that have already been learned. We don't need to learn every lesson the hard way. There's a lot of common sense, there's a lot of best practices that can be applied to the space that exist elsewhere. And so we think that education is an enormously important part of that, giving people access to resources and then following up and working closely with people who are going to come in and make an impact. A third area of our activity is actually rendered advisory services as well. We're in a unique position in that we have spent an enormous amount of time and resources studying how digital assets and Tokens are designed, what their utilities and properties are, how their economies work or should work and doing that modeling and thought across literally hundreds of projects.
00:29:19.242 - 00:29:21.418, Speaker A: Like the feel of crypto economics.
00:29:21.514 - 00:30:09.438, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So we spent an enormous amount of time on that and so it's something we realized. We've started to see a lot of kind of mistakes or missteps being made by projects that were designing Tokens or economies or perhaps more established companies that are looking to get into the space and have a lot of questions about how you do this. Really, I think that there is a lot of confidence out there. But the reality is we're at the very earliest stages of understanding how Token economies work, how Token rights and properties interact with each other, what makes for successful systems and not. So what we started to do on a fairly limited basis, as we only have so many people, is to work with projects and organizations to help them better understand crypto economics, to help them to act as a thinking partner specifically around these ideas of crypto economic design.
00:30:09.438 - 00:30:42.090, Speaker B: How do you structure a Token, how do you structure distribution, what makes sense? And really I think there's been an unfortunate short focus on the short term of issuing a Token. I think it gets positioned in a lot of ways as a capital raise when really this is a very long term decision where even small decisions can have large consequences. And so what we try and do is help teams think through the crypto economic design as something that's fundamental to their team or project or organization and all of the long term consequences and thoughts and modeling that goes into that.
00:30:42.160 - 00:30:44.310, Speaker A: So wow, so you're helping some of these teams?
00:30:44.390 - 00:31:05.278, Speaker B: We are, yeah. And so it really runs a gamut is right now we're really focused on areas that we find where there's some complexity or a particular interest. One area where we're seeing a lot of organizations reach out to us, actually much larger established organizations that have been looking at the space, they think they perhaps have a business that could benefit from Tokenization in some way.
00:31:05.364 - 00:31:08.002, Speaker A: Sort of like kick or invest or one of those.
00:31:08.056 - 00:31:32.982, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So these large players are coming in, and what they're looking for is where can they get expert advice on this, and where can they get someone to help think through what that hybrid model looks like. How someone that can help them understand their existing business and lines of business and say, here's an opportunity to extend one. Or to introduce a token into this. And what does that look like? What are the pitfalls, what are the opportunities and really helping them think through the complexities of those decisions.
00:31:33.046 - 00:32:16.882, Speaker C: This Tokenization in terms of the process of a company integrating a Token into their business model in one way, shape, or form is more than just doing the math on the crypto economics. That's a really big piece of it, the Token design. We also have to think through user experience and is it plausible to assume that people are going to use this token? Is this going to be fun? Does this make sense in terms of your product and your brand? And then long term, Tokenizing is a huge investment because it has a huge impact on your business model. And having a Token or some kind of a tokenization strategy marries you to the decisions that you made in ways that are very difficult to go back on without breaking some kind of a promise with token holders.
00:32:16.946 - 00:32:19.334, Speaker A: Right. Or unless you bake governance in or something.
00:32:19.452 - 00:32:20.120, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:32:20.490 - 00:32:36.958, Speaker A: Proposed changes. Well, so do you feel like if you're giving advice or advisory services to some of these teams, but you're also then serving as this resource, is there some kind of separation between the people who do the two different things?
00:32:37.044 - 00:33:28.590, Speaker B: Sure, yeah, it's a great question and honestly, we think a really important one. So our thesis on what we take pretty religiously is disclosure. I mean, we think that's one of the big things that the space is going to go through is really the importance of disclosing relationships here. So luckily we work with the smallest fraction of the projects that come across our dashboard and that we list and we have a very strict policy. Anything that we do, any writing on where we have a relationship with them, any kind of financial or token based relationship, very clearly disclaim that we want to make sure front and center that the writing should stand on its own, but that people understand there's a relationship there. It's clear we're on as advisors or we're providing advice or whatever that happens to be. So something we take very seriously and we think is an important part, not just for us, but for many of the players in the industry.
00:33:29.250 - 00:33:30.318, Speaker A: Different of people.
00:33:30.404 - 00:33:35.954, Speaker C: Yeah, we do separate people. So the people who end up doing the research and writing are different than the people who end up working on the project.
00:33:36.072 - 00:33:43.620, Speaker A: Yeah. So what are some of your maybe working hypotheses around crypto economics? Like, what do you think works, what doesn't work?
00:33:44.790 - 00:33:45.538, Speaker B: Sure.
00:33:45.704 - 00:34:34.286, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. There are a number of different areas that tokens and tokenization have proven very powerful. And we think far and away what we're going to see in Tokens in five years, we couldn't even imagine. Today, it's really the frontier of creativity. I feel like every week I come across something that I hadn't thought about before. I do think that there are a class of tokens that are a little bit more like equities and stocks and companies and there's a lot of regulatory issues around that those are going to get worked out and a lot of really smart lawyers and regulators actively thinking about this today around the world. But in many ways tokenizing ownership over a protocol or ownership over the company behind it, they are very, very creative.
00:34:34.286 - 00:35:12.298, Speaker C: And that equity as a share in a company is something that's been around for over 100 years. Really interesting, novel financial innovation, but it's not the only way you can imagine ownership over some kind of a joint endeavor. And so this has been a really interesting area of experimentation and I think that as the regulatory issues get worked out, people will there'll be a little bit more creativity and experimentation. A second one is in tokens that more resemble digital products that are usable by consumers, particularly crowds and crowds of people. So very good at incentivizing crowds to take good actions on a platform to avoid bad actions.
00:35:12.394 - 00:35:13.498, Speaker A: What's an example.
00:35:13.684 - 00:35:59.040, Speaker C: So a good example, and this actually isn't a token that went through a crowd sale, but numerai, they have a token. The numerair and the purpose of the token is, I guess if it's worth saying a couple words about them, what they did. We don't have a relationship with them or anything, I just think what they do is really interesting. But they have a community of data scientists around the world that are constantly crunching kind of deidentified data from stock markets and prices and weather economic data to do predictive models on the performance of different stocks or industries. And the data scientists submit outcomes of their models every week to Numerai, which takes those and uses it to improve their model.
00:35:59.810 - 00:36:02.846, Speaker A: And they invest using those models. They're a big hedge fund.
00:36:02.948 - 00:36:08.386, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And then they compensate the data scientists who are the top performers across the.
00:36:08.408 - 00:36:11.230, Speaker A: Platform in Numerair, which is their token.
00:36:11.390 - 00:36:33.530, Speaker C: Correct. And historically it's been in BTC, but they're also distributing numerair. And the role that the numerator plays on their platform is that the data scientists stake it as some kind of an indication of confidence in their model and that individual week. And that's really interesting because if they're wrong, it's not like numerai. The company pockets the proceeds.
00:36:33.950 - 00:36:35.190, Speaker A: Yeah. It gets burned.
00:36:35.270 - 00:36:52.046, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And so from the standpoint of a data scientist, they know that that numerator is not being extracted by the company and that the outcome of what happens to that new mara is determined by the algorithm and by the purpose, by.
00:36:52.148 - 00:37:02.066, Speaker A: The performance of their individual, how good their model is. Yeah, but just to go back to what you think the better ways to structure tokens are, is there anything else?
00:37:02.168 - 00:37:11.240, Speaker B: Well, I think that in terms of we get this question a lot. What's the best way to structure a token, what's the best way to do token distribution? And one of the things that.
00:37:13.770 - 00:37:14.098, Speaker A: We'Re.
00:37:14.114 - 00:38:11.154, Speaker B: Trying to get out there is that there is no one right way, there is no one killer methodology or framework or whatever it happens to be. There's really this question of what is right for the organization. And this comes back to this focus on whether that you're using some kind of distribution event to distribute something because it has utility for people, or whether you're just using it as a capital raise. Because if you're using a capital raise, then you're looking at a set of strategies to maximize that capital raise. But if you're looking at this in terms of distribution, then you really have to take that step back and think through what is this organization? What is the intention? Who will use it? Who are all the different members of the people who use it? What will they use it for? And with that, then you can say, look, here's a set of different attributes or utilities or properties that the hookin can has. These are the ways the economy can function in order to incentivize and support these type of actions. But those could be radically different depending on the type of problem you're solving.
00:38:11.154 - 00:38:25.390, Speaker B: And the same thing with distribution is that there's different distribution models out there that could be very different depending on whether you care whether one person comes in and snatches up everything or whether there's a specific group of people that you want to immediately be using this or be holding it or whatever that happens to be.
00:38:25.460 - 00:38:42.900, Speaker A: Well, that's really interesting because then it sort of just in my mind, I start thinking about spectrums or quadrants and then kind of like different depending on what your goal is, different strategies matching with that. So in terms of distribution, what do you feel is like a good way to structure a token sale to get a large number of people to buy?
00:38:43.510 - 00:39:10.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're still at the early stages of what good models for that look like. But it's interesting. We've seen some kind of novelty in this and experimentation. There was Urbit did something interesting where they had a mailing list and they distributed these kind of AirDrop these codes to their mailing list and there were two codes per email and then they could be used to purchase a fixed amount of tokens in their ecosystem.
00:39:11.230 - 00:39:14.234, Speaker A: What do you mean by two codes? Every single person got the same number.
00:39:14.352 - 00:39:25.440, Speaker B: They got two codes. Each person got two unique codes that they could use. So they could use one code to purchase a unit and then they could go and sell the other code or share it with a friend or whatever they wanted.
00:39:25.890 - 00:39:27.274, Speaker A: You plus one. I see.
00:39:27.332 - 00:40:00.710, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Or they could just give away both, whatever that happened to be. But it was an interesting model in that here's a group of people that were interested enough to follow along with them and they wanted to give them the first chance to have this kind of capped participation in it, which we think it's certainly a novel thing, but some of these clever things only work so many times. If that becomes the expectation, then you have people signing up with multiple addresses and so forth. So we think a part of this is going to be evolving. We're going to see a set of different popular versions of this emerge. Some of them are going to be tied to provable identities.
00:40:00.710 - 00:41:06.422, Speaker B: Some of these are going to be distributed to internal users of an existing product or system or someone else's existing product or system. So part of this is going to be the challenges of identifying who you want to be participants and what's the best way to give them access and what quantities and sometimes just open participation will make sense and sometimes it'll be something specific or nuanced. That's one of the things about this space that I think can be very terrifying and overwhelming but is also the very exciting part of it is that the tools that people have in order to build projects, in order to get initial participation, they're essentially limitless. There's so many different combinations and we're just starting down the path. So a lot of the thinking that we do is saying well, here's a bunch of models we've already seen, but what are the next steps on this looking like? How can these be improved? What are new ways to do this? And so it's very fun for us to get to work with teams that kind of share that vision and share that excitement for figuring out what are the new ways to do it. And I think we're going to continue to be surprised by some of the methodologies that get implemented by teams.
00:41:06.506 - 00:41:16.162, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so what you said about how once something kind of becomes the trend and people try to game it, is it just forever going to be this kind of cat and mouse thing?
00:41:16.296 - 00:41:48.954, Speaker C: I think yes and no. One of the biggest things that is more and more becoming part of the industry and part of the token sale space is some kind of KYC identification registration, which historically hasn't been a major piece of it. And that not doing that poses a lot of dilemmas for projects because if you can contribute anonymously from any individual address, then you can essentially civil attack or try to get a larger share of any individual sale.
00:41:49.082 - 00:41:51.150, Speaker A: Even if they try to multiple.
00:41:51.570 - 00:42:32.846, Speaker C: Correct, correct. So vitalik Buterin framed this really really well, that you kind of are either you limit the amount of money that you raise or you uncap the number of people that can actually participate. Because if you don't have a capped raise then anyone can contribute anything and you can maximize participation. But if you cap the raise then you can end up in situations like what happened with a basic attention token where a very small number of people got a very large portions. And so that dilemma cannot really be solved without really clever mechanisms. He just framed that really, really well. But one of the pieces of that puzzle is KYC in some way, shape or form.
00:42:32.846 - 00:43:02.246, Speaker C: So if you're an individual and they try to cap it and maybe there's a strategy like every individual address can only contribute this many dollars or this many ether, then you can just have a thousand addresses to still get a huge portion of the system. But if there's some kind of registration that prevents someone from creating 1000 addresses, then you have a little bit more flexibility in determining who can get involved, how at what levels they can get involved and why.
00:43:02.348 - 00:43:04.854, Speaker A: Sort of like coin list for the non accredited too.
00:43:04.972 - 00:43:05.640, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:43:06.570 - 00:43:20.458, Speaker C: We think we'll see more and more of that in the space because it's a really interesting toolkit for projects to experiment with distribution. Because the distribution, the distribution strategy is just as important as every other piece and it really varies project to project.
00:43:20.544 - 00:43:20.794, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:20.832 - 00:43:36.762, Speaker A: And I actually wanted to ask you before you were saying sometimes people want to release tokens to a big network and other times maybe they just want to maximize the amount of money they can raise. But is there anybody who doesn't want to release their tokens to a large number of people? I can't think of any scenario in which that would be a goal.
00:43:36.826 - 00:43:45.110, Speaker B: Well, if you're just seeing this as a capital raise and you don't care where the money comes from, then it doesn't matter if 100 people give you a dollar or one person gives you $100.
00:43:45.220 - 00:43:45.686, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:43:45.788 - 00:44:05.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Which is a different scenario. And what excites us about the space and what we're looking at is using a distribution event for distribution as opposed to a capital raise. But there are certainly people who use this as a mechanism solely for capital raising and I think we'll see that emerge and kind of carve out its own space.
00:44:05.952 - 00:44:26.066, Speaker C: The kinds of tokens that more fit that mold are, for lack of a better word, like fee sharing and revenue sharing tokens. So the holder of the token is entitled to a portion of fees or revenues generated on some kind of a platform. And many people call those like rent seeking tokens because the token holder really plays no role in the success.
00:44:26.168 - 00:44:27.780, Speaker A: And what's an example of that?
00:44:28.870 - 00:44:55.770, Speaker C: There are a number of examples, but they're often paired with other token functions or token properties. But an example might be the DigixDAO token where token holders get a portion of fees generated through the sale of digitized gold. Now, DigixDAO also has a governance function which makes it really important to distribute. So a lot of the tokens end up having or embodying a number of different rights and a number of different properties.
00:44:56.510 - 00:45:04.318, Speaker A: Okay, so one thing that I'm so curious about is how much traffic does your site get and how much hell how's that changed over time.
00:45:04.484 - 00:45:37.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have the numbers handy. Honestly, we were not tracking the numbers so closely. For us, it was really about who we're talking to and who's on the site. And we had some modest and ambitious goals for ourselves in terms of traffic. And at some point we realized that traffic was like four X, our most ambitious goals. And when we really stopped tracking it, we were so far beyond our estimates or projections for what we wanted in terms of traffic. And at this point we're so completely inundated with inbound.
00:45:37.730 - 00:45:47.574, Speaker B: So we're growing at some crazy week on week growth percentage at this point. I don't know the exact numbers, but yeah, we've stopped tracking it. It's getting so wild.
00:45:47.702 - 00:46:00.174, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I've seen it also in my podcast downloads. So one other thing I was curious about is your Smith and Crown index. What is it and how did you decide what goes into it and all?
00:46:00.372 - 00:47:09.222, Speaker B: You know, I'll talk about this at a high level. Mac can jump in on the details. So yeah, this is something that we've had for a really long time. It was one of the first things that we worked on literally years ago and it's kind of evolved over time, but we were really looking for when you pull up, say, like Coin market cap and there's a thousand things on there, there's so much noise. We think it's very intimidating for newcomers to the space. And then even if you're looking at it, how is the market doing? Do you really want a lot of short term volatility for tokens that really don't have any value and are essentially going nowhere? Do you want that being part of your overall market measure? So what we're doing with the index is trying to find a set of constituents that we think represent the overall market as a whole and use those to track to have a more accurate proxy for how are things doing right as a benchmark that you can use. And this is something we're going to continue to be working on moving forward and have some cool announcements about coming up.
00:47:09.222 - 00:47:12.946, Speaker B: But the idea is it provides yet an accurate benchmark across the industry.
00:47:13.058 - 00:47:20.422, Speaker A: And so what metrics are you using to decide which tokens are included and also then how do you decide the weightings and stuff?
00:47:20.556 - 00:47:28.010, Speaker C: We look at a couple of different factors. One of them is that we only look at fundamental blockchains. We don't include meta tokens.
00:47:28.750 - 00:47:30.230, Speaker A: How do you define a meta token?
00:47:30.310 - 00:47:32.554, Speaker C: Oh, one that's built on top of another blockchain.
00:47:32.682 - 00:47:33.022, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:33.076 - 00:47:43.562, Speaker C: A token that's built on top of no ERC, 20 tokens or their correlates on other blockchains. So that's a big one. So we're only looking at fundamental blockchains.
00:47:43.706 - 00:47:49.362, Speaker A: Second, we look at which some other people might call that a protocol token, is that correct?
00:47:49.416 - 00:47:57.990, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, that's fair. I do think there's still a lot of semantics that are still being worked out exactly across the industry, but that's a totally fair way to put it.
00:47:58.060 - 00:47:58.582, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:58.716 - 00:48:21.850, Speaker C: The other factors that we'd look at in terms of inclusion would be performance and activity on the blockchain itself. So is the blockchain gaining traction? Is it actually being used? Is it so early stage that no one's really building on it? So projects and blockchains that do have some moderate level of traction and existence and activity is part of it.
00:48:21.920 - 00:48:25.550, Speaker A: And by traction, do you mean developer activity or trading volume or what?
00:48:25.620 - 00:48:51.734, Speaker C: A lot of it could just be at the transaction level. Yes. So it could be developers. It's like what is being developed on the platform. It's how many wallets there are, how much transaction activity is actually going over the blockchain itself. And we have to adjust that a little bit for trade volumes and for proof of work coins, since they're distributing coins across the network quite a bit. But it's really who's using the network transaction and volume is one of them.
00:48:51.734 - 00:48:56.230, Speaker C: Developer activity, community following is another really big thing that we look at.
00:48:56.300 - 00:49:04.010, Speaker A: Just from the way you're describing this, it sounds like are you trying to maybe subtract some of the speculative activity? Is that what you're doing or is that included?
00:49:04.510 - 00:49:06.566, Speaker C: What do you mean by speculative activity?
00:49:06.758 - 00:49:13.850, Speaker A: People sometimes are not really interested in the Token itself, but they're like, hey, I expect this to go up. And so there's a lot of trading volume more.
00:49:13.920 - 00:49:47.830, Speaker C: Oh, sure. So market activity is definitely something we look at. So I said we will do like blockchain level analysis of what's going on over the chain itself. We also look at markets. So we'd look at factors like how many different markets and trade pairs does this individual crypto asset have across fiat and across crypto? So kind of how strong is it as part of that entire interconnected market? We look at trade volume over a pretty meaningful amount of time. So things that have short term spikes in price, network value or trade know, look past a lot of the short term stuff.
00:49:47.900 - 00:50:09.178, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. I guess what I was going at is sometimes the Tokens are trading a lot, but then the actual utility in it is maybe a lot less. I know Brian was at Token Summit and Chris Bruniske gave a great talk where he talked about subtracting out the speculative value, getting the utility value. How do you decide the weightings for the index?
00:50:09.274 - 00:50:29.250, Speaker C: Yeah, so the weightings currently are done based on network value. So we call it market capitalization. We generally don't like that term because market capitalization is some value of a company shares. And as we've said, Tokens are not shares. They're very, very different. They're very different even from each other. And I think actually Chris is the one who had the he came up with network.
00:50:29.250 - 00:50:32.120, Speaker C: We brilliant. We use it a lot.
00:50:32.490 - 00:50:54.046, Speaker A: And also for podcast listeners, you should go back and listen to the episode I did with Chris and Adam White more than a year ago. But even then, Chris was and Adam, of course, both were just really far thinking in this area. What problems do you still see that need to be solved in this know? What concerns do you know, on one.
00:50:54.068 - 00:51:31.786, Speaker B: Hand, I think you have right now, one of the big things that needs to be solved is just onboarding. When we look at the research and projects that we want to roll out, we think of it as a series of bridges. So you have people that hear about this entire industry in space and they want to get involved. And what does that first bridge look like? You have to introduce them to it. You want to provide kind of a curated set of information that's intelligent, that exposes them to projects and endeavors and sources of merit. And then once people start to get familiar with it, then the next step is perhaps to acquire some assets in the space. And that's where something like a coinbase comes in.
00:51:31.786 - 00:52:29.370, Speaker B: And then once you have those, maybe you want to go beyond what is the most mainstream and then again, providing that research and that insight and the tools for that. But then where do you hold those tokens? How do you secure them? How do you make people feel comfortable with that? And then going beyond that, how do people get more advanced than just holding a basket of assets and so forth? So at each one of those points, we see that as a bridge to a new level of capability and understanding. And I think now for people that are dedicated enough and savy enough, you can navigate all of those pathways, but it's narrow. You're kind of ford in the river on a lot of these. It's possible. But the more I think that's a series, each one of those kind of bridges is an area where there's a lot of opportunity for people to come in and solve the problems of adoption. And onboarding, we kind of see it as this way, where there's a lot of people who want a password reset button, they want insurance, they want security and custody.
00:52:29.370 - 00:53:26.014, Speaker B: And the idea is that there will be this kind of the city that's built with laws and rules and custody and so forth that will help bring on enormous numbers of people and amounts of capital. But there's always a chance to kind of step outside the city walls and go down directly to a network level and transact in whatever way is possible. But the idea now is that there are so many talented people out there, there's so many organizations that want to get involved that are simply missing robust tools and on ramps to come in and participate in the industry. So I. Think anything that helps solve those problems is pretty meaningful right now. And I do think there are a lot of problems on onboarding right now. So I think that's one big area and then the other one is around clarity too, is that this is very much the frontier in a lot of ways, and we're seeing with the SEC discussion and so forth, is that it's not entirely clear where all the lines are for this.
00:53:26.014 - 00:53:46.034, Speaker B: And we know for sure that there are a lot of players of all shapes and sizes waiting on the sidelines, very excited about this, but are looking for more clarity. So I think that's another big issue with the space and a potential for problems when you have people that are moving very fast at very large scale and a lack of clarity, that can certainly cause issues.
00:53:46.232 - 00:53:59.202, Speaker A: Where do you think all this activity is going? What do you think the future looks like for developers, for VCs, for investors, and for all of us? What will our lives look like five years from now? Pick your time frame.
00:53:59.266 - 00:54:26.180, Speaker B: Sure. No, I think it's five years from now, we can't I think anyone with a prediction for five years out, other than unless the prediction is we don't know what's going to happen, is likely wrong. That's one of the things that we love about this space is that for as much time as we spend with a dedicated team researching this every day, there's still stuff that's new and novel and surprises us and we spend a lot of time mapping out these technologies and projects and where they're going to go.
00:54:27.030 - 00:54:29.726, Speaker A: Do you think people will own like 20 different tokens?
00:54:29.758 - 00:55:07.210, Speaker B: Sure, okay, yeah, absolutely. I think that we're going to see a pretty rapid maturity in a lot of spaces. There are just so many people, smart people in every corner of the globe building tools and projects. So I think we'll see an integration into everyday life in a much larger way than we see now. And not everyone will know that they're using tokens or the blockchain for all these activities. I think a lot of these onboarding tools will use this behind the scenes to power an experience or an application or a financial transaction or whatever that happens to be. People don't need to directly interact with the idea of tokens.
00:55:07.210 - 00:55:17.934, Speaker B: These can be the blockchain and these concepts can be behind the scenes powering all sorts of experiences and infrastructure. But yeah, I think we'll see a much more integration of them into daily life in the average user.
00:55:17.982 - 00:55:21.838, Speaker A: Well, but is there anything in particular that you think you'll be doing with these tokens?
00:55:21.934 - 00:56:08.526, Speaker C: Yeah, one thing that I've gotten really excited about is tokens have been increasingly used in things like social networks or areas where content is user generated. So you think in an average day, an internet user that is contributing to a number of these different platforms is contributing without any way of really recording that kind of contribution in a way that leaves the platform. So it's kind of constantly giving to all these different platforms. You post on Reddit, you contribute to Wikipedia, you answer questions on Stack Exchange, you share photos or information or answers across a number of different platforms. And currently there's not a great way to accumulate or to measure the social capital that you're building in doing that. And tokens are one way where that could start to happen. We've seen a number of different models.
00:56:08.526 - 00:56:12.578, Speaker C: Again, I think we're going to see stuff that will just totally blow us away in five years, but it's kind.
00:56:12.584 - 00:56:21.814, Speaker A: Of accruing to our identity. So if I have good tweets plus good Facebook posts, plus interesting Reddit comments, like all of that will correct.
00:56:21.852 - 00:56:57.774, Speaker C: And people are talking about this in Web 2.0. It's not a totally new concept. Just blockchain is the technology that's around that allows that to be totally auditable. It makes it independent of the platform provider as it previously a company that just stores all this information on the central database, can corrupt it, can lose it, can manipulate it. So this is a time when the tools for recording and tracking and trading that are independent of the platform and independent of any individual company that's running a website. And so we're starting to see the foundations for what that could look like. That the value that you are constantly generating, creating on the internet.
00:56:57.774 - 00:57:12.114, Speaker C: So that's one thing that excites me. And we see a number of different projects that are starting to explore this idea and starting to create those foundations for other ways of transferring those between different platforms.
00:57:12.162 - 00:57:23.334, Speaker A: Yeah, and I even saw like a tweet from Naval Rabikant, the Angelist founder the other day saying something like, oh, I will pay some prize or something to a team that comes up with a good, decentralized Twitter.
00:57:23.382 - 00:58:17.350, Speaker B: Twitter, right on. All right, so in terms of a more specific prediction, I think one of the longer term trends we're tracking that we think is pretty interesting is right now you see a lot of the activity of governments in this largely as being that of exploring regulatory practices. But what I think we'll see is with five years of adoption based on the path we have now, is the blockchain based networks will be an important part of the global financial ecosystem. And you will see, much like different countries right now, have very vested interest in their own economic policy and global economic policy having to move from the stance of just regulation to active involvement in these global economic networks, I think we're going to see a pretty big shift in that over the next five years. A realization that this is now a strategic economic activity as opposed to something that can just be done by individuals and has to be carefully regulated.
00:58:17.510 - 00:58:26.638, Speaker A: Yes, well, I guess we'll see how it all plays out. So thank you both so much for coming on the show. Where can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you?
