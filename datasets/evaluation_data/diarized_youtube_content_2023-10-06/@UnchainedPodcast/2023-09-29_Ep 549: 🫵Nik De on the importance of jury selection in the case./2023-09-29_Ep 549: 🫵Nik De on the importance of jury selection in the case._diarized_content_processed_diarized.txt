00:00:00.090 - 00:00:48.420, Speaker A: I think it's probably going to be very boring from just kind of an observer perspective because it's a long process and we're going to be just sitting there watching this judge ask each individual, have you heard of FTX? Have you heard of Sam Bankman Freed? What do you think about cryptocurrencies? But it's going to be very interesting because this is the part where we're really going to get a sense of, okay, these are the twelve or so people who are going to determine whether or not Bankman Freed spends the next ten to 20 years of his life behind bars. And so I'm expecting to see maybe a mixed selection. I think if you pluck a random group of New Yorkers off the streets, some of them may have heard of cryptocurrency, most of them probably will not have. And they're going to be tasked with deciding whether or not one of the biggest figures in crypto committed fraud on the way up and on the way down.
