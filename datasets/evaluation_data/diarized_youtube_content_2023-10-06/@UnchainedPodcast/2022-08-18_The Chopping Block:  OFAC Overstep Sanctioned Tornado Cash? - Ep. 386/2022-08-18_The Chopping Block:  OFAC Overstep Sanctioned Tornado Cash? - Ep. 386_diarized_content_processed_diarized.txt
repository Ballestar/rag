00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.210, Speaker A: Not a dividend.
00:00:01.290 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quant.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.830, Speaker B: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.900 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker C: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:16.850 - 00:00:17.310, Speaker D: Alright.
00:00:17.380 - 00:00:28.342, Speaker C: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider perspectives on the topics of the day. So first, I want you to apologize. We're starting a little bit late because.
00:00:28.396 - 00:00:29.746, Speaker D: Tarun is very late.
00:00:29.778 - 00:00:34.834, Speaker C: You were very late. He wanted to say something to everybody for being late. Tarun, please take the floor.
00:00:34.882 - 00:00:36.534, Speaker B: All I have to say is I.
00:00:36.572 - 00:00:43.386, Speaker E: Do apologize for the late start, but sometimes thinking about time too much can.
00:00:43.408 - 00:00:46.570, Speaker B: Make you go crazy. Oh, my gosh.
00:00:46.910 - 00:00:48.730, Speaker F: The most tarune apology ever.
00:00:48.800 - 00:00:53.194, Speaker C: Okay. Thanks, Tarun. All right, quick intros. First we got Tom, the DeFi maven.
00:00:53.242 - 00:00:54.490, Speaker D: And master of memes.
00:00:54.650 - 00:01:01.294, Speaker C: Next up, we have Tarun, the gigabrain and grand pooh bot Gauntlet, who is perpetually late. Next we have Laura Shin, the self.
00:01:01.332 - 00:01:04.126, Speaker D: Proclaimed journalist and the CEO of the show.
00:01:04.308 - 00:01:08.574, Speaker C: And then we have myself, head hype man at Dragonfly.
00:01:08.702 - 00:01:10.626, Speaker B: There was no alliteration there.
00:01:10.808 - 00:01:13.858, Speaker C: Well, last time we had this big drama about whether she was actually a.
00:01:13.864 - 00:01:15.938, Speaker D: Journalist or not, and she claimed that.
00:01:15.944 - 00:01:23.314, Speaker C: She was, and we said, of course I'm a journalist. Okay, all right, moving on. That's what I said. I said that you said that you're a journalist.
00:01:23.442 - 00:01:25.378, Speaker F: We can say journalist and author.
00:01:25.474 - 00:01:25.974, Speaker G: Hello?
00:01:26.092 - 00:01:34.358, Speaker C: Yes, journalist and author published. Very impressive. Anyway, the three of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat. Nothing we say here is investment advice.
00:01:34.454 - 00:01:36.406, Speaker D: Legal advice, or even life advice.
00:01:36.518 - 00:01:38.806, Speaker C: Okay, so we're starting a little bit late, so let's go ahead and jump.
00:01:38.838 - 00:01:39.818, Speaker D: Into the meat of it.
00:01:39.904 - 00:01:41.566, Speaker C: The big story of the week has.
00:01:41.588 - 00:01:44.206, Speaker D: Been the sanctions on Tornado Cash.
00:01:44.308 - 00:01:45.882, Speaker H: So quick backstory.
00:01:45.946 - 00:01:46.750, Speaker C: Tornado Cash.
00:01:46.820 - 00:01:49.962, Speaker D: It's a privacy protocol mixer on ethereum.
00:01:50.106 - 00:01:57.678, Speaker C: At the time, it's been basically the largest privacy solution on ethereum. It's also the thing that most hacked funds end up getting washed through tornado.
00:01:57.694 - 00:02:03.122, Speaker D: Or mixed through tornado. So last week we saw treasury and.
00:02:03.176 - 00:02:07.634, Speaker C: The Office for Foreign Asset Control also called OFAC they issued the first ever.
00:02:07.672 - 00:02:13.654, Speaker D: Sanctions against a smart contract. So it was not Tornado Cash, the company. It was not the people who are.
00:02:13.692 - 00:02:15.654, Speaker C: Involved in Tornado Cash, but rather the.
00:02:15.692 - 00:02:18.642, Speaker D: Sanctioned entities include Tornado Cash, quote unquote.
00:02:18.706 - 00:02:20.098, Speaker C: Which is not a legal entity, it's.
00:02:20.114 - 00:02:28.326, Speaker D: Just the name of a project. And then specifically the list of a certain number of contracts in Tornado Cash, which are mostly on ethereum.
00:02:28.358 - 00:02:31.302, Speaker C: Now, Tornado Cash actually has other contracts on other chains.
00:02:31.366 - 00:02:32.038, Speaker D: So tornado.
00:02:32.054 - 00:02:33.282, Speaker C: Cash exists on BSc.
00:02:33.366 - 00:02:39.146, Speaker D: It exists on Arbitrum. They were apparently not sanctioned, but the ethereum contracts itself were sanctioned.
00:02:39.338 - 00:02:41.326, Speaker C: So this is the first time we've ever seen this.
00:02:41.428 - 00:02:44.106, Speaker D: We have seen another mixer get sanctioned.
00:02:44.138 - 00:02:49.362, Speaker C: So there's another mixer called Blender, which got sanctioned a while back, but it was a legal entity. And the people who were involved with.
00:02:49.416 - 00:03:02.338, Speaker D: The legal entity, this is the first time we've ever seen this. This is not a person. This is not a company. This is a set of smart contracts and a general project that has been sanctioned by OFAC.
00:03:02.434 - 00:03:07.382, Speaker C: And so in response to these sanctions, we saw an enormous amount of responses from the crypto community.
00:03:07.516 - 00:03:09.234, Speaker H: Huge pushback.
00:03:09.362 - 00:03:13.334, Speaker D: Lots of people, one declaring their solidarity with Tornado Cash.
00:03:13.532 - 00:03:15.866, Speaker C: Tornado Cash immediately started getting blocked from.
00:03:15.888 - 00:03:17.686, Speaker D: A bunch of their vendors.
00:03:17.798 - 00:03:25.280, Speaker C: So Alchemy shut off their API access. Same thing with what was the other one that I think infira Infuria also shut them off.
00:03:26.210 - 00:03:30.270, Speaker D: Their governance forum was taken down. The discord was deleted.
00:03:30.850 - 00:03:32.874, Speaker C: So the GitHub was completely erased.
00:03:32.922 - 00:03:34.778, Speaker B: The githubs of the founders, the githubs.
00:03:34.794 - 00:03:38.654, Speaker A: Of the founders, it's anyone who contributed, anyone to Tornado Cash GitHub got their account deleted.
00:03:38.702 - 00:03:42.658, Speaker C: So their accounts were completely erased from GitHub. Even for non tornado cash contributions, they.
00:03:42.664 - 00:03:44.254, Speaker D: Are just wiped off the face of the Earth.
00:03:44.382 - 00:03:51.846, Speaker C: And we've also seen one of the co founders, Alexey Perzev, who is based in. He's a Russian citizen, but he was in Amsterdam at the time.
00:03:51.948 - 00:03:53.730, Speaker D: He was arrested in Amsterdam.
00:03:53.810 - 00:03:58.994, Speaker C: We still don't know what the charges are. And FOID, which is the enforcement authority.
00:03:59.042 - 00:04:05.542, Speaker D: In the Netherlands, has not said clearly what the charges are, but he's still currently under arrest.
00:04:05.686 - 00:04:07.146, Speaker C: We've had a bunch of commentary from.
00:04:07.168 - 00:04:10.310, Speaker D: Coincenter who's preparing to challenge the sanctions.
00:04:10.390 - 00:04:18.526, Speaker C: As well as the EFF. It's been really crazy to see this stuff playing out in real time. Nobody really knows what's going on. Soon after that, there was what's called.
00:04:18.548 - 00:04:22.366, Speaker D: A dusting attack where some person, I.
00:04:22.388 - 00:04:25.390, Speaker C: Think there's somebody on Twitter proclaimed that they were going to do this.
00:04:25.460 - 00:04:28.386, Speaker D: They sent 0.1 ETH from Tornado Cash.
00:04:28.488 - 00:04:31.070, Speaker C: To a bunch of well known docs addresses.
00:04:31.150 - 00:04:40.466, Speaker D: So including people like Shaq and Justin Sun, they all received 0.1 E. And as a result, a lot of compliance.
00:04:40.498 - 00:04:56.102, Speaker C: Solutions that are supposed to pick up on people who are engaging in interactions with tornado cash, which of course is now sanctioned and so very not okay. They were now suddenly getting blocked from a lot of things that use chain analysis or TRM. So, for example, Ave is now blocking people who've interacted with tornado cache.
00:04:56.166 - 00:04:57.674, Speaker D: The front end, the front end, sorry.
00:04:57.712 - 00:05:08.606, Speaker C: The front end, the front end of Aave, as well as the front end of some other protocols, started blocking people who have addresses that have interacted with tornado cache. And so we're starting to see this broad ripple effect of what happens when.
00:05:08.708 - 00:05:13.246, Speaker D: The biggest player, which is or the biggest tool, which is sanctions, starts to.
00:05:13.268 - 00:05:14.966, Speaker C: Hit and come up against the concepts.
00:05:15.018 - 00:05:17.950, Speaker D: Of decentralization and DeFi.
00:05:18.030 - 00:05:19.458, Speaker C: So what are your guys'thoughts on what.
00:05:19.464 - 00:05:21.662, Speaker D: We'Ve seen with the Tornado Cash sanctions?
00:05:21.726 - 00:05:24.802, Speaker B: Well, you guys should start because you invested in Tornado Cash.
00:05:24.856 - 00:05:26.254, Speaker E: So I feel like we should maybe.
00:05:26.312 - 00:05:28.502, Speaker B: Start with, you know, their story more.
00:05:28.556 - 00:05:30.998, Speaker E: Closely than probably Laura or I do.
00:05:31.084 - 00:05:34.166, Speaker C: Well, we know the team fairly well.
00:05:34.268 - 00:05:36.230, Speaker D: And we do own some torn tokens.
00:05:36.570 - 00:05:39.206, Speaker C: The team broadly, I mean, the surprising.
00:05:39.238 - 00:05:50.060, Speaker D: Thing and this is public, I mean, at this point, Roman and Alexei have shared this already, is that nobody from OFAC really interacted with the Tornado team about anything.
00:05:50.430 - 00:05:58.174, Speaker C: There was no prior notice from treasury that, hey, you guys are under investigation. And if you remember, actually Tornado Cash. So, one, they have a compliance tool.
00:05:58.212 - 00:05:59.870, Speaker D: On the front end that allows you.
00:05:59.940 - 00:06:01.454, Speaker C: Basically like the equivalent of a view.
00:06:01.492 - 00:06:03.966, Speaker D: Key for Monero, where basically you can.
00:06:03.988 - 00:06:13.170, Speaker C: Basically show somebody, look, here is my Tornado Cash address. You can generate a report that basically shows you, look, here's the source of funds, here's where I got it from. But you can selectively disclose this to people you want to disclose it to.
00:06:13.240 - 00:06:14.660, Speaker D: Rather than disclose it to everybody.
00:06:15.190 - 00:06:17.186, Speaker C: And then second, they also, I think.
00:06:17.208 - 00:06:22.966, Speaker D: It was like in April, they started themselves enforcing on their front end because.
00:06:22.988 - 00:06:26.614, Speaker C: Obviously the protocol is decentralized, so they have no control over the protocol, which is one of the core points about.
00:06:26.652 - 00:06:28.806, Speaker B: Tornado Cash when they burned access to.
00:06:28.828 - 00:06:31.350, Speaker E: Every function except deposit and withdraw.
00:06:31.790 - 00:06:32.154, Speaker I: Yes.
00:06:32.192 - 00:06:36.346, Speaker B: So, like, the owners of all functions were gone. So you really can't change anything.
00:06:36.448 - 00:06:41.994, Speaker C: Exactly. And so this may be an important point that I didn't touch on deeply enough. So the big difference between Tornado Cash.
00:06:42.032 - 00:06:47.870, Speaker D: And something like Blender, that Blender was run by a company. If the company gets deleted, Blender was gone.
00:06:47.940 - 00:06:48.874, Speaker H: There was no more blender.
00:06:48.922 - 00:06:51.214, Speaker C: Tornado Cash is an entirely decentralized system.
00:06:51.252 - 00:06:55.646, Speaker D: Of smart contracts that are completely autonomous. No more human intervention is needed for.
00:06:55.668 - 00:06:58.226, Speaker C: Tornado Cash to run. So Tornado Cash really just is a.
00:06:58.248 - 00:07:00.530, Speaker H: Bunch of code that lives on the blockchain.
00:07:03.510 - 00:07:09.880, Speaker C: For the founders. Now, they did own the domain and the website, and the domain got seized as well.
00:07:11.210 - 00:07:14.006, Speaker D: The website, they were blocking on their.
00:07:14.028 - 00:07:19.334, Speaker C: Website any sanctioned addresses from interacting with Tornado cache. So ironically, they kind of did what.
00:07:19.372 - 00:07:22.346, Speaker D: They could for trying to mitigate the.
00:07:22.368 - 00:07:24.282, Speaker C: Degree to which bad actors could use Tornado Cash.
00:07:24.336 - 00:07:29.914, Speaker D: But ultimately, once you create decentralized code that anybody can use, well, anyone can use it.
00:07:30.032 - 00:07:31.766, Speaker C: The blockchain doesn't have the ability, unless.
00:07:31.798 - 00:07:46.938, Speaker D: It'S voted in by governance, to be able to discriminate which actors can and cannot use the blockchain. And so in some way, the question in my mind that this raises is, does this mean that basically privacy is kind of doomed as a category?
00:07:47.034 - 00:07:48.658, Speaker C: Because the reason why Tornado Cash got.
00:07:48.664 - 00:07:50.706, Speaker D: Hit is that that was what the.
00:07:50.728 - 00:07:52.434, Speaker C: Biggest and high profile hacks ended up using.
00:07:52.472 - 00:07:55.566, Speaker D: They ended up using tornado cash. And so North Korea and the Lazarus.
00:07:55.598 - 00:07:57.246, Speaker C: Group, when they're hacking the Ronan Bridge.
00:07:57.278 - 00:07:58.590, Speaker D: And some of these other players, they.
00:07:58.600 - 00:07:59.878, Speaker C: Went through Tornado Cash in order to.
00:07:59.884 - 00:08:01.298, Speaker H: Try to withdraw the funds.
00:08:01.474 - 00:08:04.406, Speaker D: And now that Tornado Cash is no.
00:08:04.428 - 00:08:08.582, Speaker H: Longer viable for that, there will be the next thing that they do, which.
00:08:08.636 - 00:08:11.270, Speaker E: Was some lightning service, is that right?
00:08:11.340 - 00:08:19.354, Speaker B: Yeah, there was some random lightning service that got the proceeds of the Curve Finance. So the Curve Finance Act took place.
00:08:19.392 - 00:08:22.026, Speaker E: After the Tornado Cash hack and I.
00:08:22.048 - 00:08:25.566, Speaker B: Guess the attacker sent it to this like there's this lightning service where you.
00:08:25.588 - 00:08:30.314, Speaker E: Can send ETH to an ETH contract and then relay it to Bitcoin via lightning.
00:08:30.362 - 00:08:33.386, Speaker B: It's much more expensive than using, like, Ren.
00:08:33.498 - 00:08:38.786, Speaker E: But Ren theoretically was centralized because Alameda owned most of the nodes running it.
00:08:38.808 - 00:08:40.558, Speaker B: I think they actually announced they're decentralizing.
00:08:40.574 - 00:08:49.766, Speaker E: Today, probably mainly because Alameda is a kind of easy target, let's say for OFAC, given that a lot of people are US citizens who work there.
00:08:49.948 - 00:08:52.646, Speaker B: But I think there's sort of an.
00:08:52.668 - 00:08:56.534, Speaker E: Interesting thing of what the alternatives are showing up.
00:08:56.572 - 00:09:01.802, Speaker B: I'm not sure privacy is dead as a category in the sense that in fact it just motivates certain people more.
00:09:01.856 - 00:09:04.140, Speaker E: I think there's this weird problem where.
00:09:04.670 - 00:09:08.938, Speaker B: Certainly the funding for privacy projects may.
00:09:09.024 - 00:09:11.782, Speaker E: Initially go down, but there might ironically.
00:09:11.846 - 00:09:15.754, Speaker B: Be kind of like a second wind where people are like oh, we feel more motivated.
00:09:15.802 - 00:09:24.426, Speaker E: Now the real question is are the developers who are actually good at writing privacy software? Which as we've learned from the Zkare.
00:09:24.458 - 00:09:26.194, Speaker B: World is really like five people and.
00:09:26.232 - 00:09:28.286, Speaker E: Maybe four of them are sybils.
00:09:28.478 - 00:09:33.218, Speaker B: I think there's really not that many people who are extremely, extremely good at.
00:09:33.304 - 00:09:39.798, Speaker E: Careful at writing some of this type of code. Because if you make any mistakes, you.
00:09:39.804 - 00:09:42.066, Speaker B: Have things like the Zcash inflation, inflation bug.
00:09:42.098 - 00:09:42.840, Speaker E: And so.
00:09:45.770 - 00:09:48.518, Speaker B: If normal crypto smart contracts.
00:09:48.534 - 00:09:52.410, Speaker E: Are measure 100 times cut once, writing.
00:09:52.750 - 00:09:55.354, Speaker B: Privacy code does measure a million times cut once.
00:09:55.392 - 00:10:01.146, Speaker E: And so I think it's hard to find those people who care about it.
00:10:01.248 - 00:10:03.578, Speaker B: Or are good enough actually to implement this stuff.
00:10:03.664 - 00:10:06.126, Speaker E: But usually those people are motivated by.
00:10:06.148 - 00:10:07.902, Speaker B: Non financial incentive and this is actually.
00:10:07.956 - 00:10:13.950, Speaker E: Kind of an increase in that. So I would actually not be surprised if we see way more things happen.
00:10:14.020 - 00:10:16.142, Speaker B: From anons who are actually just people.
00:10:16.196 - 00:10:18.354, Speaker D: Who maybe I think that the problem.
00:10:18.392 - 00:10:20.146, Speaker C: Is that privacy requires a lot of.
00:10:20.168 - 00:10:22.786, Speaker H: R and D work. Right, sorry.
00:10:22.888 - 00:10:24.050, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure.
00:10:24.200 - 00:10:32.310, Speaker C: It's not something that you can really easily spend together on nights and weekends. You really need a lot of dedicated energy and time and a strong team.
00:10:32.460 - 00:10:42.460, Speaker D: And for a lot of the people who can do it, they have really high opportunity costs. So I think without consistent funding, I think it is actually really hard. Now that being said.
00:10:45.790 - 00:10:46.298, Speaker H: If you look.
00:10:46.304 - 00:10:47.798, Speaker C: At the privacy coins, after the Tornado.
00:10:47.814 - 00:10:49.578, Speaker D: Cash sanctions, they actually didn't go down.
00:10:49.744 - 00:10:52.554, Speaker C: Monero and Zcash were basically unperturbed, even.
00:10:52.592 - 00:10:58.478, Speaker D: Railgun, which is like a kind of tornado Nova copy thing. Like, it dipped a little bit and.
00:10:58.484 - 00:10:59.246, Speaker H: Then it came back.
00:10:59.348 - 00:11:00.526, Speaker D: And so I think the market seems.
00:11:00.548 - 00:11:01.406, Speaker C: To be seeing this as like, okay.
00:11:01.428 - 00:11:02.686, Speaker D: This is just tornado cash.
00:11:02.788 - 00:11:05.306, Speaker G: Yeah, but I actually asked Jerry Brigo.
00:11:05.338 - 00:11:07.310, Speaker F: About this on my show. That was my last question.
00:11:07.380 - 00:11:09.206, Speaker G: Like, does he think privacy is going.
00:11:09.208 - 00:11:11.282, Speaker F: To be the next thing regulators go after in general?
00:11:11.336 - 00:11:12.466, Speaker G: He was like, no.
00:11:12.648 - 00:11:19.926, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the reality is, look, regulators are not thinking that deeply. They're just like, look, tornado cash bad, North Korea bad. So let's put the two together.
00:11:20.028 - 00:11:22.530, Speaker I: I was just struck by how sloppy.
00:11:22.610 - 00:11:30.818, Speaker A: Everything has been so far. I feel like the treasury really fucked up here. Specifically listing the Ethereum deployments of tornado.
00:11:30.834 - 00:11:33.434, Speaker I: Cash, not the other instances listing every.
00:11:33.472 - 00:11:36.842, Speaker A: Single pool that was used, not just 100 ETH pool that North Korea used.
00:11:36.896 - 00:11:42.954, Speaker I: Like, is North Korea going to use the 0.1 ETH pool? Probably not. And yet it was banned anyway.
00:11:43.152 - 00:11:44.538, Speaker A: The fact that tornado cash did have.
00:11:44.544 - 00:11:46.278, Speaker I: This compliance tool, even though, like, well.
00:11:46.304 - 00:11:47.562, Speaker A: Why do we care about privacy?
00:11:47.626 - 00:11:52.926, Speaker I: Why is this a problem? Because somebody can get basically fresh ETH and can use it to cash out.
00:11:53.108 - 00:11:54.686, Speaker A: Well, if I can go to an.
00:11:54.708 - 00:11:57.922, Speaker I: Exchange and show them the compliance tool and say, hey, here's my original address.
00:11:57.976 - 00:11:59.298, Speaker A: Here'S a new address, you can sort.
00:11:59.304 - 00:12:03.646, Speaker I: Of stop that sort of cash out process. And so everything about it just didn't.
00:12:03.678 - 00:12:06.434, Speaker A: Really make any sense. I don't think they really understood what they were doing.
00:12:06.552 - 00:12:10.486, Speaker I: Jerry also brought up the point that how is a smart contract supposed to defend itself?
00:12:10.588 - 00:12:14.834, Speaker A: Other sanctioned entities can defend themselves. They can start a lawsuit.
00:12:14.962 - 00:12:20.662, Speaker I: What is a smart contract supposed to do? And so the whole thing just feels like they didn't really know what they're doing.
00:12:20.716 - 00:12:21.498, Speaker A: And I feel like there's going to.
00:12:21.504 - 00:12:23.660, Speaker I: Be a big legal challenge and even.
00:12:24.030 - 00:12:26.726, Speaker A: We'Re still find out about what's happening with Alexi.
00:12:26.758 - 00:12:32.358, Speaker I: But the fact there have not been charges brought yet. The Dutch police claim that they're launching.
00:12:32.454 - 00:12:34.030, Speaker A: Their own investigation unrelated to the US.
00:12:34.100 - 00:12:35.674, Speaker I: Seems kind of sus.
00:12:35.802 - 00:12:39.418, Speaker A: The entire thing just feels very kind of amateur hour and really disappointing.
00:12:39.514 - 00:12:49.090, Speaker F: Yeah, I don't know if I agree with like I feel like watching this whole thing. What I'm seeing is the same issues that I see with security regulation in the US.
00:12:49.160 - 00:12:51.554, Speaker G: Where I feel like the crypto community.
00:12:51.672 - 00:13:10.006, Speaker F: Has its views about what decentralization mean, what open source code means, and they kind of have these certain distinctions that they're making. Right, but that's like the industry. I mean, when Gary Gensler came in as that SEC chair, people thought like, oh, he gets blockchain. He's going to kind of view things.
00:13:10.028 - 00:13:11.414, Speaker G: The way we do, and yet he.
00:13:11.452 - 00:13:13.802, Speaker F: Understands the technology and he has a totally different view.
00:13:13.856 - 00:13:16.538, Speaker G: Right. Like to the point where the SEC.
00:13:16.624 - 00:13:19.914, Speaker F: Seemed to imply that Ether was no longer a security, and then he seems.
00:13:19.952 - 00:13:21.950, Speaker B: To be or no longer a commodity.
00:13:22.450 - 00:13:23.600, Speaker E: Or no longer.
00:13:25.730 - 00:13:29.658, Speaker F: Yeah, sorry. Before. Gary Gensler? Yeah. And then now he's kind of implying.
00:13:29.674 - 00:13:30.846, Speaker G: That it is a security.
00:13:31.028 - 00:13:45.106, Speaker F: So I feel like what I see time and again is like even when I read for know, the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or whatever, they'll say things like, oh, there was this new crypto legislation. Introduced and it's very friendly to the.
00:13:45.128 - 00:13:48.818, Speaker G: Industry, meaning the Know had a lot.
00:13:48.824 - 00:13:50.770, Speaker F: Of input and they shaped the and.
00:13:50.840 - 00:13:55.094, Speaker G: Like you guys all because you're part of the industry. You're like, well, that's how it is.
00:13:55.292 - 00:13:56.630, Speaker F: These are commodities.
00:13:57.050 - 00:13:59.926, Speaker G: But as we've seen, SEC regulators will.
00:13:59.948 - 00:14:08.586, Speaker F: Look at something that you guys consider decentralized and be like, actually, it's really identifiable people. It's really centralized. And so I feel like it's the same thing.
00:14:08.608 - 00:14:10.634, Speaker G: Again, I just want to add on.
00:14:10.672 - 00:14:12.274, Speaker F: About the Dutch authorities.
00:14:12.422 - 00:14:13.134, Speaker G: So you're right.
00:14:13.172 - 00:14:19.450, Speaker F: We don't know what the charges are and stuff, but I interviewed somebody who used to work at OFAC in Finsen.
00:14:19.530 - 00:14:22.366, Speaker G: And he was saying that essentially we.
00:14:22.388 - 00:14:24.062, Speaker F: Just don't know all the facts about what happened.
00:14:24.116 - 00:14:24.490, Speaker G: Right.
00:14:24.580 - 00:14:33.618, Speaker F: And so it could be that there really are things that are illegal in the Netherlands or whatever jurisdiction this person falls under that give the authorities a.
00:14:33.624 - 00:14:37.122, Speaker G: Legitimate reason to arrest him. In the US.
00:14:37.176 - 00:14:43.814, Speaker F: Where we have stuff about free speech and everything, we have a bunch of US lawyers opining on what this all.
00:14:43.852 - 00:14:47.014, Speaker G: Means, but really, none of that really.
00:14:47.052 - 00:14:47.894, Speaker F: Applies to this person.
00:14:47.932 - 00:14:53.178, Speaker C: As far as you look, you're absolutely right about Alexei. We don't know what the charges are. And once we learn the charges, we.
00:14:53.184 - 00:14:57.818, Speaker D: Might be like, oh, shit, those are serious charges that maybe are incidental to.
00:14:57.824 - 00:14:59.226, Speaker C: His relationship with Tornado Cash. Right.
00:14:59.248 - 00:15:05.374, Speaker D: And you're absolutely right. Dutch system. I don't know anything about the Dutch system, but I think we are in.
00:15:05.412 - 00:15:06.398, Speaker C: Very good position to be able to.
00:15:06.404 - 00:15:09.418, Speaker G: Criticize OFAC, because yeah, I mean, I'm.
00:15:09.434 - 00:15:15.626, Speaker F: Not necessarily disagreeing with you so much as just pointing out that Tom had this very strong opinion.
00:15:15.658 - 00:15:18.146, Speaker G: Oh, they definitely it may be that.
00:15:18.168 - 00:15:24.866, Speaker F: They very well understood what the implications would be, but know, confident that they could make the argument that this was the right step.
00:15:24.968 - 00:15:26.082, Speaker G: That's all I'm saying.
00:15:26.216 - 00:15:34.198, Speaker F: I'm just saying you guys definitely view it all as being one way, but they might have a completely different interpretation of everything.
00:15:34.284 - 00:15:47.846, Speaker A: This whole thing, in my mind, is also very bizarre because it just parallels so much like the crypto wars of the case law that was presented there, and the establishment of code is free speech. And so the whole open source privacy.
00:15:47.878 - 00:15:49.606, Speaker I: Movement, I feel like we're just replaying.
00:15:49.638 - 00:15:51.066, Speaker A: This again, even though we've sort of.
00:15:51.088 - 00:15:53.420, Speaker I: Already seen this happen 30 years in the past.
00:15:53.730 - 00:15:54.480, Speaker G: Right?
00:15:55.970 - 00:16:03.582, Speaker C: I mean, these were the same arguments that were made of why encryption should be illegal. Why are you encrypting stuff? But don't you have something to hide. Doesn't North Korea encrypt stuff?
00:16:03.636 - 00:16:12.066, Speaker F: At least in the US. As far as I understand, regulations around financial things are way stricter than around other people.
00:16:12.168 - 00:16:16.286, Speaker C: Encryption was financial regulation. Right. What was the pro argument for encryption?
00:16:16.318 - 00:16:17.422, Speaker H: Was it credit cards?
00:16:17.566 - 00:16:18.766, Speaker D: That's the thing we need to encrypt.
00:16:18.798 - 00:16:25.686, Speaker C: Sending over the Internet. Right. And it's like, okay, this bad stuff that people do about sending illegal secrets and I don't know whatever nonsense they.
00:16:25.708 - 00:16:27.906, Speaker D: Were obsessed with at that time, that's.
00:16:27.938 - 00:16:29.386, Speaker C: The collateral damage that we're willing to.
00:16:29.408 - 00:16:36.250, Speaker D: Accept in order to allow for good economic activity to go on unperturbed with encryption.
00:16:36.910 - 00:16:46.714, Speaker A: It was also very serious because they were munitions, and so it was an arms control export. And so, obviously, smuggling munitions out of the country is also extremely illegal.
00:16:46.842 - 00:16:48.858, Speaker I: And yet that was sort of changed.
00:16:48.954 - 00:16:49.166, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:16:49.188 - 00:16:51.006, Speaker C: And it took people who were, one.
00:16:51.028 - 00:16:53.134, Speaker D: Obsessed with privacy for anything to change.
00:16:53.172 - 00:16:57.746, Speaker C: Because most normal people don't care or don't even understand what's going on. And second, it took people who were.
00:16:57.768 - 00:17:08.534, Speaker D: Willing to do so at personal risk, because at that time, the developers behind PGP took personal risk in creating technology that they knew was illegal in the and actually, you know, Adam Back, for.
00:17:08.572 - 00:17:10.360, Speaker C: Whatever misgivings I might have about him.
00:17:10.890 - 00:17:14.098, Speaker D: He was a true cipherpunk and a rebel.
00:17:14.114 - 00:17:20.314, Speaker C: I think it wasn't him who had RSA in his T shirt or something. Yeah, I think it was his email.
00:17:20.352 - 00:17:23.690, Speaker D: Signature was the RSA algorithm, which was technically illegal.
00:17:24.190 - 00:17:29.286, Speaker C: It was illegal as a munition, as something that's supposed to only the military.
00:17:29.318 - 00:17:35.534, Speaker D: Is supposed to have these mathematical formulas, which is a ridiculous concept on its face. And now the idea is that this.
00:17:35.572 - 00:17:37.306, Speaker H: Set of code is illegal.
00:17:37.418 - 00:17:40.826, Speaker C: Now, look, did they say that? No, they didn't say it. They said some vague thing about tornado.
00:17:40.858 - 00:17:43.246, Speaker D: Cash and these ethereum addresses, which are.
00:17:43.268 - 00:17:44.478, Speaker C: Not even all the addresses of tornado.
00:17:44.494 - 00:17:47.010, Speaker D: Cash, which is my point, is that.
00:17:47.080 - 00:17:48.514, Speaker C: What they're infringing on is a really.
00:17:48.552 - 00:17:58.102, Speaker D: Important, very difficult conversation that, as a like, we need to grapple with these conversations, not have answers handed from on high.
00:17:58.236 - 00:17:58.774, Speaker H: Right, yeah.
00:17:58.812 - 00:18:01.554, Speaker G: And I'm not saying that I don't.
00:18:01.602 - 00:18:09.686, Speaker F: Agree with you guys. Like, I'm somebody who does consider privacy super important. I find it weird when people don't. But I'm just saying that I feel.
00:18:09.708 - 00:18:12.666, Speaker G: Like very swiftly, the community kind of.
00:18:12.688 - 00:18:14.522, Speaker F: Had a very certain take on everything.
00:18:14.656 - 00:18:20.026, Speaker G: And I was like, well, we don't know their reasoning. They might come out with a lot.
00:18:20.048 - 00:18:22.394, Speaker F: Of reasons why this was the right move.
00:18:22.512 - 00:18:24.640, Speaker G: That's all I'm just trying to say.
00:18:25.010 - 00:18:29.402, Speaker F: You may think they definitely bungled it, and they be like, no, this is exactly what we intended.
00:18:29.466 - 00:18:29.742, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:29.796 - 00:18:32.974, Speaker I: Knowing the average level of competence and.
00:18:33.012 - 00:18:40.162, Speaker A: Intelligence of most of these government officials, I would be very surprised if they had a really good argument as to why was this the move?
00:18:40.216 - 00:18:41.346, Speaker I: I think it's just like, you have.
00:18:41.368 - 00:18:42.418, Speaker A: A hammer and this is where you're.
00:18:42.424 - 00:18:46.862, Speaker I: Going to use instead of from their perspective, it's like what are they really losing?
00:18:47.006 - 00:18:47.458, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:47.544 - 00:18:48.382, Speaker I: It's like a classic.
00:18:48.446 - 00:18:50.578, Speaker A: And you look at all these protocols.
00:18:50.594 - 00:18:53.910, Speaker I: And these companies that have sort of abandoned tornado cash and it's like, yeah.
00:18:53.980 - 00:18:58.274, Speaker A: Are Microsoft lawyers going to stand up for tornado? No, it's extremely high risk, very low reward.
00:18:58.322 - 00:18:59.558, Speaker I: So he's going to get rid of it.
00:18:59.644 - 00:19:02.810, Speaker A: I think the treasury probably did a very similar calculation.
00:19:03.150 - 00:19:03.514, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:19:03.552 - 00:19:05.786, Speaker C: Then you saw who's the legislator who.
00:19:05.808 - 00:19:08.518, Speaker D: Was like finally we stamped out tornado.
00:19:08.534 - 00:19:09.894, Speaker C: Cash which is owned by North Korea.
00:19:09.942 - 00:19:13.546, Speaker F: Oh, it was the Secretary Blinken who.
00:19:13.568 - 00:19:19.230, Speaker C: Claimed that tornado cash was created by North Korea, which is like this whole thing is just like this boogeyman.
00:19:19.730 - 00:19:23.682, Speaker D: Even the title, the title of the post is US.
00:19:23.736 - 00:19:27.202, Speaker C: Treasury sanctions. Notorious virtual currency mixer. Tornado cash.
00:19:27.336 - 00:19:28.980, Speaker H: They're just like, oh my God.
00:19:29.430 - 00:19:42.614, Speaker D: It's just all designed to create this fear. What is tornado cash? It's a privacy protocol that some bad people use. When you sanction this thing, they will find the next thing to use and are we going to sanction that thing next?
00:19:42.732 - 00:19:49.698, Speaker C: Right, like the next hack is going to go somewhere. It might be some lightning thing. It might be they wrap through monero and they go into their monero bridge.
00:19:49.714 - 00:19:53.178, Speaker D: And they use monero or they use Zcash next or they use ren and.
00:19:53.264 - 00:19:58.806, Speaker C: There will always be something that bad people use. And is the theory that we're going to operate with is that we'll whack.
00:19:58.838 - 00:20:03.726, Speaker D: Them all one at a time until one that's not sympathetic shows up and actually fights us.
00:20:03.828 - 00:20:06.846, Speaker F: Yeah, but I have a question. What if the government comes out and.
00:20:06.868 - 00:20:09.214, Speaker G: Is like, okay, here are the ways.
00:20:09.252 - 00:20:14.234, Speaker F: That tornado cash was actually centralized and it's like some kind of nuanced argument.
00:20:14.282 - 00:20:16.660, Speaker G: About I don't know, I'm going to.
00:20:17.110 - 00:20:24.094, Speaker A: Extremely careful to avoid components of centralization. I mean, they burned the admin keys. They didn't run like a relayer.
00:20:24.142 - 00:20:25.506, Speaker I: It was really just you build the code.
00:20:25.528 - 00:20:26.354, Speaker A: They didn't even deploy it.
00:20:26.392 - 00:20:31.046, Speaker I: There was a deployment ceremony. So I'm open to the idea that.
00:20:31.068 - 00:20:33.366, Speaker A: Maybe there's more to it as but that's the thing.
00:20:33.388 - 00:20:38.210, Speaker C: They didn't sanction the people. If you sanction the people then it's like, okay, there's some argument about people are responsible.
00:20:38.290 - 00:20:41.586, Speaker D: They didn't sanction the people. If they sanctioned the people, then I agree.
00:20:41.628 - 00:20:46.074, Speaker B: Well, they didn't know clearly if the Secretary of State thought it was North Korea, they didn't even know the right.
00:20:46.112 - 00:20:51.386, Speaker C: People were very hard not to know who the people biggest contributors on.
00:20:51.488 - 00:20:51.754, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:20:51.792 - 00:21:01.486, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. I'm just saying I don't think they did that much. They clearly did not bubble up all their due diligence. I would say the one thing though that's important. Yeah.
00:21:01.508 - 00:21:06.706, Speaker E: So with regard to a ceremony ceremonies are when basically you have a group.
00:21:06.728 - 00:21:11.122, Speaker B: Of people who each contribute part of the randomness to the initial creation of.
00:21:11.256 - 00:21:14.194, Speaker E: The initial genesis block that is used.
00:21:14.232 - 00:21:22.418, Speaker B: To be the initial point of random number generation for a privacy protocol. So you can think of it as like no one person contributed the initial.
00:21:22.514 - 00:21:25.106, Speaker E: Genesis, kind of like in the satoshi.
00:21:25.138 - 00:21:28.946, Speaker B: Has a famous quote, it's actually many people contributed part of it and got aggregated.
00:21:29.058 - 00:21:37.962, Speaker A: So they did that. But there was also a deployment ceremony. So they basically used create two and said, hey, you can do this transaction and it's going to deploy a component of tornado cash. So they didn't even do that.
00:21:38.016 - 00:21:40.490, Speaker C: Like 30 contracts that were deployed by random people.
00:21:40.560 - 00:21:40.986, Speaker H: Right.
00:21:41.088 - 00:21:42.314, Speaker C: And there was no incentive to do it.
00:21:42.352 - 00:21:44.060, Speaker H: People just did it. Right.
00:21:46.690 - 00:21:50.686, Speaker D: This whole thing clearly this is going.
00:21:50.708 - 00:21:52.686, Speaker C: To be a fight. And the thing that's frustrating about this.
00:21:52.708 - 00:21:54.738, Speaker H: Is that and this is part of.
00:21:54.744 - 00:21:56.418, Speaker C: The imbalance of power between the government.
00:21:56.504 - 00:22:02.866, Speaker D: And individuals is that when OFAC takes a step, even if that step is.
00:22:02.888 - 00:22:07.774, Speaker C: Miscalculated, it's a breach of their abilities.
00:22:07.902 - 00:22:14.386, Speaker D: Or what they're constitutionally allowed to do. The amount of work it takes to undo that step, the amount of legal.
00:22:14.418 - 00:22:15.846, Speaker C: Expenses, the amount of time, the amount.
00:22:15.868 - 00:22:21.594, Speaker D: Of energy, the amount of economic destruction that happens, it's hugely asymmetric, right?
00:22:21.632 - 00:22:23.290, Speaker C: It's going to take years before anything.
00:22:23.360 - 00:22:24.682, Speaker D: Happens on any of this.
00:22:24.816 - 00:22:28.700, Speaker C: Obviously, we'll eventually learn the charges, we'll get more details about what happened and why.
00:22:29.230 - 00:22:36.718, Speaker D: But the amount of work that it takes to push the government back one step is enormous relative to what it.
00:22:36.724 - 00:22:38.126, Speaker H: Took for them to take the step.
00:22:38.308 - 00:22:40.606, Speaker C: And that's part of the frustration of something like this.
00:22:40.628 - 00:22:43.790, Speaker D: And that's part of why regulation by enforcement sucks.
00:22:44.290 - 00:22:45.666, Speaker C: That's why it's so much better to.
00:22:45.688 - 00:22:49.506, Speaker D: Regulate through conversations so that people can.
00:22:49.528 - 00:22:51.714, Speaker C: Actually make decisions as a collective about.
00:22:51.752 - 00:22:54.078, Speaker D: What is the right way to treat privacy.
00:22:54.174 - 00:22:55.662, Speaker C: How do we think about financial privacy?
00:22:55.726 - 00:22:57.530, Speaker D: Is the idea that, look, you don't.
00:22:57.550 - 00:22:58.966, Speaker C: Have the right to financial privacy if.
00:22:58.988 - 00:23:05.622, Speaker D: Bad actors are also sharing that financial privacy with you. Is that the idea? What's theory here?
00:23:05.676 - 00:23:07.946, Speaker B: I mean, the problem, and maybe this.
00:23:07.968 - 00:23:10.794, Speaker E: Is to Laura's point is know, most.
00:23:10.832 - 00:23:11.946, Speaker B: Of the time I think if the.
00:23:11.968 - 00:23:23.226, Speaker E: Government sees a sanctioned country, know, we've had sort of mal relationships with for decades, anywhere near anything, it just becomes.
00:23:23.258 - 00:23:27.726, Speaker B: A stop everything type of decision. Now, there's collateral damage in that, of.
00:23:27.748 - 00:23:30.538, Speaker E: Course, but that is the cost they're.
00:23:30.554 - 00:23:33.314, Speaker B: Willing to pay for enforcing kind of.
00:23:33.352 - 00:23:34.962, Speaker E: This type of thing.
00:23:35.016 - 00:23:37.326, Speaker B: And I agree that there's a nuanced.
00:23:37.358 - 00:23:44.482, Speaker E: Argument against it, but I do not think the government has been kind of.
00:23:44.536 - 00:23:51.526, Speaker B: Told to have a care about a nuanced argument. Their regulators effectively lay down the law of like anything north Korea has to.
00:23:51.548 - 00:23:53.750, Speaker E: Be kind of bludgeoned.
00:23:54.650 - 00:23:56.598, Speaker C: But this is clearly like a very.
00:23:56.684 - 00:24:00.486, Speaker D: Different categorical difference right, with what they usually do.
00:24:00.508 - 00:24:01.866, Speaker C: They usually sanction a foreign person or.
00:24:01.888 - 00:24:03.546, Speaker D: A foreign company, which makes sense, right?
00:24:03.568 - 00:24:07.642, Speaker B: Like, okay, all they're doing is taking that framework and just hoping that it works.
00:24:07.696 - 00:24:13.214, Speaker C: Well, it's like, imagine that they sanctioned literally a code base. They didn't literally sanction the code base.
00:24:13.252 - 00:24:15.454, Speaker D: Because they just said tornado cache, which.
00:24:15.492 - 00:24:18.446, Speaker C: People assumed meant the code base. And so GitHub deleted their code base.
00:24:18.548 - 00:24:25.374, Speaker D: Imagine that they sanctioned this code North Korea uses for their hacking efforts, right?
00:24:25.412 - 00:24:27.210, Speaker C: And it's like, I don't know, some.
00:24:27.300 - 00:24:32.446, Speaker D: Disassembler or something like that. They say North Korea uses this and if we take this offline, North Korea.
00:24:32.478 - 00:24:33.646, Speaker H: Is going to be screwed.
00:24:33.838 - 00:24:35.186, Speaker E: I mean, we do do that, by.
00:24:35.208 - 00:24:45.090, Speaker B: The way, with hardware export restrictions and IP. So I would argue that you're not totally code is free speech, but hardware gates are not free speech, which is like a funny distinction.
00:24:45.170 - 00:24:45.750, Speaker C: Okay.
00:24:45.900 - 00:24:53.894, Speaker B: Export restrictions on hardware is actually quite different, even though it's the same code, can be the same code burned into an FPGA and it will be illegal.
00:24:53.942 - 00:24:55.580, Speaker E: As hardware but not as code.
00:24:56.430 - 00:24:59.626, Speaker C: I think that is a reasonable distinction to make though. But maybe I don't have a good.
00:24:59.648 - 00:25:01.418, Speaker H: Argument why, but I see your point.
00:25:01.504 - 00:25:07.520, Speaker B: I'm just saying, like, they draw the line arbitrarily already to me. So it's just like it's turtles all the way down once you cut the line.
00:25:08.130 - 00:25:10.302, Speaker A: Well, I think now people are talking.
00:25:10.356 - 00:25:12.602, Speaker I: Like, what is sort of the next.
00:25:12.676 - 00:25:23.650, Speaker A: Shoe to drop, right? Like, are Validators supposed to process transactions from sanctioned entities? Is Ethereum supposed to exist and process transactions from sanctioned entities?
00:25:24.230 - 00:25:26.258, Speaker I: It hurtles all the way down when.
00:25:26.264 - 00:25:28.358, Speaker A: You sort of look at the stack and wonder where does it sort of stop?
00:25:28.444 - 00:25:46.746, Speaker F: Yeah, it gets interesting when you look at the questions of after the switch to proof of stake, then is Coinbase going to process a blog that has interactions with tornado cash in it or I mean, it just gets really weird quickly. I don't know. So this may be a segue to.
00:25:46.768 - 00:25:49.658, Speaker G: Our next topic, but I just feel.
00:25:49.664 - 00:25:53.498, Speaker F: Like I keep on learning so many different things about what things will be.
00:25:53.504 - 00:25:55.374, Speaker G: Like post merge that really call into.
00:25:55.412 - 00:25:57.886, Speaker F: Question certain fundamental elements of ethereum and.
00:25:57.908 - 00:26:00.094, Speaker G: Make me wonder, like, oh, is this.
00:26:00.132 - 00:26:01.134, Speaker F: Really going to be a good thing?
00:26:01.172 - 00:26:08.910, Speaker G: Or is this going to end up in creating a lot of potential threats to ethereum?
00:26:09.070 - 00:26:10.098, Speaker F: I don't know.
00:26:10.264 - 00:26:11.540, Speaker D: What are you thinking of?
00:26:12.070 - 00:26:16.498, Speaker F: So this obviously is like the most recent one, just those questions around Validators.
00:26:16.514 - 00:26:21.240, Speaker G: And stuff, but this centralization vector around.
00:26:21.610 - 00:26:31.814, Speaker F: Liquidity staking derivatives and lido and stuff. I did a big show on this and I kind of was surprised that there wasn't a little bit more alarm about it because just as a journalist.
00:26:31.862 - 00:26:36.620, Speaker G: Listening, I'm like, whoa, this seems potentially quite bad.
00:26:37.390 - 00:26:52.142, Speaker F: And then now I'm learning a little bit more about MEP. I don't know a ton about it yet, enough to really give an opinion, but I can definitely say that given the range of things that I've heard. There's really good points being made against.
00:26:52.276 - 00:26:56.802, Speaker G: Institutionalizing mev and just making it something.
00:26:56.856 - 00:27:01.838, Speaker F: That is an accepted part of Ethereum. And so I don't know, there's just like a number of ways where I'm.
00:27:01.854 - 00:27:05.538, Speaker E: Like whoa, shit might go down, maybe.
00:27:05.624 - 00:27:07.202, Speaker B: I will talk about this.
00:27:07.256 - 00:27:09.750, Speaker G: I had a feeling Tarun would have an opinion.
00:27:10.170 - 00:27:13.254, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think the first thing.
00:27:13.292 - 00:27:15.990, Speaker E: Is Ethereum already accepts mev.
00:27:16.650 - 00:27:19.954, Speaker B: There's no ifs, ands or buts about they've in fact centralized it off chain.
00:27:20.002 - 00:27:21.866, Speaker E: And in spite of the fact that.
00:27:21.888 - 00:27:29.530, Speaker B: That'S been tried to be decentralized by multiple attacking auctions, we've centralized to like 70% to 80% of hash power in one.
00:27:29.600 - 00:27:31.482, Speaker E: So the first thing is it's already there.
00:27:31.616 - 00:27:33.434, Speaker B: The question is whether it gets shared.
00:27:33.482 - 00:27:37.294, Speaker E: The revenue gets shared amongst all validators or not actually.
00:27:37.332 - 00:27:38.734, Speaker F: But some other people would say that.
00:27:38.772 - 00:27:43.700, Speaker G: Another question would be should we do more to minimize it rather than just accept it?
00:27:44.950 - 00:27:45.842, Speaker B: There's a couple of things.
00:27:45.896 - 00:27:51.714, Speaker E: I think the first thing is that every Mitigation mechanism has a cost.
00:27:51.832 - 00:27:54.354, Speaker B: So anything that's doing something like, say.
00:27:54.392 - 00:27:57.106, Speaker E: Fair ordering, either is more centralized or.
00:27:57.128 - 00:27:58.598, Speaker B: Like the chain link Arbitrum version of.
00:27:58.604 - 00:28:01.270, Speaker E: The world has a centralized sequencer effectively.
00:28:01.770 - 00:28:03.366, Speaker B: Or, like at least a centralized off.
00:28:03.388 - 00:28:06.854, Speaker E: Chain relay, or it adds a huge.
00:28:06.892 - 00:28:13.254, Speaker B: Amount of latency or kind of like changes to the UX that would be unacceptable to most users or developers.
00:28:13.302 - 00:28:14.698, Speaker E: Like you just have to wait a.
00:28:14.704 - 00:28:16.106, Speaker B: Long time, you have no clue what.
00:28:16.128 - 00:28:28.094, Speaker E: Other transactions are being included like a batch auction. The second thing is there's sort of what I would call my folk Shannon theorem which is like anytime you actually.
00:28:28.132 - 00:28:30.922, Speaker B: Have any uncertainty in a transaction processing.
00:28:30.986 - 00:28:39.086, Speaker E: Mechanism, there's always some amount of minimum extractable value from people who are processing the transaction.
00:28:39.198 - 00:28:41.202, Speaker B: And when you force people to go.
00:28:41.256 - 00:28:44.194, Speaker E: From the environment of like, hey, I.
00:28:44.232 - 00:28:48.466, Speaker B: Submit a transaction to someone who then afterwards is very low latency with all.
00:28:48.488 - 00:28:50.294, Speaker E: The other parties have to interact with.
00:28:50.412 - 00:28:56.534, Speaker B: Then it's like, okay, well the fact that it's very low latency means the net extractable amount is a lot lower.
00:28:56.652 - 00:28:58.038, Speaker E: But now that we're like, hey, we.
00:28:58.044 - 00:29:09.962, Speaker B: Want to actually just send packets or I want to send transactions over the internet which has tons of reliability issues, you can't guarantee that the latency is low. The higher the uncertainty, the higher the extractable value.
00:29:10.016 - 00:29:21.470, Speaker E: So there's no real way around that. That's just like the laws of physics, I guess. The second thing is that there are ways of Mitigating and most of the ways of Mitigating actually involve in making.
00:29:21.540 - 00:29:24.242, Speaker B: The auction better or making the economic process better.
00:29:24.296 - 00:29:26.274, Speaker E: Not like these fair ordering things that.
00:29:26.312 - 00:29:27.854, Speaker B: Change those security assumptions.
00:29:27.982 - 00:29:37.702, Speaker E: Use new cryptography that maybe is not ready for primetime yet. There's trusted hardware which gets broken in every other month.
00:29:37.836 - 00:29:41.638, Speaker B: I'm just waiting for all these SGX things to break at some point.
00:29:41.724 - 00:29:46.950, Speaker A: And protocols are also redesigning themselves over time to reduce mev opportunities so yeah.
00:29:47.100 - 00:29:48.198, Speaker B: I think there's going to end up.
00:29:48.204 - 00:29:50.342, Speaker E: Being like we're just converging to whatever.
00:29:50.396 - 00:29:52.650, Speaker B: The information throughout a minimum.
00:29:52.990 - 00:29:57.882, Speaker C: Paint the intuition that you're trying to convey here because I think it might not be intuitive to most people why.
00:29:57.936 - 00:30:13.978, Speaker D: Mev is intrinsic to blockchains. So mev is basically the idea is like, imagine you're running an exchange, but you're the exchange operator and as the exchange operator, you can ultimately decide what happens when. As long as nobody is obviously cheated.
00:30:14.154 - 00:30:17.770, Speaker C: And when you're a totally centralized exchange, obviously nobody can really tell who's getting cheated.
00:30:17.850 - 00:30:18.926, Speaker D: And so people are just sending you.
00:30:18.948 - 00:30:21.358, Speaker C: Stuff and you're like, oh, you know what, this one goes here and this one is going to go here, and.
00:30:21.364 - 00:30:23.920, Speaker D: Then boom, I'm going to go in between and I'm going to make some money.
00:30:24.370 - 00:30:31.014, Speaker C: Now the tighter that the bounds are, like, let's say that everybody is coordinating, everybody can actually see who's doing what trades when.
00:30:31.052 - 00:30:34.786, Speaker D: Now it's harder for you to cheat, but as long as it's not instant.
00:30:34.898 - 00:30:36.326, Speaker C: The moment two people send you a.
00:30:36.348 - 00:30:37.878, Speaker D: Trade, right, if two people send you.
00:30:37.884 - 00:30:38.966, Speaker C: A trade and you can decide which.
00:30:38.988 - 00:30:43.478, Speaker D: One goes first and you can decide when your trade goes in, there's always some mev.
00:30:43.574 - 00:30:45.402, Speaker C: Mev is just the ability to control.
00:30:45.536 - 00:30:49.606, Speaker D: How the order book plays out. And Tarun's point is that it's impossible.
00:30:49.638 - 00:30:53.498, Speaker C: To get rid of. You can make it better, you can make it faster, you can do whatever, but as long as somebody runs the.
00:30:53.504 - 00:30:56.222, Speaker D: Exchange, they can always do something to.
00:30:56.276 - 00:30:59.358, Speaker C: Make even a little bit of profit. Right now in Ethereum you can make.
00:30:59.364 - 00:31:01.374, Speaker D: A ton of profit because there's seven.
00:31:01.412 - 00:31:03.550, Speaker C: Second blocks or twelve second blocks basically.
00:31:03.620 - 00:31:05.486, Speaker D: Which means that there's a lot of.
00:31:05.508 - 00:31:06.658, Speaker C: Time for you to go in and.
00:31:06.664 - 00:31:08.814, Speaker D: Reorder stuff and do a lot of nonsense.
00:31:08.942 - 00:31:12.018, Speaker I: I also think people give Flashbots for.
00:31:12.104 - 00:31:15.170, Speaker A: Saying, oh, Flashbots is like causing mev, or something like that.
00:31:15.240 - 00:31:17.326, Speaker I: I think the mental model for Flashbots.
00:31:17.358 - 00:31:20.718, Speaker A: Is sort of you seen like the Hamster Dam episode of The Wire where.
00:31:20.744 - 00:31:27.718, Speaker I: It'S like they sort of sanction a portion of the city to basically sell drugs. And I feel like flashbox is sort of like that. In my mind, this is going to.
00:31:27.724 - 00:31:37.114, Speaker A: Happen anyway, so we may as well have an orderly market for it, as opposed to what people previously did, which was like bribe Myers, do Colocation, like.
00:31:37.152 - 00:31:38.698, Speaker I: Crazy gas spikes, stuff like that.
00:31:38.784 - 00:31:48.174, Speaker B: Yeah. And so actually the history of this was that these probabilistic gas auctions led to people spam. Instead of saying like, I want to be after this transaction because I'm front.
00:31:48.212 - 00:31:53.470, Speaker E: Running or back running, you instead would just spam the validator with a million.
00:31:53.540 - 00:32:03.294, Speaker B: Copies of the same transaction with the gas just a little bit below the transaction you want to be after. And if there's many competitors, everyone was spamming and you had this huge spam.
00:32:03.342 - 00:32:09.254, Speaker E: War against the network and it just basically was non productive usage because most.
00:32:09.292 - 00:32:15.714, Speaker B: Of the block would be filled with these failed transactions that were people trying to spam. By moving that separate from the production.
00:32:15.762 - 00:32:18.418, Speaker E: Of a block via the flashbots auction.
00:32:18.514 - 00:32:26.714, Speaker B: You actually at least made it much more orderly for the average user, the non strategic user, the dumb user, the user who just opens MetaMask, hit send.
00:32:26.832 - 00:32:28.970, Speaker E: Not the user who's sitting and actually.
00:32:29.040 - 00:32:32.010, Speaker B: Monitoring the mempool and interacting with these things directly.
00:32:32.090 - 00:32:36.878, Speaker E: So the proposal in Ethereum that is the controversial one that you're talking about.
00:32:37.044 - 00:32:40.602, Speaker B: Is this notion of what's called proposer builder separation.
00:32:40.746 - 00:32:43.438, Speaker E: So the idea is that builders who.
00:32:43.444 - 00:32:45.122, Speaker B: Are block builders, people who are taking.
00:32:45.176 - 00:32:48.206, Speaker E: Sequences of transactions that they see, ordering.
00:32:48.238 - 00:32:50.126, Speaker B: Them, executing them and giving a proof.
00:32:50.158 - 00:33:10.314, Speaker E: That they executed those transactions correctly. They then bid. They say here's how much I'm willing to pay for this block. Or here's how much I want to get paid for this block. And a proposer basically takes those bids and aggregates them and then submits to a network. Now, one of the reasons this is supposed to be better, at least in.
00:33:10.352 - 00:33:12.186, Speaker B: Some sort of more economic sense, is.
00:33:12.208 - 00:33:15.334, Speaker E: That if there actually is a competitive.
00:33:15.382 - 00:33:20.346, Speaker B: Market for block builders, people who are trying to rearrange sequences and find the.
00:33:20.368 - 00:33:23.786, Speaker E: Optimal block to build, then censorship becomes.
00:33:23.818 - 00:33:29.854, Speaker B: Very expensive because you have to pay significantly more than the maximum price that a block builder is willing to offer.
00:33:29.972 - 00:33:34.158, Speaker E: For many blocks to effectively do the censorship attack.
00:33:34.324 - 00:33:35.874, Speaker B: And so the idea of doing this.
00:33:35.912 - 00:33:41.314, Speaker E: Splitting actually does sort of help, but it doesn't mitigate the fact that you.
00:33:41.352 - 00:33:43.586, Speaker B: Still have these supply chain attacks on.
00:33:43.688 - 00:33:49.474, Speaker E: The actual code base, right, where someone puts in the meme was like OFAC.
00:33:49.522 - 00:33:52.502, Speaker B: Guess, like the Ethereum client has like an OFAC check.
00:33:52.636 - 00:33:59.074, Speaker E: So I guess the main thing is these things are just still a little half baked to put in the protocol.
00:33:59.122 - 00:34:01.734, Speaker B: Fully and they're not going to go in immediately.
00:34:01.862 - 00:34:07.286, Speaker E: But at the end of the day there's no way of the best you can do is just add in mitigating.
00:34:07.318 - 00:34:10.230, Speaker B: Mechanisms and then actually share the revenue.
00:34:10.310 - 00:34:11.962, Speaker E: The one problem in proof of work.
00:34:12.096 - 00:34:14.498, Speaker B: Is that you actually cannot share the revenue.
00:34:14.534 - 00:34:22.282, Speaker E: So imagine there's revenue that's earned from mev, you can't actually distribute it to all miners.
00:34:22.346 - 00:34:27.842, Speaker B: So like let's say on each block, when you enter a Proof of Work mev auction, whoever mined that block gets.
00:34:27.896 - 00:34:33.474, Speaker E: All the mev rewards. There's no way of splitting it. And the reason for that is with.
00:34:33.512 - 00:34:36.338, Speaker B: Hash power you actually don't know. And this is a feature and a.
00:34:36.344 - 00:34:37.922, Speaker E: Bug depending on how you view it.
00:34:38.056 - 00:34:44.258, Speaker B: You don't actually know the distribution of all miners. You don't know how much resource each miner is getting. You only approximately know it and you're.
00:34:44.274 - 00:34:49.334, Speaker E: Measuring that based on the difficulty adjustment of the blockchain. And in Proof of stake you could.
00:34:49.372 - 00:34:51.174, Speaker B: Actually take a portion of the mev.
00:34:51.222 - 00:34:56.380, Speaker E: And redistribute it to all validators as sort of a bonus for staying honest.
00:34:57.070 - 00:35:04.714, Speaker B: And in some ways that's sort of the direction that's being moved in to kind of eliminate the centralization effect of sort of a Flashbot auction.
00:35:04.762 - 00:35:06.874, Speaker E: So I would say that the OFAC.
00:35:06.922 - 00:35:15.422, Speaker B: Guest thing got confounded with this thing that wants to be added and then there's lots of FUD and people didn't bother reading carefully any of the documentation.
00:35:15.486 - 00:35:19.102, Speaker E: And so hence we got the storm on the internet.
00:35:19.246 - 00:35:20.980, Speaker D: Yeah, the weird thing.
00:35:21.350 - 00:35:23.634, Speaker C: So all this mev stuff, Flashbots started.
00:35:23.672 - 00:35:24.898, Speaker D: What, early last year?
00:35:25.064 - 00:35:25.650, Speaker H: Like that?
00:35:25.720 - 00:35:28.102, Speaker B: I mean, I guess they were informal for longer.
00:35:28.236 - 00:35:32.086, Speaker C: Yeah, before that, the really interesting thing.
00:35:32.108 - 00:35:37.366, Speaker D: Is that before that there was so initially when Flashbots was first conceived, I.
00:35:37.388 - 00:35:41.814, Speaker C: Was very strongly against Flashbots. We are actually investors in Flashbots now, but I was very strongly against Flashbots.
00:35:41.862 - 00:35:42.874, Speaker H: All three of us.
00:35:42.992 - 00:35:44.214, Speaker D: All three of us are investors.
00:35:44.262 - 00:35:44.860, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:35:45.630 - 00:36:00.766, Speaker D: And basically my view was that I thought they were playing with fire and that the idea, like institutionalizing, the idea of mev extraction is going to make basically Wall Street and traditional enterprises be like, what the hell is going on in there?
00:36:00.948 - 00:36:04.126, Speaker C: You guys are just agreeing to all front run each other and steal from.
00:36:04.148 - 00:36:08.306, Speaker D: Each other and that anybody who's not smart enough or connected enough is just.
00:36:08.328 - 00:36:09.806, Speaker H: Going to get destroyed.
00:36:09.918 - 00:36:11.586, Speaker D: And I thought one of two things.
00:36:11.608 - 00:36:14.066, Speaker C: So one, there was this trend actually of a lot of projects that were.
00:36:14.088 - 00:36:23.478, Speaker D: What we call accelerationist. Basically meaning that this thing will eventually happen, let's make it happen right now and then try to create the perfect version of the eventual state.
00:36:23.644 - 00:36:25.826, Speaker C: Before that point, obviously there were mev.
00:36:25.858 - 00:36:32.010, Speaker D: Auctions and there was mev, but it was kind of a gentleman's agreement not to extract it.
00:36:32.080 - 00:36:32.314, Speaker H: Right.
00:36:32.352 - 00:36:34.326, Speaker C: And so I remember back that wasn't.
00:36:34.358 - 00:36:37.638, Speaker B: True on chain though, there were people definitely on chain.
00:36:37.654 - 00:36:39.100, Speaker D: But in terms of the miners themselves.
00:36:40.030 - 00:36:43.098, Speaker C: I remember in 2017, there was this famous instance, one of the first instances.
00:36:43.114 - 00:36:49.914, Speaker D: Of mev that was very widely known, of which was that f two pool during The Status ICO The Status.
00:36:50.042 - 00:36:55.326, Speaker C: Very old school ICO back in the ICO era. In the status ICO, it was discovered that f two pool had put in.
00:36:55.348 - 00:37:04.466, Speaker D: One of their own transactions to basically mint buy a bunch of tokens in the ICO before anybody else could. And there was a huge shit storm about this bunch of people pulled their.
00:37:04.488 - 00:37:08.738, Speaker C: Hash rates from F Two pool. You were like, oh my god, how could you do this? You're destroying the integrity of ethereum.
00:37:08.834 - 00:37:16.520, Speaker D: And after that the miners learned you don't mess with blocks. It's just part of the ethereum immune system.
00:37:16.890 - 00:37:22.822, Speaker A: There was this paper out, I think this week. I think it was like some basically actually talking about F Two pool.
00:37:22.886 - 00:37:25.434, Speaker C: It was selfish money like thing. Yeah.
00:37:25.552 - 00:37:27.260, Speaker B: Single block selfish money. Yeah.
00:37:27.790 - 00:37:30.338, Speaker C: So F Two pool has gotten with a handy.
00:37:30.534 - 00:37:46.346, Speaker B: But they've always been the kind of bad boy. They're the bad boy, yeah. They were the first ones to move from Flashbots to whatever that competitor was. So I feel like they're always living on the bleeding edge.
00:37:46.378 - 00:37:46.926, Speaker C: They are.
00:37:47.028 - 00:37:50.542, Speaker D: But I think it's interesting because that.
00:37:50.596 - 00:37:52.958, Speaker C: Single event, every single mining pool that.
00:37:52.964 - 00:37:56.646, Speaker D: I'd ever met in Ethereum, they remembered that. They all knew about that event because.
00:37:56.748 - 00:37:58.326, Speaker C: They knew that, look, there are certain.
00:37:58.348 - 00:37:59.878, Speaker D: Things you don't mess with, and one.
00:37:59.884 - 00:38:00.646, Speaker C: Of the things you don't mess with.
00:38:00.668 - 00:38:05.846, Speaker D: Is you don't reorder within a block. And it was always understood that, okay, a mining pool is allowed to have.
00:38:05.868 - 00:38:06.918, Speaker C: Their own transactions at the end of.
00:38:06.924 - 00:38:08.150, Speaker D: A block that are non fee paying.
00:38:08.220 - 00:38:10.994, Speaker C: That just like do payouts and stuff and just kind of administrative stuff.
00:38:11.052 - 00:38:22.026, Speaker D: But you don't mess with the internals of a block. And it was really Flashbots that started to move the overton window of what is acceptable within Ethereum, which is that no mev is a thing.
00:38:22.208 - 00:38:27.198, Speaker C: These mev auctions are happening on chain through PGAs. We should institutionalize them and remove the.
00:38:27.204 - 00:38:31.294, Speaker D: Noise from the mempool and put it in a separate section for Pros over here.
00:38:31.332 - 00:38:31.758, Speaker C: And everyone.
00:38:31.844 - 00:38:34.194, Speaker E: Arguably, though, I would say that I.
00:38:34.232 - 00:38:36.706, Speaker B: Think that we would not be at.
00:38:36.728 - 00:38:39.954, Speaker E: The point where Ethereum actually was able.
00:38:39.992 - 00:38:41.746, Speaker B: To support so many different types of.
00:38:41.768 - 00:38:47.566, Speaker E: Applications with increasingly less sophisticated users without Flashbots.
00:38:47.598 - 00:38:51.814, Speaker B: And it's not like it's inaccessible in theory. Like anyone could just change their RPC and use it.
00:38:51.852 - 00:38:58.166, Speaker E: So I would just say that the main thing I always take kind of.
00:38:58.188 - 00:39:13.130, Speaker B: I'm always surprised at is there's just always people like, oh, it's so extractive and nothing. I don't really understand how you expect this thing to be an economic system and not have some type of non strategy proofness.
00:39:13.210 - 00:39:15.450, Speaker E: First of all, there's no incentive compatibility.
00:39:15.530 - 00:39:22.702, Speaker B: In any of this stuff as designed. Only at the consensus layer. Does anyone even care about measuring whether.
00:39:22.756 - 00:39:24.958, Speaker E: Incentives are sort of compatible once you.
00:39:24.964 - 00:39:29.634, Speaker B: Get to application layer and literally no one actually even bothers checking if their mechanism works.
00:39:29.672 - 00:39:33.060, Speaker E: They just try to deploy and mint the token and get out.
00:39:33.510 - 00:39:40.006, Speaker B: And if people are like that, then obviously they're going to create all these horribly inefficient things. I remember when Artbox came out, which.
00:39:40.028 - 00:39:48.726, Speaker E: Is like this big NFT launch pad thing, they had this horribly implemented Dutch auction where it would always start at.
00:39:48.748 - 00:39:54.954, Speaker B: A valuation that's lower than what all the bidders wanted. And so they basically created they took this auction that was supposed to actually.
00:39:54.992 - 00:39:57.066, Speaker E: Be like an orderly thing and then.
00:39:57.088 - 00:40:03.534, Speaker B: They turned into the worst type of first price auction because everyone is like, oh, this is 50% cheaper than what I really think the value is.
00:40:03.572 - 00:40:07.070, Speaker E: So I'm going to spam for this and stuff like that.
00:40:07.140 - 00:40:08.718, Speaker B: The average person who participated in an.
00:40:08.724 - 00:40:11.246, Speaker E: Art blocks auction would have gotten zero.
00:40:11.428 - 00:40:14.622, Speaker B: If not for flashbots, so you have to give them a lot of credit.
00:40:14.676 - 00:40:17.434, Speaker C: For look, to be clear, I totally give Flashbots credit.
00:40:17.492 - 00:40:20.674, Speaker D: I mean, at this point it's clear that we're not going back.
00:40:20.712 - 00:40:27.460, Speaker B: Look at Solana. I mean, a lot of the problems on Solana happened because they didn't have an orderly mechanism and that fees were zero.
00:40:28.870 - 00:40:31.634, Speaker G: Wait, before this turns into yet another.
00:40:31.672 - 00:40:48.246, Speaker F: Solana patching show, I want to ask because again, I am still doing my research on Mev, but as far as I understand, people are pointing out that there are certain regulations against this type of thing and so some people are saying like, oh, this literally is kind of like illegal. So I was wondering, I think it's.
00:40:48.278 - 00:40:49.498, Speaker C: Plausible that we moved to proof of.
00:40:49.504 - 00:40:52.620, Speaker D: Stake that some exchanges don't extract mev 100%.
00:40:52.990 - 00:40:57.930, Speaker A: Yeah, it's optional now, right? Like if you're running an ethereum client.
00:40:58.010 - 00:40:59.326, Speaker I: You can use Mev Boost, which is.
00:40:59.348 - 00:41:00.974, Speaker A: A software which they're basically to take.
00:41:01.012 - 00:41:03.470, Speaker I: These blocks and I suspect these big.
00:41:03.620 - 00:41:06.350, Speaker A: Like, coinbase, right, they're not going to run Mev Boost.
00:41:07.170 - 00:41:08.314, Speaker I: It's too sketchy.
00:41:08.362 - 00:41:10.178, Speaker G: So yeah, I find that weird that.
00:41:10.264 - 00:41:15.122, Speaker F: One group is going to be like, okay, we'll do the thing that's illegal and then another group is like, okay, we have to abide by the law.
00:41:15.176 - 00:41:16.962, Speaker B: Right, but that's always been true in this.
00:41:17.016 - 00:41:17.846, Speaker C: Yeah, when has that not been true?
00:41:17.868 - 00:41:23.400, Speaker B: When has that not been true? We were just talking about tornado. That's the perfect example of this.
00:41:23.770 - 00:41:27.810, Speaker F: Well wait, but tornado so obviously now it's sanctioned.
00:41:27.890 - 00:41:30.690, Speaker G: But unless you're a North Korean hacker.
00:41:30.770 - 00:41:33.954, Speaker F: A lot of people were just using Facetious.
00:41:34.002 - 00:41:37.834, Speaker C: Yeah, tornado is obviously not sanctions are not backwards looking. Sanctions are forward.
00:41:37.872 - 00:41:41.450, Speaker F: Okay, so you agree that Mev Boosts then would be illegal?
00:41:42.190 - 00:41:43.926, Speaker B: Not really illegal.
00:41:43.958 - 00:41:52.426, Speaker C: It's that, I mean, if anything were to happen, it would probably be civil and it's like you're opening yourself up to lawsuits and you're opening up your coinbase. Why would you want to bother?
00:41:52.458 - 00:41:58.866, Speaker B: Yeah, the real question is does Uniswap get regulated as like a swaps dealer or like a broker dealer at least if you care about US regulation, if.
00:41:58.888 - 00:42:01.698, Speaker E: That ever was true and kind of.
00:42:01.704 - 00:42:03.314, Speaker B: Like the sanction is forward looking, any.
00:42:03.352 - 00:42:06.918, Speaker E: Future Uniswap transaction gets coffee, then I agree it's true.
00:42:07.084 - 00:42:20.300, Speaker B: But right now it's like the government doesn't even seem to be able to distinguish the difference between an LP share and ERC 20 for taxes. Forget about for understanding how to redeem an LP share.
00:42:20.670 - 00:42:23.146, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think the reality is.
00:42:23.168 - 00:42:27.222, Speaker D: That a lot of ethereum exists in a global environment.
00:42:27.366 - 00:42:28.106, Speaker H: Right.
00:42:28.288 - 00:42:30.342, Speaker C: Most people who use ethereum don't live in America.
00:42:30.406 - 00:42:31.610, Speaker D: They are not Americans.
00:42:31.950 - 00:42:34.800, Speaker B: The weird part though is most developers do.
00:42:36.850 - 00:42:38.906, Speaker C: Developers are unfortunately subject to American laws.
00:42:38.938 - 00:42:40.702, Speaker D: But ethereum itself is not.
00:42:40.756 - 00:42:41.998, Speaker C: And you have to build ethereum in.
00:42:42.004 - 00:42:43.646, Speaker D: Such a way that it works no.
00:42:43.668 - 00:42:44.622, Speaker H: Matter where you are.
00:42:44.756 - 00:42:49.058, Speaker D: And Mev is something that just comes out of the incentives, comes out of.
00:42:49.064 - 00:42:50.050, Speaker H: The game theory, right?
00:42:50.120 - 00:42:51.122, Speaker D: And it kind of doesn't matter.
00:42:51.176 - 00:42:54.990, Speaker C: If you make mev illegal in one country, someone in a different country will extract mev.
00:42:55.070 - 00:42:56.354, Speaker B: I'll give you another example.
00:42:56.472 - 00:43:01.094, Speaker E: Arguably, if the US. Government ever said that an online ad.
00:43:01.132 - 00:43:02.694, Speaker B: Impression, which is sort of like when.
00:43:02.732 - 00:43:12.202, Speaker E: You go buy a facebook ad, you're buying like a future right, to a certain set of demographics that get a certain ad, right? It's basically a security.
00:43:12.336 - 00:43:19.994, Speaker B: You could argue that it actually is a fucking common enterprise and it is a security. If the government really wanted to go.
00:43:20.032 - 00:43:22.794, Speaker E: After facebook back when they cared more.
00:43:22.912 - 00:43:24.314, Speaker B: They would probably have just been like.
00:43:24.352 - 00:43:27.438, Speaker E: Ad impressions are securities and you're a.
00:43:27.444 - 00:43:31.006, Speaker B: Broker dealer, so you can't front run everyone, but instead it's not right.
00:43:31.028 - 00:43:32.658, Speaker E: And like, oh, if you look at.
00:43:32.664 - 00:43:37.490, Speaker B: Google and facebook, their entire business model is do mev for yourself.
00:43:37.640 - 00:43:44.626, Speaker E: You run the auction, you sequence when particular bidders are bidding, and 90% of.
00:43:44.648 - 00:43:47.014, Speaker B: Bidders use automated bidding strategies that you.
00:43:47.052 - 00:43:49.560, Speaker E: Made as the company.
00:43:49.930 - 00:43:52.066, Speaker B: Their business model is literally only mev.
00:43:52.098 - 00:43:53.750, Speaker E: At least here, it's like, competitive.
00:43:55.210 - 00:43:57.026, Speaker D: I like this idea of extending mev.
00:43:57.058 - 00:44:05.450, Speaker B: To other, but that is what it is. Let's call a donkey an ass. When it is an ass, it is in this case.
00:44:05.520 - 00:44:07.610, Speaker D: All right, you heard of your first.
00:44:07.680 - 00:44:10.090, Speaker C: Facebook, the biggest mev extractor of all time.
00:44:10.240 - 00:44:12.330, Speaker B: I mean, it's the same concept.
00:44:13.390 - 00:44:18.186, Speaker C: I understand the point. I understand the point. I always enjoy the fact that it's.
00:44:18.218 - 00:44:19.326, Speaker A: Like a second price auction, though.
00:44:19.348 - 00:44:24.962, Speaker E: I mean, you do get it's not second price anymore. They literally got rid of google.
00:44:25.016 - 00:44:28.082, Speaker B: Sort of didn't sort of some some.
00:44:28.136 - 00:44:29.490, Speaker E: Auctions are, some aren't.
00:44:30.630 - 00:44:32.706, Speaker D: Anyway, all right, let's move away from.
00:44:32.808 - 00:44:41.254, Speaker C: Google and facebook auctions. So actually, one of the things that I want to chat about that we brought up before the show started, when tarun was still not here.
00:44:41.292 - 00:44:41.750, Speaker F: Oh, right.
00:44:41.820 - 00:44:45.046, Speaker C: Is see, aren't you no, you got.
00:44:45.068 - 00:44:49.954, Speaker F: More bonding, had a great discussion, and the listeners would have benefited. But anyway, this is really all your fault.
00:44:50.002 - 00:44:50.818, Speaker C: This is really all your fault.
00:44:50.834 - 00:44:52.870, Speaker D: Tarun silver lining.
00:44:53.310 - 00:44:57.002, Speaker C: So there's been a lot of hubbub this week in the NFT community about.
00:44:57.056 - 00:45:02.106, Speaker D: These exchanges that are no longer enforcing royalties. So royalties, for those who are not.
00:45:02.128 - 00:45:16.078, Speaker C: Aware, generally when you affect a sale of an NFT on a platform like OpenSea, there's a certain percentage of each sale that goes back to the original creator, and the creator specifies what they want the royalty to be for that collection. So it turns out and a lot of people did not know this, and.
00:45:16.084 - 00:45:24.066, Speaker D: I actually didn't know this until I learned it very recently, is that these royalties are not enforced at the smart contract layer. The way a lot of people talk.
00:45:24.088 - 00:45:27.294, Speaker C: About NFTs is like, oh, NFTs are this way that creators can get paid and blah, blah, blah.
00:45:27.342 - 00:45:31.702, Speaker D: But actually these royalties are kind of like a suggestion it's kind of like.
00:45:31.756 - 00:45:33.366, Speaker C: You just sort of tape something on.
00:45:33.468 - 00:45:36.454, Speaker D: Your little bucket that you're busking with.
00:45:36.492 - 00:45:46.106, Speaker C: And it's just like, please. The suggested donation is 5%, but it's up to the actual exchange to actually enforce that. And it turns out there are a couple of exchanges. One of them is Element and the.
00:45:46.128 - 00:45:49.414, Speaker D: Other one is pseudoswap that are not enforcing royalties.
00:45:49.462 - 00:45:50.678, Speaker C: And as a result, they're actually growing.
00:45:50.694 - 00:45:52.398, Speaker D: Quite a bit in trading volume because.
00:45:52.484 - 00:45:54.266, Speaker C: They'Re cheaper than the places that enforce.
00:45:54.378 - 00:45:56.794, Speaker B: Since Tom is the real NFT degen.
00:45:56.842 - 00:46:00.954, Speaker E: Here, I would love a little TLDR.
00:46:01.002 - 00:46:05.426, Speaker B: Of what pseudoswap actually does because I actually have not really understood I mean.
00:46:05.448 - 00:46:07.940, Speaker I: I feel like that's we can talk about it.
00:46:09.190 - 00:46:16.354, Speaker B: I feel like the reason that they've become popular is also their new mechanism, unlike Openc, is just the lack of royalty. Oh, really?
00:46:16.392 - 00:46:19.090, Speaker C: Well, no, I think that's a portion.
00:46:19.170 - 00:46:20.438, Speaker A: You can think of it as I.
00:46:20.444 - 00:46:22.178, Speaker I: Know you're a big Nftx fan.
00:46:22.354 - 00:46:23.590, Speaker A: You can think of it as basically.
00:46:23.660 - 00:46:26.774, Speaker I: A sort of univ three version of.
00:46:26.812 - 00:46:29.254, Speaker A: Nftx, where basically any individual can set.
00:46:29.292 - 00:46:31.722, Speaker I: Their own sort of curve for the.
00:46:31.776 - 00:46:34.054, Speaker A: NFTs that they have. And then they use a routing contract.
00:46:34.102 - 00:46:38.150, Speaker I: That aggregates over all the curves. So you get better execution, better collection.
00:46:38.230 - 00:46:39.142, Speaker B: Or like per collection.
00:46:39.206 - 00:46:39.866, Speaker I: Okay.
00:46:40.048 - 00:46:44.570, Speaker A: And lower fees. You're not doing the whole fractionalized two C swap thing.
00:46:44.640 - 00:46:46.494, Speaker I: So, yeah, it's just like a better.
00:46:46.532 - 00:46:48.186, Speaker A: Cheaper place to trade NFTs.
00:46:48.218 - 00:46:50.014, Speaker I: And the NFT meta is trending towards.
00:46:50.052 - 00:46:52.126, Speaker A: Floor trading and so it sort of all kind of lines up.
00:46:52.148 - 00:46:53.918, Speaker E: Oh, so you don't even care which one you get.
00:46:54.004 - 00:46:55.038, Speaker I: So you don't care.
00:46:55.204 - 00:46:58.638, Speaker A: You can actually specify it's sort of like Nftx in that way, but it's.
00:46:58.654 - 00:47:00.146, Speaker I: Like, hey, if you're trying to move.
00:47:00.328 - 00:47:06.786, Speaker A: A lot of money through an NFT collection, maybe you're less picky about that and it's more optimized for that sort.
00:47:06.808 - 00:47:10.658, Speaker I: Of meta with NFTs. But yes, no royalties.
00:47:10.754 - 00:47:11.014, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:47:11.052 - 00:47:15.014, Speaker I: I mean, it's this very weird dynamic where I feel like we wouldn't even.
00:47:15.052 - 00:47:15.874, Speaker A: Be having this conversation.
00:47:15.922 - 00:47:18.662, Speaker I: Had OpenSea not opted in to have.
00:47:18.716 - 00:47:20.598, Speaker A: Royalties in the first place.
00:47:20.684 - 00:47:27.798, Speaker I: But they did, which sort of set the standard. Which created this impression among everybody, including very sophisticated people, that royalties are somehow.
00:47:27.814 - 00:47:29.178, Speaker A: Enforced on a smart contract level, as.
00:47:29.184 - 00:47:31.638, Speaker I: Opposed to just being this suggestion that.
00:47:31.664 - 00:47:33.594, Speaker A: Exchanges choose to enforce.
00:47:33.722 - 00:47:41.520, Speaker I: And I think as a result, it's like, well, are exchanges incentivized to use royalties? No, because it increases the price for.
00:47:42.210 - 00:47:44.186, Speaker A: The assets and sort of reduces trading.
00:47:44.298 - 00:47:45.722, Speaker I: Do users want royalties?
00:47:45.866 - 00:47:50.318, Speaker A: Some do that I think want to respect creators and give them attribution, but most don't.
00:47:50.334 - 00:47:53.298, Speaker I: They just want a cheaper NFT. And so it's like, why are we.
00:47:53.304 - 00:47:55.362, Speaker A: Even in this meta in the first place of people?
00:47:55.416 - 00:48:00.946, Speaker B: Well, remember there was a supply side problem in 2019 and 2020 where forget.
00:48:00.978 - 00:48:03.846, Speaker E: About the demand side, there was just.
00:48:03.868 - 00:48:13.738, Speaker B: Like no one you could convince who is like a relatively prominent artist to even make one of these things. And so the royalties were actually like a way of bootstrapping the supply side.
00:48:13.904 - 00:48:20.954, Speaker E: Before kind of the demand side came after DFI summer. So I do think the supply side.
00:48:20.992 - 00:48:24.958, Speaker C: Piece that's an interesting argument. The royalties were there to bring people in at the beginning, but now the.
00:48:24.964 - 00:48:27.230, Speaker B: Demand who are more the creators.
00:48:28.290 - 00:48:33.806, Speaker F: But this is exactly my argument of why creators were interested in know Mark.
00:48:33.828 - 00:48:35.890, Speaker G: Cuban on my show was like, oh.
00:48:35.960 - 00:48:37.378, Speaker F: I got interested when I realized I.
00:48:37.384 - 00:48:41.458, Speaker G: Could sell tickets to Dallas mavs games and enforcer royalty and all.
00:48:41.464 - 00:48:58.278, Speaker F: The, you know, Creators are very interested in, you know, as a Creator myself, I have to say that I personally would totally want to know some of my resale value over to other Creators. Yeah, I don't want to go into the economics necessarily being love to go.
00:48:58.284 - 00:48:59.462, Speaker C: Into the economics of it.
00:48:59.596 - 00:49:09.754, Speaker F: Okay, so for you, for a unit of work, you make like, this amount of money. For me, for a unit of work, I make amount of money, especially with writing in particular.
00:49:09.872 - 00:49:10.540, Speaker H: Sure.
00:49:12.190 - 00:49:17.406, Speaker F: It's like super offensive. You don't even know how many people have tweeted things at me like, why don't you give things our way for free?
00:49:17.428 - 00:49:18.766, Speaker G: And I'm like, oh, because it took.
00:49:18.788 - 00:49:29.042, Speaker F: Me X amount of time to make that. And that's what I do for a living. I mean, yes, people like you like VCs, you can write for free because you make your money doing something else. But this is actually what I do to make money.
00:49:29.096 - 00:49:29.554, Speaker G: Right?
00:49:29.672 - 00:49:43.906, Speaker F: And this goes to my point. We were discussing this while Truan was late. I was kind of annoyed when I opened my Twitter application and I see Spencer Noon. No offense to Spencer, I've never met him in person, but he's a Variant.
00:49:43.938 - 00:49:46.520, Speaker G: Fund and he tweeted something.
00:49:47.290 - 00:49:55.226, Speaker F: You know, when artists songs are streamed, they shouldn't make any money because the song is effectively an advertisement for their work.
00:49:55.328 - 00:50:00.054, Speaker G: And I was like, do you know any musicians?
00:50:00.102 - 00:50:03.046, Speaker F: Because musicians, they are much more likely.
00:50:03.078 - 00:50:05.086, Speaker G: To say, I should earn so much.
00:50:05.108 - 00:50:22.274, Speaker F: More for my streams. They're more likely to complain about the fact that they kind of have to tour to make enough money. It's like the actual work they do doesn't make enough, so they have to do this additional thing on top to actually make the like and I was surprised know, Jesse Walden is part of Variant Fund.
00:50:22.312 - 00:50:23.634, Speaker G: And I was a little bit like.
00:50:23.832 - 00:50:39.378, Speaker F: I feel like Jesse definitely knows musicians, so you guys should have talked to some to understand what their world is like from a business perspective. And then I was surprised, like, Kyle Simone backed Spencer Noon up and I was like, I just tweeted back at them. I was like, you guys must not know any musician.
00:50:39.474 - 00:50:41.722, Speaker D: Just he's married to a yeah.
00:50:41.776 - 00:50:52.758, Speaker F: Yeah. So that's why it surprises me. Spencer did not seem to understand the economics of being A you Know, it's like they want musicians to Be like entrepreneurs and have this like, oh, I'm.
00:50:52.774 - 00:50:56.346, Speaker G: Going to because Kyle's Point was there's.
00:50:56.378 - 00:51:20.262, Speaker F: A ton of businesses where you give away the core Business for free and then you charge for stuff on top. And I'm Like, but a musician wants to make Music and be paid for. It not like, have this whole business Model that's super Complicated, where they do the Work, but they do that for free and then they do this other thing to make the money. And it's not what they want to do. They want to make money. They want to make money, and they want to be Paid and be paid for it. Yeah, I was a little bit like.
00:51:20.396 - 00:51:23.494, Speaker G: And I don't normally get kind of.
00:51:23.612 - 00:51:36.010, Speaker F: Emotional when I'm looking at Twitter. I'm, like, fascinated by the crypto Discussion, but I don't normally have a sense of personal Involvement, but I have Musician Friends, so I Just was like, you do not understand this World at all.
00:51:36.160 - 00:51:36.570, Speaker H: Anyway.
00:51:36.640 - 00:51:39.206, Speaker C: Okay, so let me give the supervillain.
00:51:39.238 - 00:51:43.950, Speaker D: Argument for why I Think actually I'm fine with the idea of destroying royalties.
00:51:45.090 - 00:51:53.742, Speaker C: Because you asked about the economic Argument. You asked about the economic argument. So I'm going to give the Economic say, let's ignore music and all this NFT Stuff, right?
00:51:53.796 - 00:51:55.550, Speaker D: The classic Thing is selling tickets.
00:51:56.130 - 00:51:59.406, Speaker C: When you're selling tickets to some basketball.
00:51:59.438 - 00:52:02.706, Speaker D: Game, very often what Will Happen is scalpers will come in and they'll buy.
00:52:02.728 - 00:52:04.914, Speaker C: The tickets so they can go and resell them later to people who actually.
00:52:04.952 - 00:52:06.674, Speaker D: Want to Sit down and watch the show.
00:52:06.792 - 00:52:09.666, Speaker H: So if A scalper bought the tickets.
00:52:09.698 - 00:52:12.102, Speaker D: From you and there was a tax.
00:52:12.156 - 00:52:15.714, Speaker C: That was automatically enforced when they resold the tickets to somebody else, the scalper.
00:52:15.762 - 00:52:18.070, Speaker H: Would pay you less, right?
00:52:18.140 - 00:52:23.880, Speaker D: Because they have to let's say I have to pay 25% of What I make from you.
00:52:24.250 - 00:52:26.182, Speaker C: You automatically enforce let's not say how.
00:52:26.236 - 00:52:27.346, Speaker D: Let's just say you have a software.
00:52:27.378 - 00:52:32.622, Speaker C: System that does all this, right? When I Reassign Ticket to somebody Else, I have to pay 25% of whatever.
00:52:32.676 - 00:52:34.542, Speaker D: I charge them back to you.
00:52:34.596 - 00:52:35.518, Speaker C: Then I'm going to be willing to.
00:52:35.524 - 00:52:37.038, Speaker D: Pay you less the first time that.
00:52:37.044 - 00:52:39.006, Speaker C: I scalp the tickets because I know I'm going to get less at the.
00:52:39.028 - 00:52:40.606, Speaker D: End because I have to pay 25%.
00:52:40.628 - 00:52:42.240, Speaker H: To hand it off to Somebody, right?
00:52:43.490 - 00:52:45.086, Speaker C: The Tax that you pay when you.
00:52:45.108 - 00:52:50.500, Speaker D: Resell The Asset, it flows through to the original Value that the scalper is willing to pay.
00:52:51.110 - 00:52:53.826, Speaker C: If the scalper knows they're going to make less money because they have to.
00:52:53.848 - 00:52:55.399, Speaker D: Resell it, then they're not going to.
00:52:55.399 - 00:52:56.050, Speaker C: Be willing to pay us.
00:52:56.120 - 00:53:07.734, Speaker B: You Are making some assumption about the velocity of resale here, which I think the Point Is, musicians are not like they're not constantly trying to churn their revenue. This is the reason Music NFTs will never happen.
00:53:07.852 - 00:53:12.490, Speaker C: Here's the basic shape of the argument. I'm. Making, right, is that if you remove.
00:53:13.230 - 00:53:17.802, Speaker D: Royalties, then people will be willing to pay more for the initial mint, because.
00:53:17.856 - 00:53:19.802, Speaker C: The initial mint is going to be worth more. Right.
00:53:19.856 - 00:53:23.738, Speaker D: I can now sell this thing for higher than I could originally sell it.
00:53:23.744 - 00:53:45.490, Speaker B: For, but you're assuming I'll be willing. Resale is happening fast enough that people care. Like, there's some trade off between royalty and resale frequency. Right. And that's sort of like I don't think for musicians, it's like that even for artists, fine artists. It's not like, why would it collectibles? It's clearly like, people want to just constantly, like, Beanie Baby trade, pokemon card trade.
00:53:45.830 - 00:53:49.446, Speaker C: If you're structuring it purely as, like, a donation and you're not actually yeah.
00:53:49.628 - 00:54:00.534, Speaker B: User reseller, or if it's like in that case, if it's like, fine art where it's like a tax harbor for someone else, then yeah, the royalty is the only way that the artist ever gets paid.
00:54:00.652 - 00:54:10.742, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's kind of the part that seems ridiculous to me, which is the velocity of trading of NFTs, which is like, should Board Apes be making $50 million a year from people trading board Apes?
00:54:10.886 - 00:54:12.186, Speaker I: That seems pretty high.
00:54:12.288 - 00:54:19.102, Speaker A: Maybe it should be a per transaction fee, or it should be kind of something nominal versus the 10% that you.
00:54:19.156 - 00:54:22.138, Speaker E: But when you buy merch, I don't.
00:54:22.154 - 00:54:24.766, Speaker B: Know if, like a music festival or.
00:54:24.788 - 00:54:26.574, Speaker E: A concert or something, you're not going.
00:54:26.612 - 00:54:44.006, Speaker B: And trying to resell the merch immediately. That's the problem with all these music entities. They're assuming that people want to resell the rights to it's. Like, why would I even own intellectual property or fake intellectual property and immediately sell it? It only makes sense for these weird collectible things. I just don't think it like, for.
00:54:44.028 - 00:54:46.614, Speaker E: People who are making these things where.
00:54:46.652 - 00:54:53.042, Speaker B: They'Re not trying to be businesses, and they're just like, hey, we're in our own creator. I just don't think they care about the velocity.
00:54:53.106 - 00:54:57.238, Speaker C: Well, I just don't think it makes a difference. Right. I think at the end of the day, if you get two and a.
00:54:57.244 - 00:54:58.838, Speaker D: Half percent of every future sale of.
00:54:58.844 - 00:55:01.566, Speaker H: This asset, right, then it could be.
00:55:01.588 - 00:55:04.250, Speaker C: Time expectation, an economic expectation.
00:55:04.410 - 00:55:06.586, Speaker D: If you don't have those royalties, you'll.
00:55:06.618 - 00:55:07.454, Speaker C: Make that two and a half percent.
00:55:07.492 - 00:55:10.814, Speaker D: More upfront, and you could decide that.
00:55:10.852 - 00:55:12.238, Speaker C: You want to spread out that two.
00:55:12.244 - 00:55:13.854, Speaker D: And a half percent over time by.
00:55:13.892 - 00:55:16.510, Speaker C: Taking two and a half percent of whatever you're assuming a user.
00:55:16.590 - 00:55:28.294, Speaker B: No, this is the difference between something that's like strategy proof and sort of obviously strategy proof. Strategy proof means I can bid my true valuation and I actually get but.
00:55:28.332 - 00:55:30.454, Speaker E: The problem with strategy proofness is these.
00:55:30.492 - 00:55:32.658, Speaker B: Are these are know, Nobel Prize winner.
00:55:32.754 - 00:55:37.606, Speaker E: Paul Milgram's terminology for this. Strategy proof has this problem where I.
00:55:37.628 - 00:55:40.906, Speaker B: Still have to reason about if there's many rounds of this, which is the.
00:55:40.928 - 00:55:43.162, Speaker E: Frequency argument that I have to reason.
00:55:43.216 - 00:55:49.450, Speaker B: About the future rounds, people's valuations when coming up with my valuation. Obviously, strategy proof is I don't care.
00:55:49.520 - 00:55:53.662, Speaker E: I just do it once and it works. And the problem is, the NFT market.
00:55:53.716 - 00:55:58.286, Speaker B: Has stratified itself into games that are like me really spending time thinking about.
00:55:58.308 - 00:56:08.306, Speaker E: The set of future value. That's different than what, say, a fine art person creator cares. So I view the people who make.
00:56:08.328 - 00:56:11.342, Speaker B: Board Apes as the same as someone who works at supreme.
00:56:11.406 - 00:56:12.882, Speaker E: They don't really give a shit about.
00:56:12.936 - 00:56:16.322, Speaker B: The quality of the product they're making. It's not the quality of the product.
00:56:16.376 - 00:56:18.882, Speaker E: It's literally just like, can I convince.
00:56:18.946 - 00:56:30.966, Speaker B: Enough of this core group of speculators that there's a high enough velocity of churn that it's worth investing in now versus something where it's like, I spent my lifetime making this magnum opus and I just want to sell it?
00:56:30.988 - 00:56:31.690, Speaker H: One. Right.
00:56:31.760 - 00:56:37.434, Speaker E: And understanding that those are two extremely different notions of how people on both.
00:56:37.472 - 00:56:39.834, Speaker B: Sides have valuations for these things sort.
00:56:39.872 - 00:56:42.426, Speaker E: Of means that you can't expect this.
00:56:42.448 - 00:56:46.222, Speaker B: Is why the music NFT thing is a scam. It's never going to work.
00:56:46.356 - 00:56:47.518, Speaker F: Well, in the case of someone with.
00:56:47.524 - 00:56:50.606, Speaker C: A magnum opus, the royalty doesn't matter because no one's going to resell it.
00:56:50.628 - 00:56:51.278, Speaker B: No, but they resell it.
00:56:51.284 - 00:56:54.986, Speaker E: Once you're dead, your estate gets it.
00:56:55.028 - 00:57:01.630, Speaker G: Right, well, but wait, actually going to what you were saying about the Dallas Maps tickets.
00:57:01.790 - 00:57:03.346, Speaker F: I have a similar argument to what.
00:57:03.368 - 00:57:06.398, Speaker G: Sharon was saying where when they're selling.
00:57:06.414 - 00:57:14.246, Speaker F: The initial ticket for something like a concert or like a game or whatever, they set what the price is, right? And then the scalper finds what the.
00:57:14.268 - 00:57:16.360, Speaker G: Actual, real price is.
00:57:19.690 - 00:57:30.794, Speaker F: This is why creators like NFTs, because they can have that direct relationship with people and they can capture that value rather than a lot of it going to the scalper. So just in your initial example, there's.
00:57:30.842 - 00:57:34.122, Speaker G: This kind of middle person that hopefully.
00:57:34.186 - 00:57:36.474, Speaker F: Wouldn'T exist at least as much in NFTs.
00:57:36.522 - 00:57:37.166, Speaker H: Right?
00:57:37.348 - 00:57:40.014, Speaker E: Well, the middle person is OpenSea right?
00:57:40.052 - 00:57:42.410, Speaker B: Now, arguably.
00:57:42.570 - 00:57:49.138, Speaker F: Yeah, but I don't think OpenSea is like buying the collection that you're, the.
00:57:49.144 - 00:57:50.386, Speaker D: Speculators, are the middle person.
00:57:50.488 - 00:57:50.898, Speaker F: Right.
00:57:50.984 - 00:57:52.494, Speaker E: Unless they pull a zillow.
00:57:52.622 - 00:57:52.914, Speaker H: Right.
00:57:52.952 - 00:58:04.146, Speaker F: So then when you make this whole argument about like, oh, the initial person will want to pay no, it doesn't. Because in this new world that we're talking about, we don't have these scalpers, or ideally, we wouldn't.
00:58:04.258 - 00:58:05.094, Speaker B: You see what I'm saying?
00:58:05.132 - 00:58:10.098, Speaker C: We have the speculators. Right? That's where you're making all the money from, is the speculators. That's what the royalty who's going to pay the royalties.
00:58:10.194 - 00:58:13.826, Speaker D: It's speculators who keep trading the NFTs with each other because they're all speculating.
00:58:13.938 - 00:58:21.086, Speaker F: No, but I think a lot of people that buy in the initial, it's going to be a mix. It's going to be a mix of speculators and actual real fans that just want that thing.
00:58:21.188 - 00:58:24.766, Speaker C: But the initial mints are like overwhelmingly I mean, that's what we're talking about.
00:58:24.788 - 00:58:27.546, Speaker D: Salana going down because it's not normal.
00:58:27.578 - 00:58:29.006, Speaker C: People who are, like, running Bots trying.
00:58:29.028 - 00:58:30.394, Speaker D: To get into the initial mint.
00:58:30.522 - 00:58:32.554, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's why I compare.
00:58:32.682 - 00:58:36.202, Speaker E: Most NFTs are successful with shoe drops.
00:58:36.266 - 00:58:39.406, Speaker B: Which are equally boughted or like shitty watch drops.
00:58:39.438 - 00:58:41.694, Speaker E: It's like the same group of hype.
00:58:41.742 - 00:58:52.102, Speaker B: Beast, 20 to 30 year old people who love talking about gambling because this is the sort of more introverted version of the people waiting in line to buy.
00:58:52.156 - 00:58:52.422, Speaker C: True.
00:58:52.476 - 00:58:54.120, Speaker D: Can you define hype piece for us?
00:58:56.090 - 00:59:02.698, Speaker B: Basically, anyone who somehow finds a fad for particular materialistic items, they pick a.
00:59:02.704 - 00:59:04.874, Speaker E: Subset of goods that exist that are.
00:59:04.992 - 00:59:06.986, Speaker B: Definitely bought and sold at a high.
00:59:07.008 - 00:59:09.178, Speaker E: Enough velocity that they don't have to.
00:59:09.184 - 00:59:11.226, Speaker B: Hold inventory for more than one day.
00:59:11.328 - 00:59:13.342, Speaker E: And they try to buy the thing.
00:59:13.396 - 00:59:15.774, Speaker B: Right when it drops and then immediately resell it.
00:59:15.812 - 00:59:17.070, Speaker H: That's a hype beast.
00:59:17.570 - 00:59:18.270, Speaker I: Yeah.
00:59:18.420 - 00:59:21.146, Speaker B: In some ways, I kind of feel like they are the ultimate speculator.
00:59:21.178 - 00:59:21.760, Speaker C: Sure.
00:59:22.930 - 00:59:33.262, Speaker B: And in some ways okay, yeah, sure. Those people like board apes, I don't think they have any taste for fine art or for music IP, or any of these things that are like assets.
00:59:33.326 - 00:59:36.706, Speaker E: That the rest of the 99% of the world gives a shit about.
00:59:36.808 - 00:59:38.786, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, look, it's clear once.
00:59:38.808 - 00:59:41.350, Speaker C: There'S an equilibrium, it's kind of like Flashbots, right?
00:59:41.420 - 00:59:45.638, Speaker D: It's actually very analogous to Flashbots. We're like, before anyone's extracting mev, we.
00:59:45.644 - 00:59:50.326, Speaker C: Can all kind of gentlemen's agreement, okay, we're going to enforce royalties. Royalties are good. There's a great story about it, and.
00:59:50.348 - 00:59:53.754, Speaker D: Then suddenly somebody crosses the rubicon and it's okay.
00:59:53.792 - 00:59:55.994, Speaker C: Now one person is over the line, but that person's bad.
00:59:56.032 - 01:00:07.082, Speaker B: And we don't I'm excited for this. Not because of the crypto Twitter version of this world. Kill OpenSea. Whatever. I don't think that's OpenSea will absolutely capitulate.
01:00:07.146 - 01:00:08.894, Speaker C: No, they start losing market share because.
01:00:08.932 - 01:00:10.286, Speaker B: Other people I just think you just.
01:00:10.308 - 01:00:14.506, Speaker E: Stratify the market into the it's purely.
01:00:14.538 - 01:00:16.814, Speaker B: Speculative NFTs the ones that have, like.
01:00:16.852 - 01:00:18.466, Speaker E: Long term but that's where all the money is.
01:00:18.488 - 01:00:20.766, Speaker F: No, right now creators will want to be on OpenSea.
01:00:20.798 - 01:00:24.546, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I don't think everyone wants to be.
01:00:24.728 - 01:00:28.962, Speaker E: Catering to the supreme kid like, that's just not sorry.
01:00:29.016 - 01:00:31.814, Speaker C: Really? You don't think that's what OpenSea wants to do?
01:00:31.852 - 01:00:36.706, Speaker B: I think they grew off that, but I do think that now they kind of like they're catering to a different demographic.
01:00:36.738 - 01:00:40.140, Speaker E: Look at their website. Look at Suoswap's website. Come on.
01:00:40.510 - 01:00:41.594, Speaker D: I don't know.
01:00:41.792 - 01:00:43.290, Speaker B: Look at Magic Eden's website.
01:00:43.360 - 01:00:43.642, Speaker E: Even.
01:00:43.696 - 01:00:44.602, Speaker B: Compare the two of them.
01:00:44.656 - 01:00:45.014, Speaker H: Clearly.
01:00:45.062 - 01:00:50.474, Speaker E: One is going after the ultimate speculative bubble people and the other is like.
01:00:50.512 - 01:00:51.882, Speaker B: Trying to be like we have fine.
01:00:51.936 - 01:00:54.438, Speaker E: Art on our I think what you're.
01:00:54.454 - 01:00:58.000, Speaker D: Pointing out, I understand what the argument you're making, but I don't think that.
01:00:58.370 - 01:00:59.998, Speaker C: Looking at the front page of the.
01:01:00.004 - 01:01:05.966, Speaker D: Website like the hype beasts you're talking about don't look at the front page. It's the random person off the street who looks at the front page and.
01:01:05.988 - 01:01:08.206, Speaker C: The random person off the street is very different than the average user.
01:01:08.238 - 01:01:10.386, Speaker B: But there are wannabe hype beasts and.
01:01:10.408 - 01:01:14.194, Speaker E: Magic Eden is clearly more attractive to sure, sure, right.
01:01:14.232 - 01:01:15.650, Speaker B: Just like even aesthetically.
01:01:16.550 - 01:01:18.298, Speaker E: How does one become a hype beast?
01:01:18.414 - 01:01:20.390, Speaker B: You just watch too many skate videos.
01:01:20.460 - 01:01:23.282, Speaker C: You got to start your own course of how to be a Kala hype.
01:01:23.346 - 01:01:24.758, Speaker B: You watch too many skate videos and.
01:01:24.764 - 01:01:27.766, Speaker E: You'Re like, okay, yeah, I really want.
01:01:27.788 - 01:01:37.686, Speaker B: To buy all these skate shoes and resell them because that skateboard is really expensive and I think I can make money because these people are idiots. And that's like the beginning of the cycle of doom.
01:01:37.798 - 01:01:40.218, Speaker E: And so those people need, when they.
01:01:40.224 - 01:01:41.434, Speaker B: Go to your website, need to be.
01:01:41.472 - 01:01:45.946, Speaker E: Oh, like, wait, you're trying to get sold at Sotheby's? Nah, this sucks.
01:01:46.058 - 01:01:47.566, Speaker B: Those people are not going to look.
01:01:47.588 - 01:01:51.360, Speaker E: At that site and say that. Whereas, like, Magic Eden's clearly catering to that.
01:01:51.810 - 01:01:53.710, Speaker B: And I think we're seeing the stratification.
01:01:53.790 - 01:01:56.210, Speaker E: Of the NFT market with high quality.
01:01:56.280 - 01:01:57.918, Speaker B: Assets versus low quality assets.
01:01:58.014 - 01:02:03.746, Speaker E: Low quality has high frequency churn. High quality is like, maybe it's more.
01:02:03.768 - 01:02:04.500, Speaker B: Like fine.
01:02:07.110 - 01:02:08.722, Speaker E: You know, unfortunately they maybe.
01:02:08.776 - 01:02:17.122, Speaker B: Got rugged by, I think, and the fact that Three Arrows owns such a large portion of the art block collection.
01:02:17.186 - 01:02:18.070, Speaker G: Oh, yikes.
01:02:19.610 - 01:02:22.566, Speaker E: Or owns I don't know who owns those keys.
01:02:22.598 - 01:02:33.386, Speaker B: Technically, right now someone owns those keys. But I think that we're going to see the market stratify and the bear market is the perfect time for that.
01:02:33.408 - 01:02:38.494, Speaker E: Because all the speculative stuff has to concentrate in the highest velocity exchange and.
01:02:38.532 - 01:02:43.806, Speaker B: It will probably be bad for OpenSea short term, but I do think long term their brand recognition probably means they.
01:02:43.828 - 01:02:44.960, Speaker E: Can go high up.
01:02:46.610 - 01:02:51.326, Speaker D: I mean, unfortunately, I think upmarket is board apes. That's upmarket.
01:02:51.358 - 01:02:52.478, Speaker A: Yeah, you should talk about Sotheby's.
01:02:52.494 - 01:02:53.966, Speaker I: I'm like, guess what's getting sold at Sotheby's.
01:02:53.998 - 01:02:54.862, Speaker D: It's crypto, punks.
01:02:54.926 - 01:03:03.206, Speaker B: I know, I'm not disagreeing with that. But my point is most of the volume you see right now is like.
01:03:03.228 - 01:03:07.154, Speaker E: Not even if you ignore Board Ape and Crypto volume and Crypto Punk volume.
01:03:07.202 - 01:03:12.490, Speaker B: It's like all these random solana NFTs, which is why you can see Magic Eden beating OpenSea some days.
01:03:12.640 - 01:03:17.514, Speaker E: And so I think the reason that's true is because it's like, oh, the.
01:03:17.552 - 01:03:19.626, Speaker B: Newcomer who is like, I saw these.
01:03:19.648 - 01:03:22.174, Speaker E: People get rich last year. Where can I go?
01:03:22.212 - 01:03:23.358, Speaker B: But I only have $10.
01:03:23.444 - 01:03:25.082, Speaker E: Oh, it's salon. NFTs.
01:03:25.146 - 01:03:25.614, Speaker H: Yeah.
01:03:25.732 - 01:03:29.120, Speaker D: What's the rate on Openc 2.5%?
01:03:30.370 - 01:03:35.822, Speaker F: Yeah, actually going back to a much earlier point that Tom made where he was like, oh, maybe it should be.
01:03:35.876 - 01:03:37.034, Speaker G: A fee or whatever.
01:03:37.172 - 01:03:39.230, Speaker F: To my mind, again, a creator's perspective.
01:03:39.310 - 01:03:41.074, Speaker G: I'm like, oh, well, if I create.
01:03:41.112 - 01:03:58.966, Speaker F: Something and it becomes so huge, then, yeah, percentage makes sense because then I should benefit in this thing that's gotten so huge. So the idea that no matter what the value is, you would always get the same amount, that to me, just doesn't make sense. It does make sense to me that it would be percentage based.
01:03:59.068 - 01:04:05.978, Speaker A: Maybe it's also just a byproduct of the fact that, well, A, I think if you do it per transaction, way more enforceable versus trying to do it.
01:04:05.984 - 01:04:07.238, Speaker I: Per exchange, which is like, we can't.
01:04:07.254 - 01:04:07.962, Speaker A: Do that right now.
01:04:08.016 - 01:04:08.986, Speaker I: But I think it's also just the.
01:04:09.008 - 01:04:10.554, Speaker A: Norm where we see royalties getting set.
01:04:10.592 - 01:04:14.698, Speaker I: Around like 10% just feels super high. And that's why you see these NFC.
01:04:14.714 - 01:04:16.874, Speaker A: Products that have insane treasuries because they're.
01:04:16.922 - 01:04:21.662, Speaker I: Making money on all this volume. Another thing we talked about was basically.
01:04:21.716 - 01:04:23.486, Speaker A: Making them opt in. And you can sort of see on.
01:04:23.508 - 01:04:31.794, Speaker I: Chain who's paid royalties on their asset and who isn't. And maybe those kinds of assets or those people get something special, get higher quality.
01:04:31.832 - 01:04:32.786, Speaker A: Those are the kinds of things that.
01:04:32.808 - 01:04:33.982, Speaker I: Can get sold at Sotheby's.
01:04:34.046 - 01:04:35.826, Speaker A: And the hype, these people who are.
01:04:35.848 - 01:04:42.070, Speaker I: Flipping on OpenSea, it's like, oh, you didn't pay your royalty on this crypto punk. We can't sell it at Sotheby's anymore.
01:04:42.650 - 01:04:51.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I do agree. The moment these things move to royalty, no, I tainted the crypto punk.
01:04:51.950 - 01:05:00.598, Speaker E: I think the upshot is these newcomer exchanges have a really good shot of actually cannibalizing OpenSea.
01:05:00.614 - 01:05:05.338, Speaker B: Probably not magic Eden. Magic Eden seems like ruthlessly fine about cutting fees. I don't think they give a shit.
01:05:05.354 - 01:05:11.338, Speaker E: About creators at all based on the fact that they went to the ape coin community and were like, hey, we'll.
01:05:11.354 - 01:05:15.666, Speaker B: Let you pay an ape to subsidize any user. And they don't have to pay a.
01:05:15.688 - 01:05:18.946, Speaker E: Royalty just to get the ape usage up.
01:05:19.048 - 01:05:25.246, Speaker B: So they're willing to do anything versus OpenSea is much more like trying to go highbrow.
01:05:25.438 - 01:05:29.318, Speaker C: OpenSea is definitely yeah, I agree that OpenSea is trying to hold on to.
01:05:29.324 - 01:05:31.826, Speaker D: Their highbrow status, but I think they're.
01:05:31.858 - 01:05:33.286, Speaker C: Benefiting a lot from the fact that.
01:05:33.308 - 01:05:36.598, Speaker H: Yes, all the crypto not crypto, the.
01:05:36.604 - 01:05:38.418, Speaker D: Board apes are traded on OpenSea.
01:05:38.514 - 01:05:40.746, Speaker C: And I personally believe that if that.
01:05:40.768 - 01:05:43.142, Speaker D: Changes and they need to get aggressive.
01:05:43.206 - 01:05:44.650, Speaker E: On cutting, they will.
01:05:44.720 - 01:05:45.450, Speaker D: I think they will.
01:05:45.520 - 01:05:57.486, Speaker B: You bring up a good point though, about this idea that these collections actually are weirdly decentralized in some sense, and that they don't control their revenue stream because, yes, during the speculative bubble they.
01:05:57.508 - 01:06:01.082, Speaker E: Can put up this X percent royalty.
01:06:01.226 - 01:06:04.578, Speaker B: But when the market crashes and people are just like, I'm not going to.
01:06:04.584 - 01:06:06.626, Speaker E: Pay it, then the treasury of this.
01:06:06.648 - 01:06:12.130, Speaker B: Thing Suppose all the nouns were traded on pseudoswap with no fee.
01:06:12.870 - 01:06:14.894, Speaker E: The nouns treasury has just hit its peak.
01:06:14.942 - 01:06:17.054, Speaker B: Then it's never earning any more money.
01:06:17.192 - 01:06:18.450, Speaker I: They're still selling nouns.
01:06:18.530 - 01:06:30.460, Speaker B: Yeah, nouns is weird. I meant not someone who has like a fixed there's kind of this interesting thing of what happens to these projects if they become abandoned after the royalty goes away.
01:06:31.870 - 01:06:33.626, Speaker C: I think board Ape shows you the.
01:06:33.648 - 01:06:36.726, Speaker D: Model, which is that, well, you got to keep launching.
01:06:36.758 - 01:06:38.090, Speaker B: You shouldn't airdropping.
01:06:38.590 - 01:06:44.106, Speaker C: I think that's exactly right. If you consider these things to basically be like luxury goods companies. It's like, okay, you created one line.
01:06:44.128 - 01:06:46.766, Speaker D: Of watches, okay, it's important that those.
01:06:46.788 - 01:06:50.798, Speaker C: Watches trade for a high value, but you got to keep launching more watches. There's more people in the world.
01:06:50.884 - 01:06:54.094, Speaker B: Also, there's this weird thing of like, if you make it to a certain.
01:06:54.132 - 01:06:56.658, Speaker E: Point, you just get other brands basically.
01:06:56.744 - 01:07:02.226, Speaker B: Using your address list as a customer list. Like Tiffany's, like the Tiffany AirDrop to crypto punk people.
01:07:02.248 - 01:07:02.770, Speaker H: It was crazy.
01:07:02.840 - 01:07:05.506, Speaker D: Yeah, which know, I mean, look, both.
01:07:05.608 - 01:07:07.086, Speaker E: People are equally tacky.
01:07:07.118 - 01:07:09.140, Speaker B: So I get why that's like, the good customer.
01:07:11.270 - 01:07:12.566, Speaker F: Know, I have to admit, I thought.
01:07:12.588 - 01:07:13.574, Speaker G: That they were cool.
01:07:13.692 - 01:07:18.418, Speaker F: I was know, I'm not even one of these laura's trying to get Tiffany.
01:07:18.434 - 01:07:19.954, Speaker C: To the sponsor for the it's so funny.
01:07:20.002 - 01:07:22.666, Speaker F: I was about to say I'm not even one of those PFP people, but.
01:07:22.688 - 01:07:25.206, Speaker G: I have a PFP, which I totally forgot.
01:07:25.238 - 01:07:32.254, Speaker F: It's crypto coven, of course, my favorite. But yeah, that was actually something that I thought was kind of interesting and.
01:07:32.292 - 01:07:34.510, Speaker G: Cool, but I don't know.
01:07:34.580 - 01:07:43.546, Speaker F: Do you feel like real world assets or whatever you want to call them based off of these digital things, these digital NFTs?
01:07:43.578 - 01:07:50.914, Speaker G: Do you think they're going to become a thing or is that just like because it just feels like it creates a whole host of yeah, I find.
01:07:50.952 - 01:07:51.966, Speaker D: It kind of tacky.
01:07:52.078 - 01:07:53.726, Speaker E: Yeah, it's just real cringe.
01:07:53.758 - 01:08:00.966, Speaker B: But it maps to Miami, so it's like, okay, great. Yeah, there's a quarterly figured out you literally figured out the sales tactic in.
01:08:00.988 - 01:08:02.566, Speaker E: Miami, which is like, oh, you just.
01:08:02.588 - 01:08:09.574, Speaker B: Go to some hotel and you're like, hey, put my product in your hotel. And that's how you do all your marketing. Because it's like the people who care.
01:08:09.612 - 01:08:14.522, Speaker E: About that aesthetic will buy your product because they see it at XYZ place.
01:08:14.576 - 01:08:15.386, Speaker B: This is the same thing.
01:08:15.408 - 01:08:17.366, Speaker E: It's like, oh, now, as a crypto.
01:08:17.398 - 01:08:20.460, Speaker B: Punk owner, you get to get free stays at somebody.
01:08:21.310 - 01:08:22.042, Speaker H: I don't know.
01:08:22.096 - 01:08:28.574, Speaker B: It's just like you have to have taste that's only dictated strictly by dollar values of things for you to care about.
01:08:28.692 - 01:08:31.358, Speaker D: A very it's a very TikTok house.
01:08:31.444 - 01:08:35.454, Speaker H: Approach to thinking about what NFT status is.
01:08:35.652 - 01:08:38.066, Speaker G: I don't no, no, I get it.
01:08:38.088 - 01:08:39.266, Speaker F: But I do think that there are.
01:08:39.288 - 01:08:42.770, Speaker G: Some brands that yeah, definitely.
01:08:42.840 - 01:08:50.274, Speaker F: I think the benefit is more for the traditional brand. There were a few that did super bowl ads where they had NFT stuff in their ads.
01:08:50.322 - 01:08:54.342, Speaker G: And I feel like that was for the traditional brand to get more cred.
01:08:54.476 - 01:09:10.370, Speaker B: I mean, it's crazy that Tiffany's got $12 million of revenue for ostensibly what cost them a little bit of PR and free customer list of people who are guaranteed to buy it. That's like, insane kind of genius. And I bet you we're going to.
01:09:10.380 - 01:09:12.950, Speaker E: See a lot of cop like other luxury brands.
01:09:13.030 - 01:09:17.662, Speaker A: Have you seen the tog hoyer NFT watch? They have this watch with a screen.
01:09:17.716 - 01:09:19.678, Speaker I: On it that I'm impressed by the.
01:09:19.684 - 01:09:21.406, Speaker A: Tech that they were able to get this out so quickly.
01:09:21.508 - 01:09:23.726, Speaker I: But basically, it will sync with your.
01:09:23.748 - 01:09:27.858, Speaker A: Ethereum wallet and verify the own NFT and put your NFT on your watch face.
01:09:27.944 - 01:09:28.980, Speaker G: Oh, my God.
01:09:29.990 - 01:09:30.642, Speaker F: Wow.
01:09:30.776 - 01:09:33.666, Speaker E: Boy, I love people wearing signs that.
01:09:33.688 - 01:09:35.220, Speaker B: Say, Mug me right now.
01:09:36.070 - 01:09:40.600, Speaker C: That's literally yeah, look, that's what wearing a Rolex is, too. Right.
01:09:41.210 - 01:09:43.240, Speaker D: It's not, in principle different, but.
01:09:45.610 - 01:09:45.926, Speaker H: It.
01:09:45.948 - 01:09:49.830, Speaker D: Does feel like you're going on the wrong side of the aesthetic.
01:09:50.590 - 01:09:50.954, Speaker H: Yeah.
01:09:50.992 - 01:09:58.730, Speaker B: How did we go from cipher punks to shitbags? Somehow that's like, if I ever write a book about this industry, that's the title of it.
01:09:58.800 - 01:10:01.050, Speaker D: Yeah, it is a bit douchey.
01:10:02.190 - 01:10:03.546, Speaker H: Anyway, whatever.
01:10:03.648 - 01:10:07.198, Speaker C: All this stuff is arbitrary. Who the hell knows? Maybe five years from now.
01:10:07.364 - 01:10:11.710, Speaker B: This is why I'm pulling for the fine art stuff. Because at least there it's like people.
01:10:11.780 - 01:10:15.762, Speaker E: Put thought and you really had to.
01:10:15.896 - 01:10:21.634, Speaker B: Make some social commentary about the world when they created something versus some social commentary about, like, people.
01:10:21.672 - 01:10:26.770, Speaker E: Hey, there's a lot of people better social commentary than apes.
01:10:28.010 - 01:10:30.840, Speaker A: Apes are literally we've been talking about apes a lot.
01:10:31.690 - 01:10:35.670, Speaker B: Just because the marketing is good doesn't mean it's a good social commentary.
01:10:36.010 - 01:10:37.414, Speaker C: A lot of NFT art is cool.
01:10:37.452 - 01:10:39.238, Speaker D: Most of it is not social commentary.
01:10:39.414 - 01:10:40.138, Speaker I: Yeah.
01:10:40.304 - 01:10:42.714, Speaker C: I mean, look at, like, fuck render or something. It's really cool.
01:10:42.752 - 01:10:44.490, Speaker D: It's not really social commentary.
01:10:45.630 - 01:10:48.300, Speaker B: I guess I'm just not, like, personally into that.
01:10:49.150 - 01:10:59.182, Speaker F: That's where we get real artists on my show that made NFT collections and their art was so interesting because it really engaged with blockchain technology in fascinating ways.
01:10:59.236 - 01:11:05.646, Speaker G: Like, one of them took her 23 and me genetic or DNA, whatever, and.
01:11:05.828 - 01:11:07.422, Speaker F: Turned it into a hash or something.
01:11:07.476 - 01:11:09.698, Speaker G: And then put it I think it.
01:11:09.704 - 01:11:14.414, Speaker F: Was like this was so early. It was like back in 2013 or 2014, she put it on a fork.
01:11:14.462 - 01:11:15.060, Speaker H: Of.
01:11:17.510 - 01:11:22.006, Speaker G: Doge party or it's like some counterparty doge mix up.
01:11:22.028 - 01:11:25.026, Speaker F: I don't even know. Mashup. It, like, doesn't exist anymore.
01:11:25.058 - 01:11:31.498, Speaker G: And the title was my soul. So that was funny. Or like yeah.
01:11:31.664 - 01:11:34.134, Speaker F: Mitchell Chan, who is an NFT artist.
01:11:34.182 - 01:11:36.278, Speaker G: He did some of the first NFTs.
01:11:36.294 - 01:11:41.306, Speaker F: Before the, ERCU, 721 standard. His was he found an artist, like.
01:11:41.328 - 01:11:43.854, Speaker G: A traditional artist, Eve Klein, who he.
01:11:43.892 - 01:11:58.146, Speaker F: Believes actually made the first NFTs. But they were with paper. And what it was was he had this big exhibit and there were, like, lines around the block in Paris and people walked into the gallery and it.
01:11:58.168 - 01:11:59.246, Speaker G: Was just, like, empty.
01:11:59.358 - 01:12:16.758, Speaker F: But there would be, like, numbers, like number one, number two. And you could buy one of the it was called, like, immaterial Zones of Pictorial Sensibility or something like that. And you could buy one of these, and what you would get is a certificate of your authentic ownership of this. So when Mitchell found this, it's like, from the 1950s or whatever, he was.
01:12:16.764 - 01:12:17.414, Speaker G: Like, oh, my God.
01:12:17.452 - 01:12:23.818, Speaker F: This is the first art NFT. So he made the actual digital NFT version of this in August 2017.
01:12:23.824 - 01:12:27.898, Speaker G: And this was like, before CryptoKitties whatever.
01:12:28.064 - 01:12:30.486, Speaker F: And the funny thing is, so Eve.
01:12:30.518 - 01:12:33.694, Speaker G: Klein said that you could just buy.
01:12:33.732 - 01:12:40.718, Speaker F: The certificate, but if you wanted to experience the true apotheosis of the artistic experience, then he would take you to.
01:12:40.724 - 01:12:47.538, Speaker G: The River Sen. And sorry, you had to pay for your digital zone of.
01:12:47.624 - 01:12:49.214, Speaker F: Whatever it was called, immaterial Zone.
01:12:49.262 - 01:12:51.326, Speaker G: Anyway, you had to pay for it in gold.
01:12:51.438 - 01:13:11.574, Speaker F: And so if you wanted the true apotheosis of the artistic experience, then Eve Klein would go with you to the River Sen and you would have to throw your certificate into the river and he would throw half of the gold you gave him into the river. And then that would be like, the true artistic experience. So when Mitchell this is like Marina.
01:13:11.622 - 01:13:14.618, Speaker B: Bromovich, but like 50 years ago.
01:13:14.704 - 01:13:19.286, Speaker F: So when Mitchell created his NFT version.
01:13:19.318 - 01:13:21.946, Speaker G: Of it in the Smart contract, you.
01:13:21.968 - 01:13:23.022, Speaker F: Had to pay him east or whatever.
01:13:23.076 - 01:13:32.046, Speaker G: Right. But if you ever burned your NFT, which somehow the contract would see that or whatever, and it would trigger the.
01:13:32.068 - 01:13:37.906, Speaker F: Burning of half of the ETH that you gave him. So he created that aspect of it into his anyway, and the point is.
01:13:37.928 - 01:13:39.874, Speaker G: All I'm saying is these kinds of.
01:13:39.912 - 01:13:44.418, Speaker F: Art entities interest me so much and they're so different from the PFPs or.
01:13:44.424 - 01:13:46.366, Speaker G: Whatever, which, again, I have a crypto.
01:13:46.398 - 01:13:54.726, Speaker F: Covenant, so I'm sort of a fan of those as well. But that kind of true NFT art, where it's like in conversation with art history and it doesn't have to be.
01:13:54.748 - 01:13:57.126, Speaker G: Social commentary, but it's like engaging with.
01:13:57.148 - 01:13:58.646, Speaker F: The technology in a way that's super.
01:13:58.668 - 01:14:01.526, Speaker G: Creative and makes you think, I really like those.
01:14:01.708 - 01:14:02.314, Speaker H: Very cool.
01:14:02.352 - 01:14:04.986, Speaker C: Well, so speaking of true art, we got a last piece of news for.
01:14:05.008 - 01:14:08.700, Speaker H: The week, which is that biggest news of the week.
01:14:10.930 - 01:14:13.482, Speaker C: Which is that Dragonfly just rebranded.
01:14:13.546 - 01:14:14.160, Speaker D: So.
01:14:16.210 - 01:14:20.320, Speaker C: We used to be called Dragonfly Capital. We're now that's the biggest news of the week, obviously.
01:14:20.930 - 01:14:27.962, Speaker B: I mean, I think you guys just reduced yourself to three ASCII symbols. Right? Now you have a logo that's ASCII emoji.
01:14:28.026 - 01:14:28.706, Speaker C: That's true.
01:14:28.808 - 01:14:30.180, Speaker B: Which is pretty cool.
01:14:30.870 - 01:14:31.826, Speaker D: We got a lot of shit because.
01:14:31.848 - 01:14:34.082, Speaker C: It looks very similar to Tracerdao, which.
01:14:34.136 - 01:14:36.846, Speaker D: Recently got acquired by Mycelium.
01:14:36.958 - 01:14:42.454, Speaker C: Exactly. No, tracerdao is great. Tracerdao is great. But they used to have a logo that looks a lot like ours, but.
01:14:42.492 - 01:14:46.226, Speaker D: It'S one weird Greek symbol, whereas ours.
01:14:46.258 - 01:14:53.034, Speaker C: Is like carrot and then thing and carrot. Anyway, we also announced that we acquired a fund called Metasable Capital, which is.
01:14:53.072 - 01:14:54.202, Speaker D: The fund I used to be at.
01:14:54.256 - 01:14:58.586, Speaker H: When I started investing. And so we now I just wanted.
01:14:58.608 - 01:15:00.086, Speaker D: To say that to everybody on our show.
01:15:00.208 - 01:15:01.598, Speaker F: Yeah, I have to say, do you.
01:15:01.604 - 01:15:03.674, Speaker B: Guys have, like, a gang symbol?
01:15:03.802 - 01:15:04.720, Speaker C: Not yet.
01:15:07.490 - 01:15:15.440, Speaker B: I was trying to get it pretty good. It's because it's almost hand representable. That's what it is.
01:15:15.810 - 01:15:16.974, Speaker C: That's the idea. It's very versatile.
01:15:17.022 - 01:15:30.520, Speaker F: You would be a good shadow puppeteer. Yeah, no, this brought up for me so many memories of kind of when I was covering this earlier on, because there was a time when it was like, Medicao was this sort of secretive thing.
01:15:31.050 - 01:15:33.206, Speaker G: Yeah. And I don't think I even knew.
01:15:33.228 - 01:15:36.454, Speaker F: You at that time, and later on, I found out that you used to work there.
01:15:36.492 - 01:15:42.620, Speaker G: But yeah, shoot. I'm trying to think.
01:15:43.070 - 01:15:43.578, Speaker H: Yeah.
01:15:43.664 - 01:15:45.930, Speaker F: This is what eventually became my first.
01:15:46.000 - 01:15:49.030, Speaker G: Forbes cover story, where really I don't.
01:15:49.030 - 01:16:00.718, Speaker F: Know if you guys remember the one where I put Olaf on the COVID Olaf Carlson. Yeah, because you could see the ICO thing happening and all these crypto hedge funds were popping up and whatever, and.
01:16:00.884 - 01:16:07.666, Speaker G: Metastable was, like, the oldest crypto hedge fund. But then for various reasons, I went.
01:16:07.688 - 01:16:10.478, Speaker F: With Polychain as, like, the well, Olaf.
01:16:10.494 - 01:16:12.018, Speaker D: Was always more public, right?

01:16:21.020 - 01:16:25.126, Speaker D: I think Naval plays better on Twitter. But Naval was one of the co.
01:16:25.148 - 01:16:26.518, Speaker C: Founders of Metastable, and so when we.
01:16:26.524 - 01:16:31.530, Speaker D: Acquired Medistable, it's a super OG fund. So it was founded in 2014.
01:16:31.870 - 01:16:33.814, Speaker C: They were, like, in the ethereum presale.
01:16:33.862 - 01:16:43.518, Speaker D: They did Zcash and KZOS and Algorithm and Cosmos affinity, like, you know, a huge number of the layer ones that have been very successful. And then when I was there, I.
01:16:43.524 - 01:16:48.670, Speaker H: Did Avalanche did near Filecoin, Starkware, a bunch of stuff.

01:16:55.652 - 01:16:59.026, Speaker D: But yeah, it used to be a very shadowy fund back in the very.
01:16:59.048 - 01:17:00.062, Speaker C: Early days of crypto.
01:17:00.126 - 01:17:08.334, Speaker D: And so we're now taking it into the family. Anyway, we're super overtime, so we need to wrap up. But once again, thank you, everybody, for listening.
