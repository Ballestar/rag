00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.010, Speaker A: It just seems so angry.
00:00:02.090 - 00:00:02.382, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:02.436 - 00:00:16.240, Speaker A: I guess that's the one word that I feel like not bitcoin itself, but the bitcoin sort of community or the bitcoin maxi community. They always have something to be angry about. And it seems like this is the thing de jour to be angry about.
00:00:17.330 - 00:00:50.540, Speaker B: Yeah. I forget who the quote was from, but in one of these articles, talking about a bitcoin contributor, being incensed that people would use the blockchain for anything than transferring Bitcoin. But if anything, bitcoin is in such dire need of more transaction fees and more volume, obviously, to offset the reduction in emissions. I think, unfortunately, this is not really picked up yet, but if anything, they should be applauding this, right? You should want people to use your blockchain and be willing to pay for it to maintain its security. And yet that hasn't really happened yet.
