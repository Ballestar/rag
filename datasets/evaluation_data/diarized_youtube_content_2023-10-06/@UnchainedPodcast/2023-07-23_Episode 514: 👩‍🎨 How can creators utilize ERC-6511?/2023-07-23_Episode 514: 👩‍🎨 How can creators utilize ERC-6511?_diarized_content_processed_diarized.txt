You can imagine NFT where you kind of assemble like a whole army of sub NFTs, and they all show up in interesting ways in the artwork. At the top, you have the building blocks for composable NFTs, where the nature of an NFT is made up of what it owns. And so you have all sorts of interesting ways you can do that for creators also means that creators can build really interesting things that their NFTs can do. You can have NFTs that you send on scavenger hunts on Chain or NFTs that are competing for a prize on Chain or NFTs that are doing any one of a number of actions. And that changes the nature of how you relate to these assets, relate to these pieces of art. If you're creating something, you have now this whole of Ethereum at your disposal to create your artwork.
