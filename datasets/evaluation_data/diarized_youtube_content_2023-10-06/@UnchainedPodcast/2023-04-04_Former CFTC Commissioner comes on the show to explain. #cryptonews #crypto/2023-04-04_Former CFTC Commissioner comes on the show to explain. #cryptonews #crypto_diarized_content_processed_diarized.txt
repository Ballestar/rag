00:00:00.090 - 00:00:04.894, Speaker A: So then how do you view Chair Gensler's statements that everything about Bitcoin is a security?
00:00:05.012 - 00:00:19.722, Speaker B: The actions of the agency don't match that rhetoric in terms of their ability to enforce that view by telling CFTC registered only exchanges that they would need to delist those products because they viewed them as securities.
00:00:19.866 - 00:00:31.046, Speaker A: Seems like you're saying that no matter what Chair Gensler says, that the way the agency has been acting these last four years is that ether is a commodity, is.
00:00:31.068 - 00:00:32.580, Speaker B: A non security. Yes.
