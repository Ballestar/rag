00:00:00.410 - 00:00:56.970, Speaker A: KYC was a terrible idea for a lot of reasons because I think it's the antidote to what crypto actually is trying to do but then also it's not at all inclusive so you really could not do that. Web of Trust things can become promising once you have a large number of verified users with something like World ID that you can build it on top of but it's really really impossible to bootstrap and so we threw that way too. And then within Biometrics, we came to this hard insight that we cannot use phones and we cannot use fingerprints or Face because of kind of the uniqueness requirement is just not fulfilled if you even go to a billion users. And so we had to go with iris recognition, which is the only thing that actually works in that scale. And it's proven that it works, and and you can implement it. Privacy preserving of Syrian launch Proofs and of course my first reaction was like holy shit, this is going to sound like very scary.
