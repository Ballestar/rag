We're just in a very different world.

00:01:40.270 - 00:01:54.594, Speaker C: Today's topic is what crypto regulation could look like in 2023. Here to discuss are Sheila Warren, CEO for the Crypto Council for Innovation, and Miller, White House. Levine, policy Director at the DFI Education Fund.
00:01:54.712 - 00:01:56.286, Speaker B: Welcome, Sheila and Miller.
00:01:56.398 - 00:01:56.914, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:01:56.952 - 00:01:57.886, Speaker A: Thanks Laura.
00:01:57.998 - 00:02:57.042, Speaker C: The last time I did a show on regulation was back in early October when things looked quite different. Funnily enough, the headline on that story was Kristen Smith on why crypto legislation could be passed by year's end. And in the episode, she actually credited Sam Bankman Fried with being the force behind a bill that at that point few people had actually heard of. And it was the digital commodity consumer protection act, or Dccpa. It's extremely notorious now in the crypto community, which is why I actually find all this kind of amusing. However, obviously what happened is that first of all, even before FTX collapsed, sam Binkman Fried himself came under fire from the crypto community for how that legislation proposed to treat DeFi and then obviously post FTX collapse. The future for crypto legislation probably looks quite different.
00:02:57.042 - 00:03:07.350, Speaker C: So I'm curious to hear from both of you and why don't we start with Sheila. What would you say are the top line takeaways about the current state of crypto legislation in the wake of FTX?
00:03:07.770 - 00:03:45.554, Speaker A: Well, thanks Laura, for the question. I think it's not just about FTX. It's also about the fact that we have a new Congress. So now we actually have split chambers. We have a Republican House, which may or may not be able to come together in coalition to get things across the line that's still being sorted, which is a very real time active thing that's happening, and a Senate led by the Democrats. And so we're in a world, I think this is something at the crypto Council we had been warning about and thinking was a real possibility. But I do think a lot of folks assumed we were going to have an entirely Republican led Congress, which would have had very different potential outcomes and other things.
00:03:45.554 - 00:04:27.278, Speaker A: So it's not just about what happened with FTS. It's also recognizing that we have a whole bunch of new actors. And it's a very different situation in Washington now than we had prior to this election and prior to the swearing in of these new members too. Now, to answer your direct question, what that means for crypto legislation is what it means for all legislation we've already seen. It's going to be really tough to get things across the line. We're looking actively right now at a debt ceiling situation. Brinkmanship this is always kind of a dramatic moment in Washington, but not this kind of brinksmanship and we actually have a handful of folks in the House that seem pretty committed to whatever deal they struck with Kevin McCarthy.
00:04:27.278 - 00:04:49.926, Speaker A: They seem pretty committed to holding up legislation that does not completely align with their interests, perhaps, which represent the interest of their constituents, maybe not. So everything is in a different place than it ever was. And that means that, like all legislation, crypto focused legislation is also going to have to run a gauntlet that we were not looking at in the end of last year.
00:04:50.108 - 00:05:20.530, Speaker C: Wow. And some of what you mentioned with the House or slightly alluded to I just wanted to kind of call out you're probably talking about how it was, I forget, like 15 votes or something before Kevin McCarthy was able to be sworn in as speaker. Yeah, that's, I think historically, obviously very aberrant. So clearly there's a lot of hurdles to any kind of legislation being passed. Miller what is your view on how things look at this point?
00:05:20.680 - 00:06:22.326, Speaker D: Yeah, I think Sheila generally is 100% right. I think that some foundational concepts, the landscape changed in some fundamental ways from FTX and from a new Congress. I think that generally policymakers are taking a refreshed look at the crypto industry and ecosystem, broadly rethinking what they thought they knew, given the shock of the FTX collapse to everyone, including lawmakers. And as far as the dynamics of Congress is concerned, completely agree with Sheila. I think that post FTX, some folks, particularly in the House, look at it, the collapse as a failure of people and not a failure of the technology or the underlying concepts itself. And there are other folks, I think, particularly in the Senate, that think the exact opposite of that, or that the technology is for some reason a contributing factor to the collapse. And other collapses last year.
00:06:22.326 - 00:06:32.486, Speaker D: So I think it's going to be tricky for those two groups to come to consensus on any particular issue which will make the prospect of legislative action remote.
00:06:32.678 - 00:07:13.830, Speaker A: So just building on what Miller just said, I think that we should draw a distinction between the activity we expect to see in congress. We at the Crypto Council are calling this the Crypto Congress because I think there's going to be a lot of activity bills being introduced, discussed, new coalitions forming, tons of chances for all of us to educate, which is great, but the ability again to get anything across the line, not just crypto related legislation, any legislation. We're just in a very different world. So the conversations are going to continue. And I do think in the wake of FTX, there were a bunch of folks elected who were kind of like, well, that's not really my issue. I don't have to pay a lot of attention to it. I think that is now an unusual position.
00:07:13.830 - 00:07:50.274, Speaker A: I think most people feel like they have to have some baseline knowledge about what's going on here, some baseline opinion about it. And again, that's an opportunity for us to do a lot of education to folks who are more open minded. And the last thing I'll say as a reminder is that crypto remains attractive to people or interesting to people. They're curious about it all across the political spectrum. This is one of the very few issues that does have bipartisan support and bicameral support from various people, and it certainly has generated a tremendous amount of interest. So I think Miller would agree our work is cut out for us here. There is a lot to do.
00:07:50.274 - 00:08:00.440, Speaker A: It's going to be very busy. But I think the expectations around what's going to get across the line and the ease of doing that need to be calibrated in accordance with the new environment that we're dealing with.
00:08:00.810 - 00:09:29.474, Speaker C: Okay, so this is actually super interesting that you're saying all that, because I actually was very curious. Obviously, Sam thinkman Fried was probably the number one most active crypto entrepreneur in Washington, and he and other FTX executives were huge donors to members of congress. It ended up being that CoinDesk did this investigation and found that 196 of them had taken money from him or other executives at FTX, and that that amounts to one in three members of congress. And I was wondering if you felt that those members who took donations from FTX related people, if that kind of has made them feel like they got burned and so has kind of turned them against crypto to the point where they want to be tougher on crypto or they're trying to distance themselves from the industry that they're now sort of even maybe anti crypto. Or I'm sure you've heard the theories that because of the political favor they were trying to curry, that maybe Sam and other FTX executives will get off jail, no prison time or light sentences or whatever, due to know I don't know what you make of those, but or is it something else entirely? I'm just kind of curious because to have the one person that they were sort of hobnobbing with be the one to allegedly perpetrate this fraud, I don't know, I just feel like that in particular might spark certain reactions in one.
00:09:29.512 - 00:10:41.400, Speaker D: Direction, or that well, I think everybody felt burned. No matter whether you're just an average crypto user or a member of Congress, everybody felt burned because it was fraudulent. I think the conspiracy theories about him getting off have just been proven incorrect, given the fact that it's seemingly every federal law enforcement agency has thrown the book at him, so to speak, including four potential or alleged campaign finance violations. To your point, you know, I think that members of Congress who received donations from him, many of whom are already or have already given the money to other causes, and which the debtors in the FTX case are seeking to get back from certain charities too, all feel burned, just like everybody else. I think how people react to that with respect to crypto regulation depends, I think, on the person similar to the dynamic I described previously. I think some folks view what happened with FDX as being an FDX problem. Others see it as being a crypto problem.
00:10:41.400 - 00:10:58.410, Speaker D: And to Sheila's point, I think it has generally made folks have to pick a side. So to know it's not binary, of course, but to have some position on crypto. And two congresses ago, there was probably two or three members of Congress who had positions on crypto.
00:10:58.570 - 00:11:02.750, Speaker C: And you're not seeing that fall along partisan lines?
00:11:03.250 - 00:11:51.374, Speaker A: No, not really. And I think to add to what Miller said, I think there's some folks who really see this as a Sam problem, right? Not even an XT, it's like Sam and allegedly this small group of so the thing, Laura, I think, is that this was so egregious. Like what happened here was just so wild, right? I mean, just absolutely outrageously egregious. And I think people understand that. They understand that it wasn't just to point, like, everybody feels burned by this, right? There are investors who feel burned, users who feel burned, employees who feel burned, regulators who feel burned in the Bahamas. I can't imagine how people there just there's a tremendous shock that happened as a result of all of this. And so I think there are a lot of folks that understand that this was, again, eight criminal counts were brought here.
00:11:51.374 - 00:12:32.778, Speaker A: This is not some mild here one day, gone the next kind of thing. This was like a massive, massive perpetuated fraud on people all over the world. So I think folks really do understand that, and I think they get that this was a case of one of the oldest crimes in the book. It was the new incarnation of that crime, of that kind of financial crime, that mismanagement, that fraud. Again, we'll see how all this plays out with the criminal justice hearings. But I think people do understand this is not an indictment. Now those I do think people who had already decided in their brains that crypto was the enemy for whatever reason, they are certainly using this know, lean into that point for sure.
00:12:32.778 - 00:12:35.054, Speaker A: Absolutely. They're using it as a political talking point.
00:12:35.172 - 00:12:38.558, Speaker C: Like for instance, Senator Elizabeth Warren as an example.
00:12:38.644 - 00:13:21.150, Speaker A: I don't know that many new people that came to this are looking at this situation and saying, well, this one guy and a small group of people did this horrible, committed these horrible crimes, therefore an entire industry must therefore be suspect. It's a pretty big leap. And I think that again, to kind of hammer the point home, it's because the situation here is so extreme. If this were a more ordinary kind of crime, I think people would be like, oh, is everyone doing that? But because it was so outlandish, so outrageous, so extreme, I think people are like, wow, that takes a particular kind of individual to even conceive of, let alone pull off, right? It's not an ordinary situation by any stretch of the imagination.
00:13:22.450 - 00:13:52.018, Speaker C: Yeah, I would agree with that. So obviously, I'm sure there's a lot of different ideas being bandied about. But within the crypto industry itself, right after the collapse of FTX, we saw this movement to show proof of reserves and there was just a lot of discussion around how to prevent that kind of thing. Are you hearing about any lawmakers or regulators discuss regulations or laws that could be implemented to prevent another FTX?
00:13:52.194 - 00:14:28.882, Speaker A: Again, it varies pretty widely and it varies jurisdiction to jurisdiction and how folks are approaching this. It varies almost person to person in many ways. And part of this is, I think, the domain that people feel they have either some kind of influence over or that they're deeply interested in. Right. So some folks are saying, and this is the kind of point I've made before, including in the press, the system did work here, right? I mean the reality is this person was arrested, there are these eight criminal counts brought, a justice process is running and this all happened pretty fast. So there have been comparisons. Bankman Freed to Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay or whatever.
00:14:28.882 - 00:15:51.290, Speaker A: And the reality of those situations is those went on for like decades. This was a pretty fast, horrible act to getting caught, to getting arrested situation, all things considered. So you could argue that the accountability mechanisms already existed in our current legal system, at least here in the United States. Now, what's interesting, of course, and what I think everybody has interest in is preventing this from ever happening again. And there I think it's not just about a legal and regulatory response, it's also about how do we think about diligence? How do we think about the fact that we've created a cult of personality around tech geniuses, right, that didn't exist 15 years ago? All these things play into what happened here and the ability of one individual to earn the trust of people from such a broad variety of spaces, not just Washington, but all kinds of other places too, right? So I think there's a reckoning that's happening with a lot of that that goes beyond just who should take money when and what and this kind of thing. And I don't know that all of that could ever be addressed by any specific legislation or regulation that might come down. But I do think the industry has expressed our own interest in making sure something like this can never, ever happen again and that you're disincentivizing this behavior, that you're making sure that if people do want to pull it off, it's pretty easy to catch them and that there's accountability built in.
00:15:51.290 - 00:16:43.178, Speaker A: Now, I think to the points Miller made earlier. The great thing about crypto and blockchain is that the tech itself, if you lean in to certain technical design choices and other kinds of things, you can put some of that into place and actually make that incentive structure, make that governance model, make that accountability part of how the system actually works itself. And this is a point I know Miller and I and many others are going really talking about and trying to highlight, is we don't have to just rely on an external system of accountability or regulation, although that is inevitable and also important. We also need to be leaning into what the technology itself enables. And that's something, I think, to go kind of connect this to the topic. Today folks in Washington or even in Europe or other places have a highly varied degree of understanding about how that works and the reality of it.
00:16:43.264 - 00:17:45.954, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't think we've even kind of gotten to that part of the conversation in any systemic way yet. I think that Congress right now is in kind of a shell shocked, fact gathering what happened mode and I expect there to be additional hearings on what happened, looking back. But I think this conversation about what comes next, how can we prevent this kind of thing, I think is very context dependent. I think where the business model is centralized and custodial, many of the regulations in traditional finance can mitigate some of those risks in a substantially similar way in the crypto markets. And then to Sheila's point, I'll talk my book. There are other ways to go about eliminating the need to respond to those risks altogether, non custodial exchange, be they with a centralized limit order book or with DeFi protocols. So I think that's the exciting conversation to come, depending on how you view it.
00:17:45.954 - 00:17:51.278, Speaker D: But Congress, in my opinion right now is still in the what happened? Mode.
00:17:51.454 - 00:18:24.862, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been calling it the festivist season for those who want, like, there's got to be some pulpit pounding and some of that's going to happen. Obviously that happens every time you have something like this that goes down. We're certainly not the first industry that's had senators yelling at know this is just a part of the process, but then it is going to transition and shift into something more productive. I think once some of that has been completed and I agree with Miller expecting to hear more hearings about just kind of the forensics around, how did this happen, how could this have happened? And what could have prevented it?
00:18:24.996 - 00:18:38.318, Speaker C: All right, so let's move on from the FTX stuff and just talk. I mean, there's so many different topics to discuss, but why don't we just start with your overall goals for crypto policy this year for each of your organizations?
00:18:38.494 - 00:19:28.594, Speaker D: Sure, I'm happy to. I think, you know, number one, to Sheila's point, the ODS of Congress getting something done might be slim, but I think it's going to be an absolutely crypto obsessed Congress. I think there'll be more bills introduced than probably every other bill to date that has been introduced in aggregate. So I think it's going to be incredibly busy and thinking about where this space is going over the next 1020 years, that work is absolutely critical in Congress to end up eventually with good policy. So that is definitely top of the list. I think litigation is probably going to be more important over the next two years for better and for worse than it has been previously, given that the legislature might be clammed up a bit. And then rulemaking, I think, is going to be a top priority for us.
00:19:28.594 - 00:20:06.974, Speaker D: I think that the SEC has some open rulemakings that could be particularly problematic for DFI protocols, the bipartisan infrastructure framework. If you can think all the way back to August 2021, the rulemaking for implementing that new definition of a broker will eventually need to happen, and that might be this year. So I think that just keeping on doing the everyday work with Congress is the top priority, and then litigation and regulatory work is going to be just as important, and that's just domestically. I'll let speak, Sheila, speak to what's happening all around the world.
00:20:07.172 - 00:20:11.246, Speaker C: And when you talk about litigation, any particular litigation that you want to call out?
00:20:11.348 - 00:20:45.706, Speaker D: Well, right now we're involved in the Ukidao case. It's the first time a federal agency sued a Dao as such, alleging that it's an unincorporated association. So that's one we're involved in right now. I think to the extent these rulemakings are finalized, knock on wood, in destructive ways, that is a deaf area for potential litigation too. But we'll see. If you had asked me on October 7 last year, I would not have guessed that Tornado Dash would be designated an entity the next day. So who knows what will come down.
00:20:45.728 - 00:21:38.186, Speaker A: The pike yeah, this is probably where I disclose I'm on the steering committee of the DeFi Education Fund. So work very closely with Miller on thinking through some of the priorities at the DeFi Education Fund and for CCI. We're a global alliance, so we are looking across the world, really. We're active right now, specifically in Brussels, in Europe, in the UK, which of course, post Brexit, there's a lot going on in the UK that I don't know that everyone's aware of in the US. I also think we're stepping up our engagement at the state level, specifically in California, where we are seeing a number of things happening that it could be good or could be bad, depending on how industry engages, right? These things always have a window where they can go one way or the other and be positive or negative for users of users of products and services in the industry. I think for us, I'll add, I think it's a good reminder. As Miller calls out, there are three branches of government.
00:21:38.186 - 00:22:39.546, Speaker A: The legislature is the one that gets a lot of attention, particularly in the wake of the DCPA. And with Sam and all that, people are I think a lot of crypto is like eyes are trained specifically on the Hill. But there are two other branches of government that are also really important and we are seeing the judicial branch. There's a lot of changes that happened last year there as well that didn't get the same attention. But you've got something called the Chevron doctrine around how are federal agencies, executive agencies, how can they make rules, and are those rules sticky or persistent or are those rules going to be challenged in court? And we're seeing that come up not just in our space, but in a lot of other spaces that have implications for how we think about bringing litigation. And here I'm kind of speaking as a lawyer right, in this space, and so I do think you're going to see a lot more activity in that space. And part of the strategy now is, is it more efficient, is it more permanent, frankly, to take a litigation route and go through the judicial branch of government than it is to maybe seek a legislative solution? And those are things that are now in play because of where we are with the legislative branch specifically on the Hill.
00:22:39.546 - 00:23:24.134, Speaker A: The states should not be understated. State activity is going to get, I think, more and more prominent and present, particularly as the perception that at the federal level, there's going to be, again, this difficulty in getting really comprehensive things across the line. So what's that going to mean? And then, of course, Europe, europe is taking a vote soon, the very final kind of vote on Mika, and then that's going to move into implementation. Implementation is really where the rubber meets the road. How is each country going to look at these rules? How are they going to implement them? Will they be harmonious? There's some of these principles that have been laid out in Mika, you could drive a train through them. So which facet is going to be the one that's sticky in any given country is all really important work and then of course you've mean like we just go on and on. There's Japan.
00:23:24.134 - 00:23:27.294, Speaker A: I mean there's just so much coming I think, at this space.
00:23:27.412 - 00:23:40.098, Speaker C: Yeah, a couple of things. So first of all Mika is markets and crypto assets regulation that's about to be adopted in the European Union but we'll talk about foreign jurisdictions later on in the show. So why don't we just discuss us for now.
00:23:40.184 - 00:24:12.234, Speaker A: So in that case I'll kind of run that down and say there's also all of the banking regulators right. And so the intersection you're going to have there, we've got engagement over last year. We had the Department of labor weighing in on stuff. We have the IRS weighing in on things. We've got OFAC tornado cash to that point. So there's a lot of activity happening in Washington out of these executive agencies or out of these other agencies that are even independent and I think know again we should keep an eye on the Fed and what's happening. Out of Project Hamilton other kinds of investigations into A-U-S.
00:24:12.234 - 00:24:21.882, Speaker A: Domestic CBDC that I think are having influence whether it's at treasury or whether it's on how others are thinking about this entire space, the digital asset space more broadly.
00:24:22.026 - 00:24:49.358, Speaker C: So one other thing that I did want to ask about though, when it comes to Congress well, a couple of things. So first of all, Congressman Patrick Henry is now the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and he's obviously extremely pro crypto. He's a previous guest on this show and I wondered how you expected his position in that role. Plus the appointment of French Hill to lead the brand new subcommittee on digital assets financial technology to affect movement on crypto regulation.
00:24:49.394 - 00:25:49.014, Speaker D: This think, you know, it's evidence of what she was arguing. I think it's going to be the crypto Congress that might not get comprehensive legislation over the finish line. Kind of paradoxically there. Yeah, I think the importance of Patrick McHenry being the new chairman of the Financial Services Committee is pretty important. I think he's one of the most knowledgeable about crypto and DeFi members of Congress that we have and I think that in that role he can play an outsized role in shaping legislative packages that will be enormously influential down the line. I think the best example being perhaps on custodial stablecoin regulation. That was a deal that the administration and both parties in Congress tried to put together, so to speak, last year and got pretty close and I think is one area where everyone's, at least in principle, in agreement that it's necessary and would be beneficial.
00:25:49.014 - 00:26:07.002, Speaker D: So I think that might be an area of focus for the committee and I think that we've already seen they also will be keenly interested, at least Republicans on that committee in conducting vigorous oversight of how the federal agencies are approaching their regulation of the crypto markets.
00:26:07.146 - 00:26:27.926, Speaker A: The other thing about Patrick McHenry, of course, is that he has demonstrated ability to work across the aisle. And also if you're watching the speaker hearings, you could see Patrick McHenry really as somebody who is a mover and shaker within his own party. So not everyone is. And so the prominence of him both as an influencer in a bipartisan way is something that shouldn't be understated. It's really important.
00:26:28.108 - 00:26:50.174, Speaker C: And I also wanted to check in on the status of some major crypto legislation that was proposed previously. Obviously we discussed the Dccpa, but there was also the Gillibrand Lumis bill and I wondered if either of these were sort of dead in the water. I have a sense they have to be reintroduced in this Congress, but I didn't know what your sense was of current support for either of these.
00:26:50.372 - 00:27:55.090, Speaker A: So they would have to be reintroduced. And I think the question is really what the appetite is going to be for the authors and co sponsors of those bills from the past to kind of bring them forward in their form. What I always say is just because whether a bill is introduced or not introduced, the language that's agreed upon in a bill is really important. So if you get to a place where you have a coalition, you've got participants and co sponsors from across again, are we two parties anymore, are we four parties? I mean, who knows? But if you've got this across the political spectrum, you've got some alignment on at least kind of high level principles that have then begun to be grounded into concrete language that does have some stickiness. And so I don't know that there's appetite necessarily for those bills in that form because of everything that happened, et cetera, especially around DCPA, to move forward. And I think there's also considerations around the politics of that, how a now Republican led House is going to engage the Democratic Senate, those kinds of things are also complicated. But I do know that some of that language is very much active, I would say, or like live, if you want to put it that way.
00:27:55.090 - 00:28:29.578, Speaker A: And it's ripe for being pulled into other legislation. So I think, as Miller and I have both said, we do think there's going to be a flurry of activity and drafting and all this kind of stuff. I think a lot of folks want to kind of own their own bill in a way, right? So trying to create coalition around that is going to be interesting given that this is a topic a lot of folks in this crypto Congress want to engage on. As always, Laura, nothing is ever really dead, right? Like that's not how it. Really works. So we kind of have to see how this plays out and what kind of coalitions are going to start forming as a lot of things get more baked and settled in the next few weeks and the next month in Washington.
00:28:29.754 - 00:28:40.180, Speaker C: All right, so in a moment, we're going to run through a list of topics that people are very specifically interested in when it comes to crypto regulation. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:30:06.530 - 00:30:48.300, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Sheila and Miller. For a long time it was said that the first kind of crypto legislation that would likely be implemented in the US. Would be something around stablecoins. However, obviously, as we know, last fall, the Dccpa sort of seemed to maybe edge that aside. However, of course, nothing on either matter got passed. But before leaving office, pennsylvania Senator or former Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey did introduce a bill around Stablecoins. And I wondered what you see currently in this Congress in terms of interest in passing Stablecoin legislation and also if there is still interest, what will it look like and when do you think it might pass?
00:30:48.990 - 00:31:23.282, Speaker D: I think that remains true, that if Congress moves on one thing, if I were a betting man, I would bet on custodial Stablecoin regulation. The Treasury Department is quite focused on Congress moving on that in their reports, pursuant to the Executive order, they gave principles for what that should look like. And so everyone, I think, is highly motivated to get that done. And anything that touches the dollar, the Congress and the executive are going to be keenly focused on what it would look like. That's the 100 billion dollar question. In this instance.
00:31:23.346 - 00:31:24.178, Speaker A: Trillion.
00:31:24.354 - 00:31:48.880, Speaker D: Yeah, nobody quite knows. I think Pat team is one of the more thoughtful examples of what that could look like. I think that in this instance, congress would be prudent to keep that massive topic as narrowly focused on custodial stable coins as possible and then go from there, which, those being the vast majority of the market but what that would look like, who knows today?
00:31:50.290 - 00:32:31.078, Speaker A: It's the most no brainer thing that needs to get done, honestly. And the only reason it didn't go last year was politics. I think everyone who really cares about it is informed about it, is educated about it. There have been so many different folks in Congress on both chambers and both sides of the aisle that have waded into it and kind of understand it. It's no brainer. But again, is it going to be the first priority? I don't know that I necessarily I think it should be because I think, again, it's like no brainer, low hanging fruit stuff that should be able to get across the line very easily. But we're just in this kind of world where I did not think it would take 15 votes to get a speaker.
00:32:31.078 - 00:32:50.850, Speaker A: Again, no brainer vote. So it's really hard to say until some of these committees have been meeting and have put out some of their priorities. It's really hard to know what might go first. But I'll just kind of leave it there and say, I really think that that should. But I also thought it should have last year, and I also was fairly confident it would not because of politics.
00:32:51.270 - 00:33:10.850, Speaker C: So another big question that's been hanging over the crypto space for ages is whether the default way to treat crypto should be as security or a commodity. And at the moment I was wondering whether you saw that there was momentum in one direction or the other amongst these lawmakers.
00:33:11.010 - 00:33:40.300, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's probably one of the last questions that will be answered by Congress if stablecoins are the first. To Sheila's point, it's an fortunate situation because one would think that without classifying the asset as anything, you could construct some framework where consumers are being protected and other public policy objectives are being met. Whether you call it a security commodity or a duck in theory, that really shouldn't matter. But it does, given how our system.
