00:01:17.102 - 00:01:27.910, Speaker A: Today's guest is Lawson Baker, head of Operations and General Counsel at Tokensoft Disclosure. Before we get into the show, Tokensoft was a previous sponsor of my show. Welcome, Lawson.
00:01:28.250 - 00:01:30.006, Speaker C: Hey, Laura. How are you?
00:01:30.188 - 00:02:04.980, Speaker A: Good, glad to have you. So there was a lot of regulatory news this week, but I wanted to start with one that I know you were particularly following, which is the SEC's statement on broker dealers in the crypto space. And it was titled joint Staff Statement on Broker Dealer Custody of Digital Asset securities. So before we get to the statement itself, I want to have you explain the backstory behind why this statement that they released matters like what is a broker dealer, what do they do in crypto? And what specifically were people waiting for to be resolved regarding this issue.
00:02:05.430 - 00:03:18.774, Speaker C: Sure. So just kind of quick disclaimer, all of these opinions are mine and not Tokensoft, and I'm not giving legal or financial advice by way of background. The security Token space is essentially this idea of selling investments to people that are associated with either traditional financial assets or more crypto native assets. Post 2017, when Tokensoft launched, there were a number of people who kind of trended towards we needed to do these sales of Token sales to follow securities laws. And so that's really what we focused on at Tokensoft. And the market, as it trended towards following the securities laws, essentially started following rules related to private security sales and selling to credit investors or registering the security. And one of the key issues with that is when you're doing a Token sale, a security token sale, after the tokens are sold, who can hold them? And in the context of security, Tokens broker dealers can hold them if they're approved to hold custody of security tokens.
00:03:18.774 - 00:04:34.238, Speaker C: People call that a carrying broker dealer in the space. And currently there are a number of broker dealers that are approved to quote, hold securities. The SEC, however, has essentially told the vast majority of broker dealers in the space a kind of aside, hey, you shouldn't be dealing with security tokens until we tell you how to deal with them. And so while they may be approved for custody of securities, they're kind of like nudging them and saying, you probably shouldn't hold security tokens until we approve that. And so that's like this current class of broker dealers and then there's like this new age class of exchanges or exchanges like Coinbase or just trust companies and a whole other group of people who are trying to get approval for brand new broker dealers and new exchanges that can hold securities on behalf of its users and investors. For the past probably two years, all of their applications have been in limbo. And at the end of 2018, the kind of the word on the street, if you were talking to the SEC was, hey, we're going to release new guidance in the first quarter of 2019 over how to custody security tokens.
00:04:34.238 - 00:05:54.830, Speaker C: And that kind of helped the market be like, okay, good, let's get some guidance and then we can go forward. And then the government was shut down for all of January and it essentially took till July eigth, a little over six months of the year to get the first part of this guidance. And so what they did in their guidance is more like stating the issues and maybe drawing the lines of where the issues are present. So from the drawing the lines perspective, they kind of clarified if you're operating an ATS but not actually taking custody of the tokens on the exchange when there's a sale. Meaning Me Lawson, holder of pre IPO stock, selling my securities directly to Laura. I can use the ATS to help facilitate that sale, but I have to send those security tokens directly to Laura. And so part of the release was kind of clarifying who is not technically subject to these type of rules, which is not really news so much as just kind of like highlighting what that looks like in the context of security tokens.
00:05:54.830 - 00:07:31.610, Speaker C: And then they really focused on why do we care about the issues related to custody of security tokens? And it really kind of comes down to two things. One is in the context of a security token and things on the blockchain, how can you prove you actually are the only entity that custody of security tokens is the first thing? And the second thing is like, how do we make sure investors are protected? Those concerns directly relate to how cryptocurrencies and how tokens on blockchains work today with regards to how do broker dealers prove they control security tokens for the same way that how would Lawson prove he owns his bitcoin. That's really kind of an unsolved problem because what you essentially have is a private keys that can unlock your access to the cryptocurrencies or security tokens. You can't prove you're the only person with those private keys. You can only prove that you have a reasonable good process to securely generate those keys or break up those keys where you're the only one with control of it, but you can't actually prove that no one else somehow got access to your private keys. And so that's kind of this one issue that's frankly unsolved and will only be solved by well drafted policy procedures and then auditing of it after the fact. Kind of like anything else you would audit financials or standard operating controls.
00:07:31.610 - 00:08:29.978, Speaker C: With regards to the second issue is how do you protect investors? This really kind of comes down to this concept of like where's the undo button? In all of traditional finance, both banks and broker dealers, there's an undo button. If there is a mistake, the regulator knows who to tell to fix it and the consumer or investor knows who to say, hey, you need to fix that. And so why would you need an undo button with regards to security tokens? It's pretty plain and simple. Security tokens are traditionally for traditional finance. Assets are associated with off chain assets, off chain businesses and as a result is a little bit of a different experiment than cryptocurrencies censorship. Resistance is not really a narrative of security tokens. Security tokens need what I call God mode.
00:08:29.978 - 00:09:41.126, Speaker C: They need the ability to have undo buttons. And so this idea of the undo button would address things like if I accidentally sent my security token to the wrong address or the broker dealer accidentally sent the security tokens to the wrong address, they need to be able to fix that problem for the investor. Or if I passed away, my will says these securities need to go to my girlfriend or my heirs or whoever. They need a functional way to transfer those security tokens to somebody else. From our perspective at Tokensoft, this is a solved problem. I co authored with this tokensoft team, ERC 14 Four, which is essentially a security token standard that both implements the transfer restrictions associated with security tokens which aren't present on normal cryptocurrencies. In addition to giving the security token issuer for unregistered securities or transfer agents for registered securities, god mode, if there's a mistake, there's a button to fix it.
00:09:41.148 - 00:09:53.050, Speaker A: Essentially for the companies that were kind of waiting in the wings for this guidance, do you feel like what was released this week is enough for them to proceed?
00:09:53.390 - 00:10:41.418, Speaker C: It's kind of no news news. The fact that they put it out was nice. I think there was some internal conflict for them to be able to put something like this out now that it's out, in addition to I think we're going to talk about later, the reggae the first Reggae approved with Blockstack, I think we're unfreezing. The SEC is unfreezing now. I think probably if you're thinking in their mindset, first they need to release what we think the issues are, and then they're probably going to either follow that up with more direct solutions over what they expect custodians to do, or we'll just start seeing approvals. So all of these applications for carrying broker dealers are going to probably start getting approved. So I know a number of exchanges applied for it.
00:10:41.418 - 00:11:03.230, Speaker C: The Anchorage startup in the space applied for it. There are a number of startups and exchanges and even established financial institutions that are asking for permission, even if technically they can hold securities. I think we'll start to see potentially approval now that we have this kind of first guidance out.
00:11:03.380 - 00:11:15.954, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll see what happens. We're going to discuss Blockstack's, Reggae plus ICO, and also the Libra congressional hearings next week. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:11:16.072 - 00:12:09.558, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors. privacyenhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations.

00:12:39.866 - 00:13:13.900, Speaker A: Now back to my conversation with Lawson Baker of Tokensoft. So before we move on to blockstack, I just have one last question, which is? When I was reading the SEC statement on broker dealers, there was something about some of the wording where it made me think that this regulation. And this is a thought that I've had before as well from reading some of the other guidance where reading this statement, I also thought, oh, regulation broadly might push the industry further into a sort of peer to peer noncustodial direction. Do you agree with that?
00:13:14.430 - 00:14:10.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's exactly what the technology allows for. When you read the release they were talking about in the context of when there are peer to peer type transfers, I e. The broker dealer is not actually custodying the tokens in between, then they're basically saying that's not what this is talking about. So if you're at Shares Post ATS, or Open Finance ATS or any of the other ATS, which is alternative trading system exchange in the space, unless they're approved for custody, they can't escrow the transaction. So I can't send it first to them before you send the money to them, and then they release both sides. It just has to go between either a trust company, which is not under SEC jurisdiction could do it, or it would have to go peer to peer. I would have to send it directly to you.
00:14:10.798 - 00:14:20.830, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's kind of how the market's been operating today without approval. Peer to peer is what's frankly been necessary in most contexts.
00:14:21.970 - 00:14:24.162, Speaker A: It's pretty cypherpunk of the government, I think.
00:14:24.216 - 00:14:25.780, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm okay with that.
00:14:27.590 - 00:15:00.426, Speaker A: All right, so let's now talk about the big news this week regarding Block Stack with this first regulated ICO. And at the moment of recording, they haven't announced whether or not they sold all the $20 million worth of tokens on sale, but they have been tweeting that they kept having to spin up extra servers and stuff due to demand. So what effect do you think that this Reggae Plus offering by Blockstack, and now there's another one that's also been approved, what effect do you think those will have on the ICO phenomenon? Will we see more crypto projects go?
00:15:00.448 - 00:15:06.720, Speaker C: This, you know, Blockstack's, a really cool project that I've been following for a few years now.
00:15:07.890 - 00:15:10.174, Speaker A: And yes, they were previously on the show, by the way.
00:15:10.212 - 00:15:10.462, Speaker C: Cool.
00:15:10.516 - 00:15:14.834, Speaker A: But it was a long time ago. I should probably it was like, I think, two or three years ago.
00:15:14.872 - 00:16:13.022, Speaker C: Yeah, very cool technology. It's basically something around this idea of moving back towards a peer to peer version of the Internet with local data and local identity, interacting with distributed systems. It's a very cool project. It's unfortunate they're having issues with their sale and their service provider. But I think it really highlights what I agree with is this idea that normal investors want access to some of this technology and these investment opportunities. And so the current securities laws today don't really allow for a non accredited investor, joe Plummer, to invest in many early stage projects, whether it be early stage companies or early stage tokens. Those normally fall under you have to fall under an exemption where you can only sell to credit investors, people with a certain amount of income or wealth.
00:16:13.022 - 00:17:19.958, Speaker C: What Reggae Eight Plus does is essentially say, hey, startup, or early stage crypto project, you can sell up to a certain dollar amount. It's either $50 million or there's also a $25 million number in one year. There's also a cap number over a multi year period based off your assets. You can sell up to let's call it $50 million to normal consumers that are not accredited investors in this kind of a mini IPO model. It's not a full blown registration, like when Google or Airbnb or whoever goes public. It's an in between exempt security and a full blown registration in that it has a little bit less requirements over how many years of financial statements and audits and those type of things. But it allows for you to sell up to, in Blockstack's case, up to $50 million to consumers, directly to consumers.
00:17:19.958 - 00:18:09.030, Speaker C: In the Reggae requirements, you can only invest a certain amount of your income or net wealth. It's like 10%. And so the Block stack approval is part of this narrative. I was going back to earlier with the SEC first gave this guidance and now we just saw our first approval. That's kind of related. I think that goes along with the narrative that we could start seeing a lot more approvals. The rumor last fall was there were something around 100 to 150 crypto native Reg A projects in some sort of back and forth filing stage trying to get approval for Reggaes in the crypto space.
00:18:09.030 - 00:18:30.238, Speaker C: I don't know how many of those are still around because there's high quality projects and there's not always high quality projects. But I know at Tokensoft we've been talking to a lot of people and can already support Reggae offerings, and we expect there to be a whole bunch more that are going to go live now that we start seeing the first few kind of come out.
00:18:30.404 - 00:18:52.786, Speaker A: And then just briefly before we move on to Facebook, do you think that the requirements for crypto companies to file a Reggae Plus are too onerous? Because I noticed that Maneib Ali, the CEO of Blockstack, said that Blockstack spent $2 million on their filing, which that's pretty heavy lift for a project that's just starting out. Do you think that could stifle innovation?
00:18:52.898 - 00:19:17.002, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the idea of Reggae was to frankly cost less and be less of a burden than a full registration. And those type of dollar amounts sound like a full registration type of cost. However, the fact of the matter is, I think for the good and the bad, the block stacks of the world and MANEB had to do a lot of educating of the regulators, just like a lot of the broker dealers were trying to get approved.
00:19:17.146 - 00:19:26.606, Speaker A: I'm willing to bet on he did tell the Wall Street Journal that he has been calling it Blockstack's $2 million donation to the crypto industry.
00:19:26.718 - 00:19:56.282, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment. I think they did a lot of education and I'm okay with that. It's unfortunate for them. I'm glad they are willing to do it. Not everyone is good at educating and giving analogies and trying to help the regulator understand, hey, this is how it's similar and this is how it's different and here's how we compensate for that. We spent a lot of time thinking about that at Tokensoft and trying to make sure we account for that and how we design our systems. And I think Benib did a good job.
00:19:56.282 - 00:19:59.114, Speaker C: They got it approved, and so congrats to them.
00:19:59.312 - 00:20:11.680, Speaker A: Yeah. And also, just to give people more context, I mean, they have really big name backers like Union Square Ventures, which is hugely influential in the space. It's not like.
00:20:17.750 - 00:20:40.730, Speaker C: They raised money in 2017. I think they raised around 50 million, if I remember correctly, back then, and frankly have been on an incredibly lean team. I think the last numbers I heard were like 15 or 17 people. And so they're not burning money. I'll say that they're pointing it towards the right resources, presumably until they're ready to deploy it faster.
00:20:41.230 - 00:20:53.978, Speaker A: All right, so let's now turn to what's on the horizon for next week, which is the congressional hearings on Facebook's Libra. Both the Senate and the House are interested in this. What will you be looking for during those hearings?
00:20:54.074 - 00:21:58.606, Speaker C: Yeah, this is for everybody who's not aware, is Facebook's attempt at putting together a, quote, distributed or decentralized cryptocurrency. It's a little bit of different structure. They are looking for 100 partners to be part of the validation system and consensus system of the Libra blockchain. And those partners are essentially, they've said, we want them to be well known capitalized and should be brands, consumers, trust. And these brands and these companies will help secure the network and secure the funds. In addition to they have, I believe it's a Swiss foundation that will hold in it a basket of government fiat currencies. And so the Libra token is, quote, backed by a basket of US dollars and euros and pounds and maybe even the Chinese yen.
00:21:58.606 - 00:22:00.654, Speaker C: I forget who's the entire basket?
00:22:00.782 - 00:22:03.070, Speaker A: No, it's a Japanese yen.
00:22:03.230 - 00:22:05.462, Speaker C: It is Japanese yen. Okay.
00:22:05.516 - 00:22:06.022, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:06.156 - 00:23:01.666, Speaker C: So that's the idea. It's basically this idea of a cryptocurrency backed by a basket of assets supported and, quote, secured by a hundred different entities. And so, as you're well aware, the House Financial Services Committee, when they heard the Libra announcement, basically, hey, Facebook, you need to get our approval or talk to us first before you do that. And their concerns are a number of concerns, if I'm a guessing man. Most of them are probably a little bit of overflow from just Facebook concerns. So things like privacy and too much control. And how big and how much can Facebook influence? I think, as we saw in the prior elections, people believe there was influence that occurred on Facebook with the elections.
00:23:01.666 - 00:23:26.142, Speaker C: And so the question is, do they want potential new type of money to be influenced by Facebook, or things that happened on Facebook in addition to Facebook's got a lot of consumer data, and so they're very concerned with should people's financial lives be associated or attached to their financial lives? Is that something go ahead.
00:23:26.276 - 00:23:34.000, Speaker A: Given this context, what do you think the likelihood is that the regulators will keep Libra from happening?
00:23:37.830 - 00:24:22.158, Speaker C: Can they keep it from happening? I think the social pressure will have more of effect than what from a regulatory stance they can do. I think they probably have a pretty buttoned up structure of how they can do it. The question is, do they think they have enough social pressure to allow them to do know? I'm pro the libra project because I'm pro attention on cryptocurrencies. I believe the libra project is, like, similar to stablecoins, and it's probably a little bit different of experiment than things like bitcoin and truly crypto native assets that aren't associated with off chain assets or off chain entities. So I think attention on the space is okay, and it's mean will it.
00:24:22.164 - 00:25:00.186, Speaker A: Get approved by the one thing is yeah, I just feel like the timing for facebook to do this, it's like their kind of popularity, at least in the halls of government, is probably at somewhat of an all time low. And so in that regard, it just feels like, oh, yeah, okay, so maybe libra might be a good project, but is this the right time? But one other thing that I noticed this week was the former governor of the people think of China suggested that China should do its own version of libra. Do you think that specter of, like, a digital yuan will pressure the US. Or I guess other non Chinese regulators to allow libra to go through?
00:25:00.368 - 00:26:02.298, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point. Mason, the CEO and one of the co founders of tokensoft, wrote an open letter to the head of the financial services committee in the house that basically said, hey, we understand your concerns, and we also understand your concerns that should these type of projects be banked in Swiss foundations? And part of Mason's call was like, hey, you should open the doors to the US. To cryptocurrency projects like libra, like know, giving clarity around things like ethereum and bitcoin, because if you don't, other countries will. You know, there's a number of narratives of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and these type of things. One of them is competition. When you make money software, you're going to have a whole lot of competition with the best software. And beyond software, you then have social influence.
00:26:02.298 - 00:26:41.018, Speaker C: And so 100% governments can and will make cryptocurrencies. If the US Is not awake and paying attention to that, then they're going to lose. It's as simple as that. Being said, I think there's this whole other narrative of cryptocurrencies in this idea of separation of money from state, and that's what bitcoin is doing in a very similar way to separation religion of state. Bitcoin is trying to separate money from state. The question is, should corporations also be separated from money? That's for the community in the world to decide, but these are the narratives that are fighting right now.
00:26:41.184 - 00:26:46.490, Speaker A: All right, well, we will see how it plays out. It's been great having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
