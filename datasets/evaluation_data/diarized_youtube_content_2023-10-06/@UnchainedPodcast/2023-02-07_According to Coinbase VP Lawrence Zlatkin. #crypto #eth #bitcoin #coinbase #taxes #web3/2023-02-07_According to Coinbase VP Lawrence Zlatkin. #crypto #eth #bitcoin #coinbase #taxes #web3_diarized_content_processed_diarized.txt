00:00:00.090 - 00:00:45.890, Speaker A: Don't make the mistake that just because you didn't receive a report or information from someone that you have income that you derive from crypto on DeFi or elsewhere, that you don't have to report that because you actually and the most important thing about owning crypto, unfortunately, is record keeping because it's essentially decentralized. It puts more of the burden on you to keep track of your assets that's benefit overall because the better you track them, the more you can evaluate when to trigger gains or losses, what those gains and losses otherwise are. Otherwise at some point you may receive a report from a brokerage which has a zero basis. It's just like a blank because it doesn't really know what your basis is. So it's really on you to sort of keep track and keep good records for associated with your assets.
