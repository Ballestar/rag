00:00:07.050 - 00:01:19.910, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap the Fed Drops Its CBDC Report The Federal Reserve released its long anticipated white paper on central bank Digital currencies on Thursday, explaining the Fed's current views, plus requesting feedback on questions regarding the privacy, financial stability and usage of a potential CBDC. The Fed did not commit to issuing a CBDC or digital dollar. The Federal Reserve would only pursue a CBDC in the context of broad public and cross governmental support, wrote the Fed, adding, The Federal Reserve does not intend to proceed with issuance of a CBDC without clear support from the Executive branch and from Congress, ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law. Interestingly, the paper did discuss what a potential CBDC would look like. A potential US CBDC, if one were created, would best serve the needs of the United States by being privacy protected, intermediated, widely transferable, and identity verified. Notably, the Fed's definition did not mention either crypto or distributed ledger technology in its definition of a CBDC.
00:01:19.910 - 00:02:13.490, Speaker A: In fact, in the 40 page report about issuing a CBDC, the Fed only mentioned crypto 13 times and Stablecoins 17 times. When it did discuss crypto, the analysis was biting. Cryptocurrencies have not been widely adopted as a means of payment in the United States. They remain subject to extreme price volatility, are difficult to use without service providers, and have severe limitations on transaction throughput many. Cryptocurrencies also come with a significant energy footprint and make consumers vulnerable to loss, theft and fraud. The Fed was also tough on Stablecoins, calling for Congress to promptly enact legislation. In related news, on Wednesday, two FDIC insured banks, NBH Bank and New York Community Bank, conducted the first USDF transaction.
00:02:13.490 - 00:02:58.246, Speaker A: USDF is a stablecoin created by a group of FDIC insured banks in the US. Including Synovis, New York Community Bank and Sterling National Bank, the 40 eigth, 45th and 77th largest banks in the US. By assets. The stablecoin operates on the Providence blockchain and is redeemable for cash at a onetoone ratio at any of the member groups. As of now, the FDIC has not confirmed whether USDF would qualify for pass through insurance, which would protect holders against losses up to $250,000.

00:02:58.246 - 00:03:40.354, Speaker A: The Federal Security Service, Russia's top domestic intelligence agency, successfully raided 25 residences tied to reeval, arresting the person the US. Government says who was behind the colonial pipeline attack. And the government also seized roughly $6.8 million in currency, including crypto, according to a press release. The FSB said its actions came at the appeal of US. Authorities. In November, CNN reported that Attorney General Merrick Garland estimated that revo ransomware had been deployed in an estimated 175,000 computers worldwide and caused at least $200 million in ransom payments to be made.
00:03:40.354 - 00:04:39.170, Speaker A: Of that $200 million, at least $15 million in ransom payments has been confirmed to be received via bitcoin after reeval's successful attacks on colonial pipeline, which paid out roughly $4.4 million, and to the meatpacker JBS, which paid out $11 million. In related news, Russia's central bank believes that the country should ban cryptocurrency activities, according to a report presented by the director of the bank of Russia's Financial Stability Department on Thursday. It suggests that an optimal solution for Russia would be to ban crypto mining and that new laws and regulations are needed to shut down crypto related activities. Interestingly, the report did not suggest banning ownership of crypto. The world's 21st largest city intends to add crypto to its balance sheet. Eduardo Pius, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, announced last week that the city plans to convert part of its treasury into crypto.
00:04:39.170 - 00:05:33.426, Speaker A: We are going to launch crypto Rio and invest 1% of the treasury in cryptocurrency, said Piaz at Rio Innovation Week. Rio de Janeiro also has plans to offer tax breaks for citizens who pay in crypto. We are studying the possibility of paying taxes with an additional discount. If you pay with bitcoins, you take the discount of the single quota of 7% of the Iptu, which is local property tax. It becomes 10% if you pay in bitcoin, explained Rio de Janeiro's finance secretary Pedro Paolo. In related news, El Salvador is coming under fire from Moody's Investor Service for doing what Miami and Rio de Janeiro aspire to do buy bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, El Salvador's bitcoin trades, which seem to come directly from President Naib Bukele's personal device, appear to be down roughly 14%, based on the timing of Bukele's purchase announcements.
00:05:33.426 - 00:06:24.802, Speaker A: An analyst for Moody's described El Salvador's BTC trading to Bloomberg as quite risky, particularly for a government that has been struggling with liquidity pressure in the past. The analyst also noted that El Salvador's holdings of 1139 BTC does not pose a significant threat to its debt obligations. However, increased buying could induce greater risk to repayment capacity, remarked the analyst. Notably, El Salvador faces an 800 million dollar bond that matures in January 2023. Moody's already downgraded El Salvador to a rating of CAA, one which judges El Salvador's bond to be a very high credit risk. When investing.com. Posted on Twitter that Moody had downgraded El Salvador's debt due to bitcoin trades.
00:06:24.802 - 00:07:30.640, Speaker A: Naib Bukelli replied, breaking El Salvador DGAF. I'm sure you all can figure out what that means. Judge rules Ripple can gain access to SEC communication. Ripple won a battle against the securities and Exchange Commission last week when a federal judge granted them access to emails regarding former SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman's, 2018. Speech in which he said putting aside the fundraising that accompany the creation of Ether based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. With a decision, the SEC cannot claim that emails about Hinman's speech are privileged, meaning Ripple will have access to communications from Valerie Steponik, the SEC's cryptozar and other regulators discussing the wording of the speech. Notably, the federal judge's reasoning was that she felt the speech concerned Hinman's personal views rather than SEC policy.
00:07:30.640 - 00:07:53.982, Speaker A: Although Hinman and the SEC admit that agency staff discussed his speech, it appears that this speech was merely peripheral to actual policy formation and not an essential link in the SEC's deliberative process with respect to Ether. Accordingly, emails concerning the speech or draft versions are neither predecisional nor deliberative.
00:07:54.046 - 00:07:58.166, Speaker B: Agency Documents entitled to Protection Speaking of.
00:07:58.188 - 00:08:53.442, Speaker A: Regulation, per Bloomberg, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said this week that crypto exchanges should expect stricter scrutiny in 2022. I've asked staff to look at every way to get these platforms inside the investor protection remit. If the trading platforms don't come into the regulated space, it'd be another year of the public being vulnerable, the SEC chair reportedly said in a virtual conference on Wednesday. OMG DFI 20 takes a hit ohm, the native token of Olympus Dow, crashed to an alltime low of $98.35 on Monday, marking a 91% decline from its alltime high in April 2021. According to DFI llama, Olympus Dow's total value locked has also plunged by over $1 billion since December 1. Olympus Dow is a decentralized reserve currency protocol.
00:08:53.442 - 00:09:48.280, Speaker A: Each Ohm token is backed by a basket of assets like Dai or Fracs in the Olympus Treasury, giving each token a baseline value below which it should not fall. Essentially, the purpose of Ohm is to act as a store of value not tied to the USD. Ohm tokens are generated when users bond other cryptos, such as Dai, FRAX or WBTC, to the Olympusdao Treasury. This allows Olympusdao to own its liquidity. Olympusdao also allows Ohm holders to stake Ohm tokens in return for more Ohm tokens. Ohm has often traded for above the treasury of Olympusdao, allowing for Olympusdao to print more Ohm via Staking rewards, aka high APY, to dilute the value of Ohm back to the value of its treasury. This has created a virtuous cycle in the past as users stake Ohm to earn more Ohm, which they then stake again.
00:09:48.280 - 00:09:56.282, Speaker A: However, when users stop staking their Ohm and cash out, the price of Ohm can be wiped out quickly, as happened Sunday night.
00:09:56.336 - 00:09:59.654, Speaker B: According to crypto reporter Colin Wu, ether.
00:09:59.702 - 00:10:19.234, Speaker A: Scan shows a sushi swap transaction in which roughly $10 million in Ohm was traded for Dai, causing 25% slippage on Ohm trades and over $5 million in liquidations. Since the initial selloff, Ohm has yet to recover, with the token price sitting under $120 Thursday morning, down 46% from.
00:10:19.272 - 00:10:23.186, Speaker B: Seven days before, crypto.com hacked for about.
00:10:23.208 - 00:11:00.830, Speaker A: $33 million on Monday. The Cryptoexchange Crypto.com Disclosure, a sponsor of My shows, announced on Twitter that it would be suspending withdrawals from the platform after receiving multiple reports of suspicious activity. Several hours later, the firm requested users sign back in and reset their two factor authentication. On Thursday, in a postmortem crypto.com confirmed the suspicions of Onchain analysts by revealing that 483 customers lost 4836.26 ETH and 444.93
00:11:00.830 - 00:11:32.006, Speaker A: BTC, totaling roughly $33 million. The exchange says the hack occurred when transactions were approved without two FA being input by users. Crypto.com says that no customers lost funds, as most unauthorized transactions were prevented by the Exchange and other customers were fully reimbursed. Going forward, Crypto.com is introducing a security program for qualified Exchange users that restores up to $250,000 in stolen or lost funds due to a third party accessing.
00:11:32.038 - 00:11:35.626, Speaker B: The account walmart dipping its Toes into.
00:11:35.648 - 00:12:07.654, Speaker A: The Metaverse Based on a CNBC report, it appears that Walmart is ready to join. The Metaverse trademark filings from late December show that Walmart is preparing to make and sell virtual goods and mint virtual currencies, including NFTs. CNBC reports that Walmart filed seven trademark applications. However, in a statement, Walmart hedged against saying it will actually be using the technology. We are testing new ideas all the time, the company said. Some ideas become products or services that make it to customers, and some we.
00:12:07.692 - 00:12:10.902, Speaker B: Test iterate and learn from the news.
00:12:10.956 - 00:12:15.766, Speaker A: Comes roughly six months after Walmart posted a job on LinkedIn looking for a.
00:12:15.788 - 00:12:20.838, Speaker B: Visionary leader to develop a digital currency strategy the Meta.
00:12:20.854 - 00:13:07.030, Speaker A: Metaverse will have NFTs. The Financial Times, citing several people familiar with the matter, reports that Metta, for which disclosure I write a bulletin newsletter, is drawing out plans to allow users to create and display NFTs on their Facebook and Instagram profiles. In addition, Meta is looking into building an NFT marketplace. Novi Meta's Crypto wallet could play a key role in its push into NFTs. However, as of now, plans are still in the early stage. Speaking of NFT integrations, Twitter Blue, the Paywalled version of the social network, announced the launch of NFT profile pictures on iOS, where users can show off their expensive JPEGs to the world. Time for fun bits.
00:13:07.030 - 00:14:05.474, Speaker A: This Dow has it all Wrong spice Dow is an investment dow that crowdfunded around $3 million to purchase a rare copy of a proposed adaptation of the famous Sci-Fi novel Dune in November. This week, the Dow tweeted their plans for the book, which included produce an animated series based on it and support community projects. I guess no one told them that buying a copy of a book does not give them the copyright to it. I have genuinely spent ten minutes staring at this, but no, it really does appear to be true that a bunch of crypto bros just spent €2.6 million 100 x the asking price for a book at auction in the mistaken belief that they would therefore own the copyright in it, wrote Gary Brannon on Twitter.
