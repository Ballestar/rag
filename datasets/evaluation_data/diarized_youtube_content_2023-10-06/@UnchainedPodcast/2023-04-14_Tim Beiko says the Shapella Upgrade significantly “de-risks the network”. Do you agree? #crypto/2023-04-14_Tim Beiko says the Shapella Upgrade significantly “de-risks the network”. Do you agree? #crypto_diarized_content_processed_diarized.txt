00:00:00.410 - 00:00:34.550, Speaker A: I really didn't spend a lot of time thinking about how many people withdraw or deposit. Obviously, it's known there's, like, a couple entities that had to sort of withdraw everything. But I think there's, like, two things where it feels like it balances out. One is just withdrawals significantly. I think derisked staking on ethereum for a few reasons. One is like, you know that they're possible. Even though, I don't know, the people working on the protocol sort of knew that this would probably happen around this time.
00:00:34.550 - 00:00:56.140, Speaker A: I appreciate the skepticism of maybe others in the community who feel like, okay, I'm staking this thing and I have no idea when I'm going to be able to withdraw it. But I think having it actually be live and working is like a significant derisking factor. And I think the thing that it does as well is it reduces, like, the commitment you have to make. Like before, when you were staking on ethereum, you sort of had to commit all the way until withdrawals at least.
