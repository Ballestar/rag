00:00:01.370 - 00:00:54.590, Speaker A: Hello, and thanks for tuning into this week's unchained weekly news recap. I'm michael del castillo, a knight badget fellow at columbia university. In the latest of a series of developing events, the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy last November following alleged criminal mismanagement, is navigating through significant legal and financial turmoil. The exchange received approval from US. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey in the District of Delaware to sell $3.4 billion in crypto assets, including substantial holdings in bitcoin, ethereum and salana, to repay creditors and recover from a $7 billion deficit. In what appears to be a move to prevent spooking the market, the sale, managed by Galaxy Digital, plans to liquidate up to $100 million worth of tokens, a figure that could potentially increase to $200 million, according to the plan.
00:00:54.590 - 00:02:36.186, Speaker A: Simultaneously, Bahamasbased FTX initiated legal action against Crosschain protocols Layer Zero Labs seeking to recover over $21 million in what its lawyers called, quote, avoidable transfers, end quote. That occurred in the 90 days leading up to its bankruptcy declaration, a lawsuit alleges fraudulent agreements and share transfers orchestrated between FTX subsidiary Alameda Research's, then CEO Caroline Ellison and Layer Zero. The exchange accuses Layer Zero, its former chief operating officer Robert Leighton, and others from attempting to circumvent Chapter Eleven regulations and transfer substantial amounts of various tokens from Alameda to Layer Zero's control. Also this week, a court filing covered by the block disclosed FTX's substantial marketing and sponsorship payments to notable figures and organizations, including none other than NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neill, Major League Baseball Hall of Famer David Ortiz, tennis star Naomi Osaka, and NFL quarterback Trevor Lawrence, among others. As a monumental trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman Fried rapidly approaches his defense submitted a series of probing questions to the US. District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to gauge jurors'opinions on cryptocurrency, their body language and perhaps in a hat tip to Bankman Fried's advocacy for the concept of selecting funding recipients based on data so called effective altruism. Meanwhile, Bankman Fried's defense alleged inaccuracies in the Department of Justice's claims regarding their client's laptop access during his incarceration.
00:02:36.186 - 00:03:46.530, Speaker A: The legal team emphasized that he had poor Internet access connection during the time period he was allowed to use a laptop, hindering his ability to prepare adequately for the trial. This comes amid accusations by the DOJ of witness tampering that have seen Bankman Fried denied bail, with Judge Lewis Kaplan noting that the time pressure the defendant claims is, quote, largely of his own making, end quote. That's a particularly harsh stance since Bankman Freed faces myriad charges, including fraud, with potential imprisonment exceeding 100 years, and is slated to stand trial in less than a month on October 3. As for Bankman Freed, his defense team accused the DOJ of attempting to obstruct a fair trial by seeking to exclude proposed expert witnesses. The US. Securities and Exchange Commission has clamped down on the Stoner Cats NFT project, promoted by notable figures including Mila Kunis and her famous husband, Ashton Kucher. The project, which raised $8 million through the sale of 10,000 NFTs to finance an animated series, has been charged with offering unregistered securities.
00:03:46.530 - 00:04:51.942, Speaker A: Gerber Griwald, the director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, emphasized that the economic reality of an offering, not its label, determines its classification as a security. Orchestrated by Stoner Cats Two LLC, the project utilized a potent marketing strategy highlighting the creator's Hollywood credentials and potential high resale values. It worked, to put it mildly, with the collection selling out in just 35 minutes and accumulating over $20 million in secondary sales. Despite not admitting to any wrongdoing, SC Two has consented to a cease and desist order and agreed to pay a $1 million penalty, according to the SEC statement, which did not name the founders. Furthermore, the company pledged to establish a fund to reimburse impacted investors and to burn all Stonercat NFTs in its possession, according to the statement. Crypto lawyer Mike Selig wrote in a social media post, quote The SEC is looking for PFP offerings as akin to 2017 vintage ICOs. Same marketing mistakes can be deadly.
00:04:51.942 - 00:05:47.178, Speaker A: End quote. This case marks yet another instance of the SEC's stringent oversight of celebrity endorsed crypto ventures, such as the one backed by Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1 million for her role. Still, some are noting the irony that the SEC catches celebrities but misses the big blow ups like FTX. Masari founder and my former boss at CoinDesk, Ryan Selkis, wrote on social media quote, Your tax dollars at work. End quote. Connecticut based Digital Currency Group, otherwise known as DCG, the parent company behind the beleaguered lender Genesis Global has put forth a proposal that could see users of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss's Gemini Earn program reclaiming between 95% and 110% of their assets. Whatever the amount ends up being, this initiative, filed on Wednesday, promises a significant recovery rate.
00:05:47.178 - 00:06:46.282, Speaker A: The recovery strategy, however, hinges on the sale of 30 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, valued at approximately $670,000,000, pledged as collateral by Genesis to Gemini. Gemini previously said it would help make its users whole up to $100 million if they weren't paid out in their entirety. The proposal comes amid a backdrop of legal disputes and regulatory scrutiny, with both Genesis and Gemini facing accusations from the SEC of selling unregistered securities. Despite the ongoing challenges, this proposal pending approval does in fact offer a glimmer of hope to affected investors. In the latest development surrounding the beleaguered Celsius network, former CEO Alex Musinski is embroiled in a series of legal battles following the freezing of his assets, including multiple bank accounts and a home as ordered by the US. Department of justice. Mushinski is now fighting back against a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission.
00:06:46.282 - 00:07:45.806, Speaker A: In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Moshinsky's legal team argued that the FTC has failed to substantiate any violations of laws or rules by him, emphasizing that the commission is not entitled to monetary relief. Interesting to see how that one plays out. This move comes after Maschinsky faced severe charges, including securities fraud and wire fraud, leading to his arrest in July. In related news, Roni Cohen Pavon, Celsius's ex chief revenue officer, pled guilty to several criminal offenses in the US. According to a report from Reuters. This verdict comes after accusations of engaging in fraudulent activities, including market manipulation and securities fraud, primarily concerning the inflation of Celsius crypto token prices. Cohen Pavone, who reportedly profited immensely from his scheme, now faces up to 65 years in jail.
00:07:45.806 - 00:09:31.886, Speaker A: Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange CoinX is believed to have been attacked by North Korean hacker group Lazarus, according to blockchain security researchers Slow Mist and Zack XBT initial estimates suggested losses of around $27 million, with later evaluations increasing the estimate to over $55 million. Strained from the exchange's hot wallets, the Hong Kong based exchange assured users that their assets are secure and promised full compensation for the affected parties. The exchange has temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals to ensure security measures, and it's actively investigating the incident, promising a detailed report soon. The controversial Malady NFT collection, simultaneously known for its popular anime picture profiles and for its creator resigning after admitting to racist writings, encountered yet another setback this week after co creator Charlote Fang confirmed in May that she pseudonymously wrote racist articles and resigned from her leadership position. She resurfaced on Monday, claiming on social media that an attacker had seized control of social media accounts associated with the project, including Malady Maker and Remillionaire in the social media post. Fang claimed an unnamed developer within the Malady ecosystem had orchestrated a scheme diverting about $1 million in fees from the Ramelia Corporation, the supposedly decentralized autonomous organization, or Dow, behind the Malady Maker project. This exploit primarily impacted the revenue generated from Bonkler, an experimental finance art project initiated in April 2023, according to Fang, who added that, quote, only Ramelia's revenue from Bonkler was compromised, end quote.
00:09:31.886 - 00:10:35.922, Speaker A: She further claimed that the main contract NFTs and Bonkler reserves were still secure, going on to vow to pursue the culprits quote, with the heavy hand of the law. End quote. In a startling error, crypto service provider Paxos has been identified as the entity that mistakenly paid a staggering 19.89 bitcoin, approximately $500,000 in transaction fees to transfer a mere zero eight bitcoin, or about $200. The incident, which occurred on Sunday, set a new record for the highest transaction fee paid in a single bitcoin transaction. A spokesperson from Paxos confirmed the mistake to the block, stating it was due to a bug in a single transfer and sought to assure users that efforts are underway to recover funds from F Two p from F Two pool, the mining pool that processed the transaction. The spokesperson emphasized, quote Paxos clients and end users have not been affected and all customer funds are safe.
00:10:35.922 - 00:11:08.126, Speaker A: End quote however, an F two pool co founder has expressed annoyance and even regret about potentially agreeing to refund the amount, turning the matter over to a social media questionnaire. Results to be determined as of the time of this recording. For those of you looking for a funny way to end your week, the founder of crypto Exchange THODEX was sentenced to over 11,000 years in prison. Not that that's a laughing matter, but take a listen to what standup comedian Ginny Hogan has to say about the.
00:11:08.148 - 00:11:38.970, Speaker B: Matterdex was one of Turkey's largest crypto exchanges until it went offline in 2021 and its CEO, Faruk Fati Ozair, went missing. About a year later, he was arrested in Albania, meaning that Andrew Tate is no longer Albania's most recent celebrity stowaway. Truly, though, Albania feels like the wet version of Burning Man. After that, Ozair was extradited to Turkey, where just this week, he was sentenced to 11,000 years in prison. 11,000 is enormous. That's like the number of women SBF has slept with times 11,000. He also faces a fine of $5 million.
00:11:38.970 - 00:12:08.818, Speaker B: So I guess once he gets out of prison in 11,000 years, he's going to have to get a job. Before this, Ozair was already in jail for failure to submit his tax documents. I had no idea you could go to jail for that. In America, that just means you have to serve as an elected official. Two siblings have also been sentenced to jail, which I think is very good. This way, his parents can never be like, ugh, why can't you be good like your older sister? In America, we also dole out tough punishments for our crypto fraudsters. SPF has been charged with a similarly tough sentence no access to almond butter.
