00:00:02.650 - 00:00:25.458, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, welcome back to the Chopping Block. Every four weeks, the four of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next up there's Robert, crypto connoisseur and captain of Compound. Third, we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand pooba at Gauntlet. And finally, myself, I'm haseeb head hype man at Dragonfly Lie.
00:00:25.458 - 00:00:46.170, Speaker A: All four of us are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice. So, Robert, we were just commenting how incredibly young you look with your beard shaven off. I got the feeling that Bitcoin is back at $20. With how young you look, how does it feel to be unburdened by the beard?
00:00:47.070 - 00:00:56.560, Speaker B: I shaved clean for the first time in two years. I think it's going to be the catalyst to bring us out of this temporary bear market. So time will tell. But ask me in, like, three weeks if it worked.
00:00:57.250 - 00:01:00.400, Speaker A: Is this part of, like, being a new father? You're trying to reinvent yourself?
00:01:00.850 - 00:01:11.330, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. You got to start from a clean foundation. So reboot start eating a little bit healthier this week, too, so maybe you'll have a younger fitter. Me?
00:01:11.480 - 00:01:13.380, Speaker C: Baby only sees baby face.
00:01:16.310 - 00:01:24.450, Speaker D: It looks like you're about to intern at Compound, showing up. It's your first day. I just really love decentralized money markets.
00:01:24.610 - 00:01:28.250, Speaker B: Yeah, me too. I can't wait to see if they exist.
00:01:28.750 - 00:01:35.020, Speaker A: Wow. Is anything weird in the new diet? Anything particularly crypto relevant? Is it like meat only?
00:01:35.550 - 00:01:37.130, Speaker C: No seed oils?
00:01:37.470 - 00:01:42.810, Speaker B: No seed oils. Nothing that comes wrapped in plastic, nothing processed.
00:01:43.390 - 00:01:47.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like since COVID my diet has gotten a lot worse than what it used to be. Pre COVID.
00:01:47.914 - 00:01:50.350, Speaker B: Yeah, mine too. I gained, like, 30 pounds.
00:01:50.930 - 00:02:17.558, Speaker A: Yeah, I got to work on that. Okay, well, we've got an interesting piece of news this week. Our namesake, Laura Shin. So, first of all, we're all here to congratulate Laura Shin, because one, she just released her book, The Cryptopians. It just came out this morning, actually. It was just announced that my place, which I'm not at right now, just received the pre order book. It just arrived this morning, but I don't actually have it with me, otherwise I'd be flashing it on screen.
00:02:17.558 - 00:02:52.654, Speaker A: But in the book, it was announced that there was a huge reveal, and the reveal is that we now actually know. According to Laurishan, allegedly, we know who was the infamous Dow hacker. Okay, so I think at this point, given how many people have entered crypto in the last couple years, I'm going to guess that for a lot of folks, this is ancient history. So we need to crack open the history book. So the Dow hack was a hack that took place, I think this was 2016. Yes, 2016. So in 2016, one of the very first major projects and ICOs on Ethereum was this thing called the Dow.
00:02:52.654 - 00:04:07.980, Speaker A: And the Dow was basically a decentralized, essentially decentralized venture capital group. And the Dow was at one point it held something like 5% of all the Ether in existence. It was a huge project on Ethereum back when Ethereum didn't have a whole lot else going on and it got hacked. And as a result of trying to ameliorate the side effects of this hack, which would have had the Dow hacker controlling a huge amount of the Ether in existence, ethereum very famously pulled the switch to hard fork into two versions of Ethereum. One which today is called Ethereum Classic, which is a sort of parallel universe in which the hacker got away with it and owns all the Ether that he stole. And then the current version of Ethereum, which we know today, is just Ethereum, which is actually a sort of forked and rewritten version of Ethereum that made a temporary exception in the otherwise automatic rules of the blockchain that this hack got undone and the contract got fixed in such a way that it is no longer hacked. So for a long time it was unknown who this hacker was and we just discovered that it is a let me see it's a 36 year old Austrian programmer who is the co founder of Ten X, which is some weird ICO project that I don't know very much about.
00:04:07.980 - 00:04:13.934, Speaker A: Do any of you guys know anything about this person or know anything about Ten X or have any connections to this story?
00:04:14.132 - 00:04:49.002, Speaker B: So my only connection to this story is that the Dow hack is actually what got me excited about Ethereum and actually got me to notice that Ethereum existed and was working. So the Dow hack is actually what brought me into the ecosystem. Originally I was not like an ICO participant. I didn't think it would work, to be honest. But the Dow hack was like the moment in time that got me paying extreme attention and made me want to build things in the space. I did at some point invest like $12 in the Ten X ICO. So I do know the project that way.
00:04:49.002 - 00:05:41.126, Speaker B: But I will caveat and say that anything is allegedly we actually don't have any conclusive evidence that this person is the Dow hacker. There's always the 1% chance that he's not. So we don't want to have this person skinned alive. But aside from that, I have never heard of this person. And if he is, it's almost something to be proud of at this point, years out, because it's one of the most monumental events in the history of both crypto and blockchains and Ethereum, period, full stop. It's one of the most controversial things to ever occur. Huge amount of people think it was ethical and deserved and positive and it started to prove out most of the really important questions about is code is law or is code not law? Led to the fork of Ethereum into Ethereum classic and Ethereum.
00:05:41.126 - 00:05:53.966, Speaker B: And I kind of think it's something to be proud of, to be at that cataclysmic event. But we'll see if at some point it's proven that he's actually the one who did it or if he admits to it.
00:05:54.148 - 00:06:56.542, Speaker D: Speaking of proof and speaking of allegations, I actually found the details of this article to be super interesting. Basically, once the ETH was stolen, it was swapped via Shapeshift, which is basically a ring exchange for doing cross chain swaps and basically swapped into Bitcoin. And then it was dormant for a while and then a later date they swapped it into Grin or sorry, then they mixed it and then they swapped it into Grin, which is another privacy coin. And basically along this path it was revealed that Chainalysis, which is a blockchain analysis group, was able to unmix the transaction from Wasabi wallet, which is how he tried to gain some privacy for these bitcoins, which normally would have otherwise been very obvious who the holder was. And so there's an unknown capability that Chainalysis has, I presume. It was pretty somewhat easier this time because the transaction was so large in size, so it was a very small anonymity set. You just can't really hide such a large Bitcoin transaction.
00:06:56.542 - 00:07:22.780, Speaker D: And then basically this swap from Bitcoin to Grin was sent to this person's, Grin Node, which was his name, IO. So not very stealthy there, but pretty interesting details. I also remember using Shapeshift in the very early days when you couldn't do other types of swaps. And just the fact that chain analysis can also unmix Bitcoin in certain scenarios is also pretty interesting.
00:07:23.870 - 00:08:24.126, Speaker A: So I was slightly skeptical of the story of that. It's as simple as chain analysis has some magic way to unmix Wasabi transactions. Like, maybe it's true, but it seems more plausible that they just had not that big of an anonymity set and they just kind of chased down all the things in the anonymity set and they're like, oh, this one is connected to this guy who also has these other things. Or they're basically able to plausibly rule out some of the other outputs and as such they're going to go and say like, oh, we were able to figure out that it's exactly this one. I don't know if that's true, but that's my gut feeling here, is that this is not like a large scale because this is the first time we've heard about this, right? And this is not a live attack. This is something that's like purely intellectual curiosity. Who hacked the Dow at this point, given that obviously they didn't get any Ether, they have ETH Classic and who's going to cash out the ETH Classic that the Dow hacker stole? So it does seem like I don't know Tarun, if you have a perspective here, but I feel like this may be overrepresented what Chainalysis did here.
00:08:24.148 - 00:09:39.154, Speaker C: I will say one thing that I remember was that if you were in Ethereum at that time, there's this very early testnet that 90% I'm sure of people have not heard of called the Morden testnet, doesn't really exist anymore. And if you were paying attention on Twitter in maybe like five or six months ago, laura and a few other people were like, hey, does anyone have an archived copy of the Morden testnet? And nothing rang a alarm bell in my head more that someone is trying to do some type of deep analysis because the people who are actually asking for the copy were like Hudson from the EF, or at that time, I guess he just left him on flashbacks. Like Laura, one of the two Alexes who worked at the EF, I forget which one it was either the one who went to Balancer and DNS or the other one, Vandesand or the other. It was like very particular people, very close to Ethereum Foundation, plus Laura. And that clustering was very OD to me. And so it did actually seem like there was some much more weird digging going on. The Morden Testnet thing was like the big thing.
00:09:39.154 - 00:10:26.066, Speaker C: So I think I suspect that so the Morden Testament was like one of the modern ETH testaments, but it was deprecated in the hard fork. It was kind of basically killed by the Dow hack. So I suspect there might be some truth to this because it was really hard to find anyone who had that testnet archived. And the fact they were able to go back to that and they asked on Twitter, that part I guess wasn't said in the article, but you can go find the tweets if you search Morden testnet, I don't think they're deleted. So I'm a little more hope in that regards. With regards to the Grin thing, I'm a little less I'm sort of in your boat that maybe there's something else going on. The volume didn't make sense.
00:10:26.066 - 00:11:24.006, Speaker C: Although one hilarious thing to think about is that ETH Classic has had so many hard forks, soft forks and itself. Forget about hard forks, I mean like actual just forks from miners not mining it and big trades getting front run, that it does make you wonder if it is really this person, whether they were making large transactions. And some of the exchange software that we saw in Etc. I don't know if you guys remember like Etc basically got 51% attacked it at one point, right? I was wondering if some of those are actually related to this person trying to do this Grin thing. Because the timing was around the time Grin was sort of coming online. So there's a couple of things to corroborate these other aspects that I don't think were mentioned. But the Morden testnet plus this sort of like Etc forking being around weird transactions, there's something there I would say perhaps there's more to it.
00:11:24.006 - 00:11:27.240, Speaker C: But yeah, there's a lot in the story that does check out.
00:11:28.730 - 00:11:51.920, Speaker A: It feels like behaviorally, the story of, okay, we found all this evidence that it's you. We present you with all the evidence, you're like, no, it's not me, and then you delete all your social media records and kind of run away to me. I'm like, okay, that's kind of all the proof that I would need to know that this person is probably the hacker, because at a certain point we're protesting a little bit too much and then running away a little too fast.
00:11:52.610 - 00:12:01.714, Speaker B: I give it 99%. They could be scapegoated. There's a lot of different factors which make it not definitive in my mind. Just because you delete your social media.
00:12:01.832 - 00:12:05.902, Speaker A: Presence doesn't mean robert, how big are your ten X bags that you're talking?
00:12:06.056 - 00:12:07.800, Speaker B: I own the whole project now.
00:12:09.770 - 00:12:14.758, Speaker A: Clearly your ten X is now one X, Robert, I'm sorry to tell you.
00:12:14.844 - 00:12:17.702, Speaker B: Zero X. I don't think he was.
00:12:17.756 - 00:12:26.038, Speaker D: Actually able to cash out that much, though, which is the funny part. Like, most of it is still sitting there in e classic. So I think it was only like a few mil or something like that from the article.
00:12:26.214 - 00:13:14.266, Speaker C: So maybe this gets to a slightly related but kind of crazier thing to think about. It's been raining cats and dogs of attackers being found in less short period of time. And it kind of feels like a lot of the reason that this has happened is like, whoever did the attack, whether it was this person directly or this person was just an accessory, they were unable to get out of more than a certain percentage. So, like, the BitConnect hacker, the actual hacker, as far as we know, could only get out of $900 million out of that like four, 4.5 billion. Well, that's what's missing in the best case scenario, the person who isn't caught got away with that. That's a pretty low take rate given how much they were able to get out of.
00:13:14.288 - 00:13:14.714, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:14.832 - 00:13:34.560, Speaker C: So I think the moral of the story is eventually whoever actually does this stuff realizes it's actually really hard to get out in serious size, and then they start trying to get accomplices and the accomplices get caught. That's my sort of rough theory as to how we kind of have some of the bumbling mistakes we've seen.
00:13:34.930 - 00:13:50.440, Speaker D: Is this even illegal, though? Was this even a hack? Basically, he stole the money and then they just changed it so that the money was not stolen. So it's not like a normal DeFi hack where the money is actually permanently gone. In this scenario, everything was kind of reverted. So really, who lost here?
00:13:51.450 - 00:13:53.654, Speaker A: Well, it's reverted on one chain, right?
00:13:53.772 - 00:14:03.478, Speaker B: Every ether holder, right? Every ether holder lost the blockchain fractured into two. Every user, every developer lost in some way.
00:14:03.564 - 00:14:04.906, Speaker D: I think that's kind of a stretch, though.
00:14:04.928 - 00:14:07.322, Speaker C: Like ETH classic is know.
00:14:07.376 - 00:14:14.774, Speaker D: It's not like, oh, I'm missing out on some huge chunk of value. ETH classic is basically worthless. So it's like in know, you don't actually lose out.
00:14:14.832 - 00:14:18.960, Speaker C: Tom, I'm excited for your twitter DMs shortly after.
00:14:19.890 - 00:14:29.986, Speaker B: Yeah. Who lost? I mean, this is also like the number one event that Bitcoin Maxis point to in terms of the flexibility of Ethereum monetary policy.
00:14:30.088 - 00:14:30.402, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:30.456 - 00:14:31.886, Speaker D: For sure it was a narrative loss.
00:14:31.918 - 00:14:35.022, Speaker A: For sure. I mean, it's a big loss of credibility.
00:14:35.086 - 00:14:59.802, Speaker B: I feel like the community decided that the hack was so bad that they made a new version of the blockchain without the hack. Right. And that was an unbelievably contentious decision at the time and probably still is. Right. So who lost in some way, it's Ethereum in general lost and all of the users and developers. Now it's years later. You could say that maybe it made everyone a lot stronger, and I think in other ways it did.
00:14:59.802 - 00:15:02.986, Speaker B: But everybody lost. Right, sure.
00:15:03.168 - 00:15:19.220, Speaker D: The point is there's like a group of depositors that is short tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars. It's sort of more of a I agree, a branding and sort of narrative loss more than anything else. But has it been repeated? Right. People want to do this with the Parity multisig as well, and it didn't happen.
00:15:21.670 - 00:15:40.854, Speaker C: We don't know that people wanted to do it in large mass. I would say that Parity was much more contentious than the Dow in the sense that Parity was like, we're going to exit Ethereum. And then they did. Right. And Rug pulled the client. It was a very different it was even more crazy that they it's also.
00:15:40.892 - 00:15:50.554, Speaker A: Possible Ethereum would be worth more today if the Dow hack had never happened. So we can't measure the counterfactual loss of value. Right. It could have been that it would have taken much longer for Robert, maybe.
00:15:50.592 - 00:15:54.122, Speaker C: Never have made compound if the Dow hack didn't happen. That's what we learned on this episode.
00:15:54.186 - 00:15:54.814, Speaker A: That's true.
00:15:54.932 - 00:15:59.886, Speaker B: Probably. I never would have looked at smart contracts if it hadn't happened.
00:16:00.068 - 00:16:00.654, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:16:00.692 - 00:16:04.494, Speaker A: You would have just gotten rich off Ten X, never had to build anything.
00:16:04.692 - 00:16:22.230, Speaker B: No, I wouldn't have, because I wouldn't have gone to the Ethereum ecosystem at all. Yeah, I hated crypto before that. I, way long ago dabbled in bitcoin and was like, bitcoin, whatever, it's not going to take over the world. And then the Dow hack is what got me excited about crypto.
00:16:22.570 - 00:16:26.600, Speaker A: Why did it get you excited about crypto? Why? What was exciting about it?
00:16:27.470 - 00:17:01.890, Speaker B: The fact that you could build using a computer program, you could start to program financial assets on a blockchain. The fact that the Dow was even deployed was such a monumental achievement, I think, for society at large, that the Dow as a smart contract, getting deployed with the ability to gather funds and deploy those funds, it was incredible. It was so inspiring. It made me immediately look at Ethereum as something usable.
00:17:03.670 - 00:17:10.070, Speaker A: It is definitely one of the more Sci-Fi things that I read when I was learning about crypto. I was like, holy shit, that's so cool.
00:17:10.220 - 00:17:38.560, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like the dream of crypto itself. And some people need certain events in the world to get it and have it click. And right now with the truckers in Canada, people are getting why you want censorship resistant money, even though people got that, like, ten years ago, people are learning the lesson. The Dow was like, to someone who's like a builder, it's like you can build extremely complex financial infrastructure on a blockchain. It was like, wow, light bulb moment.
00:17:39.410 - 00:18:06.600, Speaker A: I feel like the other thing about this story is that it's another vindication of this narrative increasingly arising that crypto is actually not good for laundering money. And it's like all these big hacks, they keep getting unwound or they keep getting found or they keep getting frozen, and I think we're just going to keep seeing more of it. So the ammunition on the side of no crypto is actually not great for stealing funds or laundering money. Seems to be getting stronger every time that we uncover one of these.
00:18:07.130 - 00:18:22.746, Speaker C: One thing I just wanted to point out about Ten X, I didn't really know much about them, although clearly there was I mean, just go look at their chart. 100% insider trading on this. And you can just see the volume, like 100 X in the last two and a half weeks.
00:18:22.928 - 00:18:23.820, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:18:24.190 - 00:18:27.022, Speaker C: Yeah. This is a chart of like, hey.
00:18:27.076 - 00:18:29.214, Speaker A: Someone'S going to throw this up on the screen.
00:18:29.332 - 00:18:33.150, Speaker C: Yeah, throw it up on the screen. Just go to the Ten X one month chart.
00:18:33.730 - 00:18:34.800, Speaker B: Up or down?
00:18:35.190 - 00:18:43.358, Speaker C: It goes up and then down, but you can see the downward thing is like this perfectly linear line. It's like, hilarious.
00:18:43.534 - 00:18:49.400, Speaker A: Maybe it's like the bet that the attention is going to go up and then the price is going to go down. People realize that he's a bad guy.
00:18:49.930 - 00:18:53.910, Speaker C: It's a beautiful chart. The one month, the 30 day.
00:18:54.060 - 00:18:55.030, Speaker D: Oh, 30 day.
00:18:55.100 - 00:18:55.862, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:18:55.996 - 00:19:01.530, Speaker C: 30 day is just like, look at this linear thing coming down. And look at the volume. Look at the volume.
00:19:02.590 - 00:19:03.340, Speaker A: Wow.
00:19:04.270 - 00:19:06.390, Speaker C: It hasn't had that volume in forever.
00:19:06.550 - 00:19:26.802, Speaker D: Yeah, true. That was actually the other interesting piece of evidence. I think it's less damning, it's kind of more circumstantial, which is like, I forget the name of the Dow hacker, but he was basically suggesting to people that they should short Ethereum right before he drained the Dow, which is like, I don't know why you would do that. It seems pretty leaky, but programmers are.
00:19:26.856 - 00:20:01.934, Speaker C: Very rarely good traders. A lesson I learned firsthand in trading. One other thing is the Ten X co founder guy definitely started scammy. Yeah, he started a ton of scammy, like D Five Forks in the last year and a half. So I don't know what you want to make of that, but he was tweeting today. And then I looked at what he made and I was like, wow, okay. You made a lot of these pangolin wash trade or sorry, pancake swap wash trading things.
00:20:02.132 - 00:20:04.510, Speaker A: Robert, you've come a long way as an investor.
00:20:05.650 - 00:20:08.640, Speaker B: I still invest in shitcoins like ten X, though.
00:20:10.050 - 00:20:12.426, Speaker A: All right. From humble beginnings to more shit.
00:20:12.458 - 00:20:15.678, Speaker C: No, they're now shit NFTs.
00:20:15.774 - 00:20:23.170, Speaker B: That's true. Yeah. I still get suckered by all the new things and shiny things on the crypto menu.
00:20:23.510 - 00:20:54.758, Speaker A: That's fair. What is crypto for if not losing money to dumb things? Speaking of crypto and dumb things, so I think we should start doing like, a weekly segment on dumb Dows. So there's a new Dow that is trying to buy the Denver Broncos, which is a sports team. It's American football team. Estimated sales price of $4 billion that I guess is going to go on auction and buy. The Bronconcos.com is out there trying to dirt unite.
00:20:54.758 - 00:21:23.240, Speaker A: Let's own the Broncos together. It doesn't look like they even have any place to actually put money, yet they are recruiting people who can maybe help them figure out how to set something up on juicebox, I suppose. I don't know. Like, right now, so far, I think historically, the biggest Dow is the one we talked about last time, assange Dow, which was about 50 million. So this thing is about 1% of what it would need to be in order to buy the Denver Broncos. I don't know. What do you guys think the likelihood that we see bigger and bigger Dows start going after more sensational things like this?
00:21:24.570 - 00:22:02.206, Speaker B: Here's my prediction, and I could be proven completely wrong, and I hope to be proven completely wrong. I think what will happen is, over time, instead of capital being formed to do something cool like this, because they're never going to hit their goal, right. You're going to see more permanent pools of capital available either from Dows or protocols or whatever that are able to respond to these events. So we're already at the point where there's protocols and DAOs with like a billion dollars, right? It sounds crazy, but it's true. They do. They have like, a billion dollars. And yeah, the Denver Broncos are completely out of reach, even for the biggest protocols and the biggest Dows.
00:22:02.206 - 00:22:35.470, Speaker B: But a minor league team is not, right? Or things that don't cost $4 billion that is available. Right. So I don't think we're going to see these quick. Let's fundraise as much money as humanly possible to do this thing. That's a really hard coordination problem. I think what we'll see is Dows and protocol treasuries and these players emerge that have hundreds of millions of dollars available to seize opportunities that eventually like, oh, we should call M A Dow.
00:22:35.890 - 00:22:37.722, Speaker D: You want to do like a SPAC for DAOs?
00:22:37.786 - 00:22:40.730, Speaker A: A dow SPAC. Yeah, exactly. I was going to say like a dao.
00:22:40.810 - 00:22:46.338, Speaker C: So which football player is Chamath? I don't watch football, so I don't know anything.
00:22:46.424 - 00:22:49.410, Speaker A: Which football player? Which football player?
00:22:50.710 - 00:22:52.286, Speaker C: Back promoter. The cheerleader.
00:22:52.318 - 00:22:55.762, Speaker A: The one who's oh, I see, okay. The promoter. Yeah.
00:22:55.816 - 00:23:03.734, Speaker C: Gotta be some celebrity who's going to make the SEC angry. But there's always going to be one, right? At least one, yeah.
00:23:03.772 - 00:23:07.962, Speaker A: I feel like you probably need Daniel SESTA to go in and be the guy who tries to buy the sports team.
00:23:08.016 - 00:23:08.918, Speaker C: Sifu.
00:23:09.094 - 00:23:14.780, Speaker A: Sifu. Or the ten X guy. Apparently he's quite charismatic, I hear.
00:23:15.470 - 00:23:50.502, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm just saying there has to be some cheerleader. Maybe Tom Brady is like the football Dow SPAC driver because he's already done all these crypto. Like, he's just like you know, I just think that will be the catalyst. Although one thing to remember is probably the longest running Dow like structure in the US. That's largely capitalized, is the Green Bay Packers, where people in the town own shares in the team and they get some dividend. They can vote on some things. Right.
00:23:50.502 - 00:24:13.230, Speaker C: They do actually have these kind of cooperative ownership structures in sports. I just tend to think most of the people who want to do it right now are unequipped to actually do any of it. Led in part by the fact that the news articles for this thing tended to quote PhD students who are advising the Dow instead of anyone working on the Dow, which I found hilarious.
00:24:14.930 - 00:24:31.774, Speaker D: Speaking of dumb DAOs, because maybe this shouldn't just be a recurring segment. This is my current favorite Dow or SPAC Dao. This is Fries Dow. They're buying fast food restaurants and that's pretty much it. I feel like generally that the Dow.
00:24:31.822 - 00:24:34.290, Speaker A: Formations that we don't get anything for donating.
00:24:34.790 - 00:24:54.410, Speaker D: Well, you get a token, you get Fries token, and in theory you get some repayment from the cash flow from the fast food restaurant. Normally they're doing something very epic. They're buying a copy of the Constitution. They're donating to Julian assange. They're buying the Denver Broncos. But this is just buying some fast food restaurants. So respect.
00:24:54.410 - 00:24:56.730, Speaker D: Start small, starts practical.
00:24:57.390 - 00:25:08.158, Speaker C: What voting rights does the Token have? Like voting on which chain to be a franchise of? Or what's the token purpose here, other than just like yeah, I think it's.
00:25:08.164 - 00:25:17.540, Speaker D: Just like a governance token. We put a bunch of money in a pot and then we can vote on which or maybe they want to open a franchise. They have a lot of options.
00:25:18.550 - 00:25:23.570, Speaker A: This isn't even a spec. This is just private equity. I feel like crypto is just getting more mundane.
00:25:24.150 - 00:25:33.160, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's private equity, except people are trading like, the mezzanine tranche of the fund or something. Right?
00:25:33.610 - 00:25:35.350, Speaker B: Yeah, that one's going to end badly.
00:25:36.250 - 00:25:43.570, Speaker C: Well, clearly the franchises are going to lock them out at some point, right, and just be like, fuck you. It just seems like unlikely that won't happen.
00:25:43.660 - 00:25:53.614, Speaker B: I think that one's going to have a principal agent problem. And the people organizing the Dow are going to figure out a way to get all the money, and the people who are investing in the Frys are not going to get any money.
00:25:53.812 - 00:25:59.006, Speaker C: Imagine if your dividends were paid in Fry NFTs, though, then you've given all.
00:25:59.028 - 00:26:05.470, Speaker B: Your money to people who go out and buy real world businesses, make the real world money, and you get JPEGs.
00:26:06.310 - 00:26:22.806, Speaker C: I think a lot of NFT projects aren't so different, especially these ones that are funding movies that haven't been made. It's not so different. There will be some weird thing that goes on. The difference is the franchises, I think, or franchisers will know. Put a foot down on this.
00:26:22.988 - 00:26:44.830, Speaker B: Here's a chopping block experiment. We should profile a bunch of bad Dows and then the audience should tell us which of these bad Dows, the four of us should take our real money and put into one of these bad Dowels. So a year later we can come back and be like, oh man, we lost all of our money in Friesdao. But let me tell you about the experience along the way in a way that would make us really credible.
00:26:45.410 - 00:26:56.082, Speaker C: We could do a dating game for Dows where we bring three bad Dows and then one person who's like, I want to join a Dow and we ask questions on their behalf and then they have to pick and then we.
00:26:56.136 - 00:26:58.900, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds like an amazing game show. Actually.
00:27:01.510 - 00:27:03.010, Speaker C: Would be kind of funny.
00:27:03.670 - 00:27:30.540, Speaker A: I'm imagining now Dow dating and I feel like we've talked some about protocol M A. It'd be interesting to see if we end up doing Dow M A. And so one of these kind of failed takeover bid dows is kind of like, okay, well, we didn't buy the Blockbuster or, you know, like the NFL Dow or the Broncos Dow, like, rolls up a bunch of the smaller ones, like buys up Fries Dow. It's like, look, you guys don't need fries. Let's just go buy the Broncos together.
00:27:30.910 - 00:27:35.706, Speaker C: All I will say is, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about how you would do an M A protocol.
00:27:35.898 - 00:27:40.190, Speaker A: I've noticed that. I've noticed that tarun give us the rundown of M A protocols.
00:27:40.690 - 00:28:21.962, Speaker C: The TLDR is like, if you were watching the Fay Rari merger and disclosure, Robert and I are Faye investors. The Fay Rari merger was a very contentious thing. And most of the contention was price discovery where, like, someone said a price, someone said, I want one 10th the price. And then people were like, okay, we're going to pull all of the conversation offline and come up with the price and come back. So it was like a contentious thing. I think if you can make a protocol that separates price discovery for two Dows in such a way that each Dow votes on putting a portion of their treasury. To sort of be the backstop price.
00:28:21.962 - 00:29:02.250, Speaker C: And then you have this kind of like continuous auction where people who own both sides of token can basically lock their tokens and then at some point in the future, decided by governance, basically the trade gets executed at the final price. Now you have to make this like, resistant to whales. You have to have some rage quit things. Some of the Faye argument was that there wasn't good enough rage quit. So there's a lot of details to make it work as a protocol. But if you can make the price discovery some type of thing that you see where people can basically vote on the final price or stake for the final price, I think you can alleviate some of these problems and make it relatively generic for certain types of governance contracts.
00:29:03.470 - 00:29:07.558, Speaker B: And eventually Denver Broncodao will use this to acquire Fridao.
00:29:07.734 - 00:29:11.130, Speaker C: And we will have called it here. You will have called it here first. Robert?
00:29:11.790 - 00:29:12.540, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:13.150 - 00:29:43.670, Speaker D: Your point around price discovery, I think is well received, but it's made me think why people who are not auctioning things or selling things that might be interesting. Dow targets have not tried to solicit Dows actively. This is a pool of capital that is not super price discerning and is actually actively looking to deploy. You would think actually trying to get these people to bid on your thing is probably a good use of time and money versus just leaving it to the sort of standard high net worth or PE farms or whatever.
00:29:43.820 - 00:30:06.350, Speaker C: I mean, the whales still will have more power in this thing. But I think at the end of the day, you want to incentivize the whales to just show their cards before the thing happens. And somehow that's more how you want to design this, because right now you have this weird thing where some of the whales want to just only discuss things off chain and then the price discovery is extremely slow.
00:30:07.650 - 00:31:15.474, Speaker A: Well, this is kind of a more general topic, I feel like. I mean, you saw the same thing with Sushi when there's this interplay between the deal making that tends to happen in the context of a Dow, oftentimes there's deal making that needs to happen behind closed doors for people to feel like the negotiation can kind of happen in a way that is suitable to both parties. But the nature of a Dow culturally kind of demands that all the negotiating happen out in the open. Right? And it kind of reminds me a little bit of democratic countries that kind of feel like, look, we should be beholden to our electors in the way that we make decisions diplomatically. But it's also necessary for diplomats or legislators to be able to go behind closed doors and kind of hash it out and then come out with a proposal that they present to the broader constituents. How do you guys think about this dynamic in the world of Dows because it feels like this keeps happening. You have this feeling that look, the founder or a group of people who are kind of responsible for BD at the protocol level, they want to have the flexibility to be able to go behind closed doors and negotiate bespoke deals and maybe present them to the Dow and communities by and large really resent this.
00:31:15.474 - 00:31:19.270, Speaker A: They don't like this phenomenon but it seems pretty universal.
00:31:19.930 - 00:32:05.670, Speaker C: I think it's effectively always going to happen. There's no doubt that that's just the nature. Until we actually have private smart contracts that actually work and can do a lot of facilitate a lot of discovery without publicly showing your imagine. You could sign a commit reveal to a blockchain that only like some subset of parties you want to see can reveal, and then you can reveal your bid, and then people coordinate that until we are at that point, which we're not from a program we can do that not from a technical standpoint, but from a programmatic standpoint. It's just like the programming that right now in the ass, no one's going to do it. It's just really not at stage that's ready to do it's. Obviously theoretically and proof of concept practically possible.
00:32:05.670 - 00:32:44.314, Speaker C: It's just not in like hey, you're going to put this in rainbow wallet possible. And obviously that's five years more of engineering that might be not be true, but right now that's still going to happen. I think that's why you want something where it's like people vote on this auction, then they get a certain amount of time and then they have to reveal their preferences. Right now the problem is the preferences revelation process is extremely asymmetric and one side will reveal one thing in a way that forces the other side to take longer to reveal instead of shorten how fast they reply.
00:32:44.362 - 00:32:44.526, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:44.548 - 00:32:53.970, Speaker C: And if you can make it something where they have to kind of have a back and forth that will actually, at least in a lot of cases I think reduce the complexity of these deals.
00:32:54.470 - 00:33:40.718, Speaker A: Well, one interesting case of Dow governance, quote unquote coming into play was in the last week we saw a huge drama play out in Terra. So Terra for those who are not familiar, it's a layer one blockchain. It's been around for a few years now. It used to be a stablecoin, it still issues a stablecoin called UST and it's a little bit complex to explain all the moving parts. But basically one of the most popular protocols on Terra is a protocol called Anchor. Anchor, a DeFi protocol in which we are actually dragonfly is an investor and Anchor, essentially what they do is they offer very high yields to people who stake some of their assets, including stablecoins into anchor and anchor because it offers very high yields. So on the order of about 20% yields, those yields in this environment are not really sustainable.
00:33:40.718 - 00:35:05.440, Speaker A: It's very difficult to get 20% yield doing anything right now, given the way that yields have come down in DFI. So Anchor's reserves were draining over time and if Anchor were to lose a lot of the supply that were locked in Anchor, it would have very negative effects for the overall Terra ecosystem as well as for Anchor itself. And so there was a proposal in Anchor governance and interrognance broadly to inject a bunch of capital to backstop and kind of help strengthen the reserve to allow Anchor to be able to continue offering these high yields for a longer period of time. And so apparently what happened was LFG, which I think is the something guard, they injected 450,000,000 into Anchor in order to protect the reserves. And we also saw very recently announce a $1 billion fundraise to create a billion dollars of BTC that is going to be backstopping the Terra ecosystem further. So a huge amount of capital that is going in to protect the Anchor ecosystem in a way that obviously I was reading through some of the forum comments in the governance forum for Anchor and it was very interesting seeing this phenomenon of a lot of folks who obviously don't directly have access to that capital. It's kind of maybe even slightly unclear where the capital is coming from, but they're just like, yeah, we should shove a bunch of money back into Anchor to keep it all going.
00:35:05.440 - 00:35:11.760, Speaker A: Curious what you guys think of this whole Terra anchor saga and where you believe it might be going.
00:35:12.290 - 00:35:14.366, Speaker C: I mean, Terra is a little bit.
00:35:14.388 - 00:35:53.226, Speaker D: Between a rock and a hard place. Clearly there is a large percentage of the UST in Anchor that is exclusively there to get this yield. And if that yield goes down or disappears, that kind of unwinds. And obviously that greatly impacts the Luna price just by virtue of the fact how Terra is designed. I feel like this is the 450 mil seems like maybe a stop gap, right? Like you kind of need that money to maybe make sure that this thing doesn't bleed out immediately. But it feels like maybe the rest of the money could have been better spent designing new sources of demand for UST, which was I think part of thesis of some of the products they've been developing so far. And this doesn't feel super sustainable to me.
00:35:53.226 - 00:36:04.238, Speaker D: I feel like a billion dollars could go a long way towards developing new DApps or partnerships or use cases that are going to generate new organic sources of demand for UST so they don't have to know sort of burning the cash, so to speak.
00:36:04.324 - 00:36:05.700, Speaker A: That's an interesting point.
00:36:06.310 - 00:36:49.294, Speaker B: I agree, Tom. I mean, if you squint it's like an extremely simple ecosystem, which is luna makes UST and the demand, pretty much all of the demand for UST comes from you can earn 20% on it. There's a little bit of demand outside of that, right? But you can earn 20% on it. And that 20% comes from Luna. And this works eventually it gets so big that there's sustainability issues. If it works forever and it's small, it's a perpetual motion machine and everyone high fives. I think long term, something has to change fundamentally in the economics of the system.
00:36:49.294 - 00:37:25.980, Speaker B: This can keep working for a while, right? Like, just put this in a spreadsheet. If you're paying people 20%, let's say, on their UST, which you created from Luna anyway, this keeps working for a while, but eventually it becomes unsustainable. And I think one of the primary foundational pieces of the economics of the ecosystem will change. It's going to have to. It might be the yields go down. It might be you meant UST, not with Luna. Maybe it's something totally left field, who knows? But I expect something's going to have to give.
00:37:26.990 - 00:38:20.266, Speaker A: Tom, you raised this point of like, look, you could take that billion dollars and do a lot more things with it. You could build more use cases, build more partnerships. And to a certain extent, I kind of disagree in the sense that we have run out of ways to use money to buy adoption. We're like so far down the utilization curve of money that just think of all the captive capital right now in Crypto, especially among the layer ones. We're just thinking about the current generation of all the folks like Polygon and Avalanche and Terra and Nier Protocol, and all of them have raised craploads of money, and it's very unclear how they can use it to do anything. And that's ignoring even the previous generation, right? Like, think of how much money Filecoin has, how much money Tezos Foundation has, how much these EOS for that matter, has, or Tron has. All of these folks have huge balance sheets and they have absolutely nothing to spend it on.
00:38:20.266 - 00:38:57.718, Speaker A: And so I think we're in the situation now where the uses for capital to produce adoption or produce partnerships even, has incredibly, has become incredibly inefficient. And what you see now mostly is that there are tons of biding wars between all these protocols and their balance sheets for partnerships. If you're Tom Brady or you're Melania Trump and you want to launch an NFT project, you just go to all these foundations, you say, hey, I'm going to launch an Ft project. Give me your best price. And it's like, okay, 5 million, 10 million, 15 million to launch a project on top of them. That's where these treasuries are mostly going. So I don't know that Terra had a lot of other ways.
00:38:57.804 - 00:39:12.406, Speaker C: Melania clearly didn't talk to the Salana Foundation based on all of the logistical fuck ups, and also then all of everyone working like Anatoly and Fauna, twitter being like, we are not associated with this whatsoever.
00:39:12.518 - 00:39:17.966, Speaker A: That's true. I bring it up in Jess, but most projects do look like that.
00:39:18.148 - 00:39:45.702, Speaker D: I don't know, I think some of those products are just like fundamentally crap or unneeded. And so it's like, yeah, $4 billion is not going to save EOS. It's just impossible. But I just feel like stablecoins are like the killer app of crypto. I mean, there's like, what, 13 billion, and Tether is sitting on Tron. What is that doing? Is he being used for gambling? You being used for payments? Stablecoins are fundamentally like the killer app of crypto so far. And so I'm not super convinced that they've tapped out, but point well taken.
00:39:45.702 - 00:40:01.120, Speaker D: This is why I think the 450 makes sense, because it takes a while to sort of build these things out and deploy. You can't just put this money to work overnight and expect dividends in the form of new applications, but it's like you need to do something. You can't just sort of keep holding on and hope that people are going to stick around.
00:40:01.490 - 00:40:54.846, Speaker C: I mean, one thing I would add is that unlike some of the other stablecoins that are sort of similar in structure, like Celo, the Terra design never had an explicit reserve. And this is basically bolting on what you've seen in some of the other stablecoins of like a basket of other crypto assets as a reserve. So it's not like it's unheard. And the size of given how large Luna is relative to Zello, I think actually they're still under capitalized on a dollar per dollar redemption basis, like if we compare it to other sort of undercover. So it's not so crazy size wise. I do agree that it's kind of like hard to buy. Customer acquisition cost in crypto feels like 00:10 or infinity, right? There's no in between.
00:40:54.846 - 00:41:46.830, Speaker C: CAC it's either nothing, people are using it for free because they're earning fees or something, or it's like a little bit and you can get them, or it's just like you're paying infinite to keep them. So I think it is a little hard because it's not as kind of discreet in a lot of other industries, I guess. Also the Terra ecosystem is a little weird, right? There have been a bunch of new protocols. Like Mars protocol has like a three month UST lockup. For the record, I don't really own any UST or use it. I've used it a few times, but not seriously. And part of the problem I had with it was like the only application you could really if you're not in Korea, with disclaimer in Korea, there's tons of stuff you can do with but like, there wasn't really that much, right? There's like anchor astropod mars.
00:41:46.830 - 00:42:16.934, Speaker C: And I do feel like until they have more protocols that are just like the base core blocks, it's really hard to just pay for new users for polygon or avalanche. Everyone just redeployed unisoft compound Aave, right? And that was enough to but like, Terra doesn't quite have that the only thing that's there is anchor right? So I don't think they could spend their way out of this in any scenario unless they make the backstop, make people have confidence in it.
00:42:17.052 - 00:42:31.500, Speaker D: Well, if Doe is listening in the interest of replicating the successful DeFi protocols from Amber third chain, I might suggest he make a ribbon clone, which seems to be the thing that is missing from the Terra ecosystem so far. So you got to have every Lego piece together.
00:42:32.190 - 00:42:49.860, Speaker C: And don't get me wrong, Doe is also an incredible hustler and finding random teams, building all this stuff. So I just think it's like there's a cart before the horse thing and to haseeb's point, I don't think throwing money at the horses is going to work. You might as well load up, get as many carts as possible.
00:42:50.470 - 00:43:29.054, Speaker A: I mean, ultimately it's buying them time and it's a real question of whether Terra can use that time profitably to change the calculus. Because what may end up happening is that six, eight, nine months later down the road, we're in the exact same spot and it's time for another billion dollars of backstop. So hopefully that doesn't happen. Obviously at Dragonfly we're long anchor, so we hope that things work out. But it's clearly not in a very promising position right now given the state of the yield situation. But speaking of yields, one of the big piece of news this week was BlockFi. So BlockFi entered into a settlement with the SEC.
00:43:29.054 - 00:44:13.874, Speaker A: It agreed to pay $100 million in penalties and to pursue registration of its crypto lending products. So for those who are not following the saga, BlockFi, it allows you to get yield on your crypto. It's a kind of centralized company that has become increasingly popular in the last few years. And the SEC, well, actually many different state regulators, state securities regulators started going after BlockFi in their states, basically saying that BlockFi was offering securities, unregistered securities. And that's not cool. And so this culminated in the SEC finally extracting a massive penalty, or relatively massive penalty from BlockFi 100 million. And BlockFi agreed to stop offering their yield products to any of their customers until they register.
00:44:13.874 - 00:45:04.800, Speaker A: So this is interesting on a few dimensions. I mean, one is that, okay, 100 million is a big penalty, but it's also not a big penalty relative to the market cap of BlockFi, which is they sort of built a business by doing this and then were able to get really huge and then essentially take, I don't know, like a few percent tax on their business to go and fix it after the fact. But of course it also reverberates across the industry in that one. It creates a path for other regulated institutions to start offering the same thing in terms of crypto lending products. And it ultimately maybe produces even a little bit of a moat for BlockFi given that they are going to be the first to be registered, presumably with the SEC for the offering of this crypto lending product. So curious. Robert, in particular, I'm wondering what your reaction was to this news.
00:45:05.250 - 00:46:07.058, Speaker B: Well, I think in some ways it's good because if you're a business that accepts money from retail customers and does whatever you want with that money to generate a return and then passes that return to customers, that's clearly a security. Right? And I think that's been relatively obviously a security or a securities related business for a really long time. They weren't just gone after for offering security, but also being an investment company as well as fraud. It should be clear that if you are a very traditional organization that is doing that, you will have to comply. It doesn't matter that it's a new digital asset, doesn't matter that it's a new type of asset. If you're in the business of taking money using your discretion and skill and excellent prowess to make a return and handing it to customers, that's old school Wall Street, right? And so I see this as no surprise. I imagine that there's a lot of folks in the regulatory space that are not surprised by this outcome either.
00:46:07.058 - 00:47:08.466, Speaker B: At Compound Labs we offer a product called Compound Treasury, which operates on the assumption that giving money to a business to generate an interest rate for you is a security. And so it's only offered to accredited investors as an exemption from registration. But knowing that businesses will be able to just register this with the SEC is extremely positive, I think. Not just for businesses that look like BlockFi, but for other types of businesses that don't look like BlockFi. I assume next up are securities exchanges that are trading crypto. Right? And eventually you'll see all of these businesses and things like them, not just lenders, but trading platforms, brokers, all of these types of entities being registered businesses. Yeah, they're not trading equities or they're not supporting the equities financial markets, but they're doing crypto and the crypto financial markets.
00:47:08.466 - 00:47:25.370, Speaker B: And I think long term it's going to be really positive for the space. In the short term, obviously it's chaotic, but giving them an opportunity to become regulated and registered businesses is extremely positive long term.
00:47:26.190 - 00:47:44.510, Speaker A: Makes sense. Spoken like a true elder statesman of lending. I agree. I think it seems like a good thing for the industry that we finally have some regulatory clarity, even if it only comes through enforcement. Some clarity is better than no clarity, even if it'd be nice to have that clarity ex ante before people end up running afoul of the lines.
00:47:44.930 - 00:48:15.450, Speaker D: I actually really liked Matt Levine's take on this, which was know, normally if you want regulatory clarity, you can hire a bunch of lawyers and spend a lot of time and maybe after several years you finally get approval or yes, no or path forward for whatever the product is you're trying to build. Or you can do what Blockfly did, which is just build it and then take a small haircut after the fact. But having already built a great business, it does seem like in crypto, that is often the best path forward, given that there doesn't really seem to be a lot of responsiveness or quickness to actually get clarity on all the products people are building.
00:48:15.520 - 00:48:20.538, Speaker C: So was EOS the most successful regulatory clarity entity in history based on this?
00:48:20.704 - 00:48:22.300, Speaker D: It's got to be, yeah.
00:48:23.150 - 00:48:41.906, Speaker A: Unfortunately, we didn't really get a lot of clarity from right. Because if you look at the history of the SEC going after Token issuances as like, EOS, slap on the wrist, didn't have to register Kin. Slap on the wrist, didn't have to register telegram. Nope. You can't do telegram. Telegram. Token was like, too security.
00:48:41.906 - 00:48:46.130, Speaker A: Like, you can't do the D Five money market car lending thing.
00:48:46.200 - 00:48:47.890, Speaker B: That was just 100% fraud.
00:48:48.390 - 00:48:49.166, Speaker A: Was that just fraud?
00:48:49.198 - 00:48:52.578, Speaker B: Okay, that one was all fraud. All day, all night. Yeah, it was all fraud.
00:48:52.674 - 00:49:12.620, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Okay, never mind. Never mind on that one then. And then XRP is still up in the air, unclear where XRP is going to land, and of course, ethereum, whatever statute of limitations, I suppose. Dow was a security according to the SEC. So it feels like we've kind of got a big range and there's not a lot of clarity even from what the SEC has gone after.
00:49:13.070 - 00:49:34.210, Speaker C: I mean, I think it's going to get more interesting if the SEC goes after NFT stuff or someone goes start going after NFT stuff. I feel like these things are all things. The blockfly settlement to me, just read like, I read some tweets from lawyers from 2018, and then we zoomed forward and picked a number. It wasn't like people weren't already saying a lot of this stuff.
00:49:34.280 - 00:49:34.514, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:34.552 - 00:49:41.000, Speaker C: It's just that the government decided to pick a random stopping time and a random number and then we got an answer.
00:49:42.010 - 00:50:12.240, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's fair. That's a fair critique. All right, so we're winding down on time, but one thing I want to make sure that we get to is there's been an amazing discovery in the world of DeFi. So we were talking earlier about stablecoins with Terra, and it turns out the renowned stablecoin known as Ohm, otherwise called Olympusdao. It turns out that it was recently discovered by some leading scientists and researchers that Ohm bonds actually serve as a volatility reduction strategy. Tarun, do you want to cover?
00:50:14.610 - 00:50:55.598, Speaker C: You know, I've chilled. Ohm is not being all like, pure ponzi in this show. Many times. My theory for whenever you should try to figure out if a crypto project is just a pure ponzi or whether there's some actual sort of mathematical reason that it should work is if you see it last a really long time and then there's a huge crash and somehow still is not dead. And you see that like, a certain number of times, right? Because, like, something that's like a pure ponzi fake algo stablecoin. You'll see the death spiral really fast, right? We've seen enough of these.
00:50:55.684 - 00:50:56.880, Speaker B: It dies once.
00:50:57.410 - 00:51:02.080, Speaker C: It dies once. ESC maybe had a little like fake second bump, but.
00:51:04.710 - 00:51:07.890, Speaker B: Not the suicide roller coaster. It's like one instant.
00:51:09.830 - 00:52:02.530, Speaker C: And Ohm had this interesting thing where it somehow didn't die, even though theoretically everyone was like, oh, a lot of Algo stablecoins, they're just these kind of overly simplistic controllers. Somehow you can't really get them to work without putting huge backstops. Just to be speaking of, for instance, backstops. The Sello and Terra models effectively end up needing some backstop and you hope your staking coin is a good enough backstop, but eventually you have to diversify and offer kind of different types of yield, different types of duration risk to people on the other side. And so Ohm, I think it certainly fairly has gotten a lot of criticism because they created the greatest meme in crypto of 2021. And there's a lot of stuff that probably was ponzi. Like the Staking mechanism was really not really doing anything for the protocol.
00:52:02.530 - 00:52:42.362, Speaker C: But this bond mechanism that they invented and now is the reason that it became like the third most forked contract on EVM chains. The third most involves a lot of heuristics, like throwing out safe math and throwing out libraries. But whatever assume that third most did with the heuristics I used for this. One of the reasons so stable is that this bond thing actually does work in some way. There's some sort of meaning to why having bonds as a way for a Dow to rebalance its treasury works really well. And people have said this forever. Tom has probably said this since 2020, that Dow should be issuing bonds.
00:52:42.362 - 00:53:11.930, Speaker C: And there was all these versions of it, like uma, options and stuff like that. None of them caught on. But the Ohm bond is this Cohen of truth. And yeah, this paper kind of formalizes that and argues that, look, you can actually lower the volatility of the asset that way by adding more bonds. And as you add more bonds, you can make the Dow's Treasury management strategy stable. So it was more don't I'm not to. I actually met the Ohm folks in Denver.
00:53:11.930 - 00:53:32.010, Speaker C: I don't think they invented this figure with that assumption that this is it was just that they were like fly by the seat of their pants and they kept adding all these features and somehow the Frankenstein worked and under the COVID you're able to be like, okay, there's actually life underneath. It's not just the dead robot.
00:53:32.170 - 00:53:41.086, Speaker A: Well, that's the magic of Darwinian evolution, right? There's no single hand controlling all this. But what rises to the top is the adaptations that lead to survival.
00:53:41.198 - 00:53:50.166, Speaker C: It's just know, think about a year ago from right now. That was like peak Algo stablecoin. That was when Mark Cuban got rugged on Titan. Do you remember that?
00:53:50.268 - 00:53:51.858, Speaker B: That was a year ago that felt.
00:53:51.874 - 00:54:04.570, Speaker C: Like that was like a year ago. Time has lost meaning in this industry. But my point is there were so many things that died and Ohm did not. So there's some Cohen of truth and that was hopefully what we tried to illustrate.
00:54:05.390 - 00:54:26.606, Speaker A: So the last thing is that I think a few of us were in ETH Denver over the weekend, which was absolutely incredible event, huge numbers of people there. I heard that there were 15,000 people at East Denver and from what I heard, the last East Denver, which I think is 2020, there were 1500 people and there were thousands on the waitlist Denver.
00:54:26.638 - 00:54:30.530, Speaker C: I remember you could get a free ticket for it because they had extra capacity.
00:54:31.270 - 00:54:32.494, Speaker D: Yeah, it was pretty nuts.
00:54:32.542 - 00:54:33.442, Speaker A: Totally crazy.
00:54:33.576 - 00:55:02.910, Speaker D: Just like people spilling out under the street and there were like lines like two blocks long to get into the venue. All the hotels are booked out and everything. So it's great to see obviously people excited and great to see a lot of energy around Ethereum and crypto. I will say though, that I was a judge for the hackathon and I feel like the projects were not substantially better or they're not like ten times more projects. So I feel like a lot of people were in town just to party or talk about their project or whatever, but who knows, maybe it's just my bias.
00:55:03.250 - 00:55:10.494, Speaker B: So are you saying that it was the modern equivalent of what bitcoin Miami was but for sounds?
00:55:10.532 - 00:55:11.678, Speaker D: That sounds right to me.
00:55:11.764 - 00:55:14.750, Speaker C: Yeah, except for the weaker form of COVID spreading.
00:55:17.410 - 00:55:19.140, Speaker A: That is true, that is true.
00:55:20.070 - 00:55:26.530, Speaker C: There's some poll I just saw on Twitter that was like, did you get COVID at East Denver? And I think it was like 60%.
00:55:26.600 - 00:55:30.118, Speaker A: Yes, 40% no wait, 60% yes.
00:55:30.204 - 00:55:32.674, Speaker C: Yeah, it had like 150 responses.
00:55:32.802 - 00:56:19.138, Speaker A: Holy crap. Okay, well, the other thing was that so when I was in line at East Denver because you have to take a COVID test to actually get in and clearly it wasn't very effective because obviously there was a lot of COVID spreading there. When I was in line at East Denver, everybody in my group who was in line with me, they had all joined crypto in the last year and none of them were devs. So I think it does vindicate a little bit. This is the kind of bitcoin Miami for Ethereum in that almost everybody there was into NFTs and that was their relationship with Ethereum and what was happening in this community. Which just kind of shows how big the tent has, you know, crypto I don't like more and more I feel like an old man in the space given that I'm like, wait, you guys don't know about DeFi, you guys don't.
00:56:19.154 - 00:56:23.014, Speaker C: Know about look, you're getting old, robert's getting know.
00:56:23.052 - 00:56:26.806, Speaker A: I know we're going opposite ways. We're passing each other in age.
00:56:26.988 - 00:56:31.420, Speaker B: Terrible. In a year, I'm going to ask you to invest in my new. Idea.
00:56:33.310 - 00:56:36.726, Speaker C: Wait, time is a circle. Is that what you're saying? Time is a circle.
00:56:36.838 - 00:56:39.494, Speaker B: Yeah, time's a circle. I'm going to go back to the outset.
00:56:39.622 - 00:56:45.642, Speaker A: Yeah. Robert I'm going to be like, look, he's so young. We have to invest in him. That's going to be their memo.
00:56:45.706 - 00:56:50.990, Speaker B: You know how right now there's high schoolers who are doing DeFi. Eventually there's going to be like, middle schoolers.
00:56:51.890 - 00:56:54.050, Speaker A: There are already middle schoolers buying NFTs man.
00:56:54.120 - 00:57:11.846, Speaker C: That's the thing that's half that conference was kids. Maybe this is a funnier observation. I've never been so many places that checked your ID. It was very clear that they were like the Rari kids were not they weren't even at the bottom of the.
00:57:11.948 - 00:57:12.694, Speaker B: They were too old.
00:57:12.732 - 00:57:16.520, Speaker C: They were too old for kind of the median. They're the median now.
00:57:17.530 - 00:57:27.142, Speaker A: That's nuts. That's nuts. Anyway, all right, guys. Well, this was an interesting couple weeks. Hopefully we'll be back soon with another episode of The Chopping Block.
00:57:27.286 - 00:57:28.794, Speaker C: Can I ask a favor?
00:57:28.992 - 00:57:29.354, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:29.392 - 00:57:36.206, Speaker C: Can we get Laura as our guest next week and like, oh, yeah, let's do the deep dive. We should have a deep dive with.
00:57:36.228 - 00:57:39.466, Speaker A: The I totally agree. Okay, next time, homework assignment.
00:57:39.578 - 00:57:40.766, Speaker B: All of you out there and all.
00:57:40.788 - 00:57:46.586, Speaker A: Of us on the show, we got to read the cryptopians. And then next time we're going to have Laura on for a history lesson.
00:57:46.698 - 00:57:50.478, Speaker B: And pitch us which shitty dow to put our savings into.
00:57:50.564 - 00:57:56.422, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. I think that the shitty dow thing has got to be sticking sticking point.
00:57:56.476 - 00:57:56.790, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:56.860 - 00:57:58.534, Speaker B: We need to do that for real.
00:57:58.572 - 00:58:02.690, Speaker A: We got our marching orders. All right, thanks, everybody. Bye.
