00:00:00.090 - 00:01:11.230, Speaker A: Um, thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. The infrastructure bill will most likely become law on Monday. On November 5, the United States House of Representatives passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains two provisions that could heavily affect cryptocurrency tax reporting. So called crypto brokers must report customer gains via A 1099 and any transactions over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service. To many in the crypto community, including advocacy groups such as Coin Center and the Blockchain association, the bill defines a broker too broadly and could potentially impose reporting requirements on entities such as crypto miners and wallet developers for whom it will be impossible to comply. In addition to the broad definition of broker, the bill includes an amendment to tax code 650, which would require entities to report personal data on trading partners like Social Security numbers for digital asset transactions over $10,000. Coins center described the requirements of the bill as unworkable and possibly unconstitutional.
00:01:11.230 - 00:01:57.358, Speaker A: Even more striking, not reporting such an event would now be deemed a criminal felony, according to Abe Sutherland. In his appearance on Unchained in October, Jake Trevinsky, the newly hired executive vice president and head of policy at the blockchain association, explained that getting the language changed is most likely a lost cause in the short term. Importantly, nothing will happen right away. He said the crypto provisions don't go into effect until 2024. We can try to get them repealed or amended before then. He also noted the 2022 midterm elections could reshape Congress's attitude toward crypto. However, if nothing can be done to amend the legislation by 2024, a redefinition could fall to the Treasury Department.
00:01:57.358 - 00:02:09.506, Speaker A: It's up to the Treasury Department to decide who is subject to the provisions, said Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management to CNBC. Similar to the broker definition, the Treasury.
00:02:09.538 - 00:02:12.994, Speaker B: Department will have to provide guidance twitter.
00:02:13.042 - 00:02:54.530, Speaker A: Embraces Web three via dedicated crypto team Twitter announced a new business unit dedicated solely to crypto. The news was first reported by the Financial Times. Tess renierson, formerly of interchain foundation, will be leading a team named simply twitter crypto. Ranierson said the new unit will be focused on supporting the existing crypto community on Twitter. Twitter truly gets crypto hello Bitcoin, tipping and NFTs, but there's so much more to explore here, she said. She went on to cite DApps and crypto communities as areas the team is looking forward to exploring. Twitter crypto will be working closely with Blue Sky, an offshoot of Twitter looking to build a decentralized social network.
00:02:54.530 - 00:03:25.546, Speaker A: Twitter was far from the only Web two social media giant to dip its toes into the Web three waters. This week at the Salana Breakpoint conference, Reddit CEO Alexis Ohanian announced a 100 million dollar investment into the Salana ecosystem through his Seven Seven Six venture company. Additionally, Discord CEO Jason Citron posted a sneak peek of Discord's future, showing a direct integration with MetaMask into the popular gaming discussion platform. However, after a wave of negative responses.
00:03:25.578 - 00:03:28.446, Speaker B: To his tweet, Citron walked back the.
00:03:28.468 - 00:04:09.894, Speaker A: Hint, saying, thanks for all the perspectives, everyone. We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now, we're focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web Three has lots of good, but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale more soon. A New Home for Binance Chengfeng Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Binance, hopes to secure status as a digital asset service provider in France in 2022. France will be a natural choice for a regional and even perhaps global head office, said Zhao in an interview with Les Echoes. According to a translation from the Bloc, zhao went on to add, we want to be regulated at this stage of our development.
00:04:09.894 - 00:04:40.598, Speaker A: This will allow us to grow faster. 5% of the world's population 400 million people have already adopted crypto. They are pioneers. We now want to convince the remaining 95%. Zhao's words come as finance faces regulatory scrutiny from the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, the United States and other jurisdictions. Q Three was tough for crypto communities, especially Coinbase. Third quarter earnings reports have slowly begun filtering out, and the numbers for crypto companies have not been pretty.
00:04:40.598 - 00:05:25.186, Speaker A: Coinbase, for example, saw a decline in monthly transacting users by 16%, trading volume by 29% and net revenue by 39% between Q Two of 2021 and Q Three. In response to the earnings report, Coinbase or Coin shares fell roughly 10% on Tuesday afternoon in after hours trading. As of press time, Coin is down 4.1% on the week. Other centralized crypto communities saw similar dips between Q Two and Q Three. Square's cash app reported a 23% drop in its bitcoin profits in Q Three. Robin Hood's numbers were even more drastic as crypto revenue fell 78% between Q Two and Q Three.
00:05:25.186 - 00:05:36.934, Speaker A: Accordingly, total revenue shrank from five hundred and sixty five million dollars to three hundred and sixty five million dollars between earnings reports. SEC halted registration of tokens stemming from.

00:05:39.692 - 00:06:00.206, Speaker A: Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, stopped a Wyoming based Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or Dao, from registering two tokens as securities. The Dao named the American Cryptofed Dao, LLC was legally recognized in Wyoming as a limited liability company or LLC. Back in July, following Wyoming's decision to.
00:06:00.228 - 00:06:02.954, Speaker B: Allow such an action, the SEC alleges.
00:06:03.002 - 00:06:16.366, Speaker A: That the Dow filed a materially deficient and misleading registration form known as a Form Ten that failed to contain certain required information about the Dow's business, or tokens. The SEC alleges that the tokens Ducot.
00:06:16.398 - 00:06:18.882, Speaker B: And Locke are equity securities rather than.
00:06:18.936 - 00:06:39.242, Speaker A: Utility tokens as the Dow attempted to describe them. According to Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Digital, it appears American Crypto Fed, Dow, LLC was a sham. To be clear, I don't fault the SEC for this, he said. It clearly was a troll, but does show that the come in and register not so easy of a thing.
00:06:39.376 - 00:06:40.114, Speaker B: He added.
00:06:40.182 - 00:06:43.120, Speaker A: This is getting farcical. We need a better way.
00:06:43.810 - 00:06:47.434, Speaker B: ENS rose 100% after AirDrop ethereum.
00:06:47.482 - 00:07:34.494, Speaker A: Name, service or ENS? The company behind ETH Domain Names, began an AirDrop of its governance token ENS to existing name registrants this week, shortly after the AirDrop, which gives users the power to vote on how ENS will function going forward. The ENS token price skyrocketed, shooting up to a high of $85.69 on Wednesday morning. At such high prices, users are reporting their Airdrops are now worth upwards of $20,000. Interestingly, to claim a drop, users had to vote on the ENS governance constitution. Furthermore, claimants were required to delegate tokens, aka their voting power, to addresses owned by the likes of Coinbase that applied to be delegates. As of press time Thursday afternoon, ENS was at $63.57,
00:07:34.494 - 00:08:22.102, Speaker A: a 100% increase from its initial trading price of around $30, good for a market cap of approximately $930,000,000. Time for fund bits.
