00:01:21.618 - 00:01:23.800, Speaker C: Hey Laura, good to be back on the show.
00:01:24.730 - 00:02:06.130, Speaker A: You wrote a couple of really interesting blog posts last week that refer to some of the events on March twelveTH, which we'll call Black Thursday for listeners, because we're going to be referencing events throughout that day, throughout the show. And on that day, due to panic over the coronavirus and its effect on the economy and amid a much wider sell off, the crypto markets crashed in two legs, as you wrote about in one of your blog posts. And you say in the first blog post that in the second leg, the market structure of the crypto markets broke. So why don't you just kind of broadly describe the events of that day in crypto.
00:02:08.150 - 00:02:31.674, Speaker C: Just for clarity. So if you look at kind of the coin market cap, you'll see a lot of the events are reported on UTC time. And actually the first leg down happened on the twelveTH and the second leg down happened on the 13th in the US. It was basically morning and evening. And so I'm just going to refer to the two legs as morning and evening just for simplicity. So the first leg down happened at about 05:00 a.m. Central time, 06:00 a.m.
00:02:31.674 - 00:03:12.326, Speaker C: Eastern time on the twelveTH. We don't know with 100% certainty what caused it, but definitely someone who held a lot of bitcoin started selling their bitcoin. The two best theories are, one, that someone was derisking because they were kind of concerned about global macro as a result of the coronavirus. And the second theory is that the plus token scammers from kind of last summer sold off bitcoin, and presumably they wanted to do that in the guise of it kind of being aligned with the coronavirus. They had a chance to see the US. Futures markets limit down the night before, and so they kind of assumed that everyone would rightfully just assume that the broader markets were the cause. So those are the two best theories.
00:03:12.326 - 00:03:46.690, Speaker C: It feels like a high probability that one of those is correct. There is a possible third theory. There are other possible theories, but none of them that I think make a ton of sense. And so it's very likely that one of those two things caused the first leg down on the twelveTH that moved bitcoin from about 7500 to about 5800 or so over the course of about an hour. So it was a very large and very fast move and then kind of prices stabilized throughout the day. I can tell you from our side we work with a lot of other market participants, exchanges, market makers, desks and stuff. And obviously the day for all of those guys was really hectic.
00:03:46.690 - 00:04:32.098, Speaker C: And a number of people got margin called, meaning that they had posted collateral to borrow some assets. The value of the assets they borrowed had decreased such that the value of the collateral was now higher than the value of the assets that were borrowed. And so excuse me, the value of the assets borrowed was higher than the value of the collateral. And so those lenders were trying to work with the borrowers to figure out how to either get more collateral or repay the loans. And so that kind of back and forth went between a lot of lenders over the course of the day. And what appears to be the case is that some number of borrowers were unable to either post more collateral or repay the loans. And so the lenders in the evening started liquidating collateral and that's what caused the second leg down.
00:04:32.098 - 00:04:39.670, Speaker C: Unfortunately during the second leg down then we kind of started hitting some mechanical problems in the crypto markets and that's kind of why I said the market structure broke.
00:04:40.730 - 00:05:06.560, Speaker A: Yeah. And you have a really great dissection of how the crypto markets have these unique characteristics that kind of played into what happened there. So I don't know if you can remember all nine of them, but you laid out nine different ways that they are kind of distinct from traditional markets or have their own unique characteristics. So can you at least lay out the major ones, if not all?
00:05:07.010 - 00:05:53.502, Speaker C: Sure. So the most unique thing about crypto is that there are a lot of trading venues where people trade and they all trade the same assets bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, et cetera. In traditional markets, by and large you can more or less think of like, let's say equities as like there being a single exchange where equities are traded. In FX markets there are a handful of trading venues, like primarily a few major banks and dealers around the world, like three or four kind of major venues where people trade FX. But in crypto there's about ten or so major venues where people trade. And although the underlying assets are core the same bitcoin, ethereum, those things, the way they're traded is very different. So you've got spot markets, you've got futures markets, you've got perpetual swaps, which are a form of futures market, and you got options, those being the major ones.
00:05:53.502 - 00:06:20.680, Speaker C: And then different exchanges have different, they trade different products. So not all the exchanges trade all the products. For example, coinbase only trades spot. They don't have any derivatives. If you look at BitMEX, BitMEX only trades futures and perps derabit really just dominates options trading. And so you've got all these different venues and people trading different products. And of course, as the underlying price of bitcoin changes, the price of these different derivatives products is also changing in real time.
00:06:20.680 - 00:07:13.314, Speaker C: And then on top of that, you've got different kinds of traders who cannot access certain venues, right? So if you just say like, I want to sell or buy $10 million of bitcoin, let's just say, generally speaking, the not sensible thing to do would be to go to a single exchange and just eat through the order book on that exchange. The right thing to do. And there's a lot of kind of people who formally know how to do best execution on this stuff is you'd look at the order books across all of these exchanges and you'd write pick off the orders off of all of those exchanges, you'd space it out over time and do those kinds of things. But that's assuming you can access all of the order books in crypto, a substantial majority of traders in the space actually cannot access all of the order books or even some of the order books. Some people can only access one order book. For example, a lot of Chinese retail traders basically only trade on huobi. A lot of people who don't want to KYC only trade on BitMEX.
00:07:13.314 - 00:08:16.166, Speaker C: And so you've got people who structurally do not want to spread their trades across lots of venues. And so as a result of kind of all of these unique dynamics of different products being traded across different venues, and the fact that people are not doing, quote unquote, best execution and kind of taking liquidity across all different venues, you end up with pretty meaningful price deviations between those venues. 99% of the time those price deviations are close to zero, or like maybe they get a little bit beyond the make or taker fees, but not much. And arbitragers will kind of just arbitrage those and that's fine. But what happened on the twelveTH was that those prices started getting so out of whack, arbitragers started having to shuttle money between the exchanges because let's say the price was high on one exchange and low on the other, but let's say the money they had on each exchange was backwards. So they had it to basically flip the positioning of the bitcoin, let's say the USDT that they had across those exchanges. Well in order to do that, they have to use the blockchains and withdraw from one exchange and deposit to another exchange.
00:08:16.166 - 00:08:54.386, Speaker C: And that takes time. And so on the twelveTH that started happening in such high frequency that basically the bitcoin blockchain and the ethereum blockchain became entirely congested. So people were using up all of the block space on both chains. And so gas fees started to go up, the network started to come congested, transactions started not going through. And so that was like a big problem, just making the whole system more difficult to use. On top of that, because the price went down, a lot of miners started turning off their mining machines because their revenue was decreasing and the cost of electricity is fixed. And so it actually became unprofitable for them to keep on mining.
00:08:54.386 - 00:09:21.440, Speaker C: And so when they do that, that means the rate at which new blocks are coming out is slowing down, which obviously decreases the overall throughput of each blockchain. And so those two things kind of happening at once basically made it so that people could not move arbitragers, could not move money between exchanges quickly enough. And so the prices started to really meaningfully deviate between those exchanges. On top of that, then things got even. I'll pause there, like that was already a lot.
00:09:23.190 - 00:10:15.540, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean what you're describing just sounds like one of those terrible feedback loops. Like it just was essentially a downward spiral. The problem was being exacerbated at every step of the way. But one thing that I wanted to ask about, because I was a little bit confused when I read this in your blog post, one BTC is one BTC, and whether or not you choose to sell it at 4000 or 8000 or 12,000 or whatever it is, is presumably under the miner's control. So I kind of don't necessarily understand why it is that they would just turn off their mining equipment immediately at that second, because maybe I just don't understand how they run their business. But I feel like I could see an argument for being like, oh well, they could just hang onto it until the price goes back up.
00:10:15.910 - 00:10:54.640, Speaker C: Right? So they can. And certainly miners historically have very much speculated on the price of bitcoin. As the derivatives markets have matured, specifically the futures markets and the options markets, miners have become, a lot of miners have gotten blown out, like in 2018 as the market crashed. And so they've become a lot less willing to take on price risk of bitcoin. And so fortunately now they can hedge this to a large degree where they can say, hey, my cost of mining bitcoin is 5000, I can get a guaranteed lock in price of 7000. And so I'm going to do that, and I'm not going to take on the fact that maybe the price falls at the 6000 or 5000 or 4000. So a lot of miners are becoming a lot more rational about that.
00:10:54.640 - 00:11:31.302, Speaker C: That has started to happen. However, there are a lot of miners who still are not hedged. And so for them, if you're a miner, let's say your cost of mining bitcoin is 6000. And as the price of bitcoin hits 6000, maybe you keep on mining, but maybe you say, hey, at 5500, am I going to mine for a 10% loss? Like if it hit 5000, am I going to mine for almost 20% loss? 17 or 18, whatever that math comes out to be. And a lot of people start to say, hey, this just isn't worth it. I'll just wait for the price to come back up before I start mining. Why would I mine now and have a guaranteed loss? And so that started happening on the twelveTH.
00:11:31.446 - 00:11:48.906, Speaker A: And then one other thing I wanted to ask about was you did talk about how there were obviously increased transactions plus higher gas fees and transaction fees. And so why was it that those higher fees were not enough to offset the decline in the value of the block reward?
00:11:49.098 - 00:12:14.930, Speaker C: Yeah, so I haven't looked at the ratio recently, but if you just say a miner makes 100% of revenue, I think right now it's something like 90% to 95% of minor revenue, kind of generically speaking, comes from block rewards and only five to 10% comes from transaction fees. I don't remember the exact math breakdown, but it's something to that effect. And so fees going up like three or four x, it doesn't offset enough to really move the needle.
00:12:15.090 - 00:12:40.400, Speaker A: Right, okay. All right. So then in the beginning you talked about how part of the reason for the first sell off was perhaps coronavirus or maybe even the plus token. But then for the second one, what was the cause of that again? Was that the miners turning off the.
00:12:40.770 - 00:13:29.102, Speaker C: Yeah, so the cause of the selling was that there were lenders who had lent out assets and the borrowers became insolvent or were close to becoming insolvent, and so the lender started liquidating the collateral of the borrowers. What's interesting is there's two different types of ways to get leverage in crypto. You can do it on exchange using BitMEX or binance or any of the derrick's exchanges, all that you take on leverage. And if you follow any of the Twitter accounts, like, I think one's called whale Calls, I think another one is called bitmexrect, there's probably other ones for the other exchanges. And basically if you follow those accounts, they'll start tweeting out this number of contracts liquidated at this price. They're just like bots that, tweet that out. So those people are taking on leverage on the exchange, and those exchanges have rules and say, hey, look, if you're levered long, either short or either you're levered long or leveraged short.
00:13:29.102 - 00:14:13.210, Speaker C: If the price moves against you, there is some threshold at which the exchanges will just they will take your collateral and they will just start market selling your collateral to make sure that you stay solvent. And so that happens all programmatically and the exchanges handle that. The other way to take on leverage is to basically call someone, in this case a lender. So think people like Genesis or BlockFi or Matrixport or those kinds of companies. And those kinds of companies say, hey, if you want to get a yield on your bitcoin, deposits a bitcoin with me and I'll give you a yield like a bank. And if you want to borrow some bitcoin, call me and I'll lend you some bitcoin. And so those guys started to the people who borrowed Bitcoin and Ethan, whatever else they had borrowed, and probably dollars in this case, those people started to become insolvent.
00:14:13.210 - 00:14:49.900, Speaker C: And so in those cases the lenders don't typically programmatically market sell on the underlying exchanges. They always prefer not to liquidate people's collateral. And so they were quite literally calling up the people who borrowed and saying, hey Bob, hey Joe, hey Jim. You know, you're close to being insolvent. Either you need to deposit more collateral or we're going to liquidate your clock or liquidate your collateral. And so it sounds like they had about 12 hours or so of back and forth and dialogue and obviously things did not get resolved in that twelve hour period. And so the lenders contractually had to start liquidating that collateral and so that's what caused the second leg down.
00:14:50.430 - 00:15:17.490, Speaker A: Okay. And so like on this chart that you have on your blog post there's, what does this look like? Maybe a period of about 12 hours or so where there does not appear to be very many liquidations at all. It's sort of flat after the first big spike in the morning and then it continues to go up. Is that kind of what happened there? Why was there this period where it doesn't look like there were any liquidations?
00:15:18.150 - 00:15:54.710, Speaker C: Correct. So that's what happened during that twelve hour period was the lenders were reaching out to the borrowers saying, hey guys, here's your balances, here's your solvency ratios and whatever. You need to either deposit more collateral or you need to return the loans and the contracts between the lenders and the borrowers. They have language saying, hey, we're going to give you this much notice. If you don't respond in 6 hours or 4 hours, then we have the right to liquidate your collateral. Once you respond. There's like a whole bunch of provisions in those contracts about these kinds of situations that very formally define how quickly things need to get resolved.
00:15:54.710 - 00:16:13.442, Speaker C: In this case it seems like it was about 12 hours. It's kind of about the amount of time in whichever contracts were written and obviously things did not get resolved. And so then at that point the lenders legally had the right to claim the collateral. And then in order to ensure that their depositors stayed solvent, they had to liquidate that collateral wow.
00:16:13.576 - 00:17:04.206, Speaker A: Okay, so there was another thing here, and there was a lot of speculation about this online, but basically there was one point where in your blog post you said that there were only $20 million worth of bids left on the entire BitMax order book and over $200 million in long positions that needed to be liquidated. And you say that that could have crashed the price of BTC to zero briefly, but that what happened was that BitMEX ended up going down for maintenance. And I did see some people speculating that BitMEX had kind of gone offline to save the price of bitcoin. What do you think happened there? And also how does this play into what you were saying before about the bitcoin blockchain being backlogged?
00:17:04.398 - 00:17:36.270, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's a few kind of compounding variables here. So all of this happened during the second leg down, which was in the evening in the US. So once the lender started liquidating collateral, obviously the prices started, bitcoin started going down more. At that point there were people who had leverage on BitMEX. I mean, people had leverage on all of the derivatives exchanges, but on BitMEX specifically, there was more people who were levered long. And so those liquidations started to cascade. And the problem was that over the course of the day, people had already done a lot of arbitragers because of the price movements in the first half of the day.
00:17:36.270 - 00:18:32.766, Speaker C: And so a lot of market makers had already moved collateral off of BitMEX to take advantage of arbitrage on other venues. And so the amount of collateral available on BitMax was lower than normal. On top of that, the blockchain was slowing down because the miners were turning their machines off, and because there were just so many transactions that were shuttling around the price of sort of cascading down on BitMEX, what happened was that market makers basically stopped showing up. This is actually common that in general, when volatility is increased, market makers widen their spreads. In general, market makers, their business mandate is every single day, don't lose money. And if there's a day where market maker lose money, that's a very bad day for them. And all those businesses are run with very strict risk controls on making sure that they're not taking on too much risk and not quoting spreads too tight so that they lose money.
00:18:32.766 - 00:19:14.470, Speaker C: And so on days like on march twelveTH, those are days that the volatility is really high and they don't want to lose money. And a lot of market makers may have ended up losing money in the first half of the day. And so they were already just very risk off and scared. And a lot of market makers just said, hey, this volatility is picking up, this is getting crazy, we don't know what's going on. And so a lot of market makers just stopped providing liquidity entirely. And so as the price of bitcoin started cascading down, in the evening, market makers just didn't show up to provide liquidity on BitMEX, and people kept getting liquidated there's a few more. And it wasn't not only that, there were obviously not all market makers disappeared, but some percentage did.
00:19:14.470 - 00:19:51.800, Speaker C: And so even the ones that wanted to provide liquidity at that point, they just didn't have collateral on the exchange. And so they were trying to shuttle collateral from coinbase, binance, huobi, wherever else they had collateral, they were trying to send it to BitMEX, but the blockchain was slow, and so they couldn't get collateral to BitMEX, and so they couldn't actually provide liquidity. And so as a result of all of that, there ended up being a point where there were $200 million of outstanding liquidations that needed to occur, but there was only $20 million of orders on the bid side of the book. Had they not turned the system off or had it not gone down, the price of bitcoin would have gone to zero.
00:19:53.050 - 00:20:00.540, Speaker A: Yeah. So if that would have happened on BitMax, what would have happened to the price of bitcoin more broadly across the market?
00:20:01.550 - 00:20:31.974, Speaker C: I mean, nothing that would have only survived for like, one or two minutes, three minutes. People were obviously trying to send money to bitcoin, and there is a price sorry, yeah. Let's say bitcoin is trading for $500 on BitMax and $4,000 on coinbase. There are people who are going to say, right, like, when the price discrepancy is that large, I don't care if I lose everything and BitMax blows up in the next five minutes. I'm willing to risk that to try and make eight x in five minutes. Right. And there are people who have that risk tolerance and have the sophistication to do all that stuff.
00:20:31.974 - 00:20:45.660, Speaker C: So as the price discrepancy gets wider, it obviously encourages more people to show up. And so at some point they would have shown up, but the spike on BitMax, it could have printed zero. And that's just like a very bad look, obviously.
00:20:46.670 - 00:21:08.978, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Just so much craziness. All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss how all of this played out in DeFi and also look at what different on chain technologies could be solutions or preventative measures to these issues.

Will government backed coins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy.

00:23:20.910 - 00:23:44.050, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Kyle Simani. So let's now talk about how these market failures on Black Thursday played out in DeFi. You wrote in your first blog post that DeFi, quote, outright failed, which is interesting phrasing to use. So what happened there? And let's start the story with MakerDAO.
00:23:44.470 - 00:24:16.618, Speaker C: Yeah. So of the major D five protocols, the one that definitely had the most problems on March twelveTH was maker. So for those that don't know, maker is a way to get leverage. Like everything else in crypto, getting leverage is generally like the top thing people like to do. They like to trade with leverage. In the case of maker, you post Ethereum or ETH as collateral and you withdraw dai as a form of debt. And the people who do that are generally doing so for one reason, which is they want to go margin long or levered long ETH.
00:24:16.618 - 00:24:59.478, Speaker C: And so they're taking that die and selling it for ETH. All right? So they're getting levered exposure to the price of ethereum. So on the twelveTH, during the first leg down price leg down, bitcoin and Ethereum both crashed pretty hard. As a result of that, a lot of those maker dow collaterals became under collateralized, and so people started liquidating those positions on traditional centralized exchanges like BitMax, the exchange automatically runs those liquidations and they just will market sell or market buy, and they'll just eat orders on the order book to execute those transactions. In the case of MakerDAO, there is no order book, right? And it's not a centralized exchange. And so in those systems, anyone this term is kind of generically used as a keeper. Keepers run some software.
00:24:59.478 - 00:25:47.142, Speaker C: That software was written by the Makerdow team and that software basically just looks at the price of ETH, looks at the collateralization of all of the outstanding loans and it says, hey, if anyone is under collateralized, you can go liquidate them and you get some reward for doing so. It's like a few percentage points or something. And so there's a rational motivation for people to do that. So that system broke down in kind of a couple of different ways, two to three different ways on Thursday the twelveTH. So the first is that the Ethereum network became fully congested and so gas fees were going up and blocks were full. The Keeper software was not written to actually dynamically adjust gas prices. It was basically using some setting to just say, hey, set the gas fee at, I'm just going to say one penny for simplicity.
00:25:47.142 - 00:26:46.958, Speaker C: But the market wasn't clearing transactions with anything below. Let's say people who were running the Keeper software, that the out of the box Keeper software were trying to liquidate collateral and were just not doing so because the software wasn't configured to do this. Some very smart person realized this, realized what was happening and so they went into the system and they just changed the parameters and they said, hey, just change the gas price and increase the gas price so that the transaction will get included, the miners will include the transaction. What that person realized is that the way that the liquidations work in Maker is that those are actually their collateral auctions. And so the idea is there's $100 for sale, you can bid up to let's say $99, and then you'll get $100 and then you make one dollars profit, right? So some guy realized, hey, no one else's transactions are going through, so I can bid $0 and I can get $100. And so some very smart person did that and collected, I think, $6 million or $8 million of ETH over the.
00:26:46.964 - 00:26:52.670, Speaker A: Course of, I think the total was 8 million, but at least one of them was maybe like 4.5.
00:26:52.740 - 00:27:24.470, Speaker C: But anyway, yeah, someone ran out with millions of dollars and paid effectively nothing for it. And so that was the first failure that happened. Now that's fixable, I mean, if the Keeper software was written to dynamically adjust gas prices, that wouldn't have happened. So that's a pretty fixable problem. The second problem was that liquidity, in order to run those liquidations, you have to bid in those auctions with Dai. And so you need to have Dai. And it turns out that there weren't enough keepers who had enough liquidity, like had enough Dai on hand to actually engage in those auctions.
00:27:24.470 - 00:27:39.978, Speaker C: And so the price of Dai went up to, I think, a dollar and $0.10 because people realized that this was happening. And we're buying Dai at any price to try and run this trade. So that's obviously a bad thing. You want the price of Dai to stay at about a dollar. So that was the second problem. The solution to that, I'll come back to the solution.
00:27:39.978 - 00:28:30.430, Speaker C: And then the third problem was the Oracles. So the maker system needs to know the price of ETH USD in order to make sure the system is staying solvent. And if the price of ETH USD falls too low, then the keepers can come and do the liquidations. Well, again, the theorem blockchain became 100% congested. And so the makers either were not configured to adjust their gas prices or they just chose not to submit transactions outright because the price of ETH kept crashing. And so during the second leg down, when ETH touched, I think, $88 on coinbase, when that happened, the last price that maker reported that was formally incorporated in the system was about, I think $101 or something like that. And it turns out there were a lot of vaults or CDPs in the maker system that were going to get liquidated at $100.
00:28:30.430 - 00:29:20.142, Speaker C: And so the conspiracy theory is that the people running the Oracles realized what was happening. They probably realized that, hey, if this huge amount of collateral gets liquidated, the people taking that ETH collateral may choose to sell it for dollars and cause the price of ETH to cascade further. Remember a couple of minutes ago I was saying that in times of crazy volatility, market makers just stop showing up because they just don't know what's going on. And so when ETH was down at $88 or when Bitcoin was down at 3800 or 4000, at those prices, there is very little liquidity. And so if someone's trying to market sell 5 million, $10 million of ETH, that's going to crash the price. And of course, there were other maker vaults with even lower liquidation thresholds. And so it's very possible that ETH could have just cascaded down from 88.
00:29:20.142 - 00:29:34.500, Speaker C: Have the maker Oracles been reporting the price correctly? It's very possible that ETH could have cascaded from 88 down to 50 or 40 or $30 because market makers just weren't showing up. And so those were kind of the three big problems with DFI that day.
00:29:37.910 - 00:30:06.990, Speaker A: Even though I read it's crazy. Laura, I was just going to say, even though I read your blog post before, my jaw is still like on the floor. Because the thing about the Oracles is if the Oracle really had just dipped $1 lower to $100, I mean, think about it. So I actually did not see much chatter about that. But were there any conspiracy theories about what happened there? Because it almost feels like in both instances, like things were manipulated.
00:30:09.410 - 00:30:49.178, Speaker C: So the people who run the maker Oracles, the way it's designed is there are some people who are publicly disclosed and some people who are not publicly disclosed. And that's like a safety mechanism. I think it's actually a very smart design the Maker team came up with, and I generally agree with it. Some of them I don't remember all the participants off the top of my head, the ones that are publicly disclosed, but the Maker team has them written down somewhere. But I think the zero X team has one of the keys, the Maker team is one of the keys. I forget, what else are the keys? Obviously, even the people who are anonymous who we don't know who they are, obviously those people are vested in the interest of Maker in the long run, right? Like they're not bothering to do this for fun and because they think Maker is stupid. They're obviously doing this because they care.
00:30:49.178 - 00:31:15.466, Speaker C: And presumably a lot of them own a lot of MKR. A lot of them also probably own a lot of ETH too. I think the probability of that is extremely high. It was very rational that they realized what was happening and said, oh my God, just stop, we can't prove it. I'm not accusing them of anything, but on the surface, that is a very plausible explanation.
00:31:15.598 - 00:31:26.258, Speaker A: Right? Listeners, we do not know the facts we're speculating here. But in terms of the other explanation, would that just be the congestion on the ethereum blockchain?
00:31:26.434 - 00:31:38.010, Speaker C: Correct. So that's the other theory is that it was just congested and the software was not configured correctly, and they weren't including the gas fees to actually get included in the blocks.
00:31:38.830 - 00:32:04.850, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. All right, so let's now just talk about kind of let's just play through, like, a little hypothetical here. So if those liquidations had occurred at $100, as they were supposed to, what do you think would have happened next, particularly in terms of the whole Maker system and then also the knock on effect throughout DFI?
00:32:05.990 - 00:32:38.702, Speaker C: I think had the Oracles reported the price down to $88, I think ETH would have traded down to probably 30 or 40, and that would have caused more liquidations. And it's very possible that 100% of the collateral in Maker could have been liquidated. I don't think Maker would have become insolvent in the sense that the system would break like the contracts that have broken. I just think that 90 or 100% of the users would have gotten liquidated and that would have outright shattered confidence in the system.
00:32:38.836 - 00:32:45.950, Speaker A: Yeah, well, except for the congestion on the blockchain. But anyway yeah, and then so what about the rest of DFI?
00:32:47.490 - 00:33:21.734, Speaker C: There's interesting second order impacts on the rest of DFI. So Dai is collateral for a lot of other protocols. And so, for example, in compound, you get some interesting effects. ETH is collateral in a ton of other protocols. So compound lend for me, BZX, dYdX, all these things. And so had the price of ETH crashed really low, that would have caused Cascading liquidations on other DeFi protocols, which would have probably further cascaded the price of ETH even lower, which would have been bad. The price of dai.
00:33:21.734 - 00:33:57.374, Speaker C: Also, if Maker started to become insolvent, the price of Dai either could have skyrocketed because Dai would have been contracting that's unclear. Or the price of Dai could have crashed because people realized, oh my God, the system is insolvent. How those dynamics would have played out on a minute by minute basis, I don't know. I don't think it's possible to know. But certainly there's a case where Dai could have become started trading well below a dollar. You could have traded at something. And if that happened, then a lot of the loans that are collateralized by Dai also would have probably become insolvent, which would have caused even more liquidations.
00:33:57.374 - 00:34:15.690, Speaker C: And so this already cascaded to some degree into other protocols. For example, Compound compound had a lot of liquidations firing primarily because of ETH collateral being low, but it could have caused just hundreds of millions of dollars or more. Liquidations could have occurred.
00:34:16.670 - 00:34:31.746, Speaker A: All right, at one point earlier when you were talking about how the Dai price had gone off its peg, you said you would talk about the solution to that later. Is that the USDC thing that MakerDAO adopted later on?
00:34:31.928 - 00:35:13.018, Speaker C: Yes. One of the core problems was that the price of Dai went up to a dollar ten and it was very hard for people to run these collateral auctions to actually buy the ETH collateral in the system. And so one of the problems was that people couldn't get die. And so today in order to do that, you have to deposit ETH and you have to effectively take on risk exposure. Like today, if you want to mint new Dai, you can do so at any time. But in order to do that, you have to be able to hold ETH right and take on risk of price of ETH. And a lot of market makers don't want to necessarily take on the price risk of holding ETH in order to create more Dai.
00:35:13.018 - 00:35:49.958, Speaker C: And so the idea here that's pretty clever is the Maker team said, hey, look, we're going to allow anyone to create die using USDC as collateral. Obviously USDC, the price is very stable at one dollars. I think it's never gone like more than a penny up or down. And so we're going to let anyone create die using USDC. And that's basically the solution then that you can deposit USDC, create die and then run any of these auctions. And so you can effectively guarantee the price of Dai won't go up to a dollar ten. Again, this obviously is controversial because it introduces trusted collateral into Maker, which has been a pretty controversial debate in that community for a while.
00:35:49.958 - 00:36:35.820, Speaker C: I think the way that the Maker team has proposed this, and I think was voted in last week or voted in recently to be used, is that they said, hey, if you're going to borrow, deposit USDC and withdraw die, the interest rate is going to be really high. I think the interest rate is set at 20% or 25% and so it's designed to deter people from leaving, creating large amounts of dai in the system and leaving it there for a long time because a 20% interest rate is really expensive. But of course, if you're just going to borrow it and repay the loan in five or ten minutes, then you don't really care if the interest rate is 20%. And so they designed it very clever where they said, hey, look, we can solve a liquidity problem by allowing for this other form of collateral, but we just expect no one's going to leave these loans outstanding for more than a few minutes.
00:36:36.510 - 00:37:23.290, Speaker A: Oh, that's interesting. Okay, yeah, I did see some people kind of upset about that, but I feel like what you just explained is kind of a good way to take that criticism into account. Okay, so now let's go to the second blog post that you wrote which covered all these different solutions for potentially dealing with some of the market failures that we saw in the crypto markets. So obviously you had talked about how one of the issues here is the fragmented markets of crypto, but you actually say in the second piece that you expect even more fragmentation. So why is that? And then what are some other potential ways to reduce the volatility without more consolidated trading?
00:37:23.870 - 00:37:56.440, Speaker C: Yeah, if you look over the history of crypto, I'd say up until second half of 2017, there were generally speaking, no more than three to four major liquidity venues. All of those liquidity venues basically only traded spot. Those exchanges for the most part did not have any form of KYC coinbase I think did, and Kraken like none of the other ones did. And so there was just a pretty limited number of venues. Obviously the number of mark participants was much smaller. The sophistication of mark participants was much lower. You didn't have firms like Jump and DRW and Susquehanna in crypto at all at that time.
00:37:56.440 - 00:38:48.578, Speaker C: DRW was there but basically no one else. And so the market was not very sophisticated and it was pretty limited. What happened in the second half of 17 is you got a lot more sophisticated exchanges show up. So finance showed up, BitMEX got really big huobi and OK and all those guys started really growing and started adding a lot more sophisticated products. Meanwhile, you kind of got Chinese government cracking down on exchanges in China and as a result of that, basically Huobi, OK and Binance are kind of sort of the only three exchanges that are allowed to function in China. And although I don't know this for fact, I think with a pretty high probability that if you try and launch a new exchange in China, the government will basically not let you get off the ground. So those three seem to have some sort of kind of just they were already here so they're allowed to keep living, but no one's allowed to launch new exchanges.
00:38:48.578 - 00:39:28.594, Speaker C: So those guys have kind of inherent grandfather, basically clause from the governments. So it's unlikely you're going to see new people show up there. Korea basically the same thing, kind of. So and then we've also started to see the institutionalization of the US market with firms like CME and DAC getting in the space. And so for all these reasons, the market structure has really started to diverge where you have just more trading venues and people have meaningful network effects around those trading venues. There's obviously a lot of traders who either value KYC don't want KYC, they're Chinese retail, they're American institutions. And so as the markets matured, it's become very clear that there's different types of market participants who want different things.
00:39:28.594 - 00:39:52.540, Speaker C: And that really supports, structurally having lots of different exchanges. Is it clear? The answer is six versus eight versus twelve versus 18. I don't know, that's a pretty wide range. But it's clear that the market is going to support quite a few different exchanges structurally, at least until some of these types of parameters change. And so I don't expect anytime soon that market structure dynamic is going to change very much.
00:39:53.150 - 00:40:14.610, Speaker A: And then another option you looked at was potentially disallowing extreme leverage, such as the 100 X leverage that's allowed on BitMEX or the 125 X leverage allowed on finance. How would disallowing that help? And why do you think that this is likely not something that they'll actually implement?
00:40:15.190 - 00:40:46.406, Speaker C: Yeah, they offer that much leverage because some people want that, right? They're not offering the product and no one's using it. And so people are trading with that much leverage. A lot of people are not trading with that much leverage, but some people are. These exchanges are unregulated. And so these businesses, rightfully so, want to serve their customers. And if the customers say, I want to trade with that much leverage, then the exchanges want to let them do that. So I think it's unlikely those exchanges will disallow.
00:40:46.406 - 00:41:16.180, Speaker C: It basically because they are in their capitalists and they want to serve their customers. The problem with that, unfortunately, is that if you make it too easy to get too much leverage, you can very quickly get Cascading liquidations. And that's what we've seen happen time and time again. The second leg down on BitMax when there ended up being $200 million liquidations and only $20 million on the order book, if you simply disallow leverage, let's say BitMax capped leverage at ten X, I'm fairly certain that that situation would have never come up.
00:41:16.650 - 00:41:27.826, Speaker A: Right, but why do you think oh, so you're saying that the exchanges won't disallow it just because since there is consumer demand, customer demand, they'll just meet that demand?
00:41:28.018 - 00:41:41.766, Speaker C: Correct. I mean, crypto, one of the rules of crypto censorship, resistance. If your customers want it, then don't censor them. Right? That's what they want. They know the risk. Anyone who trades with that much leverage knows what they're doing. They understand that it's very risky.
00:41:41.958 - 00:41:43.760, Speaker A: Let's hope they know what they're doing.
00:41:44.210 - 00:41:46.320, Speaker C: Fair enough. Let's hope they know what they're doing.
00:41:47.410 - 00:42:19.430, Speaker A: One other option you looked at was circuit breakers and I saw that your partner to Shar Jane, tweeted that as a suggestion and his tweet got a fair bit of pushback eventually. Actually, in recent days, Huobi did introduce a circuit breaker on its derivatives platform but it seemed like you believe that the exchanges are not likely to agree on a global circuit breaker provision. So can you talk a little bit about how circuit breakers would help and why you think they're not probably going to be a big solution?
00:42:19.850 - 00:42:59.720, Speaker C: Yeah, so if you look in traditional, if you look at like the New York Stock Exchange for example, they have circuit breakers. I think the rule is if the price moves 7% or more in one day, then in some period of time, then the circuit breakers kick in and they just freeze all the markets. That works really effectively when the underlying assets only trade on a single market, in this case, let's say US equities. But if you think about it, like if you institute, let's just say the circuit breaker is 15 minutes, price of bitcoin goes down 7% in 15 minutes. Well, because there's multiple menus at the table, those terms become very challenging. There is no single price of bitcoin at any moment in time. The price between all of the exchanges varies a little bit.
00:42:59.720 - 00:44:15.382, Speaker C: It's usually very small, it's usually a few basis points, but in times of volatility, in times when the circuit breaker would be going off, that's definitely not the case, right? Like the price of the exchanges is different and so you end up just creating even if all the exchanges shake hands and say yes, we'll all institute a 30 minutes circuit breaker. If the price movement is x in some number of minutes, it's still really hard because the circuit breakers are going to go on and off at different moments in time because each exchange has their own local price. And so what you end up doing is you end up just screwing a lot of market participants because of just like the market microstructure, both as certain exchanges shut down, right? And then others hopefully hopefully follow and then also on the reverse side of when those exchanges light back up, right? And turn back on and start taking trades again because they would end up turning on at different times. And so you have a lot of very difficult problems with market microstructure and doing that in a fair way. And as a result, someone's going to get hurt. Really? Someone's going to make money from that, obviously, but someone is going to get hurt in what I would consider an unfair capacity, because they just can't compete at that microstructure level. So logistically it's very hard to do time.
00:44:15.382 - 00:44:53.740, Speaker C: I mean even just agreeing on notions of time, notions of price and all those kinds of things and obviously volatility is going to be very high in these moments. And also there's a strong incentive to break range. Let's say all the exchanges get together and shake hands and say, hey, we're not going to do this. And then let's say there's ten people and nine of them do it and one of them doesn't because that worse and says great, I'm the only one open for business. So all of the trading has to happen on my exchange, right. I'm going to collect all the trading fees. And so you have a real tragedy to Commons where it's super difficult to get people on board and even if you could get them on board, the actual micro structure of the implementation would be very hard.
00:44:54.350 - 00:45:19.410, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. So in the second essay you actually also reviewed a whole bunch of different tech solutions for increasing throughput and lowering latency on the blockchain networks themselves. So you started with some of the different technologies on the Bitcoin network. Why don't you talk about some of the different ones there and what your assessment is for their potential to help in these situations.
00:45:19.830 - 00:46:10.466, Speaker C: Yeah, so the two major kind of theoretical proposals for improving the aggregate throughput and decreasing latency of Bitcoin transactions are Lightning network and side chains. And I think there's kind of structural problems with both. In the case of Lightning, in order you have to pre collateralize all the channels and each channel is a bilateral channel between two parties. So today there are about ten major venues. And so if you wanted to have channels between all the exchanges, that's about 100 different channels between these folks and that's 100 channels. And that means each exchange has to collateralize one side of that. These exchanges would have to in terms of balance sheet management, it's pretty risky for them to say, hey, I'm going to pre collateralize all these channels and I don't know if people are going to use this, I don't know which of these exchanges my customers are going to want to send money to.
00:46:10.466 - 00:47:06.814, Speaker C: And that really limits their flexibility because every bitcoin that's in one channel cannot be used in another channel. Not only does it limit their flexibility in that way, it also limits their flexibility in terms of things like, let's say, loans. So a lot of the exchanges are starting to loan out assets and so how they think about risk of their own balance sheets as they have all these competing interests is really difficult for them to reason about this. Running a Lightning node is expensive. It's risky because it's a hot wallet, it's always online and it's very capitally inefficient because they don't know where customers are going to want to send the money. And so they have a large amount of overhead for maintaining this they know for a fact the customers are not going to use it the vast majority of the time. And then even if their customers did start using it, because the liquidity is divvied up across 100 different channels, the arbitragers are going to very quickly exhaust that channel and then that channel is going to become sitting there useless.
00:47:06.814 - 00:47:32.774, Speaker C: Right? Okay. The first few people to Arbitrage will get instant transactions, but then as people try and follow along that same corridor, then that channel gets exhausted and so you end up having to recolateralize the base kind of anyways. So I'm pretty skeptical that lightning is like a core solution to this problem. It just creates a lot of mechanical complexity and you end up just breaking up basically liquidity between these different channels. So I'm skeptical.
00:47:32.822 - 00:47:34.918, Speaker A: There side chains.
00:47:35.014 - 00:48:01.826, Speaker C: Yeah. So the other major proposal for this is side chains. I think the Blockstream team proposed side chains, I think as early as either 2013, if not 13, then definitely 2014. And so it's been talked about for a long time. Today the usage of side chains on Bitcoin is effectively zero. The only real side chain out there is the Liquid side chain made by the Blockstream team. Liquid has been around for more than twelve months now and still has effectively no usage.
00:48:01.826 - 00:48:39.230, Speaker C: And a handful of the major exchanges are signed up to use it, but they're not using it. And there's also quite a few missing people. I know Finance is missing, coinbase is missing, Kraken is missing, I think a few others are missing too. And so you don't have everyone on board. Sidechains theoretically should solve the problem, but the exchanges are just choosing not to use it. And so the kind of natural question is, well, why exchanges have some reason to use sidechains in that it would very clearly help them save on gas fees on the blockchain. You can bet that all of the exchanges paid a lot of gas fees on March twelveTH because transaction costs were going up on the blockchains as networks became congested.
00:48:39.230 - 00:49:36.820, Speaker C: And so they're actually incentivized to use something like Liquid because it'll actually help them save money. I don't know, I haven't called all of the exchanges and had one on one conversations with them and asked them the specific question. But as I think about it, the most obvious reason I think they don't use it is that the exchanges don't trust each other. They are brutally competitive, brutal competitors, they generally don't like each other, and there's a lot of ways where Liquid could backfire. So the way Liquid works is it's an eleven of 15 multisig and so if any eleven of the exchanges clue they can screw, they can really hurt one of the other exchanges. And so if I'm, let's say Coinbase is a good example here, or CME, or Backed, if I know a lot of the other people on liquid are Asian exchanges that are unregulated. If those guys call each other and say, hey, we're just not going to send these coins to Coinbase even though we're supposed to, they can just choose not to, and they can just take them for themselves.
00:49:36.820 - 00:50:03.550, Speaker C: And given the fact there's almost no legal recourse, right. Like, this would be totally uncharted territory that gets really game, theoretically dangerous for Coinbase. And so I think that's the big reason why these exchanges haven't opted in to use it is because they just don't trust each other. And with an eleven to 15 configuration, it's very easy to see how you get hurt. Not for a million dollars. I mean, you could get hurt out of $50 million. I mean, it could be a huge, huge loss.
00:50:04.050 - 00:50:12.602, Speaker A: Wow. So do you see any way to solve these kinds of congestion issues during times of high volatility like that? On Bitcoin?
00:50:12.666 - 00:50:37.014, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, on Bitcoin, I'm not really optimistic. I don't see how to do it. On Bitcoin. I think with the smart contract platforms that have newer, just approaches to scaling, as well as they have kind of full scripting languages that allow for more advanced smart contract logic, I'm more optimistic. But on Bitcoin, based on my kind of current outlook, I don't see how it's going to get done.
00:50:37.132 - 00:50:44.300, Speaker A: All right, well, let's talk about Ethereum quickly. What are some of the different solutions there, and what's your assessment of those?
00:50:44.670 - 00:50:51.386, Speaker C: Yeah, so on Ethereum, there's a handful of solutions. Roll ups are kind of a common one, trying to think what are the other ones?
00:50:51.488 - 00:50:54.250, Speaker A: Sharding was another you mentioned in your blog post.
00:50:54.400 - 00:51:10.434, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. Sharding is the other big one. So I'll kind of touch on Sharding first. So ETH 2.0 is working on Sharding. A lot of the new layer ones coming out are also working on Sharding as well. And they have kind of their own flavors of Sharding, and they have different nuances to how they do what they do.
00:51:10.434 - 00:52:33.654, Speaker C: But the really big problem I have with Sharding is that it's not clear that it actually helps in this specific situation where you have a lot of money needing to shuttle around in kind of much of what I'll call like, random ways, meaning you just have random deposits and random withdrawal addresses. And so the reason that I'm concerned that it doesn't solve the problem is that in a Sharded system, if you send a transaction from Shard A to Shard B, or like you send money and you need to go do a cross Shard transaction, you end up doing a transaction on Shard A and on Shard B. And so when you do that, if you think about that, and then if 100% of the transactions are cross shard, then what you end up the net effect you end up getting is that the aggregate throughput of the system ends up approaching the throughput of a single shard because every transaction takes up a second, you know, takes up space on a second shard. And so that's really concerning because then you end up like if people are shuttling money around to run these arbitrages and all these transactions end up being cross shard, then you're kind of defeating the whole purpose of Sharding. And so I'm very concerned about that kind of happening. Obviously, in any of these cases, you would not end up with 100% of transactions being cross shard, but certainly a meaningful percentage would be. And that's going to be, again, during a time of volatility, a time when things are moving around.
00:52:33.654 - 00:52:57.506, Speaker C: And so the idea that Sharding is going to increase throughput by ten x, by 50 x or 100 x, I'm very skeptical. That may be the case 90% of the time, but during the time when the systems are breaking and when everything is volatile and going crazy, that's when you need it to really maintain that throughput advantage. And during those moments of time is when I think that's going to really get tested in a really negative way.
00:52:57.608 - 00:53:08.214, Speaker A: It's terrible. But when you were talking, I realized that it reminded me of the hospital bed or ventilator issue with the coronavirus. I was like, oh, it's the same problem, right.
00:53:08.252 - 00:53:16.220, Speaker C: But anyway, when it's peacetime, everything is good. Like building systems to run during peacetime is easy. Like building systems to work during wartime is really hard.
00:53:16.750 - 00:53:20.090, Speaker A: Yeah, but what about optimistic roll ups?
00:53:20.430 - 00:54:15.306, Speaker C: Yeah, so optimistic roll ups have a similar ish problem where a couple of problems so one is at least the vanilla implementation of optimistic roll ups doesn't solve the latency issue because you still rely on the underlying layer, one blockchain for clearing transactions. So you increase throughput, but you don't decrease latency. But the other problem basically is that if these exchanges end up using their own optimistic roll up chains, then you're basically recreating the same thing as Sharding, where you have to end up having the same transaction on multiple chains or multiple optimistic roll up chains in order to produce the kind of same effects. And so as I just think again, I look at these exchanges, these guys don't coordinate on much of anything, and saying that, hey, they're all going to agree to use the same optimistic roll up chain just seems to me to be very unlikely. Like they haven't done that in the past. Technology is still new. These guys all seem to want to kind of have control of their own systems.
00:54:15.306 - 00:54:26.180, Speaker C: And so I just find it unlikely that all of these players agree to use the same optimistic roll up chain. And if they don't, then you end up basically in kind of the same kind of Sharding logic that I just walked through.
00:54:26.710 - 00:54:40.440, Speaker A: Wow. All right, well, so you kind of started to go into how you think we could solve this issue. And I know this is maybe more speculative or off the future, but. Why don't you go into that a little bit?
00:54:41.130 - 00:55:39.186, Speaker C: Yeah. So I mean, my favorite solutions to solve this problem, I think there's one interesting market structure solution, which is the introduction of Prime Brokers. I think Prime Brokers really help a lot because they basically allow you to have a single centralized entity off chain, basically manage all the collateral across all of the venues and allow the different funds and traders to do all the trading and then just net all that stuff out on some frequency kind of after the fact. Prime Brokered is very big business in traditional markets, people like Prime Brokers. The challenge is that A, you need everyone to trust the same Prime Broker or Prime Brokers, which in crypto today, there are no single entity that everyone trusts. And then B, that entity needs to have a lot of capital because you need to be able to have enough capital to basically face all of your clients or so if you're a prime and let's say all of your clients have $5 billion collectively, you need to have at least $5 billion and probably a lot more in order to be effective prime broker. And so that's been kind of a problem is that there aren't Prime Brokers.
00:55:39.186 - 00:55:57.086, Speaker C: I expect we will eventually have Prime Brokers. So Tagomi for example, today is trying to do that. They're not there yet, but they're certainly moving in that direction. A handful of other players are trying to do something similar. The good thing about Prime Brokers is that they don't really change the market. They don't require a change in the market structure. You don't need to get the exchanges to agree on anything.
00:55:57.086 - 00:56:31.058, Speaker C: You don't need to introduce some new standards. This can be very much like the exchanges want to do business with its trader, which in this case is the prime and the traders want to have prime services. And so it's a very kind of organic evolution of the current market structure. So I'm optimistic that will help mitigate this problem over time. The other solution I'm really interested in is the introduction of new layer one assets. Ethereum people have been talking about proof of stake and Sharding and all these things for years. For the last couple of years we've seen a lot of really smart people say, hey, I have different ideas and different ideas on how to scale these systems.
00:56:31.058 - 00:57:26.506, Speaker C: And a lot of really smart people are working on scaling new layer ones. Of those, the one I'm kind of most interested in is called Solana. And they're really the team focused on optimizing just a single shard to kind of maximize throughput in a single system. So I have most throughput and lowest latency in one Shard. And the idea is that if you can actually do that, then all of these problems around, throughput, around, moving money around, around, low, latency, all those things get just magically solved. You don't have to worry about new trust models, new security models, cross charted transactions, just all these other things are just really untested and just introduce lots of new variables and we just don't know how those things are going to actually work in the real world. But we all know today with very high conviction that you have a chain and it has assets on it and you shuttle them around and exchanges, take deposits and withdrawals, and that market structure is very well understood by everyone in the market.
00:57:26.506 - 00:57:38.320, Speaker C: And so I like that that kind of approach plugs into the current market structure very well. The downside of that approach is you need people to agree to use the new chain, which is a non trivial thing to do.
00:57:39.330 - 00:57:53.310, Speaker A: Definitely non trivial, but it is still early days in Crypto, so we'll see what happens. All right, well, thank you so much for explaining all this craziness. It has been great having you on the show. Thanks for coming on unchained.
