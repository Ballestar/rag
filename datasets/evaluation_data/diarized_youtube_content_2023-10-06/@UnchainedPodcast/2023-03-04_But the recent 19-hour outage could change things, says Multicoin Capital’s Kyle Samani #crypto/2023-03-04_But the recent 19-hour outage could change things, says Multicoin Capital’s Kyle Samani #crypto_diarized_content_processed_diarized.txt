00:00:00.090 - 00:00:12.474, Speaker B: I just feel like women are so trained to be like, you don't want to spook a man. Don't bring up children in the first, like, three years. And men will just I have been on dates with men who will say, like, I want children in the next year. And it's like, you guys are insane.
00:00:12.522 - 00:00:41.398, Speaker A: But I guess we do. We get scared. I've heard comedians tell jokes, male comedians tell jokes about, you know, women talking about children and stuff and everything. Yeah, and men bring them up, too. And women are so afraid that they will because we have an expiration date on our bodies. We're having kids. And men don't really, but they will make you feel crazy.
00:00:41.398 - 00:00:53.870, Speaker A: Gaslight you of like, you're a stalker bitch because you talk about kids. What's wrong? Nobody wants your dirty ass sperm.
00:00:54.290 - 00:00:55.006, Speaker B: Nobody want.
00:00:55.028 - 00:00:57.340, Speaker A: To make no babies. Nobody wants your seed, man.
