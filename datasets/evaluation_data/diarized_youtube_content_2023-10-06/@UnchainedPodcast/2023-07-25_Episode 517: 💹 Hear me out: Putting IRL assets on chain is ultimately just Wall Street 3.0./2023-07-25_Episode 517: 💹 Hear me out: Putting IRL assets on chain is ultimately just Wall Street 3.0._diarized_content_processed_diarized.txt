Like the more use cases and the more sort of end users in one place, the better and the more things are just going to happen and the more connections get made and products evolve and the assets evolve as well. So I think increasing the diversity of end users is only going to be a good thing, right? Because they'll stick around and do something different and they'll use another product and they'll put money somewhere else and they'll reinvest something and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it all compounds. And so the long term outcome is just going to be like, I think of like 15 years and I'm really bad this because I used to think we'd have all the real world assets on chain. Now I'd be totally wrong, but I think in like 15 years it'll just be like, oh, every.
