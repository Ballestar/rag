00:01:19.100 - 00:01:25.346, Speaker A: My guest today from Berlin is Luis Quinte, the CEO at Aragon One. Welcome, Luis.
00:01:25.458 - 00:01:26.950, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:01:27.100 - 00:01:29.670, Speaker A: What problem are you trying to solve with Aragon?
00:01:30.010 - 00:02:06.914, Speaker C: The thing that we are trying to solve with Aragon is that human governance is very broken, both at the micro level, like the way we interact with each other and the way we organize. It's very hard for someone in the world that is Argentina to organize with someone from Iran, for example, because of multiple regulations that make it almost impossible. But also the macro level, like governance, is broken. And democracy is, I would say, in the last stages of growth. And we need to come up with new systems that are better for human coordination, as we have seen also in the west, with Donald Trump winning the US. Elections and stuff like that.
00:02:07.112 - 00:02:11.858, Speaker A: Yeah, well, actually so what makes you say that democracy is in the last stages of growth?
00:02:12.034 - 00:02:51.902, Speaker C: Well, I think if you look at technological revolutions, they have this period sometime in which they have early adopters, and then they grow, and then they have this kind of productivity plateau in which they just kind of stabilize over time. And that means that we have taken the most out of them, and now there is time for a new thing to come up. And I think we have taken out the most of democracy already, at least in the west. And now new models have to come that are better for human coordination. And maybe even they come in new forms. Maybe they come in the form of smaller communities that coordinate between them instead of having these huge monoliths that we consider nation states today, there are, like hundreds of millions of people. So I think it's time to experiment with new models.
00:02:52.046 - 00:02:55.234, Speaker A: And so what does ideal governance look like to you?
00:02:55.432 - 00:03:38.338, Speaker C: Well, I think that's a very hard question because that depends so much on the actual governance model that we are looking at and the problem that we're trying to solve. I think in terms of nation states, it's very hard to empathize with millions of people. And I think that's the number one problem in society today. We cannot empathize with another citizen because there are like 100 million citizens in a country and they are so different from one another. And so I think if we can start dividing that into smaller units that obey Danvers number, which is the number of people your brain can empathize with, I think we may have better communities rather than having these monolith nation states in which everyone starts fighting each other.
00:03:38.424 - 00:03:41.460, Speaker A: But what is Dunbar's Number? Isn't that a really low number?
00:03:42.230 - 00:03:43.874, Speaker C: 150. Yeah.
00:03:44.072 - 00:03:48.258, Speaker A: So the world should be governed in little communities of 150 people.
00:03:48.424 - 00:04:16.894, Speaker C: That's something that I really wanted to experiment with. I would love to try that out. Try if having these smaller communities also improves meaning in life, because I think we have a crisis of meaning right now. So, like my generation, for example, there are literally social apps in Finland and the north of Europe to connect teenagers because they feel isolated. And that's so crazy to me today, with Instagram and Facebook and all of these things, we feel more and more alone than any other time in life.
00:04:17.012 - 00:04:19.598, Speaker A: And your generation meaning like, how old are you?
00:04:19.684 - 00:04:21.280, Speaker C: I'm 23 right now.
00:04:21.890 - 00:04:26.978, Speaker A: And actually, why don't you tell a little bit about your story? How did you get into the blockchain space?
00:04:27.144 - 00:05:06.910, Speaker C: For sure. So I got into software when I was twelve years old because of Linux and Free Software. And it was kind of mind blowing to me because I come from a humble family and the fact that you could basically get a computer and just start creating stuff and there was no limit, there was no need to go to a store and buy anything at all. It was all for free and open. That was mind blowing for me. And also that kind of post capitalistic sort of idea that people were working for free on the Internet and they were creating free software for other people to use it without any expectation of profit. I didn't understand the reasoning behind it, and I'm not sure I understand it yet, but it was so mind blowing for me.
00:05:06.910 - 00:05:35.106, Speaker C: And then I saw Bitcoin in 2009 when the white paper came out and I thought it was a scam. I thought like, this is technically impossible. I didn't really even read the white paper. And then in 2011, I read the white paper and I was mind blown. It was around the financial crisis that hit the Spain very bad where I'm from, and also hit my family very bad. And when I read the whole white paper at the end, I was like, oh, my God, this is going to change the power dynamics of the world so much, and I really want to be involved.
00:05:35.298 - 00:05:43.446, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. All right. And then I guess why don't you briefly fill us in and how you came from that point to launching Aragon.
00:05:43.638 - 00:06:23.094, Speaker C: Yeah, so in 2013 or 14, I really got involved more and more into the bitcoin space. I was doing some small projects here and there, but then I wanted to do a bitcoin exchange with a couple of partners I had back in the day. And that didn't work out because of, like, we couldn't basically raise money for it. And then in 2014, we came up with Stampery, which is Blockchain Timestamping, basically. I think it's one of the main platforms that are doing that now, although it took a long time for it to gain any sort of traction. So we launched that startup to allow people to timestamp. We had the dream of eliminating, notary publics using the blockchain, which was a pretty obvious use case.
00:06:23.094 - 00:06:48.782, Speaker C: Right. But then these things take a lot of time. And then in 2016, I went out of the Blockchain Space for, like, a few months to pursue something with my now co founder Jorge, which we met when we were, like, 16. And what's his last name? Jorge Guardo. Yeah, we met when we were, like 15 or 16 in Spain via Twitter. And we were both like, young hackers. And then we started working on multiple things.
00:06:48.782 - 00:07:11.270, Speaker C: And then in 2016, I asked him to join. Crazy idea I had related to patents and basically eliminating the patent system. And then at some point, we moved to the US. We did the whole Silicon Valley thing. And at some point we realized that the underlying issue wasn't really the patent system in the US. For example. It was politicians and the power dynamics that just don't want to change it.
00:07:11.270 - 00:07:28.486, Speaker C: You just want to keep the patent trolling and these big companies to own these patents so they can have huge mobiles. And so at some point, we figured out the underlying issue was governance of the country and of the law system and not patent like themselves. So we came up with Aragon.
00:07:28.678 - 00:07:32.910, Speaker A: Yeah, well, also, I don't know. Do you remember that I interviewed you once about Stanford?
00:07:33.410 - 00:07:34.394, Speaker C: Seriously?
00:07:34.522 - 00:07:35.214, Speaker A: I did.
00:07:35.332 - 00:07:35.902, Speaker C: Wow.
00:07:36.036 - 00:07:47.346, Speaker A: Yeah, but the very first question I asked you was how you prevent lies or falsehoods from getting on the blockchain? And I'm just going to tell you straight, you didn't have a good answer for it.
00:07:47.368 - 00:07:53.570, Speaker C: So I was like, I still don't I think what? I still don't have a good answer for other things. Right.
00:07:53.640 - 00:08:13.638, Speaker A: And you were saying you wanted to be a notary system, so I was like, okay, this is so far away from being that. But anyway, all right, so before we get into Argon, why don't we just define a few things? Because there's the Aragon Network. There is Aragon Association. There's Aragon One. So why don't you just high level overview describe the whole setup exactly.
00:08:13.724 - 00:09:01.346, Speaker C: Yeah. So Argon itself is the project and the movement that has the mission to create decentralized organizations for the world and to basically allow the people to experiment with governance at the speed of software. And so for that, we have the Argon network, we have the Argon Association and a few other entities. And so we have this multi team model in which instead of having one team that grows to like a thousand people, we want to decentralize also development. And so we have this model in which the holders of a token, that is the Argon network token can vote proposals to basically govern the whole project. And so one of the proposals or one of the ways that they can do that is to choose the development teams that are going to carry development. And so Aragon One is a team I lead and that's the foundational team working on Aragon's development.
00:09:01.346 - 00:09:35.810, Speaker C: But there is also Aragon, Black, Otarg and there are many other small Aragon teams that are working on the ecosystem. Then there is the Aragon network. And the Aragon network is like the broad sort of Dao that governs the project itself. And it also wants to provide services to other DAOs. So, for example, one of them is the Argon Court. We want to create a dispute or solution system for DAOs. So they can use Dry code, which is smart contracts, but they can also use wet code, which is basically human written agreements that we are very used to in the traditional world, let's say.
00:09:35.810 - 00:09:52.966, Speaker C: So we can combine the best of both worlds. So that's a little bit of an overview. Then we have also, like a grants program called Aragon Nest that has been giving out grants for multiple things. We were the first ones to give grants for Ethereum 2.0 development. But that's a little bit of an overview of the ecosystem.
00:09:53.158 - 00:10:19.140, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And early on, when you talked about Aragon One for listeners who know kind of how Ethereum development happened, there was a period early on where there was the Ethereum Foundation and then East Dev was the company that was formed to do the development for the network. All right, so then why don't we just start with what it is and what people can do if they want to use this system.
00:10:19.750 - 00:10:56.330, Speaker C: Yeah. So right now we have the Argon client, which is this app that allows you to create decentralized organizations. And so you can do multiple things. You can, for example, create a membership kind of organization in which you can literally just list members and manage funds, for example. That's a very easy use case that people are doing in Theorem community with other kind of dows like Molok comes to mind and stuff like that, right. In which you have a group of friends and then they put funds in and then they mass funds. That's a very easy use case but then you also have use cases that are I think a little more ambitious, that are more like open Dows in which anyone can join.
00:10:56.410 - 00:11:03.002, Speaker A: Well wait actually. But to go back to the membership one, is that like a centralized type of entity using the Aragon network?
00:11:03.146 - 00:11:17.806, Speaker C: Well it will be like a decentralized kind of entity that you create on Aragon and then it's basically like a permission entity in the sense that people have to vote for new members to come in. But that will be something that will live on the ethereum blockchain will be fully decentralized.
00:11:17.998 - 00:11:18.886, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
00:11:18.988 - 00:11:58.994, Speaker C: Yeah. And then there is use cases that are more in terms of open Dows and so one of them that we are super excited about is fundraising. So there was this model proposed by Vitali called Daicos and this model proposed by Luke from our team, also called Apri. And so what we're doing here is we're basically creating a Dao. That fund raises money and then the token holders can decide to set what's called the Tap rate and so that's the amount of money that flows to development teams to implement this idea for this project. And so the cool thing there is that basically you are inverting the power structure. So token holders are the ones that control the project and the money flows and not the other way around.
00:11:58.994 - 00:12:12.950, Speaker C: So basically I think with that you can have fundraisers that are like 2017 scale, like very big fundraisers but with accountability and transparency that we didn't see in 2017. So that's one model that I'm super, super excited about.
00:12:13.020 - 00:12:14.360, Speaker A: And did that pass?
00:12:14.970 - 00:12:17.398, Speaker C: Well, that's going to be launching like a couple of weeks from now.
00:12:17.484 - 00:12:21.082, Speaker A: Oh, okay. Yeah. Because he's blogged about that for quite a while, I think.
00:12:21.136 - 00:12:21.786, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:21.968 - 00:12:22.700, Speaker A: Okay.
00:12:23.790 - 00:12:56.254, Speaker C: In the Dao space there's always like it takes some time to actually implement things because everyone is so afraid of consequences. Right. So when the Dow happened and the fork happened and all of that, it took years until someone literally said we're going to implement DAOs again because there is those things that people are really fearful about and I think fundraising is the thing that people are very fearful about as well. Right. Because we have a lot of legal implications and the SEC and all of these things. Right. But that shouldn't impede us for innovating.
00:12:56.254 - 00:13:03.974, Speaker C: That's why we're here. Right. I'm personally not here to see that there are SEC compliant ICOs happening. I don't really care about that.
00:13:04.092 - 00:13:04.982, Speaker A: Oh really?
00:13:05.116 - 00:13:12.598, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I didn't get into the space to basically facilitate the life for the nation estate. I go into the state so we can replace the nation estate.
00:13:12.774 - 00:13:32.670, Speaker A: Okay, well so to tie all that together, I did want to ask you about this fact that you're trying to build a Dow because given the history with the Dao that might seem kind of bold to some people because that was a huge failure. So why did you decide to build a Dao and a platform for DAOs?
00:13:33.090 - 00:14:04.406, Speaker C: Well, when we looked at the Dao, it was interesting because you look at it and the idea itself was really great. Then the problem was implementation. Right, but it's one of these cases where it was very unfortunate that it was called the Dao because then the whole Dao concept just got basically screwed over for years. But if you look at it like the concept itself is a brilliant concept. The problem was implementation. And so if you're rational, you think, let's just make an implementation that works. Right? And we invested a lot of money and time into making sure that this gets audited.
00:14:04.406 - 00:14:13.660, Speaker C: And I think we've been live for like a year and some months with no bags found or critical ones at least. So super happy about that.
00:14:14.270 - 00:14:28.610, Speaker A: All right, so why don't we just talk about the platform? So you kind of actually walked through us a little bit. So if I have a simple Dow, like a membership thing, I can do that. So then actually talk about some of the other features that people can implement.
00:14:29.190 - 00:14:55.900, Speaker C: Yeah, so there is a system with multiple apps that you can install and uninstall. You can think about it. Lego bricks. Basically, you can build very basic, very complex structures, just like putting together these bricks that are very generic. And so by default, there is like a finance app which allows you to manage finances. And then you can send the URL to anyone for them to check the finances in a transparent way. There's a boarding app that allows you to vote on stuff.
00:14:55.900 - 00:15:41.414, Speaker C: There's Token Manager app that allows you to manage token balances mint tokens for new people, slash them as well. So you can do all of those things. And then there are more apps that are kind of not by default, but that are super important as well. So, for example, there is this suite of apps for Aragon called Open Enterprise that allows people to manage more open organizations. And so, for example, you can have something like Gitcoin where you find bounties and people can come and claim those bounties directly on Aragon. On the Aragon Dao, you can have a dot boarding app which is like another kind of mechanism for boarding. You can have an allocations app that allows you to have multiple kind of bank accounts inside the Dow that are controlled in different ways and with different permissions of who can withdraw money.
00:15:41.414 - 00:16:19.030, Speaker C: So you can do all of these things that are very composable. I think right now we are starting to see that Hub will actually use it for something. Because when you create a platform, like at the end, argon is like a platform for these apps to be built. And then with these apps you create new organizational structures. But I think the interesting point is when you start having a critical mass in which you can plug these components in different ways to create new models, and that's where composability gets seen. And I think that's something that worked out very well for Ethereum, and now we're starting to see that for Aragon, although it takes a little bit to building a platform to see how people use it and compose these things.
00:16:19.180 - 00:16:31.514, Speaker A: And so just to clarify something, because when I was browsing the materials about Aragon, for some reason, I got under the conception that companies could use it, and obviously companies are centralized. So is that true or not true?
00:16:31.632 - 00:17:07.598, Speaker C: Well, you can definitely implement a centralized, hierarchical company on Aragon, like, for example, Aragon one, we use Aragon, but we are like a Swiss company, and we use it for finances. We use it for basically managing finances and boarding. So you can definitely do that. I think the issue there is the legal part of it. So, for example, in our case, we implemented this functionality in the finance app. So you can export a CSV because our accountants really wanted to. And I think if you want to do simple stuff like that, you may use Aragon.
00:17:07.598 - 00:17:43.614, Speaker C: But if you want to do something more complex, you may want to use some kind of, like, legal wrapper. So there is this project called OpenLaw, and they build this very cool integration with Aragon and Wyoming LLCs. So they have this online wizard in which you can create an LLC, and it automatically creates an Aragon Dao, and it links both. So you have legal agreements that literally say, know, membership is going to be defined and shares are going to be defined by this token app on Aragon. So when you create a new token on Aragon, it automatically basically is a legally valid way of saying that's a new share on the Wyoming LLC. So that's a very cool use case as well.
00:17:43.652 - 00:17:44.980, Speaker A: How did that come about?
00:17:45.750 - 00:17:55.506, Speaker C: It was a few months ago, a community member called Ross from OpenLaw, and he just made it happen. I think they're looking to expand to New York LLCs as well.
00:17:55.608 - 00:17:56.178, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:17:56.264 - 00:17:57.266, Speaker C: Yeah, it's very cool.
00:17:57.368 - 00:18:19.978, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I know Caitlin Long was really instrumental in getting a lot of blockchain friendly laws passed in Wyoming, so I wondered if she was part of that. But actually, something else I wanted to ask about was earlier when you were talking about how they're composable and you can make different kinds of organizations, so how are people using them, and are you seeing any innovative uses that you hadn't really thought of before?
00:18:20.144 - 00:18:54.834, Speaker C: Well, it was funny. So way before we came up with Aragon fundraising and implementing this fundraising mechanism on Aragon, we saw a dao that was basically they were like a very small, smart contract that would basically use the finance app on Aragon. And the tokens app on Aragon so that if there was a new deposit to the finance app they would mint a new token for that member. So effectively fundraising before we implemented fundraising. And that was really funny to see. It's actually a very cool project and one of my, I think, favorite use cases. Most of their developers are based in Iran.
00:18:54.834 - 00:19:07.354, Speaker C: So of course, if you're based there, you're automatically discriminated in the whole world. Right. So I think Argon was one of the only ways that they could have fundraised to build their software and their project.
00:19:07.552 - 00:19:28.446, Speaker A: Wow. This is actually a perfect segue to my next question, because I was wondering, so obviously we've got the normal traditional legal jurisdictions all around the world. So how did those laws fit with or not fit with these entities that you're creating on Aragon?
00:19:28.638 - 00:19:36.100, Speaker C: Well, it's the intersection between dry code and wet code, which is what Nick Sabo used to do all these things.
00:19:36.550 - 00:19:43.782, Speaker A: And just clarified that for people. So wet code is like human courts of law and then dry code is like code.
00:19:43.916 - 00:20:23.822, Speaker C: Exactly. Computer code. Yeah. Smart contracts. And that's super interesting because, for example, when I think about declaring taxes right, so you want to declare your taxes, you see your crypto portfolio, but then how do you declare a CDP? How do you declare an NFT? How do you declare an asset that may be even illiquid in the market? It's just kind of so hard because the system of smart contracts are touring complete. And the way that the law works is that they try to cover every edge case with regulation. The issue is that you cannot cover a touring complete set of options with regulation because that's infinite.
00:20:23.822 - 00:21:08.930, Speaker C: Every line of code may be totally different and doing a totally different thing. So it's intrinsically impossible to make this two system work. That's my sort of idea that I have built over the course of the past years. I think you can implement something like these legal wrappers. So you open a Wyoming LLC and then you have shares on your Aragon corporation and the finances. But if you want to install a new app on Aragon that is totally different, for example, this fundraising app or use like a bonding core for one of these more billionaires technologies, how do you translate that to the legal system? Is totally, I think, out of the reach of the legal system. So I think if we want to exploit 100% of the potential of decentralized organizations, we have to forget about the old and we just have to build the new.
00:21:09.080 - 00:21:19.318, Speaker A: Well, so then if someone's creating a Dow on Aragon and the different people that are using it are in different jurisdictions, then does that create problems for one or the other of them?
00:21:19.484 - 00:22:03.774, Speaker C: That is a great question. Well, I think the way you can look at it and we've been looking at some of these jurisdictions, some of them may treat the Dow as a general partnership, some maybe don't. And the issue there, I mean, one of the issues with how legality works these days is that it's not built for the Internet. It's not built for a world where you can join a dao and just be part of it. Right? And there are a lot of interesting questions that arise. So, for example, if you're a passive stakeholder of a dao, let's say you are a token holder of MakerDAO and MakerDAO does something that is illegal in one jurisdiction, which I mean, it's not that hard. There are jurisdictions in which many things are illegal.
00:22:03.774 - 00:22:35.806, Speaker C: For example, think about jurisdictions like Thailand or even Spain where you just cannot insult the monarchy, right? So imagine that there is the Aragorn Network dao, which has the ability to do proclamations. So to say, as a dao, I proclamate something on behalf of my members and this dao insults the monarchy in one of these places. Are you liable now for that? It's a very hard question and I think I don't have the answer. I just think we should be brave and try to experiment with it.
00:22:35.988 - 00:23:46.130, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, on a related note and this might seem unrelated, but I think it is similar, I literally just yesterday read this article where there was some astronaut who basically did something in space. I guess she was going through a divorce and she accessed the bank account of her wife who she was separating from. And the wife was claiming that it was like a criminal act and she was claiming that they had these shared financial accounts to manage the finances for their son anyway, but the article was saying there are no laws around. If she's in space at the time, then how do you manage that? So I agree that obviously now with Blockchains also there is this whole new territory that opens up and it's not clear how these things will be managed. But actually yet another perfect segue because I was going to ask you about disputes as well and you have this whole dispute system managed by the Aragon Court. So what is that and when do people use that function and how does it work?
00:23:46.280 - 00:24:50.582, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So I think one of the most exciting parts of a decentralized organization is that you may be able to just completely create new jurisdictions on the internet, but the problem with the smart contracts is that they are very limited. So you can encode a very small part of the world because of the mid space, because there are a lot of human subtleties. You may be able to describe a lot of things with computer code, but you cannot, for example, say, Ethereum should know about my tablet or about my computer and when I leave a company, it should know that I need to return that right to my employer. And so the idea with the our own court is that you can also add this human written language or human written code or basically like a contract to a smart contract. So in that way, you have the best of both worlds. And the problem there, when we thought about it, was like, right, this is amazing for disputer solution, this is amazing for basically creating or adding a lot of capabilities to decentralized organizations that they didn't have before.
00:24:50.582 - 00:25:24.514, Speaker C: But the issue is that courts are hard to run. And I mean, it's not that easy to create literally like court. You have to create a system of law around it. Right? And so when we thought about it, we saw that courts are traditionally very expensive. They are very slow. Like, we have cases, I have seen cases where there are claims against huge corporations and the case is very clear, but these corporations have so much money that they are able to extend it for years or decades and then settle. And that's it.
00:25:24.514 - 00:26:06.014, Speaker C: Right? And so I believe if we can incentivize fairness by creating a global jurisdiction, which basically has a court, I think the court is a core component. It's the one that makes sure that you incentivize fairness or you incentivize people to follow the system of law. We can empower Dows much more. And so the idea here is with the court is basically you can create a dispute, you can access this pool of Euros that are incentivized to actually behave because of cryptocurrency incentives. And then the cool thing is that over time, you're going to build jurisprudence that is global. It's not like linked to any local jurisdictions. So you may be able to study this one system of law and then basically use it anywhere in the world as a global way.
00:26:06.212 - 00:26:12.142, Speaker A: And who are the jurors? Like, how are they chosen? Are they just people who hold the Aragon network? Token?
00:26:12.286 - 00:27:00.900, Speaker C: Yeah, so euros need to stake a t in order to become participants of this network. And so Euros, like anyone, can be a Euro, basically, which I think is very cool, and then they are chosen randomly. So, for example, in the first round when you open a dispute, you may be assigned €5 randomly and then if you don't agree with the result, you can basically raise it to the next level and then maybe like 21 and then more until you raise the dispute to the whole network and all the users can participate. And so that makes it very hard for anyone to try to game the system, because at the end, you're just going to make it very expensive to basically make it so expensive that they will have to buy the entire network or like 51% of the whole Aragon network for them to win a case.
00:27:02.630 - 00:27:11.270, Speaker A: You keep talking about how the normal legal system is expensive. So how do you guys pay for your court?
00:27:11.690 - 00:27:16.978, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's like a flat subscription fee that organizations. Pay and then there's like a dispute fee.
00:27:17.154 - 00:27:21.122, Speaker A: Wait, and do they pay the fee only when they have a dispute going or forever?
00:27:21.266 - 00:27:54.402, Speaker C: Well, we're thinking about it still. I think that there's going to be like a very small kind of flat fee, like yearly flat fee kind of thing, and then just like per dispute because I think it makes sense to have it per dispute. So you only pay when you really use it. Right. But on the other hand, you also need to keep the euros being paid in some way because what you want to like these systems, the thing that you want them to use for is you want to have them there. So if you need it, you can use them, but hopefully you incentivize everyone to not use them. Right? And so you need to even pay euros for doing nothing because they are just there.
00:27:54.402 - 00:28:10.358, Speaker C: So you don't need to use them. I mean, you need to use them right at some point in time, but idea that you don't, right? It's just like everyone sees that they are going to lose money by opening a dispute and no one does that's like the sort of incentive structure that makes sense.
00:28:10.524 - 00:28:17.642, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss more about governance in the Aragon network. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:29:38.730 - 00:30:27.246, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean. And that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

00:30:34.108 - 00:30:40.760, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Luis of Aragon. So the court system also has appeals. How do appeals work?
00:30:41.230 - 00:30:52.570, Speaker C: Yeah, so appeals is a system where you don't agree with the result of the case and you basically raise to the next round. And so it just basically grows the amount of euros that are involved until it's a whole network.
00:30:53.630 - 00:31:03.790, Speaker A: But I think if one side appeals and then you have to put up a stake for that or something and then the other side doesn't, then the side that puts up the money automatically wins. Right.
00:31:03.860 - 00:31:56.642, Speaker C: They have to basically stake more and more over time. The cool thing about this though, is that because I'm very worried about this world where people who don't have resources cannot appeal and so they basically lose the case. Right. The good thing about programmatically creating these cases is that you can fundraise for them. And so let's say there's a very clear case like David versus Goliath kind of case, right? So what David can do to win the case against Goliath is he can say, all right, I'm going to create this Dao and this Dao is going to fundraise for all the proceeds for my case and then I'm going to basically split the profits with all the participants that invest in this fundraiser. And so the evidence is public, anyone can just see it. And then if people believe in it, they are not only incentivized to make it fair, but also incentivized from an economic point of view to invest in this case.
00:31:56.642 - 00:32:01.250, Speaker C: So David ends up winning the case and then the split proceeds.
00:32:01.990 - 00:32:18.978, Speaker A: Very interesting. So let's also now talk about the Token because Aragon actually was first built without a token. So let's talk about what the Ant Token does within the system and how you justify its existence. If the Aragon network actually existed before without the token.
00:32:19.074 - 00:33:18.214, Speaker C: Yeah, well, so the history was like the following. Basically, we created Aragon and then at some point we were thinking, all right, if decentralized organizations are mainstream, what comes next? Like, what are the services that we'll need? And so we identified this very important service that was Accord. And I think that's actually very useful for Dows for one simple reason and it's 51% attacks. Like, we are seeing that with open Dows there is this very, very easy attack that is basically you can say, I want to propose to withdraw all the money from this Dow to this new Dow that is made out of just 51% of the participants of this original Dow. Right. And then all these participants are incentivized to vote yes to take the money out and the other like 49% that may be like passive stakeholders, they basically get screwed over and they cannot do anything at all. And so if you have this system of this solution, you can say all right, these are the things that are not allowed in this Dow.
00:33:18.214 - 00:33:55.334, Speaker C: And so one of them is 51% attacks. And so when someone opens a boat, anyone can dispute it and can basically stop that from happening. And so I think that's the very very first service that will make Dows mainstream or help make them mainstream because otherwise 51% of DAX could stop this trend for open Dows. But there are also other things that may be useful for Dows in the long term. So we are thinking about building our own layer, one protocol, our own blockchain as well very optimized for the use case of Dows. And so the idea or how we are thinking about it is ant is useful for two things. One of them is pure governance over the project.
00:33:55.334 - 00:34:29.220, Speaker C: So like Ant holders right now have basically all the governance over the project. They can choose what the development teams, they can choose proclamations they can claim. For example, there is like the fight for Freedom Day, February 10, which is the day that the Argo network Dow proclaimed as the sort of like yearly vacation for the network. They can do all of these things and also they will be able to basically exchange a T in this bonding curve for other tokens that are like the Jurors token, maybe the Argon chain token, all of these things, right? But a T is like a pure governance token basically.
00:34:29.830 - 00:34:39.350, Speaker A: And you mentioned that you guys might try to build your own blockchain and you're currently on Ethereum. Why would you switch what is not optimal about Ethereum for Argon?
00:34:39.690 - 00:35:28.918, Speaker C: Well, things in Ethereum are great in terms of composability, the problem with Ethereum right now is of course, like in terms of the roadmap, I would say it's not very appealing. The E 2.0 roadmap I think three years from now it's really a lot of time and so we are real worried about the scalability. So for example, in 2017 there was the whole ICO Craziness and so you have one ICO and that one ICO will basically stop the network from bureau operational. Now with Argon fundraising we are going to see that maybe multiplied by one order of magnitude more because you can open a fundraise with like two clicks, have this Dow fundraise money and it's all on chain because it's a bonding curve. So basically all transactions happen on chain. So they are even more expensive than the ICO Craze back in 2017.
00:35:28.918 - 00:36:17.966, Speaker C: And so if that happens, we could have serious scalability issues. And the problem there is that there are two ways to do it. One of them is to optimize the whole network or the other one is to just optimize another network that you tailor for that specific use case. And so for example, you may make cheap or basically free to run operations that are important for DAOs. So one of them that is very important for us is permission checking. So does this holder have permission to withdraw finances from the Dao? And if they don't, what is the best route that they could do it? Maybe they have tokens, maybe they can open a boarding so they can withdraw money from the dao. All of these primitives that we have in our smart contract framework called Aragon OS, they could have way cheaper prices if we had our own chain.
00:36:17.966 - 00:36:40.362, Speaker C: Then the problem there is Composability. So ideally you have all of these protocols on Ethereum, right? And then you are able to access them from these other chains. Like a Dao can still open a CDP, ado can still own Dai. But that's kind of the rationale that you can build these chains that are very optimized for certain things and then they connect back to Ethereum for how network effects or Composability or security even.
00:36:40.416 - 00:36:40.922, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:36:41.056 - 00:36:50.030, Speaker C: Yeah, Ethereum is like the most secure smart contract network and there is I think, no doubt that it's going to have the maximum security compared to other application specific chains.
00:36:50.930 - 00:36:57.650, Speaker A: Just to go back earlier in that description you were saying token bonding curve. Can you describe what that is for people?
00:36:57.800 - 00:37:54.402, Speaker C: Yeah. So if anyone is familiar with stuff like Uniswap, it's a very similar concept. It's basically a way in which you can exchange two tokens in a fully decentralized way. And the good thing about the bonding curve is that you can basically define the demand and supply sites so you can sort of architect the price that it's going to take. So if there is more demand it might go up more and you can also basically have reserves attached to this bonding curve. So let's say for example in Aragon fundraising, like when you buy tokens into the curve, what you are doing is you are for example, sending Dai or Ether or something into this curve and then this curve is minting new tokens for you in this Dow that is fundraising. And so what happens in the other way around is you sell these tokens and then you get part of these reserves out in Ether or die or whatever the reserve ratio is defined in.
00:37:54.402 - 00:38:11.414, Speaker C: And so that's how bonding curve works. And it's very exciting because you can basically, in the case of Aragon fundraising, get rid of centralized changes. You don't need to be listed in Binance or Coinvest or anything like that. You can just have this bonding curve and then in a decentralized way anyone can change it.
00:38:11.612 - 00:38:29.600, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, it's really cool. It's like having a market that's just determined by the software. Exactly something. So then the other thing I want to ask about was you kept saying that basically you can build a blockchain so that certain functions are cheaper. But why can't you do that via the smart contract? Do you know what I'm saying?
00:38:31.650 - 00:39:18.446, Speaker C: Yeah, well, smart contract. So in Ethereum, for example, everything is very generic and then you have some functionalities that they are built to be faster. So the way they do that is via opcodes or pre compiles, which basically means that the client understands certain code and instead of running it in the virtual machine, it just runs it in a much more efficient way directly, almost like native way. Right. Instead of this virtual machine. And the whole thesis around polkadot cosmos love these protocols is that you may be able to architect your whole chain using these things so everything is faster and cheaper instead of running like super generic virtual machines. Of course, I think the concept of a virtual machine is amazing because with Ethereum you can code anything.
00:39:18.446 - 00:39:49.080, Speaker C: Like you are not constrained to what the pre compiles or what the opcodes say. You can build anything. And that's the main difference with Bitcoin, right? And what made it attractive. But on the other hand, I think having the power for the whole Argon community to also basically govern what goes into a pre compile, what goes into an opcode, what is optimized, what is even not optimized. Maybe there are things that we don't want to optimize for that we want to make them slower so like wins and device less usage of that. So I think that's a very cool concept, like reclaiming sovereignty from layer one, basically.
00:39:49.450 - 00:40:09.806, Speaker A: Oh, now I'm under. So that's why there have been all these votes around whether or not to either invest in polkadot or build on polkadot. It's because if you do that, if you build on polkadot, then you could have a parachain that is oh, now I see where it's kind of customized for the needs of and then and.
00:40:09.828 - 00:40:45.226, Speaker C: Then DAOs can choose. Right? Maybe if you are building a dow that is all about interacting with compound and diet and all of these protocols, maybe there is still a case for Ethereum and you want to have super high security. It's going to be super expensive to interact with that dow, for sure. But if you want to do that, there is still a huge use case for that. But we also want to enable other use cases like organizing with my friends. Maybe I want to create that with like ten people or I want to run a fundraising and I want people to be able to put money in without having to pay one dollars per transaction. Then you want to enable that other set of use cases as well.
00:40:45.408 - 00:41:43.100, Speaker A: Okay, I actually want to go back to ask about the jury one more time or the court, because I was noticing so basically when you were describing how the jurors come to their decision, you guys conceded that, okay, jurors might discuss the vote with each other offline. But then you also said that the juror fees are quote distributed proportionally among the jurors that voted for the final ruling option meaning they basically get paid only if they voted for the one that won. But I feel like doesn't that give the jurors a financial incentive to collude? And then also because they have to stake the ant, it seems like they would be incentivized to always vote in favor of what is the best for the value of their own token. But I didn't know if that could sometimes skew the outcomes in a weird way and if you found that desirable or if you even had thought that realized that might happen.
00:41:43.710 - 00:41:51.166, Speaker C: Yeah, well, first on collision the idea is that if that happens you can still kind of raise that to the next level and then the next set.
00:41:51.188 - 00:41:52.734, Speaker A: Of Euros like with the appeal, you mean?
00:41:52.772 - 00:42:28.106, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly, you don't appeal and then the next set of euros may not collude again so it may go back to the original sort of outcome that the case should have had in the first place and then for ant and actually sort of the incentive there. That's an interesting question and there is some research this is not going to be in our version one, it's too complex, but there has been research on basically if the whole network gets corrupted on doing what it's called like a futarchy fork. So basically what will happen there is that if the whole network actually just.
00:42:28.128 - 00:42:30.586, Speaker A: Describe for people what futarchy is yeah, for sure.
00:42:30.608 - 00:43:22.826, Speaker C: So futurkey is this very cool almost governance mechanism but not really in which you basically have two different prediction markets and so basically you predict what is going to be the winning option over a certain metric. So, for example, let's say you are running a country, and so this country, you define that this access metric is the GDP of the country. And then you have like two different presidents. And so you may vote or you may bet on the president that is going to increase the GDP more. And then if the president, if one president wins and then increases the GDP, you get rewarded for betting on that. And then if on the contrary, the GDP goes down, then you get as last or you may just not get rewarded for that outcome. And so there's this final process that is very much in research right now which is that the whole network gets corrupted.
00:43:22.826 - 00:44:15.726, Speaker C: So like ant holders all get corrupted and there's like a 51% attack on the whole network which will be very expensive but could happen. Then you could basically split the network in two and then run a fooder key market on which is going to be the ant price in the future. And so if the network is incentivized to keep running and to keep the court running, you could predict that ENT price will go up if the court case is actually resolved in a rational way right. Instead of being corrupt. And so if you do that, you could basically choose a fork in which ENT is valued more, because that's the one in which people are betting that the outcome was right and ditch the other one. It's like a very sort of like Sci-Fi structure, but it's very interesting. And look, Duncan from our team proposed it a few months ago, and I think it makes a lot of sense.
00:44:15.828 - 00:44:38.194, Speaker A: And wait, so just so I understand, it's sort of like it would be like back when Ethereum classic split from Ethereum, if there were like, markets placed on which one. But then what would happen? Whichever one has the high GDP or whatever, then what? You kill off the other chain? That's not possible. Right?
00:44:38.312 - 00:44:51.638, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, basically what will happen is people just kind of migrate from one to the other. And that's it. You have two different tokens. And then there is one token that accrues value. People bet on it, and the other one loses value and may end up being worthless.
00:44:51.814 - 00:45:17.614, Speaker A: Okay. I don't know. With ideology, some people might be convinced that they were right anyway. But anyway okay. All right. So we've been talking a lot about governance of the DAOs within Aragon, but then let's talk about the governance of Aragon itself, because you have a way of governing Aragon, which is called AGP, which is sort of similar to like an ethereum improvement proposal or a bitcoin improvement proposal. So describe the AGP system.
00:45:17.812 - 00:45:45.494, Speaker C: Yeah. So EEPs are Aragon governance proposals, and they are the ways that you can change Aragon or govern Aragon. And so there is AEP Zero, which is the Argon manifesto. It's like a very broad mission statement about the project, which lists the values that the project has. And then there is AEP One, which is the governance process itself, like how you can submit AEPS and get them passed and approved. And then there are just like AEPS that people are proposing. And so these AEPS may take different shapes.
00:45:45.494 - 00:46:10.734, Speaker C: So one of them is like a finance track AEP, which basically is around finance management and funding different teams and funding initiatives. There is a meta track which changes the process itself, the governance process itself. There's a proclamations track. For example, this fight for Freedom Day that I was talking about that was put in by the network. It was a proclamation. It was the network proclaiming. I want to have a national holiday.
00:46:10.734 - 00:47:03.406, Speaker C: So to so the cool thing about these AEPS is that they get voted by the whole network and then a T holders are free to vote and then whatever happens is executed. So right now, there is a point in Centralization, though, that I have to talk about, which is there is this legal entity in Switzerland called the Aragon Association. And that one right now curates proposals and uses this mechanism, this buzing mechanism as signaling for what to do. But in the end, the IR organization is the one that is executing these things and is curating them as well. And so that's the point of centralization. And the issue why we cannot get away with it right now is because the argument has to curate these proposals so they are not outright illegal. Right? Because right now the Aragon Association is the one that has the funds for taking care of the project and so it has the power over these finances.
00:47:03.406 - 00:47:53.054, Speaker C: And if the Aragon Association just basically send money somewhere that was maybe illegal then I would have been held liable. How we want to change it and fully decentralize the project is actually using the Aragon court. So one of the first use cases that we're going to have for the court is actually ourselves. We are going to transition the money, the finances, the funds for the project into a Dao. And then instead of curating that via the organization, we're just going to have this sort of like, manifesto and then people will be able to propose AEPS and the network like, token holders may actually approve or react them for the ballot. So if the AEPS don't agree or don't really empower or don't really follow the Aragon manifesto, then you can open a dispute and basically they don't go to the vote. So that's how we plan to decentralize the process entirely.
00:47:53.182 - 00:48:37.170, Speaker A: Okay, there's so much to unpack there. But basically so the Aragon Association is sort of like the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland exactly, where essentially it has control of the funds from the crowd sale. But then there are literal people that have signed on as directors where in, you know, you guys do anything out of line with the mission of the association then you can be held personally liable. So now you want to decentralize that into. Did you say it was a smart contract or a Dao? It's a dao. So what I didn't get was this part where people vote and then you disperse the funds based on how they vote. So how does that happen? Because to my mind it would seem like you would need a multi SIG but then there's like people in control of that multi SIG.
00:48:38.230 - 00:48:42.610, Speaker C: Well, we want to decentralize the funds as well. So the Dao will be one having the funds.
00:48:43.430 - 00:48:48.850, Speaker A: Right. But then for the Dao to make a transaction, who initiates that?
00:48:49.000 - 00:49:03.658, Speaker C: And the good thing is that the governors of this Dao would be ind holders. So Nd holders initiate the vote and then if the support threshold is passed and the vote passes, then it automatically gets executed and the money goes out.
00:49:03.744 - 00:49:31.458, Speaker A: Like the smart contract does it exactly. It gets just coded. Okay, so people vote like, let's give Laura 100% of the tokens and that passes. Then it happens. So the smart contract sees, okay, it's passed. Okay, I get it. So then whoever makes the proposal, they're proposing a piece of code where it's like, if such and such, then move the money to Laura's address.
00:49:31.458 - 00:49:32.274, Speaker A: Something like that.
00:49:32.312 - 00:49:55.398, Speaker C: Yeah, it's pretty much like that. Yeah. When you open a Dow these days, and you create, like, a finance proposal, for example, what you are saying is, my intent is to get money from this place to this other place, and I want to get maybe 100 A and T like token and also amount. And then when it's passed, then automatically, like the smart contract, basically executes that intent.
00:49:55.574 - 00:50:21.250, Speaker A: Okay, so this has happened multiple times now in the conversation, but it's very good because you keep answering the question almost before I get there, because my next question was to ask about your ideal governance, which, you remember, I asked you about in the beginning, and I was wondering how Aragon currently falls short. So that seems like one way, but are there any other ways where you feel like know needs to make other changes to get closer to your ideal?
00:50:21.830 - 00:50:42.394, Speaker C: One interesting conversation we're having in the Aragon community right now is around locked voting and rewards for voting. So there was this very interesting AEP that happened, I think, in the last boat or in the previous one, which was about Aragon buying dots on polka dot, which was just because you guys.
00:50:42.432 - 00:50:46.298, Speaker A: Wanted to invest, like, $1.5 million into dots, right?
00:50:46.384 - 00:50:47.738, Speaker C: Yeah, it was something like that. Yeah, exactly.
00:50:47.824 - 00:50:48.460, Speaker A: Okay.
00:50:50.290 - 00:51:10.706, Speaker C: That was a very interesting proposal, because basically it didn't pass at the end. But then there was this proposal called AEP 42, which was about not biggaldian Aragon on polka dot. So there was Amin from, like, Spank Chain, and Molok proposed that one, and that one he was on Unchained in.
00:51:10.728 - 00:51:14.994, Speaker A: Case people missed that episode. You should listen to it. It's very good. Anyway, keep going.
00:51:15.112 - 00:51:49.866, Speaker C: Yeah. So there was AEP 42, which was about Aragon not building on polka dot. And Amin posted this Tweet, like, who can lend me 1 million ant so I can sway the boat? I can vote on my proposal, and I can get it passed. Right. And the issue with Tokens right now is that they are tradable. So, I mean, it's not an issue, right? It's just like a functionality they have, but you can buy them, and if they are useful for governance, you may be able to sway the rest of the boat. And so there's this idea about locked boarding, which is you lock your tokens for maybe a year, and you get a reward for boarding.
00:51:49.866 - 00:52:18.434, Speaker C: So you get more voting power. You lock them for four years, you get even more. You lock them for 100 years, you get even more. And so the idea there is that you want to have people in your community that are really incentivized for the long term of the project. So the more they lock their tokens, the more incentivized they are for the long term outcomes and not the short term ones. So you prevent communities or having communities which are made of pump and dampers basically, which happens a lot in the crypto space. And so that's one interesting conversation you want to surround rewarding votes.
00:52:18.434 - 00:52:39.338, Speaker C: So rewarding people who vote maybe via inflation, but then you have the problem of random voting. So you don't want to incentivize people to just go there and random vote whatever they want to vote. You need to make sure that they read and they understand it. And so maybe a combination of rewards plus locked voting would be an ideal way to actually incentivize people to stay and take decisions in the long term.
00:52:39.434 - 00:52:45.630, Speaker A: And then just so I understand, so for the locked votes, like the longer you lock them then the more weight your vote has.
00:52:45.700 - 00:52:47.054, Speaker C: Oh yeah, okay.
00:52:47.092 - 00:53:11.270, Speaker A: So it's similar to the lockdown that Edgeware was doing where you get more tokens the longer you lock them up. Well, one other thing that I wanted to ask about was so voter participation has so far been low that vote in the spring on whether or not to buy Dots at all, less than 5% of all tokens were used in that vote. So how do you plan to get higher levels of participation?
00:53:11.610 - 00:53:37.138, Speaker C: Well, I think there are multiple ways to achieve that. One of them is user experience. I think right now it just takes money to vote. It's a very long process. And also if there are like ten proposals on the ballot, some of them are very complex and you need to study them. So it takes a lot of time. It literally takes like a full day for an Arm community member to study them and vote accordingly so that could be enhanced way more.
00:53:37.138 - 00:54:19.054, Speaker C: I think also delegative voting will help. So we're planning to implement that so you can delegate your votes to someone else and then they can vote. I think in the future it will be less of a direct democracy and more as like representative. I think that's where the world has been going for the last hundreds of years, right? We have these representative democracies and so I think that's great. But these new systems also allow you to vote directly if you don't want to go through these intermediaries, right? So I think that's great. And also with this liquid democracy you are able to basically delegate and then if the representative is doing something wrong, you can automatically delegate to another one. You don't have to wait for four year terms.
00:54:19.054 - 00:54:46.230, Speaker C: And so I think that's super interesting to increase participation. Turnout, on the other hand, I have to say, I think we are very obsessed with participation and we shouldn't focus on that so much. We should focus on the outcome of the decisions. And so if you look at the Argo network and the outcomes of their decisions. So far, it's been amazing. I'm really amazed by there hasn't been any major decision that has impact the project in a negative way. And so I think the important part is the decision outcome and not the participation rate necessarily.
00:54:47.050 - 00:55:04.650, Speaker A: Well, one thing also is that at this moment, there's not a lot of usage of the network. Like, there are fewer than 700 organizations in Aragon so far, and then there's even less than $1 million in Aragon smart contracts. So what are your plans to get more adoption?
00:55:05.070 - 00:55:25.634, Speaker C: That's a great question. I think that's one of the main problems of this space. We are building technology that is very idealistic, but the issue is how to get actual mainstream users. I think fundraising will really help. It's a use case that I love. Aragon. Fundraising is actually, I think, the best way to fundraise from anywhere in the world and then do it in an accountable and transparent way.
00:55:25.634 - 00:55:55.710, Speaker C: So I think that will really have a lot of adoption in the short term. We're also launching a new version that is going to make it way easier for people to use Aragon in terms of user experience. So I think that will really help as well. I think there is one missing piece which is onboarding, like crypt onboarding and private keys and all of these things. And I'm very excited to see that more and more projects are taking on it, because ideally, you don't need to remember private keys. You don't need to install MetaMask. You just use it like a Web Two app almost.
00:55:55.710 - 00:56:38.790, Speaker C: And so I think that will really help adoption as well, focusing on niche use cases and kind of handholding users. There is something that I'm very excited about, and we have started doing more and more because there is where you see the struggles that people are having. I think that will really help in the medium term. I think in the short term, it's actually very tough to get mainstream adoption. I think even what we are seeing is that people are using Aragon in the crypto scene more than mainstream right now, because the crypto people actually understand way better why they need it. Right? So we had this example of, like, Melon protocol, which launched their token sale time ago, and they built the protocol.
00:56:38.870 - 00:56:39.494, Speaker A: Wait, Mellon?
00:56:39.542 - 00:56:40.134, Speaker C: Yeah, Melon.
00:56:40.182 - 00:56:42.458, Speaker A: Oh, she was on my mono was on my show too.
00:56:42.544 - 00:56:51.242, Speaker C: Nice. Yeah. Yeah, they are great. And so I think as of a few days ago, actually, they transitioned their whole governance to an Aragon dao.
00:56:51.306 - 00:56:51.694, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:56:51.732 - 00:57:05.794, Speaker C: So they have this dao of token holders, and these token holders vote a council, and this council can upgrade the smart contracts. So that's adoption right there. But I think we're going to see mainstream adoption more in the medium long term, and not so much in the short term. I think in the short term, crypto adoption is going to be the most.
00:57:05.832 - 00:57:52.658, Speaker A: Powerful yeah, when I was researching this, I was like, this is getting really futuristic. And I was this this isn't something that people are really using a lot now, but it's really interesting. And I did another episode with Glenn Weil or Glenn Whale and Santiago Siri and some of the ideas were similar. So you kind of mentioned something about this, but I wanted to ask you and this is actually something I'm not certain about, but I did read somewhere that you personally have a large percentage of ant. I could not verify that. I tried to figure that out, but I couldn't. So you can correct me if I'm wrong, but regardless, do you think in general the concept of whales adversely affects governance? And if so, how would you guys try to address that?
00:57:52.824 - 00:58:53.506, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think there is a lot of hate against Plutocracy and I think on one hand that's understandable, but on the other hand, having people who have strong skin in the game is actually very good. I think if you're a busy fan, for example, and you put up a significant amount of your portfolio to just buy a token because you really believe in the future of it, then capital at the end of the day, is like how you stake in these systems, if you will. So if you build that position over time, you of course deserve to govern it in some way. I think the confusion comes in when we talk about common goods versus not common goods. And so I think actually I had an interesting discussion yesterday about this where someone was arguing that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not protocols because protocols are just standards and standards are free. So with Bitcoin Ethereum, you need to buy to be part of it. So I think actually what we are seeing is that what we call protocols are not protocols.
00:58:53.506 - 00:59:32.526, Speaker C: They are networks. And as you see them, they are like a next version or next generation shareholder governance. So in traditional corporate you have shareholders and they govern the whole system. Usually they are very institutionalized and we have companies like Apple, Google, which had a lot of early investors back in the day, which basically kind of had all the growth, all the upside from these networks. And now with Bitcoin Ethereum, we're seeing that more and more retail investors are getting in and they are also profiting from these huge networks that have been built in the early beginning. I think that's the beauty of it. They are much more open, they are much more fluid.
00:59:32.526 - 00:59:57.754, Speaker C: You don't need to be an accredited investor. You don't need to be a VC to access it real quick. Or in the very beginning of the project, if you look at Bitcoin, for example, it wasn't busy firms that got Bitcoin at $1. It was cyberpunks people who were buying drugs. It was like completely different crowd. And I think that's like the way to look at it's like an extended version of shareholder governance, like a next generation shareholder governance and not so much common goods. Although it also has a little bit of a common good.
00:59:57.754 - 01:00:02.220, Speaker C: But I wouldn't look at it that way as of right now, at least.
01:00:02.830 - 01:00:58.238, Speaker A: Yeah, the one comment I have about that is I think there were some wealthy people who got in at a dollar, but I won't name them on the podcast. But anyway, actually so I actually wanted to just ask more directly about that issue with the polka dot vote. And you kind of addressed it with a locked voting, but I didn't know if there was anything else you would so just for people who don't know, and I can't remember if we described on the show, but basically there was this vote should we stay focused on ethereum or should we also develop on polkadot? And as the vote was going along, it seemed like the sentiment was to stay developing on ethereum and then at the very last minute, somebody put in a ton of tokens to sway the vote in the other direction where it would be really impossible in a short amount of time to overcome the tokens they'd put in. So would the locked voting solve that or are there any other solutions you guys are thinking of?
01:00:58.404 - 01:01:39.114, Speaker C: Yeah, to be more specific, the outcome of the boat was like no, but I think it was like 1% more no than yes. And then this whale made it way more kind of no than yes in the end, but it was already no. I think with locked bottom you may be able to solve it, but I don't think it's an issue. Like in this particular case, I was trying to identify who this person was and I couldn't. That's the beauty of it. But I was trying to identify like just going to ethereum scan and seeing what tokens they held and all of that and it was like an OE, like an Aragon OE. This person was in the community for a long time and so I think with Logboarding, actually, maybe even this person has more power.
01:01:39.114 - 01:01:51.626, Speaker C: But they were an OG. I don't know if they bought in the market. I cannot remember. But definitely I think if they have bought this share of their cake, I think they sort of legitimate that they bought.
01:01:51.818 - 01:01:57.850, Speaker A: Okay, so you don't have any other ways to kind of prevent the gaming of the system in this way? Or do you not see it as gaming?
01:01:57.930 - 01:02:41.134, Speaker C: Well, there is one way I don't see it as gaming, to be honest. But there is one way that you can prevent these kind of last minute votes. I think this is last need both right in the last minute, someone basically changing the outcome. And so you can have this mechanism for boarding that's actually also been kind of discussed in the community, which is that if there's a significant change in mansour in the last minutes or hours. Or if there is a significant amount of boats, you can extend the period of time of that boat for like 24 hours or 40 or something like that, and then do that again and again and again until basically if there are no final last minute votes. And then at that point, it's like the final outcome is revealed. So I think stuff like that may help.
01:02:41.134 - 01:02:56.020, Speaker C: Also kind of lock and reveal boating where boats are not transparent by default, but you have to commit it first and then rebuild it at the end. And then all boats are public but use at the end and not real time. I think that will help.
01:02:56.550 - 01:03:07.240, Speaker A: And obviously, you and I were here this week in Berlin for Web Three and Dapcon. So did you guys present anything or what milestones will people be looking at going forward?
01:03:07.690 - 01:03:37.518, Speaker C: Yeah, so my co founder, Jorge presented the Argo Network, and it was so cool because the room was so packed. It was really amazing to see the interest on a court system which like two years ago was Sci-Fi and no one really believed that could be done. Then I had the opening keynote at the Weather Summit. And the Weather Summit this year was very much about DAOs. It was kind of crazy. It was me and then Ryan Schroder presenting some ideas around very interesting DAOs that are coming up. Then there was Dao Panel.
01:03:37.518 - 01:04:19.070, Speaker C: Then it was Yalda from one of the Aragon development teams called otARk presenting their Aragon apps and their suit for Aragon organization. So it was pretty much about DAOs. And I'm super excited because I think we saw this trend coming, but we didn't see the interest so much in the community this past two years or so. I think the stigma on the Dow was still being carried around and I think now we are liberating ourselves from that and we are ready to the Dow 2.0 kind of thing, right? So I'm super, super excited about it. And then we also presented the Aragon design system, which is our take on enhancing consistency across all the Aragon platform and making sure that Aragon app developers can easily design new apps by basically dragging and dropping components.
01:04:19.810 - 01:04:45.670, Speaker A: Yeah, so a couple of things. So I wanted to do this show partially because I know everybody's talking about Dows again. So I was like, okay, this is like a good way to kind of be on trend. But then the other thing was that actually, it's funny that we mentioned the space thing before because Yaldov's idea is about governance in space. What was it? It's like something like it's like a decentralized organization to explore space or something.
01:04:45.740 - 01:04:48.854, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like a decentralized SpaceX, basically.
01:04:49.052 - 01:04:55.590, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So that's funny that that was the theme in this episode. Well, anyway, thanks so much for coming on Unchained.
