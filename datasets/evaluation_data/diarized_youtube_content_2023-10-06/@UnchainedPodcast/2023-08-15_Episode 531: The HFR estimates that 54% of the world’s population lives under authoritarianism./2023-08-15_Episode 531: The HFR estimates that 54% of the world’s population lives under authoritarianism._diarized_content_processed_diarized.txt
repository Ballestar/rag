We are flying luggage, suitcases full of US dollars into our countries because otherwise we wouldn't be able to get the money into our countries. Or if we get it via bank, then the next day the government declares us as a terrorist organization and seize our funds. Oh my gosh. And that's the way how they have to work under these circumstances.

Then you have a tool that enables work against authoritarian leadership's.
