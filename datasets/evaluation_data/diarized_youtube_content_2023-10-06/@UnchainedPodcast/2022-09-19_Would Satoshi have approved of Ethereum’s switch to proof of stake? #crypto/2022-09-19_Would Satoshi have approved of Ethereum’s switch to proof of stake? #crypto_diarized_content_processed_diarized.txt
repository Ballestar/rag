00:00:00.330 - 00:00:35.954, Speaker A: So there is this say I forget who said it. It could have been Anthony Sasano, which is that Bitcoin is the idea and Ethereum is the execution. And one of the things that hall said 13 years ago was that he was looking into ways to make Bitcoin more energy efficient. You're talking about Hal Finney? Yeah, exactly. And it's widely thought that Hal Finney could be Satoshi. And I personally believe that is the most likely candidate. And here we are 13 years later after Hull.
00:00:35.954 - 00:00:48.610, Speaker A: Finney kind of wrote this we now have basically a more secure version of Ethereum, which doesn't consume nearly as much electricity. It consumes roughly 5000 times less than Bitcoin.
