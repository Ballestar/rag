00:00:00.250 - 00:00:29.542, Speaker A: Bear claws are only my second favorite claw. Today, FTX has entered into an agreement to claw back 99% of the value of the assets held at Modulo Capital, the so called Obscure Crypto Fund, aka crypto fund SBF. Funded last year. Modulo Capital was founded in March 2022 by two people, one of whom was romantically involved with SBF. Two of SBF's exes were getting rich off FTX money. Looks like that's what they liked about him. SBF claims to have given Modulo Capital $75 million less than he actually gave him.
00:00:29.542 - 00:00:59.690, Speaker A: His defense? $75 million to SPF is nothing. That's, what, like, two extra weeks in jail? Unfortunately, it does represent 99% of Modulo's total assets, which is like the time Mark Zuckerberg pledged 99% of his wealth to charity. Except in this case, I think Modulo actually is going to have to pay up. Now FTX and Alameda have to give up their claims to Modulo, which seems fine. That's like, send your food back to the chef after you've licked the plate clean. SPF has not immediately responded to requests for comments, but if we know SPF, it should be about 13 seconds.
