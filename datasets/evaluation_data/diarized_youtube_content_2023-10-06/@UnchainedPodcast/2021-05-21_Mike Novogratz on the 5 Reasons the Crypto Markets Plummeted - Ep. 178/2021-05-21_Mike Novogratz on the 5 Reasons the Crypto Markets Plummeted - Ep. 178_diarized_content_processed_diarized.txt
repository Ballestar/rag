00:01:16.870 - 00:01:21.266, Speaker B: Today's guest is Mike Novogretz, CEO of Galaxy Digital. Welcome, Mike.
00:01:21.378 - 00:01:24.040, Speaker D: How are you doing? Laura, it's my third time on your show.
00:01:24.730 - 00:01:26.278, Speaker A: We'll have to have you back.
00:01:26.444 - 00:01:38.042, Speaker B: So we've seen a bloody week in crypto, but as of today, Thursday, which is recording day, there's a noticeable bounce back up. What do you think was the cause of the washout and what do you think the outlook is from here on out?
00:01:38.176 - 00:01:38.858, Speaker D: Great question.
00:01:38.944 - 00:01:42.250, Speaker E: Listen, when you have these big liquidations.
00:01:42.690 - 00:02:27.286, Speaker D: There'S always more than one cause. And so the first thing is, I think you have to recognize people were longer crypto than we all thought. I got calls yesterday from people I've met years ago. What should I do? What should athletes, you know, rappers, crypto fever found its way into lots of pockets. So that's one, two, we had tax day in the US two days ago, and so a lot of people had to sell to pay their taxes. And we also had it was about one year after, like, Paul Jones and that whole group of hedge funds bought crypto. And so they hit their one year long term to short term or short term to long term capital gains mark.
00:02:27.286 - 00:03:05.000, Speaker D: And so I'm sure some of them decided, hey, now it's short term. I made so much money. If you bought bitcoin at 8000 and it was trading at 50, let's lock some in with the lower tax rate. And then you can't deny Elon Musk his comment about ESG kind of hit bitcoin in the remember that book The Hobbit where Smog had that the Dragon had that one vulnerability and the Archer hit the arrow right there. That's a vulnerability and it's not fair. It's a vulnerability in lots of ways. We can get to the ESG question in a little bit, but you add that all together.
00:03:06.010 - 00:03:10.426, Speaker E: Plus my last, we had this kind.
00:03:10.448 - 00:03:35.902, Speaker D: Of craziness going on with really crappy coins that were pumping five X. I mean, I looked at ETH classic. I was short ETH classic, and thank God I was disciplined and covered. And then it went up five times. I was like, thank god I covered. For no reason, these FUD coins were FUD coins kind of crummy coins were just being pumped. That's always a sign of excessive speculation.
00:03:35.902 - 00:03:46.834, Speaker D: What we saw with doge and shiba enu, it's fun if you're involved, I guess, but it's not healthy for the ecosystem, and it's certainly a sign of excess speculation.
00:03:46.882 - 00:03:54.834, Speaker E: And so you put all those things together, the charts crack, and then you take out leverage.
00:03:54.962 - 00:04:05.238, Speaker D: And I think I read 700,000 people got stopped out. $9 billion taken out of their wallets.
00:04:05.414 - 00:04:08.090, Speaker E: And that's mostly retail.
00:04:08.590 - 00:04:34.980, Speaker D: Some hedge funds, of course, stopped out. A lot of friends that are disciplined and sold. Most of the big institutions don't move that fast. They're like, whoa, what just happened? Most of the crypto OGS, they're like, wow, this is just part of being in crypto. It's like, yeah, painful part of being in crypto. But we bounce back pretty quickly, I think, partly because the story doesn't really change. There is a revolution going on.
00:04:34.980 - 00:05:22.930, Speaker D: I see it with the kind of human capital that we're hiring. More and more unbelievably talented people want to work in our industry, and I see it with our competitors doing the same thing. I was talking to our own troops yesterday, and I was like, I remember when the nikki fell 50% in one night, when they had the fukushima earthquake. The earthquake, and then the fukushima reactor, literally the second biggest stock market in the world, fell 50% at night and then bounced. It wasn't like, oh, the stock market's over, right? People dusted off, went back to work, and the industry continued. It's kind of the same thing when we have things like, for a moment, you're like, oh my gosh, what's happening? It was a liquidity, too much leverage. And so if there's a lesson in this, it's for the individual investor.
00:05:22.930 - 00:05:48.950, Speaker D: Bitcoin is an 80 vol instrument. Ethereum is 120 vol instrument. The altcoins have higher ball than that. You don't need leverage. And everyone, especially the younger generation, but everyone wants to get rich quick. Give me four to one leverage, three to one, six to one, and we're dealing with nitroglycerin. That's the kind of volatility.
00:05:48.950 - 00:05:52.240, Speaker D: And so run with less leverage and you'll get stopped out less.
00:05:53.250 - 00:05:53.982, Speaker E: Long answer.
00:05:54.036 - 00:05:54.942, Speaker D: Sorry about that.
00:05:55.076 - 00:06:27.346, Speaker B: No, but you covered multiple questions at once. I'm glad you actually raised the environmental concerns. That was going to be a question of mine. And I just wondered, how much of a problem do you think that they are? Do you think that the industry should try to address them directly in some way. And obviously, Galaxy, you've just launched a new mining operation and you also said you'd be launching new financial services and tools for Bitcoin mining sector. But will any of that address energy issues or is it just financial tools for miners?
00:06:27.458 - 00:06:51.418, Speaker D: So, yeah, let me answer that question really holistically. First, I think let's defend our industry a little bit. We use a lot of electricity. We provide an amazing service, right? Bitcoin itself provides an amazing, valuable service to the world, right, storing wealth, and it should be expensive. It uses a decent amount of green electricity and some less green electricity, just like every other industry.
00:06:51.594 - 00:06:54.866, Speaker E: We're not talking about boycotting Google and.
00:06:54.888 - 00:07:12.982, Speaker D: Banning YouTube because YouTube uses two and a half percent of all global electricity. Think about that. It crushes bitcoin and let's stop watching. YouTube provides an amazing service. I will bow down at the altar of YouTube. It is one of the great innovations in the world. You can learn anything on YouTube, literally anything.
00:07:12.982 - 00:07:58.886, Speaker D: And so you'd be crazy not to think YouTube's a valuable service and it uses a lot of electricity, just like Google and Microsoft and Facebook and all the big tech companies. And all the banks should be looking at reducing their carbon footprint, going carbon neutral by 2040 or 2050, whatever they decide is the appropriate target. Crypto should too. And I think you're going to see a rash of measures from the big crypto players to say, hey, this is how we're going to push our industry towards carbon neutral. And those will be things like carbon sequestration, taking carbon and sinking it into the ground. That can happen with carbon capture, can happen with these big machines that suck carbon out of the air or planting trees. It's complicated though.
00:07:58.886 - 00:08:20.540, Speaker D: Like a tree is not a tree is not a tree. Planting trees in some area actually create more carbon emissions. And so we're working on finding the right experts. I actually know one or two of the world's best people in this space and I think give the industry time, there'll be a response. And I know that because I'm talking to lots of people that are in the space.
00:08:21.710 - 00:08:34.046, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like the more that I see bitcoin people talking about this, the more I keep thinking they may be working on some renewable energy combined initiatives. I mean, we're already seeing it, like with Carusa energy.
00:08:34.228 - 00:08:41.998, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, just a quick note here. The International Energy Agency says, referring to this 2.5% statistic and others about YouTube's.
00:08:42.014 - 00:08:46.034, Speaker C: Energy use, that quote, it is clear these figures are too high.
00:08:46.232 - 00:08:53.826, Speaker A: Although the IEA does not calculate its own number, it does note how energy efficiency and demand are constantly changing.
00:08:54.018 - 00:09:15.710, Speaker B: Ether has also been a big story this year, and despite the bloodletting earlier this week, it's tripled in price since the beginning of the year. And this is even before we get to the london hard fork, which will institute EIP 1559, which will it's largely seen as a change in monetary policy that will make ETH a deflationary asset. How do you expect the rest of the year to go for Ether?
00:09:16.450 - 00:09:18.830, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a great question.
00:09:18.980 - 00:09:46.562, Speaker D: People were like, well, where do you think Ether is going to go? I was like, Dudes, it went from 700 to 4000. That's pretty good. How greedy can everybody get? Listen, Ether has a lot going for it right now, right? It's got this monetary shift which I think is wonderful, but it's got the three big tailwinds of stablecoins being built on Ether, d five being built on Ether and NFTs being built on Ether.
00:09:46.626 - 00:09:49.174, Speaker E: And so I remember when I first.
00:09:49.212 - 00:10:13.666, Speaker D: Met with Joe Lubin in 2015, he was explaining how all this was going to work and I was like, yeah, and he's kind of gotten it right. And we always said, well, Ether's gotta it's got to scale faster. And it hasn't yet, but they're side chains and level twos and people are making all their adjustments. I do think because it's been slow to scale and because other people are.
00:10:13.688 - 00:10:18.434, Speaker E: Creative, it's led to the explosion really.
00:10:18.472 - 00:10:41.506, Speaker D: Of these other ecosystems. Right? The binance smart chain Solana, the Terra Luna system where you have these charismatic entrepreneurs, all three, maybe the three entrepreneurs of the year, building similar ecosystems on far less decentralized, far more efficient blockchains.
00:10:41.618 - 00:10:41.990, Speaker E: Right?
00:10:42.060 - 00:11:29.074, Speaker D: I mean, I don't even know if you can call the binance smart chain a decentralized blockchain. It's a CZ chain. And I don't badmouth that. I think there are unbelievable areas for innovation, right, and people are being brought into the system. I wonder, and you probably have a better insight on this than me, if as these ecosystems grow and we transfer more value and we get more regulated, are regulators going to allow these less decentralized blockchains to be where we transfer all our wealth? Are consumers going to care right now? Consumers don't care because most of the consumers of crypto are gamblers. What do they call them? Djens. Right? Crypto is still mostly a gambling ecosystem.
00:11:29.074 - 00:12:11.106, Speaker D: It will shift over time and you've seen it. Listen, one of the cool things about Luna is this chai payment system. People I think it's 7% 8% now of payments in career being done over this blockchain based payment system. And so again, I'm watching this thing as an investor but also as a sociologist to see how this plays out. Think of like the flow blockchain, dapper, it's pretty tightly controlled, but a blockchain is not a blockchain is not a blockchain. I was going to term afraid of binos blockchain and name only. And again, I know I sound like I'm casting Dispersion.
00:12:11.106 - 00:12:23.420, Speaker D: I'm long a lot of this stuff because like charismatic leaders, good communities, momentum in the stuff, in adoption, I don't know in the long run how that plays out.
00:12:24.430 - 00:12:26.906, Speaker E: We all started in this because it.
00:12:26.928 - 00:12:40.606, Speaker D: Was a decentralized revolution, right? Like literally. And it was a peer to peer decentralized revolution where no one really controlled all the knowledge, all the data. And so we'll see how this plays out.
00:12:40.708 - 00:13:14.940, Speaker B: That was a long tangent, sorry about you. Just again, you covered some other questions that I had because some other thing that that raised for me was whether if SEC Commissioner Hester purse's safe harbor proposal were in place, then it may not matter for some of these chains to start off centralized as long as they got decentralized within some certain time frame. But right now, obviously, we're not operating in that environment, but we're going to discuss a little bit more about the markets and also Galaxy. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:14:29.910 - 00:14:47.730, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Mike Novogratz. So Galaxy has had a ton of news coming out in recent months and I wanted to ask you, why did Galaxy decide to make the industry's first billion dollar acquisition with BitCo? What do you see happening in the industry now that makes bringing custody in house seem necessary?
00:14:47.890 - 00:14:56.502, Speaker D: Yeah, so I guess, you know, I was wrong originally in my instinct that institutional clients would want you to custody elsewhere.
00:14:56.646 - 00:14:56.954, Speaker E: Right.
00:14:56.992 - 00:15:17.906, Speaker D: When you buy bonds at Goldman Sachs, you custody of a bank of New York. You don't keep them at Sachs. And in crypto, I think because of the complexity of the instrument, people wanted a soup to nut solution. So we heard that from a lot of customers. Not every customer, but a lot. And so to some degree, we needed it to fulfill or growing. Though I would have paid a billion dollars for custodian if I didn't think.
00:15:17.928 - 00:15:19.314, Speaker E: There was more to it.
00:15:19.512 - 00:15:50.570, Speaker D: What I really get excited about with BitCo is they have 60 and growing blockchain engineers. And from the time I started in 20, 12 13 till now, I have invested in Blockchains. I've had traded on top of Blockchains. I've been a cheerleader and an unofficial spokesman for Blockchains, but I've never built on Blockchains. And I think building on chain and having that capacity is kind of the next chapter of where this whole industry goes.
00:15:50.720 - 00:15:51.082, Speaker E: Right.
00:15:51.136 - 00:16:01.774, Speaker D: We talk about our asset management business and should it be an on chain asset management business or part of it should be it. We didn't have the technical expertise to make that happen.
00:16:01.972 - 00:16:04.494, Speaker E: And so I think I see this.
00:16:04.532 - 00:16:16.822, Speaker D: Merger as a marriage of West Coast and East Coast, silicon Valley and Wall Street, but it's mostly an acquisition of human capital. Our best assets in the whole industry go up and down the elevator every day. Right.
00:16:16.876 - 00:16:19.494, Speaker E: It's not like we have machines that.
00:16:19.532 - 00:16:27.810, Speaker D: Create harvesters or automobiles. We're a human capital business and that's what we're buying.
00:16:27.970 - 00:16:45.642, Speaker B: Well, so to expound a little bit on that, you did in the same vein tell the block that you think where the industry is going is, quote, it is building on the blockchain. It is DeFi. And you kind of hinted that Galaxy would start doing that. So what are you envisioning when you talk about wanting to build in DFI?
00:16:45.786 - 00:17:05.294, Speaker D: Well, listen, so first of all, we invested a ton of cool DFI projects that's been one of our best businesses because seems everything you bought in the last 18 months is up a whole lot. And we're going to continue to do that. There have been structural impediments of actually using DFI, regulatory mostly.
00:17:05.342 - 00:17:08.354, Speaker E: Right. Think of something as simple as uniswap.
00:17:08.402 - 00:17:54.482, Speaker D: Are you trading against the smart contract? Who's on the other side of the smart contract? Well, if you're a retail customer, there's a zero probability that the feds are going to come busting through your door for having done a trade that might have happened with someone from an evil empire. Right. That someone who wouldn't have been KYC. But if you're a regulated institution, you better be damn sure you have a process in place at least to say, hey, no, I know I'm executing with someone legit. And so we've been spending a lot of time on, as a lot of people have, on cracking that code, right, of having to some degree a safe garden inside of to be able to use DeFi. Think about it like a blue check. And I think we're close there.
00:17:54.482 - 00:18:28.160, Speaker D: As soon as that gets done, we'll be a much bigger user. We use some things now, but like staking and trading on decentralized systems is still regulatory confusing space. And then it's, listen, BitCo has a big wallet. I forgot the exact statistic, but it's significant portion of transactions in the whole space happen in BitCo wallets. They support lots of other exchanges in and around the world. And so I can see all kinds of staking services.
00:18:29.090 - 00:18:30.718, Speaker E: And even when I said what I.
00:18:30.724 - 00:18:38.290, Speaker D: Thought about should we do part of our asset management on chain. We've invested a lot of cool on chain asset managers. It opens up a whole lot of possibility.
00:18:38.710 - 00:18:51.174, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I'm trying to read between the lines and I was thinking AMMS liquidity providers, like using I forget what Mellon Protocol changed its name to, but anyway okay, so I guess we'll have.
00:18:51.292 - 00:19:25.950, Speaker D: But Laura, in some ways the simplest function of a bank, right, is you take in money and then you lend it at higher rates. And so just even being able to be a broad lender in the space could be a huge opportunity set right now. One of the hindrances, and you see it on days like yesterday. One of the reasons I think we also did this merger, I think bigger is better as we go into the broader institutional world. And I think having a deep balance sheet is important. Days like yesterday are really important, right? Markets are collapsed, you want to have access to capital.
00:19:26.110 - 00:19:31.362, Speaker E: But the traditional banks don't lend to crypto yet.
00:19:31.496 - 00:19:55.274, Speaker D: I can't go to JPMorgan and say, hey, give me a 300 million dollar credit line at Libor plus 200 or 300 even. We've got a 2 billion plus balance sheet. Like what are you scared of letting me money for that's crypto we don't understand. And the days like yesterday, they're like, oh, thank God we didn't lend them money. Right? Those days set our industry back a few months. Not years, a few months. The conversation has to die down.
00:19:55.274 - 00:20:01.614, Speaker D: And that's a little endemic to the space. It's still a young space, but it.
00:20:01.812 - 00:20:05.130, Speaker E: Allows people that were on the edge.
00:20:05.210 - 00:20:28.134, Speaker D: To back away from the edge. And so getting capital into the space is critical. We're working really hard and being really thoughtful on how do you because if you could get cheap capital, there's plenty of places to deploy it, right? The basis trading, that happens. Lending on chain, there's unbelievable yield to lending on chain. The problem is there's not a lot of dollars.
00:20:28.172 - 00:20:30.630, Speaker E: So if you want to borrow dollars.
00:20:30.700 - 00:20:43.340, Speaker D: In crypto, you're borrowing at almost 1314 15% during times of duress, which is crazy. So if you could borrow it three or 4%, it's a whole heck of a good business.
00:20:44.110 - 00:20:48.602, Speaker B: All right, well, I will keep my eyes peeled. I'm very curious to see what you do.
00:20:48.736 - 00:20:49.642, Speaker A: Last quick question.
00:20:49.696 - 00:21:11.006, Speaker B: Galaxy also filed for a Bitcoin ETF last month. And at the beginning of the year, many people thought that having Gary Gensler as SEC chair was a positive signal for a Bitcoin ETF. But last week the SEC released a cautionary statement basically for mutual funds that wanted to invest in Bitcoin futures. So did that statement change your view on the ODS that a Bitcoin ETF would be approved?
00:21:11.038 - 00:21:14.546, Speaker E: This know, I think it's going to.
00:21:14.568 - 00:21:35.242, Speaker D: Be fourth quarter or first quarter of next year. I don't know. It's hard to say, Gary. I just keep saying if I'm the chairman of the SEC. An ETF is far better than the Grayscale Trust or the other products that institutions have that public equity markets are allowing people to invest in. And so we allow the Grayscale Trust.
00:21:35.296 - 00:21:37.414, Speaker E: But we're not going to allow an ETF.
00:21:37.462 - 00:22:06.210, Speaker D: Makes absolutely no sense. Like, bizarre, right? And I know Gary's very bright. There are a lot of technical issues that surveillance of the exchanges, all these issues that common. People like me don't like to get in the weeds of that. When I talk to the guys that are working on it, I think it's as much of a technical solve. Listen, days like yesterday aren't good for that, accelerating. Let's assume they were going to approve an ETF last week.
00:22:06.210 - 00:22:09.206, Speaker D: I mean, they decided last week to approve it next month.
00:22:09.388 - 00:22:12.678, Speaker E: After yesterday's volatility, any bureaucrat is going.
00:22:12.684 - 00:22:14.520, Speaker D: To say, let's wait a couple more months.
00:22:14.890 - 00:22:18.920, Speaker E: And so I do think it happens.
00:22:20.110 - 00:22:25.610, Speaker D: I would make a market probably 30, 70, 30% fourth quarter, 70% first quarter.
00:22:26.590 - 00:22:27.354, Speaker E: All right?
00:22:27.472 - 00:22:32.590, Speaker B: And before we go, do you want to give a Bitcoin price prediction for end of year? And same with ether.
00:22:33.250 - 00:22:38.202, Speaker D: Yeah, so it's funny, my price prediction.
00:22:38.346 - 00:22:41.534, Speaker E: In December for end of year was.
00:22:41.572 - 00:22:45.490, Speaker D: 64,000 and we got to 64,000 in March.
00:22:46.310 - 00:22:48.706, Speaker E: And if I was smart, I would.
00:22:48.728 - 00:23:03.880, Speaker D: Have said, hey, I made my whole year, let me take half of my bitcoin off. Of course, then you're like, oh, it's going to 100,000. It's hard to say. I think we're going to go sideways for a while.
00:23:04.890 - 00:23:07.560, Speaker E: We're going to consolidate between.
00:23:09.710 - 00:23:14.330, Speaker D: 35,045, 50,000 for a while.
00:23:14.480 - 00:23:17.066, Speaker E: And I think a lot of the.
00:23:17.088 - 00:23:52.978, Speaker D: Selling pressure is gone. A lot of the stories that got people scared to sell are gone, right? The ESG story came. Regulatory stories have not been great. They've kind of know China regulatory story that helped kick off yesterday. Now we need new buying and institutions are coming. They come slow. I could tell you that every one of the major banks, goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Ups, PNC Bank, they're all coming with product geared to the wealth clients, right? That's the 50 to 80 year olds who don't buy through their coinbase wallet.
00:23:53.074 - 00:23:54.166, Speaker E: But it takes a while for them.
00:23:54.188 - 00:24:02.550, Speaker D: To get set up, then the money takes a while to get in. So the positive news is, I'll tell you something about our experience with Morgan Stanley.
00:24:02.710 - 00:24:04.998, Speaker E: In order to be a financial advisor.
00:24:05.014 - 00:24:19.198, Speaker D: At Morgan Stanley and sell bitcoin, you have to take a bitcoin course online. I have done ten probably teachings with various regional sales forces on how I think about bitcoin, how I sell it.
00:24:19.364 - 00:24:22.602, Speaker E: And so think about 2013.
00:24:22.666 - 00:24:29.038, Speaker D: There was like, Dan Moorhead, there were three or four institutional salesmen of bitcoin.
00:24:29.214 - 00:24:31.006, Speaker E: Not even me, Dan Warren.
00:24:31.038 - 00:24:36.334, Speaker D: I'm trying to think who else was out there? Barry, of course. Now we just trained up 4000 Morgan.
00:24:36.382 - 00:24:38.946, Speaker E: Stanley FAS to sell bitcoin who have.
00:24:38.968 - 00:24:44.482, Speaker D: An economic incentive to sell it, who understand it, who help control people's investment decisions.
00:24:44.626 - 00:24:46.006, Speaker E: And you're going to do the same.
00:24:46.028 - 00:25:01.102, Speaker D: Thing at Goldman Sachs and the same thing at JPMorgan. And so the institutional army is coming. It's coming slowly. And so I'm always balanced between that being the buffer on the downside. What was interesting yesterday's price action is.
00:25:01.236 - 00:25:04.234, Speaker E: As the market collapsed, people that traded.
00:25:04.282 - 00:25:08.110, Speaker D: On exchanges were getting stopped out because they were levered.
00:25:08.530 - 00:25:10.110, Speaker E: People that traded in the US.
00:25:10.180 - 00:25:22.670, Speaker D: Stock market came in and MicroStrategy outperformed bitcoin by 14%. Yesterday, the grayscale trust went from a 14 15% deficit to trading at a premium.
00:25:22.830 - 00:25:23.250, Speaker E: Right.
00:25:23.320 - 00:25:26.846, Speaker D: And so non levered dip buyers showed.
00:25:26.878 - 00:25:30.642, Speaker E: Up levered over their skis.
00:25:30.706 - 00:25:55.722, Speaker D: People got stopped out. And so, again, if there's a message to send to crypto investors, it stopped taking so much leverage. But you did see demand from US. Retail buying a lot of crypto yesterday, which I found really interesting and promising. It really feels to me we put in a tradable low. We retested it last night, which felt scary again, because when you're testing lows, it always feels scary.
00:25:55.786 - 00:25:57.118, Speaker B: It's the end of the world.
00:25:57.284 - 00:26:17.750, Speaker D: It wasn't the end of the world. And I think now, listen, it doesn't mean we're going to just rocket off to space, but we got bitcoin. Miami coming up. There'll be a lot of good, positive energy. I think the town's going to go wild. You've got COVID plus Miami, end of COVID plus Miami plus crypto. I don't know.
00:26:17.750 - 00:26:20.120, Speaker D: You're going to be there. You might want to have some.
00:26:21.050 - 00:26:49.406, Speaker B: I will not. Unfortunately, I have a big book thing going on, so I cannot do fun things for a little while, but I will be watching from afar and living vicariously through you. But I agree, I think it'll be pretty wild. All right, well, Mike, this has been super fun. I would love to have you back. Know, these shows are pretty short, but we covered a lot of ground. So thank you so much for coming on.
00:26:49.406 - 00:26:50.218, Speaker B: Unconfirmed.
00:26:50.314 - 00:26:50.670, Speaker E: Awesome.
00:26:50.740 - 00:26:51.918, Speaker D: Laura, thank you.

Discover how people are reimagining the world around you on tezos. Hi, everyone.
00:27:31.364 - 00:27:53.742, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline, the market crashed. Coinbase Finance and other exchanges briefly shut down the total cryptocurrency market. Capitalization is down roughly 20% over the past seven days, from about $2.2 trillion to $1.7 trillion as of press time. Thursday afternoon.
00:27:53.742 - 00:28:52.230, Speaker A: Bitcoin is sitting at around 40k after bouncing back from $30,000, while Ethereum hit a weekly low of $1,860 before bumping back up to the high 2000s. Wednesday was the bottom for the market when Bitcoin and Ether lost 30% and 40% of their value, respectively, in a single day. The correction led to coinbase reporting intermittent downtime for customers attempting to purchase cryptos. On sale finance was also disrupted as the exchange stopped Ethereum related token withdrawals from its platform. The dip, however, did not affect decentralized exchanges such as Sushi swap, which reported its highest trading volume ever in a 24 hours period. On the flip side, average gas fees rose 239.4% on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, meaning Ethereum users paid steep prices to use DApps next Headline The crypto dip is not all Elon's fault.
00:28:52.230 - 00:29:44.534, Speaker A: As for what caused this week's bruising, several factors likely came together. First, tether. Last Friday, for the first time since 2014, Tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General's Office three months ago, which requires an ongoing publication of the assets backing USDT. As of March 31, 2021, USDT is backed by 76% cash and cash equivalents, with a final 24% filled by secured loans at twelve point 55%, corporate bonds, funds and precious metals at 9.96% and other investments including digital tokens at 1.96%. The Ft looked at what the 76% of cash and cash equivalents is comprised of, and surprisingly, only 3.87% of that, or 2.9%
00:29:44.534 - 00:30:17.090, Speaker A: of all tether is actually backed by cash. About two thirds of that 76% in cash and cash equivalents comes from commercial paper, with fiduciary deposits making up 24.2%, reverse repo notes taking up 3.6% and treasury bills just 2.94%. When Tether initially launched, USDT claimed to be backed one to one with US. Dollars. In 2019, the company changed the wording to say USDT was backed 100% by Ted reserves, which it seems is still company policy.
00:30:17.090 - 00:31:29.186, Speaker A: Today, Caitlin Long, CEO of a bondi bank, wrote a tweet thread about her thoughts on stablecoins and the crypto selloff, which are probably connected in the thread. She argued that risk managers at crypto hedge funds, quote, almost certainly will require haircuts on tether, forcing traders to sell crypto to reduce risk, because, quote, tether's probability of default and loss severity in default just went up based on the disclosure. Another cause of this week's selloff may have been unease over China. On Tuesday, three self regulatory bodies in China, all of which are under the supervision of the People's Bank of China, jointly published a note reiterating a 2017 ban on financial and payment institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions and initial coin offerings. Although it was nothing new, it appears a misleading Reuters article made the rounds Tuesday morning, spreading a rumor that China had completely banned crypto, which was much more dramatic than the reality. The third driver of the drawdown this week may have been Elon Musk and his Twitter account. Last week, Tesla announced it will no longer accept BTC as payment for vehicles, citing environmental concerns regarding Bitcoin's.
00:31:29.186 - 00:32:21.354, Speaker A: Proof of work consensus algorithm. Then, over the weekend, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk hinted that Tesla may sell or had already sold its bitcoin holdings by responding indeed to a tweet from Cryptowale on Twitter that said, quote Bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their bitcoin holdings. Musk later clarified the speculation, tweeting Tesla has not sold any bitcoin and that Tesla has diamond hands. However, by that time, BTC had already slid well under fifty k. The final impetus behind the price plunge may have also been retail traders. Meltham Demir's, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, said, quote Crypto is still largely a retail driven market driven by fear and panic. It operates 24 7365.
00:32:21.354 - 00:32:52.420, Speaker A: This is a perfect recipe for panic selling exacerbated by media hype over nonevents. Next headline. Ethereum had an impressive Q one. James Wang, a former Arc analyst, wrote an insightful article earlier this week about Ethereum's impressive Q One performance. Here are a few highlights on Ethereum's growth between Q One 2020 and Q One 2021 total transaction fees are on Ethereum are up 200 x to $1.7 billion daily. Active users increased 71%.
00:32:52.420 - 00:33:55.910, Speaker A: Total value locked in DFI rose 64 x to $52 billion from $800 million. NFT art sales rose from seven hundred k to three hundred and ninety six million dollars. On a related note on Wednesday, CoinShares reported that Digital Asset Investment Products saw a net outflow of $50 million over the previous seven days, which is the first net outflow since October 2020 and the largest since May 2019. Surprisingly, the prime suspect of the outflows was Bitcoin investment Products, which accounted for $98 million flowing out of the system. CoinShares noted that other Digital Asset Investment Products saw inflows totaling $48 million over that last week, implying that investors might be diversifying their crypto portfolios. Interestingly, Ethereum accounted for $27 million of the inflows, continuing the trend of ETH outperforming BTC this year. As Melton pointed out, quote, May is the first month Ether products traded more volume than bitcoin.
00:33:55.910 - 00:35:10.858, Speaker A: Next Headline U. S. Regulators Sprint to Keep Up with Crypto During a virtual hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, Michael Sue, the acting head of the controller of the Currency, expressed concern that, quote, the regulatory community is taking a fragmented, agency by agency approach to the technology driven changes taking place today. Sue is eyeing a collaboration between the OCC, Federal Reserve and FDIC to create what he's calling an inter agency Sprint team that would establish a unified framework and set definitions for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, sue requested a staff review of all the OCC's crypto related guidance issued over the past year, which will encompass the entirety of former controller Brian Brooks's reign at the OCC, when the regulator established crypto guidance largely seen as beneficial to the industry. For example, Brooks wrote a series of interpretive letters during his tenure clarifying that federally chartered banks could custody, stablecoins and hold them in reserve. Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Bank, pointed out that earlier on Tuesday, the OCC had reversed a final ruling, which, although unrelated to crypto, is a very rare occurrence, perhaps signaling that sue could zig where Brooks Zagged.
00:35:10.858 - 00:35:31.430, Speaker A: Four other U. S. Regulatory headlines are also worth noting. U. S. Congressman Thomas Emmer sent a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, urging clear accounting standards for digital currencies. The FDIC put out a request to depository institutions this week asking banks about the handling of digital assets.
00:35:31.430 - 00:35:46.810, Speaker A: On Thursday, Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown penned a letter to Michael Sue regarding his concern over the OCC previously granting national trust charters to Paxos, Anchorage and Protego, signaling that the trust charters may be at risk.
00:35:47.550 - 00:35:48.122, Speaker E: The US.
00:35:48.176 - 00:36:27.522, Speaker A: Treasury is calling for businesses that receive $10,000 in crypto to report such transactions to the IRS, stating that while they are a, quote, small portion of business income today, cryptocurrency transactions are likely to rise in importance in the next decade. The IRS will also be given additional funding to address the crypto market. Next headline. Wells Fargo and bank of America make crypto moves. On Wednesday, Wells Fargo's Wealth and Investment Management division announced that it will soon introduce an actively managed crypto strategy. Wells Fargo is the latest us. Bank, following Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and possibly Morgan to grant wealthy clients exposure to crypto.
00:36:27.522 - 00:37:20.730, Speaker A: Bank of America joined the Paxo Settlement Service, which has the capability to settle stocks at T plus Zero through Ethereum based blockchain technology. You can listen to CEO Charles Cascarilla talk about Paxos on unchange in three different episodes, which we will put in the show notes if you want to check them out. Kevin McCarthy B of A's, head of finance and clearing, believes that technology would be a positive for the bank, as B of A could free up the collateral. We'd have to post on an overnight basis, which would improve the return on assets. B of A will offer the service to clients when and if a clearing agency grants approval. News heard around the block the Bitcoin hash rate fell almost 20% this week as miners in China'sichuan region faced temporary power limitations. Pancake Bunny, a finance smart chain protocol, lost $45 million in an exploit on Thursday.
00:37:20.730 - 00:38:30.960, Speaker A: As a result, the price of Bunny dropped significantly from one hundred and forty six dollars to six dollars before jumping back up to the $40 range. Blockfly accidentally gave away large amounts of BTC, 700 being the highest number reported in a promotion gone awry. And finally, Figure Technologies, a blockchain lending company, raised $200 million, led by ten T Holdings and Morgan Creek Digital, the company is now valued at $3.2 billion. Time for fun bits MySpace tom with Bitcoin at one point down 50% from its alltime high, it was an easy week to bash the first cryptocurrency. In the past, a dip of this magnitude may have warranted a Bitcoin obituary. This week, the obituary was replaced by an article titled First Mover advantage is Great, but Could Bitcoin end up the MySpace Way? By Joe Weisenthal, executive editor at Bloomberg, with the gist being that BTC could, like MySpace, end up being replaced by better technology all of Facebook, though Joe admits it will be harder to supplant BTC due to the nature of blockchain tech versus social media.
00:38:30.960 - 00:39:13.178, Speaker A: Here's where the humor comes in, however tenuous the connection, it seems the creator of MySpace, Tom Anderson, is a Bitcoiner, which is perhaps worrisome for BTC holders or hodlers. In an odd yet humorous move, Tom has only posted on his Twitter account five times in 2021. Three of those posts came in response to Nick Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and an ardent bitcoin defender. Tom's latest tweet was posted on Sunday, showing off his new profile pic replete with laser eyes with a quote, Buying the dip. All right, thanks for tuning in.
