00:00:00.330 - 00:00:46.166, Speaker A: So if I were defending, let's say, some key creator on friend tech, what would the SEC try to claim? I think it would be very hard for them to claim security status. I think they have two routes basically to claim it was a security. They would say first, back when it was called the share, they would try to use a case called Landrith, which says that if you call it stock, it's not necessarily dispositive. If you call it stock or call it a share, it's not necessarily. But it might help if it also has the attributes usually associated with stock. And that's a somewhat flexible test that looks to different kinds of things like dividends. And the SEC might try to claim somehow that the fee that's shared with the creator is some form of a type of a dividend, even though it's really not.
00:00:46.166 - 00:00:58.940, Speaker A: I would be skeptical of the SEC trying to trying to jam this into the Landrith test for stock or the Howie test generally. I would be very confident if they tried to do that.
