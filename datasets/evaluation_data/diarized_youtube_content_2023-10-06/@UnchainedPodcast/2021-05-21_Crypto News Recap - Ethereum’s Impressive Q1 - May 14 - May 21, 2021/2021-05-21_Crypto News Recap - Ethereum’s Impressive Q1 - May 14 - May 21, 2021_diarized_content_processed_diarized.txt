00:00:00.090 - 00:00:39.480, Speaker A: Um hi everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this week's News recap. First headline the market crashed. Coinbase Finance and other exchanges briefly shut down the total cryptocurrency market. Capitalization is down roughly 20% over the past seven days, from about $2.2 trillion to $1.7 trillion s as a press time, Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin is sitting at around 40k after bouncing back from $30,000, while Ethereum hit a weekly low of $1,860 before bumping back up to the high 2000s.
00:00:39.480 - 00:01:30.722, Speaker A: Wednesday was the bottom for the market when Bitcoin and Ether lost 30% and 40% of their value, respectively, in a single day. The correction led to Coinbase reporting intermittent downtime for customers attempting to purchase cryptos on sale finance was also disrupted as the exchange stopped Ethereum related token withdrawals from its platform. The dip, however, did not affect decentralized exchanges such as Sushi swap, which reported its highest trading volume ever in a 24 hours period. On the flip side, average gas fees rose 239.4% on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, meaning Ethereum users paid steep prices to use DApps. Next headline the crypto dip is not all elon's fault. As for what caused this week's bruising, several factors likely came together.
00:01:30.722 - 00:02:20.954, Speaker A: First, tether. Last Friday, for the first time since 2014, Tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General's Office three months ago, which requires an ongoing publication of the assets backing USDT. As of March 31, 2021, USDT is backed by 76% cash and cash equivalents, with a final 24% filled by secured loans at twelve point 55%, corporate bonds, funds and precious metals at 9.96%, and other investments including digital tokens at 1.96%. The Ft looked at what the 76% of cash and cash equivalents is comprised of, and surprisingly, only 3.87% of that, or 2.9% of all tether is actually backed by cash.
00:02:20.954 - 00:03:00.710, Speaker A: About two thirds of that 76% in cash and cash equivalents comes from commercial paper, with fiduciary deposits making up 24.2%, reverse repo notes taking up 3.6% and treasury bills just 2.94%. When Tether initially launched, USDT claimed to be backed one to one with US. Dollars. In 2019, the company changed the wording to say USDT was backed 100% by Ted reserves, which it seems is still company policy today. Caitlin Long, CEO of a bondi bank, wrote a tweet thread about her thoughts on stablecoins and the crypto selloff, which are probably connected.
00:03:00.710 - 00:04:23.310, Speaker A: In the thread, she argued that risk managers at crypto hedge funds, quote, almost certainly will require haircuts on tether, forcing traders to sell crypto to reduce risk because, quote, tether's probability of default and loss severity in default just went up based on the disclosure. Another cause of this week's selloff may have been unease over China. On Tuesday, three self regulatory bodies in China, all of which are under the supervision of the People's Bank of China, jointly published a note reiterating a 2017 ban on financial and payment institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions and initial coin offerings. Although it was nothing new, it appears a misleading Reuters article made the rounds Tuesday morning, spreading a rumor that China had completely banned crypto, which was much more dramatic than the reality. The third driver of the drawdown this week may have been Elon Musk and his Twitter account. Last week, Tesla announced it will no longer accept BTC as payment for vehicles, citing environmental concerns regarding bitcoin's proof of work consensus algorithm. Then, over the weekend, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk hinted that Tesla may sell or had already sold its bitcoin holdings by responding indeed to a tweet from Cryptowale on Twitter that said, quote, Bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their bitcoin holdings.
00:04:23.310 - 00:05:05.214, Speaker A: Musk later clarified the speculation, tweeting Tesla has not sold any bitcoin and that Tesla has diamond hands. However, by that time, BTC had already slid well under fifty k. The final impetus behind the price plunge may have also been retail traders. Meltham Demir's, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, said, quote Crypto is still largely a retail driven market driven by fear and panic. It operates 24 7365. This is a perfect recipe for panic selling exacerbated by media hype over nonevents. Next headline ethereum had an impressive Q One.
00:05:05.214 - 00:05:55.550, Speaker A: James Wang, a former Arc analyst, wrote an insightful article earlier this week about Ethereum's impressive Q One performance. Here are a few highlights on Ethereum's growth between Q One 2020 and Q One 2021 total transaction fees on Ethereum are up 200 x to $1.7 billion daily. Active users increased 71%. Total value locked in DFI rose 64 x to $52 billion from $800 million. NFT art sales rose from seven hundred k to three hundred and ninety six million dollars. On a related note, on Wednesday, CoinShares reported that Digital Asset Investment Products saw a net outflow of $50 million over the previous seven days, which is the first net outflow since October 2020 and the largest since May 2019.
00:05:55.550 - 00:07:04.050, Speaker A: Surprisingly, the prime suspect of the outflows was Bitcoin investment Products, which accounted for $98 million flowing out of the system. CoinShares noted that other Digital Asset Investment Products saw inflows totaling $48 million over that last week, implying that investors might be diversifying their crypto portfolios. Interestingly, Ethereum accounted for $27 million of the inflows, continuing the trend of ETH outperforming BTC this year. As Melton pointed out, quote May is the first month Ether products traded more volume than bitcoin. Next headline us. Regulators Sprint to Keep Up with Crypto During a virtual hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, Michael Sue, the acting head of the Controller of the Currency, expressed concern that, quote, the regulatory community is taking a fragmented, agency by agency approach to the technology driven changes taking place today. Sue is eyeing a collaboration between the OCC, Federal Reserve and FDIC to create what he's calling an interagency Sprint team that would establish a unified framework and set definitions for cryptocurrencies.
00:07:04.050 - 00:07:48.898, Speaker A: Additionally, sue requested a staff review of all the OCC's crypto related guidance issued over the past year, which will encompass the entirety of former Controller Brian Brooks's reign at the OCC, when the regulator established crypto guidance largely seen as beneficial to the industry. For example, Brooks wrote a series of interpretive letters during his tenure clarifying that federally chartered banks could custody, stablecoins and hold them in reserve. Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Bank, pointed out that earlier on Tuesday, the OCC had reversed a final ruling, which, although unrelated to crypto, is a very rare occurrence, perhaps signaling that sue could zig where Brooks zagged. Four other U. S. Regulatory headlines are also worth noting. U.
00:07:48.898 - 00:08:40.500, Speaker A: S. Congressman Thomas Emmer sent a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, urging clear accounting standards for digital currencies. The FDIC put out a request to depository institutions this week, asking banks about the handling of digital assets. On Thursday, Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown penned a letter to Michael Sue regarding his concern over the OCC previously granting National Trust charters to Paxos, Anchorage and Protego, signaling that their trust charters may be at risk. The US. Treasury is calling for businesses that receive $10,000 in crypto to report such transactions to the IRS, stating that while they are a, quote, small portion of business income today, cryptocurrency transactions are likely to rise in importance in the next decade. The IRS will also be given additional funding to address the crypto market.
00:08:40.500 - 00:09:32.862, Speaker A: Next headline wells Fargo and bank of America make crypto moves. On Wednesday, Wells Fargo's Wealth and Investment Management division announced that it will soon introduce an actively managed crypto strategy. Wells Fargo is the latest us. Bank, following Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and possibly Morgan to grant wealthy clients exposure to crypto. Bank of America joined the Paxo Settlement Service, which has the capability to settle stocks at T plus zero through Ethereum based blockchain technology. You can listen to CEO Charles Cascarilla talk about Paxos on Unchained in three different episodes, which we will put in the show notes if you want to check them out. Kevin McCarthy, B of A's, head of finance and clearing, believes that technology would be a positive for the bank, as B of A could free up the collateral we'd have to post on an overnight basis, which would improve the return on assets.
00:09:32.862 - 00:10:18.162, Speaker A: B of A will offer the service to clients when and if a clearing agency grants approval. News heard around the block The Bitcoin hash rate fell almost 20% this week as miners in China'sichuan region faced temporary power limitations. Pancake Bunny, a finance smart chain protocol, lost $45 million in an exploit on Thursday. As a result, the price of Bunny dropped significantly from one hundred and forty six dollars to six dollars. Before jumping back up to the $40 range. Blockfly accidentally gave away large amounts of BTC, 700 being the highest number reported in a promotion gone awry. And finally, Figure Technologies, a blockchain lending company, raised $200 million.
00:10:18.162 - 00:11:09.166, Speaker A: Led by Ten, T Holdings and Morgan Creek Digital. The company is now valued at $3.2 billion. Time for fun bits MySpace tom With Bitcoin at one point down 50% from its alltime high, it was an easy week to bash the first cryptocurrency. In the past, a dip of this magnitude may have warranted a Bitcoin obituary. This week, the obituary was replaced by an article titled First Mover Advantage is Great, but Could Bitcoin end up the MySpace Way? By Joe Weisenthal, executive editor at Bloomberg, with the gist being that BTC could, like MySpace, end up being replaced by better technology all of Facebook, though Joe admits it will be harder to supplant BTC due to the nature of blockchain tech versus social media. Here's where the humor comes in, however tenuous the connection.
00:11:09.166 - 00:11:47.230, Speaker A: It seems the creator of MySpace, Tom Anderson, is a Bitcoiner, which is perhaps worrisome for BTC holders or hodlers. In an OD yet humorous move, Tom has only posted on his Twitter account five times in 2021. Three of those posts came in response to Nick Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and an ardent Bitcoin defender. Tom's latest tweet was posted on Sunday, showing off his new profile pic replete with laser eyes, with a quote, Buying the dip. All right, thanks for tuning in.
