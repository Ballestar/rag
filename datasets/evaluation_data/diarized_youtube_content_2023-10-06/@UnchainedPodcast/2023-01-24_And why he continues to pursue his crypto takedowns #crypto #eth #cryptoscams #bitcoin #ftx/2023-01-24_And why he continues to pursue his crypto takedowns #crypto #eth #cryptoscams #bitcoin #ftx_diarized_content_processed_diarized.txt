00:00:00.330 - 00:00:22.954, Speaker A: I almost quit doing this a few months ago, actually. I had done a lot of stuff with Celsius. I'd actually found some original things that were cited in other papers and CoinDesk and things. And I kind of thought, like, well, I've made my contribution to this. I can just quit. I just have too much fun doing this. I've met so many interesting people and learned so many interesting things about real finance in addition to crypto.
00:00:22.954 - 00:00:50.300, Speaker A: And literally, I know people all around the world now because of this, right? So I can't really stop now, unfortunately, maybe. But in terms of time, I find time, nights, weekends, whatever, when this is your hobby, when you have a hobby that you really like and care about. I don't really watch a lot of Netflix. I'm way behind on reading books. I'm way behind on other things I like to do, because this is basically what I do for fun.
