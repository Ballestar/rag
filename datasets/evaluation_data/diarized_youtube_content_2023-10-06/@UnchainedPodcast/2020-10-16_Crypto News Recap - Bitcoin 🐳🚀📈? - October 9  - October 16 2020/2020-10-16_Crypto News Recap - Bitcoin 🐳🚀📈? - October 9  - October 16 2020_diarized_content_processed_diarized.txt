00:00:00.090 - 00:00:26.118, Speaker A: You. Thanks for tuning into this week's news. Recap. First headline Stonerich Bets $115,000,000 on Bitcoin, continuing the trend set by MicroStrategy and Square. The $10 billion asset management firm Stonerich Holdings Group revealed in a Forbes article Tuesday that it has invested in 10,000 bitcoin, currently about $150,000,000.
00:00:26.284 - 00:00:28.406, Speaker B: It has also raised $100 million in.
00:00:28.428 - 00:01:14.638, Speaker A: Funding for its crypto subsidiary New York Digital Investment Group, or NYDIG, with $50 million in a recently closed round. In a statement to CoinDesk, the private firm called bitcoin its, quote, primary treasury reserve asset. The announcement further illustrates the growing trust in bitcoin as a safe haven asset.

Meanwhile, Grayscale Investments posted its all time best quarter ever, with over $1 billion invested across its cryptocurrency products. In the OTC markets, BTC and ETH are showing renewed interest following the Square news, as attention seems to be moving away from DFI tokens back to these more tried and true crypto assets. Fidelity also published guidance on bitcoin as an alternative investment, highlighting what it sees as continuing retail interest in bitcoin, as evidenced by the increasing number of wallets holding less than ten bitcoins. Fidelity also laid out annualized returns for hypothetical portfolios, allocating one to 3% to BTC.
00:02:17.430 - 00:03:23.374, Speaker A: It shows that even in 2018, when bitcoin's price fell 70% with regular rebalancing, a portfolio with 3% of bitcoin set up at the beginning of the year would have outperformed a portfolio without any bitcoin by 1.1%, and from January 2015 to September 2020, such a portfolio would have outperformed one without bitcoin by 29%. However, the report notes that bitcoin's historical pattern of accelerated returns may not continue as it exits early stage behaviors. On the flip side, bitcoin could instead enter a period of more stable and steady performance, possibly resulting in lower volatility and favorable riskadjusted terms. Lastly, market analyst Willie Wu posted some charts to Twitter illustrating why Square and MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchases are just the tip of the iceberg. He pointed out that there has been a reduction of 250,000 BTC on spot exchanges over the last eight months, signaling that other big investors may be getting into the game.
