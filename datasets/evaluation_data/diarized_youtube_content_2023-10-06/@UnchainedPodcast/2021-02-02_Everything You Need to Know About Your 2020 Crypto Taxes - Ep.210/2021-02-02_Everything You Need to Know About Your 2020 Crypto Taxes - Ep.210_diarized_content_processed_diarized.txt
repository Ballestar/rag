Here to discuss are Shayhan Chandrasekara, a CPA and head of strategy at Coin Tracker, and Dan Hannah, COO of Zen Ledger.
00:00:57.366 - 00:00:59.070, Speaker A: Welcome, Shahan and Dan.
00:00:59.490 - 00:01:00.878, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:01:01.044 - 00:01:29.750, Speaker A: Just a quick disclaimer before we dive in. While we hope that this show is informative for everyone, this is not financial advice, and everyone who has any crypto holdings should seek their own personalized tax advice. Also, we need to make one caveat, which is that this show will primarily be helpful for us taxpayers. All right, so there are some changes to the ways the IRS is handling crypto this year. What are those changes and what does that signify?
00:01:30.330 - 00:01:34.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, happy to start with one of them. I guess we can go back and forth.
00:01:34.160 - 00:01:36.950, Speaker A: This is Dan for people listening on audio. Go ahead, Dan.
00:01:37.030 - 00:01:56.286, Speaker C: Thanks, Laura. Yeah, I think one of the biggest ones that we saw was towards the end of December where the IRS released a new draft for the 1040 question, which is a question that came on for last year but was on the schedule one and now has moved to the top of the 1040. So a little bit more prominent placing and then they also was it sort.
00:01:56.308 - 00:01:58.782, Speaker A: Of like the front page of your taxes?
00:01:58.926 - 00:01:59.666, Speaker C: Absolutely, yeah.
00:01:59.688 - 00:02:01.730, Speaker A: So the schedule one sort of like the front page.
00:02:01.800 - 00:02:29.210, Speaker C: Yeah, pretty much, yeah. So the schedule one is a form that not every American needs to file. But this 1040 is typically a form that, if not everyone, the majority of US. Based investors will need to file. Now, that question is listed as the number one question. And some of the draft guidance that came out, I think clarifies a few of the issues, mainly around if purchasing crypto, you have to check off yes. And under the new draft, you now have to check off yes.
00:02:29.210 - 00:02:44.580, Speaker C: Under that question if you've purchased crypto, which is a little bit of an interesting conundrum in the sense that purchasing crypto is not necessarily a taxable event. But I think that's a big major change that we've seen to the newest draft and then to the movement of the question itself.
00:02:46.070 - 00:02:47.780, Speaker A: Sheihan, do you want to add to.
00:02:48.710 - 00:03:28.346, Speaker B: So then you're right. In the draft instructions, it did say that if you had purchased crypto, you would still have to check yes, but actually I checked out the instructions yesterday and they had removed that language. Yeah, it was interesting to me as well. So if you look at the instructions right now, it does not explicitly say that you need to check yes if you purchase crypto. However, if you purchase crypto, I think it would still be recognized under the receive category because it's such a broad question. But, yeah, there was a purchase that bucket, they removed it from the final instructions.
00:03:28.458 - 00:03:32.570, Speaker A: Wait, so now the final does not ask you if you purchased crypto.
00:03:32.730 - 00:03:47.320, Speaker B: It does not explicitly say that you need to check yes if you purchase crypto. But in the question, did you receive any cryptocurrency? So I assume if you're purchasing something, you're receiving. So just to be safe, I would check yes.
00:03:49.610 - 00:04:04.106, Speaker A: Okay, so what do those moves mean to you that now it's right on the 1040, it's the first question and they're even asking if you've received crypto, which isn't necessarily a taxable event, what do those changes mean to you?
00:04:04.288 - 00:04:38.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of people think that, okay, if I answer this question, I'm going to get audited tomorrow. I mean, that's not the case right now. IRS is trying to kind of get, I guess, a good set of data among US. Taxpayers with some type of affiliation with crypto because right now they don't have this data. So by putting that question on the page one, they're going to expose this question and the subject to roughly 150,000,000 taxpayers. And you are supposed to answer this question. You got to say either yes or no, and your answer is going to be tied to your Social Security number and et cetera.
00:04:38.770 - 00:05:10.400, Speaker B: I think what Iris is trying to do is they know that exchanges and everybody has seen tremendous amount of growth because of the recent bull run and the previous bull runs, but the number of returns that they get with crypto has been in thousands. So it just doesn't make any sense. So that's why I think they're trying to gather the information. Gathering the information doesn't necessarily mean that you got to pay a tax bill. For example. Like you said, Laura, if you receive like a cryptocurrency gift or something like that, there's nothing to report. But you would still check yes.
00:05:10.400 - 00:05:41.660, Speaker B: And there could be other situations. You could be like, as you mentioned, you could be purchasing crypto and the safe thing to do is to kind of check yes. But again, there's no taxable event. But by answering that question, whether you like it or not, you had to give that information to the IRS. And I'm sure that's going to go into some type of database and IRS going to run some analysis in the future to do analysis among the taxpayers with crypto applications. If they're funding everything correctly or not.
00:05:42.510 - 00:06:07.010, Speaker A: Okay, wow. All right, so now we know this is important. So it sounds like not everybody who should have been reporting has been in recent years. So we might have some longtime crypto people who are just trying to wrap their heads around this the first time. So what is the main principle that people should keep in mind when it comes to their crypto and taxes?
00:06:07.510 - 00:06:44.010, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I'll start, maybe Dan can add to that later. I think a lot of people don't realize that crypto is regulated and it's taxable. Some people, they find out that it's taxable when they first see the question on TurboTax or when their tax practitioner asks them. So that's something to know. Like crypto is taxable as a property. If you make any profits you got to pay capital gains taxes and if it's a loss, then actually you can write it off and you could even get a refund. So reporting your crypto transaction is not necessarily bad because if the market is down, you could actually benefit.
00:06:44.010 - 00:07:14.454, Speaker B: The IRS first came out with these rules in 2014, pretty much said crypto is rated as property. So from 2014 to 2020 we haven't seen any major differences in the way that we treat crypto, even though the crypto space has grown tremendously. We have DeFi, stable coins and et cetera. But unfortunately, according to IRS, all cryptocurrencies should be treated as property. And that poses some other challenges, but we just got to go with what we have right now.
00:07:14.572 - 00:07:28.890, Speaker A: So when you say property and you said that means it's taxed like a stock. So that's kind of know you can have either long term capital gains tax or short term capital gains tax and that type of thing, is that kind of correct?
00:07:28.960 - 00:08:05.746, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's an easy way for beginners to think about crypto taxes. It's literally like stocks. There are some exceptions, but just to kind of give an idea, you have your purchase price, which we call in technical terms a cost basis, and you have a sales price. If there's a difference, if it's a positive difference, you have a gain. And that gain is subject to either long term capital gains or short term capital gains. The long term capital gains occur when you sell your coin after holding it for more than twelve months, and then short term capital gains occur if you were to sell your coin after holding it for less than twelve months. So it's pretty similar to stocks.
00:08:05.746 - 00:08:22.906, Speaker B: But there's one exceptions for crypto. The wash sale rule does not apply because wash sale rule is only applicable stocks and securities under Section 1091. But kind of thinking about stocks is kind of like an easier way to approach crypto taxes in general.
00:08:23.088 - 00:08:39.826, Speaker A: And just to flesh that out for people, when you say the wash sale rule does not apply, that means if they were to buy back the cryptocurrency after selling it within some time period then. So typically for stocks, that wouldn't trigger a taxable event, but it does for crypto, is that what you're saying?
00:08:40.008 - 00:09:33.426, Speaker B: So the wash sale rule means that let's say a stock goes down in value and then you're selling it and you're buying it back. If you do the buyback within 30 days after you sell it, that loss is going to get disallowed by the IRS because the idea is that IRS doesn't want you to give any credit for paper losses, but that's only applicable to stocks and securities in the crypto world. That's not applicable. What that means is you can literally, if you have your positions, like in the red, meaning your cost base is higher than your market value, you can sell them, harvest your losses, and quickly get back into the same position without having to wait that 30 day wash sale period. So it kind of allows you to aggressively harvest your tax losses compared to stock. So that's actually one advantage and I don't see people talking about it. They always focus on the bad side.
00:09:33.426 - 00:09:39.990, Speaker B: Okay, why do we have to pay taxes? But if you plan things correctly, there are some unique advantages if you deal with crypto.
00:09:40.650 - 00:09:50.550, Speaker A: Okay, great. So in general, what information should people be recording in order to be able to report correctly for their taxes?
00:09:51.630 - 00:10:34.434, Speaker C: I think a big misnomer is that you need to be tracking every single transaction and you need to be tracking your cost basis like yourself. So I think one thing like ZenLedger and like a CoinTracker provides is software that's able to do that for you. So one thing that we typically recommend for our customers or our clients is to really track the sources. So, for example, I'm using a coinbase, a kraken, a gemini. I'm using ledger, a trezor, a MetaMask. So really by tracking what wallet addresses you're using what exchange account you're using, platforms like the ones that we both provide allow you to simply integrate API keys, integrate CSVs, integrate wallet addresses, and then our software actually kind of does all the in between for you. Calculating the cost basis, calculating your gains, your losses.
00:10:34.434 - 00:11:03.758, Speaker C: So what we typically recommend is just making sure that you're keeping track of what you're using. Not necessarily. You don't have to have an Excel spreadsheet or a Google document or handwritten notes of every single trade or every single transaction, but just making sure that you understand the sources that you're using and then making sure that you're preferably using a crypto tax software. Because we definitely believe that it makes your life a little bit easier and makes it really simple to get your applications taken care of, just to kind.
00:11:03.764 - 00:11:55.730, Speaker B: Of give some contest to people who are completely new to this. If you were to trade your stocks and securities in like TDM and trader JPMorgan at the end of the year, you're going to get this phone call 1009 B listing cost basis, your market value and the gains and losses. Now after you get that it's just a matter of plugging those numbers into your tax return, then you're fine. But in the crypto world it does not happen because of the complexities associated with cost basis and et cetera. So that's where these crypto tax software tools come in handy. So you can connect your exchanges and wallets and those software can provide that cost basis and market value and gains and losses, then you can include that on the return. And without this software and if you're using multiple exchanges and wallets it's virtually impossible to you to kind of track those things and sometimes you could even be overpaying taxes for no reason.
00:11:55.730 - 00:11:59.170, Speaker B: So highly recommend using any of these softwares.
00:11:59.670 - 00:12:23.900, Speaker A: And actually I just wanted to go back to that question about how the very first question on the 1040 right now is about crypto. I was wondering what is the penalty for someone if they either accidentally or even dishonestly report that they didn't have any such crypto transactions or didn't receive crypto during that year, when in fact they did?
00:12:24.990 - 00:13:01.138, Speaker B: There's no major penalty, just an informational question. But when you sign the return, you're signing the return under penalty and perjury. So you are expected to report things correctly. And if you're intentionally lying on that question that could even be considered like fraud. So to give an answer there's no like a monetary penalty and if you get it wrong you're going to get penalized for $100 or $1,000. You got to get the question right. And again, that question, again, a lot of people are scared of that question and I wouldn't be scared of that, it's just an informational question and just answer it correctly.
00:13:01.138 - 00:13:09.290, Speaker B: And if it's a yes, then the second question that you should be asking yourself is do I have a taxable event or do I have other forms to file?
00:13:10.990 - 00:13:46.726, Speaker A: And then one other thing I was also curious about is there are all kinds of airdrops but there are people who kind of are a bit active in crypto and then later are not active and whatever. Like if they come in during some kind of bubble and then they drop out when things are a bit quieter. So if they receive an AirDrop but they don't know that they've received it and they don't report that, I guess you said there isn't a penalty but it just feels like there could be a lot of instances where that would happen, right?
00:13:46.908 - 00:14:18.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there could be instances if you really forget to kind of look at your wallet to see if you receive any airdrop. I would say that's like an innocent mistake. You're not trying to intentionally defro the government. Again, that's another situation where some of these crypto tax software do come in handy because if you're using one of them you can see the taxes at the end of the year and you're like, oh, I got an AirDrop. And luckily this software captured it. Now you know you have a tax liability and now you know you got to answer that question correctly.
00:14:19.082 - 00:14:48.050, Speaker A: All right, so let's now just walk through all the basic different types of transactions that can happen, that can trigger taxable events and let's talk about what information you might want or need to record or what different factors in the transaction could affect what your taxes might be. So let's just start with the basic one. Someone buys crypto and then later they sell it. Walk me through what that looks like for them in terms of taxes.
00:14:48.210 - 00:15:57.326, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think Shahan mentioned it earlier, just in the sense that once you purchase that currency, then you'll have that cost basis moving forward. So depending on how long you held that currency, as was mentioned, if it's under twelve months, that'd be a short term capital gain. Over twelve months, long term capital gain. So one big factor is how long did you hold and then obviously did that asset go up or down before you sold it or traded it? And I think that's another element that maybe we'll get into later of buying with dollars into Fiat, crypto into crypto, and then crypto back into Fiat are kind of like the three main buckets. So anytime you go from one crypto to another, that would be a taxable ven and that would come with another set of cost basis, another set of gains and losses. But yeah, so the purchase question kind of just depends because I think a lot of individuals may not realize that purchasing crypto with another crypto is not actually a purchase, but a trade and comes with another set of obligations that comes separate than if you were just using dollars to purchase crypto. So there is kind of not gray area, but there's some more context depending on how you purchase that.
00:15:57.326 - 00:16:28.418, Speaker C: But typically from dollars into crypto, there'll be no taxable event on that. And then depending on how long you held that crypto, under twelve months, over twelve months. And then at the end, if you sold that back in for another crypto or exited back into Fiat, not only the amount that you held, the gains, losses, but then typically some of your own personal information could be included in that as well, as far as your own tax rates and things like that. So there is some complexity to that question and some variables that kind of go into the overall purchase or sell of a crypto asset.
00:16:28.594 - 00:17:01.346, Speaker B: I guess just to kind of give everybody a summary. Again, for those of you brand new, remember these five situations. These are the five situations where you could owe some type of crypto taxes. So number one, as Dan mentioned, you're pretty much cashing out, you got a bitcoin for 10,000, you're selling it for 30,000. You got to pay taxes on 20 grand. That's pretty easy. Number two, when you go from one cryptocurrency to another, like you're spending ethereum to buy bitcoin, this is a situation that a lot of people don't get because they're know I didn't receive any cash.
00:17:01.346 - 00:17:27.942, Speaker B: Why do I have to pay taxes? Unfortunately, IRS doesn't care whether you receive cash or not. As long as you have access to some type of wealth, by moving from one coin to another, you got to pay taxes. So that's the second situation. And number three is when you earn crypto. You could be earning crypto through wages by working for somebody. It could be interest, it could be DeFi income, mining income, staking income. So those are taxable events.
00:17:27.942 - 00:17:43.866, Speaker B: Number four is when you spend crypto to buy goods and services. There's a bunch of crypto debits and credit cards. Some people think, oh, I'm just spending crypto. It's not taxable. It is taxable. So something to keep in mind. And lastly, airdrops and forks.
00:17:43.866 - 00:18:09.500, Speaker B: In 2020, we saw a couple of major airdrops, the uni airdrops and the spark airdrops. So those are the situations where you have some coin, but you don't necessarily have cash to pay the taxes. So you got to make sure you be pulled enough taxes or at least after you get the AirDrop, you convert portion of that AirDrop to like a stable coin. So at the end of the year, you got enough cash in hand to pay the taxes. So those are the five situations I would remember.
00:18:09.870 - 00:18:50.470, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Okay, that's a smart tip. One thing that I wanted to ask also, so in that case where you are purchasing with bitcoin or cryptocurrency, what if you've acquired the cryptocurrency at different times and then you kind of make a big purchase of something? So let's say it's like you received $20 of bitcoin at one time and then $100 another time and $50 another time, and then you buy a plane ticket that's more than 100 and why let's say it's close to 200 and you still have other bitcoin, then how do you determine the cost basis?
00:18:51.610 - 00:19:47.838, Speaker B: Yeah, this is where tools like zen ledger and contractor come in handy. So IRS is saying that if you can specifically identify the unit that you deem to be selling, meaning if you have all the detailed records of every cryptocurrency that you purchase with the date, with the unique Identifier and everything for tax purposes, you can pick and choose which unit that you're selling. So in your example, ideally you want to be disforcing the coin which you paid the highest amount for, thereby reducing your gains. So you can achieve the specific ID if you're using like a crypto tax tool, because if you're using a tool, you automatically keep all those records. But if you don't use a tool, it's your responsibility to track them on excess spreadsheet or something. And in case you get audited, you got to prove this is how you achieve the cost basis for that specific transaction.
00:19:48.034 - 00:19:59.302, Speaker A: Okay, let's walk through a few other scenarios. So what about people who mine cryptocurrency? What do they need to do to report their taxes correctly?
00:19:59.446 - 00:20:43.190, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to chime in. I think it really just depends on how that mined currency is received from a corporation or an individual. So if you have an LLC set up and you're having a mining facility run through a business or a business entity, it's a little bit different than having an individual. So that's kind of a big difference. But at the end of the day, that mining income would be considered as taxable income for crypto tax purposes. So pretty much the same thing from what we've discussed earlier. When you receive either that distribution from a pool that you may be operating with, or maybe by luck, you're able to get your own block and get your own block reward that access, and that transaction would be viewable on the blockchain.
00:20:43.190 - 00:21:33.210, Speaker C: You'd be able to see the timestamp when it came in, the value that it's worth in USD value, and then treating that income would be just as taxable income. A lot of the times that we see, whether it's individuals or corporations, a lot of that mining income or mining revenue is then used to fund future business operations. So if you're converting that income back into dollars or using that income to then purchase a new ant miner, a new facility or things like that, then being able to track that is interesting as well. So I think we've seen that if you're mining cryptocurrency, a lot of the times it's better to even just set up a simple LLC and have that income come through the business versus a singular entity because you have a little bit different tax rate as a corporation versus an individual. Sheehan, I don't know if you had anything to add on that.
00:21:33.360 - 00:22:44.338, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that distinction is super important, like how you're going about doing the mining operation, because you could be mining as a Hobies, meaning you could have a couple of mining machines on your basement versus you could take investors money and just mining as a business. If you're mining as a Hobies, you got to pick up the income. As Dan mentioned, the income is the market value every time you get those bitcoin or whatever the coin that you're mining, and you would sum it up on an annual basis, that would be your income if you're a Hobbies. Unfortunately, you cannot deduct your mining related business expenses because it's considered a hobby under the IRS. Now, the second option is your mining as a business. If that's the case, you pick up the income you get to write over the mining operation, like related expenses, like rent, utilities, subscriptions, and also equipment, because these equipments, as you guys know, they're pretty expensive and luckily, the IRS code allows you to depreciate up like $1 million worth of equipment under Section 179. And there's bonus depreciation and there's de minimis safe harbor rules, meaning if you have receipts and if something is below $2,500, you can just write it off.
00:22:44.338 - 00:23:18.140, Speaker B: They don't even ask what it is for. So it's very beneficial. Like whenever you earn income by leveraging equipment or a capital intensive type of business, IRS has very favorable tax rules. So, yeah, I mean, talk to a tax advisor about kind of structuring it. But the TLDR here is that if you properly run like a mining, especially proof of work mining business, you're actually making money, but you're not paying any taxes because you get the deduction from the depreciation, which is a non cash outflow. So it's pretty beneficial if you do it right.
00:23:18.590 - 00:24:02.220, Speaker A: And one other thing is, so Dan kind of very quickly was just like, oh, when you mine it, you can get the price from any Block Explorer. So is that just how you determine the cost basis? Because as we know, the price of, let's say it's, bitcoin can vary depending on what country you're in. Of course, I know we're talking about the US. But still, even recently there was kind of this question of what was the high that bitcoin reached back in the 2017 bubble? And it turned out if you look at Coin market cap, because that's using sort of like a global reference, it's higher than US. Exchanges. So, yeah, just for a miner, then, would they have to kind of try to pick a US. Price? You know what.
00:24:04.110 - 00:24:36.882, Speaker C: I mean? For us, we run full nodes as well. So I think that gives you a little bit more granular detail than using, like, a Block Explorer, like Blockchain.com or Bitcoin.com or a Block Explorer. So running a full node allows you to essentially look at the exact timestamp, look at the exact cost basis. As you mentioned, even finding that USD value can vary depending on if it's listed on a Coinbase, a finance, a Kraken. I think you've covered in some of your previous podcasts some arbitrage opportunities back in 15 and 16 where US bases would buy on a US.
00:24:36.882 - 00:25:08.094, Speaker C: Exchange and then sell in Asia and then get the arbitrage opportunity between the two listed prices. So we've definitely seen that the price is not always consistent, and it really just depends on kind of what you're using. We use multiple price feeds. We run full nodes. So we have kind of a different ability than, I'd say, an individual. I imagine CoinTracker is using the same types of technology. So I think as an individual, it's a little bit harder to figure out exactly what cost basis and what USD value you should use.
00:25:08.094 - 00:25:14.000, Speaker C: But by running a full node, it gives you a little bit more granularity than just using a Block Explorer, for example.
00:25:14.450 - 00:25:44.098, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, running a full node is a great option. And all these crypto tax software, they rely on these pricing data providers. So what these data providers do is they combine pricing from various sources and they kind of clean up those bad actors and other bad prices and we rely on the market value coming from those pricing data providers as well in conjunction with running your own nodes and directly getting the price feeds from the exchanges.
00:25:44.274 - 00:25:56.640, Speaker A: And just so I'm clear, so on a node it's not like you're going to get a USD price, it's more that you will know the exact moment of time, is that what it is? And then you can use that against the index, is that what you're saying?
00:25:57.250 - 00:26:40.554, Speaker C: Pretty much. I mean, for a node it just gives you a little bit more granularity into the timestamp, into the amount, into the fees that were paid and things like that. You can still find that in a Block Explorer as well if you entered in the transaction hash or the address. So it's not like it gives you completely different information, just a little bit more granular detail. But as Shion mentioned, typically using like a pricing aggregator in my opinion, I think CoinGecko has kind of taken that top spot versus a Coin market cap, especially recently, especially after the acquisition and we've seen some gamifying of the data with CoinMarketCap in the last year or so. But I think CoinGecko has been a very trusted resource that we've seen. Yeah, we'll leave that out for now.
00:26:40.554 - 00:27:00.690, Speaker C: But CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, probably the two biggest ones there might be. But CoinGecko is one that we think has done a really great job of as you know, pricing out or aggregating some of these additional price feeds, cleaning up the prices and giving you kind of one universal price that you can use across multiple exchanges.
00:27:01.030 - 00:27:10.902, Speaker A: And then earlier we did reference like if you earn crypto, so let's say some employer does pay you in crypto, then how would that be? Taxed? Yeah.
00:27:10.956 - 00:27:35.326, Speaker B: So there's two levels of taxation. There's taxes that employer has to take care of and there's another level of taxation for the employee. For the employer, you got to pay your typical payroll taxes and et cetera. So that's a whole nother administrative burden on them. But there are major companies like Coinbase and if you elect to do so, you can get paid in crypto. So it's pretty common. So that's the employer side of things.
00:27:35.326 - 00:28:10.934, Speaker B: As an employee, if it's properly included on your W two or 1099 and in USD that's pretty easy. You just kind of plug that into the return and you're fine. But in most cases, employers in this space are not super educated. They're still new and they're startups. Sometimes they just kind of send out like hey, here's some coins, here's some bitcoins as your compensation. In that case it becomes employee or the contractor's responsibility to have detailed records of every. Time you receive those coins, the value of those coins and you got to sum it up and that should go on your taxes.
00:28:10.934 - 00:28:23.354, Speaker B: So again, that's another situation where these crypto tax software could come in handy because as soon as you enter timestamp it can convert the coins into USD and it just shows you what needs to be included on the tax return.
00:28:23.552 - 00:28:37.070, Speaker A: And then what about I mean, I know this isn't super common, but it does happen. What about peer to peer transactions that don't involve an know, something kind of like a local Bitcoins or Paxful? How do you handle that?
00:28:37.220 - 00:29:45.826, Speaker C: For us specifically, it's a little bit trickier than using like a Coinbase or binance where you have an API key or a CSV set. But one of the things that we offer, and I believe CoinTracker does as well, is the ability to have a custom CSV or a manual entry where you can actually manually enter in the specific data set. So if you're using like a BISC or a local Bitcoin or another provider that's more peer to peer, there's still an additional element of having to track that yourself and then enter that in. And that's kind of how we are looking at it right now because of the nature of the I know sometimes the exchange is not even the best word or like decentralized exchange or for Biscuit for example, there's not really like a company behind it. So it gets a little tricky because there's not like a customer support person or like a tech team that will be able to provide you a transaction detail. So it just becomes a little bit more tricky for the average investor, but at the same time to be fully transparent, the average investor in crypto in my opinion is not really using those services yet. They're typically going with a Coinbase, a Kraken if they're US, a Gemini, one of those US based exchanges that have a fiat on ramp.
00:29:45.826 - 00:30:32.310, Speaker C: And that's another differentiator I think as well is most of these peer to peer exchanges don't give you the ability to go from dollars into crypto and they're normally crypto to crypto. So you'd still have to use another fiat on ramp to gain crypto. Let's say you $100 into Bitcoin, bitcoin into your BISC account, bitcoin into whatever asset type you like. So typically that's another distinction is with a BISC or a local Bitcoins, you're not able to put dollars in and then trade with them. You're having to deposit crypto in, then use that crypto. So there's a little bit more advancedness I guess to using those platforms where the average new user, and I could be absolutely wrong, but the average new user is typically looking for a fiat on ramp. They're looking for someone that can help custody and hold their coins for them.
00:30:32.310 - 00:30:54.350, Speaker C: And those centralized providers really provide that in a neat, easy to use most of the time in a mobile app. So I guess that's my perspective. But if you're using those we and I believe CoinTracker does as well, gives you the opportunity to manual enter those singular or putting them into a CSV and then adding a complete CSV file in so you can still account for that, it adds an extra step or two.
00:30:54.500 - 00:31:25.974, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk about some of the more obscure types of crypto transactions that may actually really appeal to my audience, such as yield farming and staking and validating and earning interest in all kinds of stuff. But first, we're going to have a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn and spend crypto all in one place. Earn up to 8.5% per year on your BTC. Download the Crypto.com
00:31:25.974 - 00:31:49.230, Speaker A: app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on BTC and more than 20 other coins. Once in the app, you can apply for the Crypto.com Metal card, which pays you up to 8% cash back instantly. Reserve years now in the Crypto.com app. Back to my conversation with Dan Hanum and shehan Chandra Sekara. All right, so let's walk through some of these more obscure crypto events.
00:31:49.230 - 00:32:02.530, Speaker A: Let's start with yield farming because that was quite the craziness last year. I'm sure this is going to make a lot of people's taxes a bit more complex this year. What information do they need and how do they determine cost basis, et cetera?
00:32:02.950 - 00:32:29.930, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say it's a mess. There's so many layers of taxation for a typical yield farming type of transaction. For those of you who don't know, typically what happens is you buy a certain type of coin in an ERC 20 type of environment and then you earn some type of governance token and then you lend the governance token again on another platform and you can just do it on a multiple layers.
00:32:30.430 - 00:32:32.800, Speaker A: It's like Russian nesting dolls or something.
00:32:33.650 - 00:33:05.138, Speaker B: Yeah. And on the top of that, there are other platforms who kind of help you optimize your entire strategy. Again, it's a tax nightmare. Again, luckily, there are tools that kind of kind of help you kind of figure out those. Either interest income, the PNL based type of accounting, meaning you have an entry price and exit price, and then the difference is A-P-L the profit or loss, and then you pay taxes on that. So again, it's an emerging area. IRS probably doesn't even know that this exists.
00:33:05.138 - 00:33:18.566, Speaker B: But again, we had just had to work with what we have from 2014. So it's challenging, but there's enough guidance there to infer the right tax implications for those transactions.
00:33:18.758 - 00:33:38.098, Speaker A: Which is what? That? Because, for instance, with the Sushi swap thing, when you start providing liquidity to uniswap and then you receive the Sushi is the cost basis just whatever the Sushi is trading at, at that moment or how do you so in the.
00:33:38.104 - 00:34:20.526, Speaker B: Case of uniswap, that's a whole different conversation. But usually the easy way to think about uniswap is that you're providing liquidity and then you close your position with your liquidity pool. If there's a difference, then you're going to pay taxes on the PNL, the profit and loss. So that's just a uniswap how I think it should be taxed. Although I know once you put the coins into a liquidity pool that the ratio changes and it just doesn't make sense for anybody to track those ratio changes and treat them as individual sale. It's just too much work for no reason. Just speaking of yield farming generally, again, everybody's doing it a different way.
00:34:20.526 - 00:34:42.360, Speaker B: Every platform is doing in a different way. Every time you earn something like a governance token or earn interest, that's treated as order income and that establishes the cost basis for that token. And then when you later sell it, you got to pay capital gain taxes on the difference between the cost basis and the sales price. And then you do this multiple times and you just got to make sure that you track all of them.
00:34:42.970 - 00:34:57.530, Speaker A: Okay, so the value for the sushi when they were doing that vampire mining on uniswap would be just whatever it was trading for at that, like whatever the trading price was for sushi. Is that the cost basis?
00:34:58.110 - 00:35:10.510, Speaker B: That is correct. Again, it's not know direct tax guns that has been issued by the IRA. This is how I think it should be treated in a more practical way because there's nobody to answer these questions except.
00:35:12.290 - 00:36:31.660, Speaker C: Yeah, there's still a lot of gray area in the inference between what's written and using other guidance to kind of put together what we would recommend. The good thing from a pure accounting or tax perspective as far as on the opposite side of how are they taxed, but then how can you track this and how can you easily and accurately report this? The good thing is because a lot of these platforms, whether it's a uniswap SushiSwap maker compound on down the list, most of the time you're interacting with a wallet address, whether that's a MetaMask or my theorem, wallet or one of these other providers. And the good thing with our software, and I believe CoinTracker as well, is you can just enter in that Wallet address. So I know in our last question we had mentioned like entering in manual entries or entering custom CSVs for the average user or even for myself, like trying to do that with DeFi or yield farming or something like that would get pretty complex. But the good thing is you can enter in an address and then we'll pull in that transaction data directly from that address, where it went, what pool you went into, what pool you came out of, things like that. So after you kind of sort through how it's taxed on the opposite side, being able to report that accurately and concisely and getting that into your tax forms has become a little bit easier because you're getting the distributions out to a wallet address, and then you can just enter that wallet address, and we can see the activity in that address.
00:36:32.350 - 00:36:49.550, Speaker A: And obviously with a lot of the yield farming, people were making crazy amounts of interest for allowing their tokens to be borrowed or whatever it was. So how does earning interest get taxed by the IRS?
00:36:50.370 - 00:37:28.858, Speaker B: Yeah, generally speaking, earning interest at the time you receive it, you just had to pay taxes based on the market value. That interest is taxed as order income. Again, I know it sounds like interest, but technically speaking, it's not considered interest because for you to earn interest income, you got to put money in a certain institution. So in this case, we are not dealing with money instead of money, we are putting property. So the technical, I would say it's more like other income, but either way, the tax freedom is the same. You just got to pay order income taxes at the time you receive it, equivalent to the market value at the time you receive it.
00:37:29.024 - 00:37:32.874, Speaker A: Okay, so it depends on what your income bracket is, what amount you're going to pay.
00:37:32.992 - 00:37:34.202, Speaker B: That's correct. Yeah.
00:37:34.336 - 00:37:57.794, Speaker C: Then you'd have a separate form for that as well. And I think that may be a segment we'll get into as far as what are the tax forms, what are they used for. But with the Schedule One, you'll have a listing of that income that comes in, which is separate than an 89 49 or a Schedule D or some of these other tax forms that are kind of more focused on a purchase or a sale of an asset versus just the interest or income that comes in.
00:37:57.992 - 00:38:18.540, Speaker A: Okay, so this is interesting because basically so for people doing yield farming, depending on the complexity of the transactions that they're doing, they could be paying capital gains taxes in addition to ordinary income taxes, even if it looks like kind of like a single cycle of yield farming. Is that right?
00:38:19.230 - 00:38:58.490, Speaker B: So I actually wrote a post about this. In my opinion, when you say yield farming, it consists of at least seven to eight transactions, meaning you're opening up a loan, you're getting interest, and then you're selling the second token to another one. And all those different layers of transaction have different ways of getting taxed, and your entire tax bill depends on the summation of those 708 transactions. So it is really hard to say. Okay, how should yield farming be taxed? It's hard to say because every platform is doing a different way, and then that yield farming phenomena consists of different, like, at least 708 transactions.
00:38:59.870 - 00:39:20.618, Speaker A: Okay. All right, well, super fun for you guys, and I'm sure the IRS is going to love this when they really get into it. Okay, so another new thing that well, it's not really new, but with Ethereum 2.0, it became a bigger thing with staking or validating. How does that kind of activity get taxed?
00:39:20.794 - 00:40:15.220, Speaker B: Okay, I'll start with Ethereum 2.0 because that's the big news because ethereum is the second biggest currency with the market cap. So again, we still don't know how it's going to look like in the real world because I hear some exchanges are providing some type of liquidity token while your original, I don't know, 20 or 32 ethereum are being locked in the ethereum to smart contract. So again, I actually explained this on my tour as well. We can speculate how it's going to look like, but we just don't know how exactly this will play out in the real world. But generally speaking about staking, like something like Tazos, the conservative way to treat is that at the time you receive those staking rewards, you had to pay order income taxes based on your income tax bracket. So that's the most conservative way to go about that.
00:40:15.590 - 00:40:52.170, Speaker A: All right, yeah, no, that is true because there are different ways to stake. And I did do an episode with James Slazis of Dharma Capital because they launched Liquid Staking, I think is the name of the company. And yeah, I do think they're giving people tokens because I think you can do like a fraction rather than the full 32 E as your deposit. Okay, interesting. All right, so we briefly did talk about airdrops, but why don't we go through that in terms of what people need to know and report for their taxes?
00:40:52.910 - 00:41:38.342, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we covered some of it in the sense that a traditional AirDrop would just be taxable ordinary income from the income that comes in from that AirDrop. Most of the time, especially with an Airdrop, a lot of the times, especially, like, maybe hardcore bitcoin users that have been around for a few years, whether it's BSV or BCH or some of these, there's like 100 different bitcoin forks. A lot of times they'll not want to keep the fork and they'll actually trade that fork right back in for additional bitcoin. So it kind of just depends on what you do with that AirDrop, what you do with that fork. And then with the AirDrop, we went through kind of how you could track that, how you could report that. I think Chian mentioned the Uni AirDrop or like the one inch AirDrop. Those were kind of pretty large airdrops this year where it kind of depended on how many addresses you use to interact with the protocol.
00:41:38.342 - 00:42:19.674, Speaker C: So with Uniswap, you could actually have 100, 200, 300 different wall addresses that all interacted and all received an AirDrop. So it becomes a little complex, but using software like either of ours really allows you to kind of simplify that process. So the income that you'd receive from the AirDrop would just be included among other income, whether it's mining, whether it's staking, whether that's interest or quote unquote, interest, and then what you do with that asset moving forward. If you keep that asset, then you go into that holding period. If you trade that asset in, same thing, holding period, gains, losses. So there's kind of duality. Not necessarily there's a double tax, but there's just multiple factors of once you receive that AirDrop, what you do with it.
00:42:19.674 - 00:43:22.730, Speaker C: But the AirDrop itself would largely be considered taxable income. That comes, you know, as we mentioned, figuring out what the USD value of that AirDrop when you received it. And then we've seen know, as Shion mentioned, and I think anyone that kind of lives in this space, there's a lot of gray area and a lot of lack of guidance around an AirDrop. And when do you actually own that AirDrop? So do you own that AirDrop when it hits your wallet? Do you own that AirDrop when you actually claim that token? Do you use that AirDrop when you actually move that token? So there's a lot of gray area in the sense that we really just haven't had clear guidance directly from the IRS. So firms like ours, our tax attorneys, sheehan CoinTracker other platforms in the space, try to typically recommend more of a conservative approach. At the end of the day, you are putting your names on these tax forms, so you have a little bit of optionality of what to do. But we typically recommend taking a conservative approach and then listing that income along with any other income that you're getting from your crypto asset activity.
00:43:23.250 - 00:44:07.050, Speaker A: Yeah, and one other factor with the AirDrop and also the fork would be if you have those coins on an exchange, when that exchange makes those coins available to you. Because as we all remember from when bitcoin forked into bitcoin cash and bitcoin, I think there were several exchanges, coinbase probably being the most famous one, where people could not access their bitcoin cash until four months later, or more than four months later. So I guess that would then affect your cost basis. Right? Because if the price at the time of the fork is different from the price at the time that you receive it on the exchange, then you would have a different cost basis.
00:44:07.710 - 00:44:08.650, Speaker C: Yeah, correct.
00:44:08.720 - 00:44:51.660, Speaker B: So I think the concept that we are talking about here is called Dominion and Control. So Iris actually came out with the guidance in 20, 19, 24 revenue ruling. So Iris pretty much said that you have a taxable event at the time you gain dominion and control of the coins that you get. So it's not the time you claim it, because the claiming doesn't mean that you have actually control over it. It's the time that you see your coins on the wallet and you have the ability to do whatever you want with that on that specific time. That's when you have a taxable event and you got to report the order income equivalent to the market value at the time you gain the domain and control.
00:44:52.670 - 00:45:29.186, Speaker A: Okay? And I just had a realization because this has happened to me. Let's say that you have some coins in some kind of wallet and that wallet receives an AirDrop or whatever it might be, but then you cannot access that wallet anymore. Do you still owe taxes on that money? This totally happened to me, by the way. I lost a fair amount of ether. But anyway, sad story, I was trying to buy my ENS name because I knew there were like squatters after it and miserably failed.
00:45:29.218 - 00:46:11.246, Speaker B: But anyway, that's a good question. Again, I would answer that question using logic. So yeah, I mean, obviously at the time that coins hit your wallet, you have a taxable event, but if you could prove that, okay, you no longer have control over that wallet, you don't have the private keys, I don't think you should recognize income. It just doesn't make any sense because you don't have the dominion. You have the dominion, but you don't have the control over that wallet because you just don't have access to it. So I would not record it, but at the same time, I would not claim a loss because that might raise a red flag to the IRS. So it just disregarded.
00:46:11.246 - 00:46:13.380, Speaker B: And I know it's sad, but what can we.
00:46:16.630 - 00:46:37.754, Speaker A: So we, I think we went through pretty much all the major transactions that people know, be interested in. There might be some others that I didn't think of, but I think that's pretty comprehensive. But then there are actually certain things that people might do with their crypto that they don't need to report or that wouldn't be taxed. So what are some examples of those?
00:46:37.952 - 00:47:43.738, Speaker C: I mean, honestly, at this point, with the treatment of it as property, there's really not that many that don't come under some sort of tax. I think the clear one is using dollars to purchase crypto. So if you go in into an exchange and you put in $100 and buy bitcoin, ethereum, et cetera, that itself is not a taxable event. But then tracking that cost basis and figuring out what you did with that token moving forward would be I think that's a clear one is the purchase of crypto with fiat or using dollars to purchase crypto is one that's not necessarily a taxable event, but would likely need to be tracked depending on what you do. As far as other ones, there's not really that many as far as anytime you make a trade as we walk through, there's kind of a misconception of using crypto and purchasing another crypto that, that should be considered a purchase. But as the treatment of property, you're essentially selling one piece of property and acquiring another piece of property. So that crypto to crypto transaction typically covers 95% of all activity, whether it's some type of yield farming, some type of just trading, then we get into margin trading, futures options, derivatives, and those all have taxable events.
00:47:43.738 - 00:47:55.266, Speaker C: So pretty. Unfortunately for the US based taxpayer, there is not that many buckets or types of transactions that aren't taxable in some regard. But I don't know if she had any that didn't come to mind for me.
00:47:55.448 - 00:48:30.538, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll give you two more example in addition to what Dan mentioned, because this is a question that I get all the time. Transfers between exchanges and wallets that you own are not taxable. It doesn't matter your portfolio is worth million bucks or $10 million. If you're transferring from Coinbase, which you own, to another exchange of wallet that you own, it's not taxable. So that's the second one. The third one is if you're receiving a gift or if you're sending out a gift. Those are not reportable transactions, because if I'm receiving like a gift that's not income.
00:48:30.538 - 00:48:42.050, Speaker B: Of course you would say yes to that crypto question on page 1040, but there's no tax obligation. So I would say those are the other two situations that you could have something to do with crypto, but there's no taxes.
00:48:42.710 - 00:49:32.180, Speaker C: Just to add on to that, not necessarily with another aspect, but I think what we got, especially back in 2017 or 2018, was some users that were like, why do I need to upload my wallet addresses? There's no taxable events, all I'm doing is transferring back and forth. But seeing that transfer allows us to then probably attract that cost basis between exchanges, between wallets, between protocols, so that when you make that purchase, we can see what lot or depending if you're using FIFO, LIFO, Hyo or specific ID where that came from. So put that out there as well, because I think we get a lot of questions, I imagine Coin tracker does as well of why do you need to see my wallets? There's no taxable events that are occurring in the wallet, specifically if you're just transferring back and forth. But seeing those transfers allows us to have a complete flow of funds that we can look at and then be able to track cost basis according to your transaction flow. So I just wanted to add that in because it's definitely a frequent question that we see a lot.
00:49:32.550 - 00:50:02.320, Speaker A: Yeah, and for people who don't know that LIFO, FIFO, whatever, is just last in, first out, first in, first out, which are different ways to determine cost basis for your taxes. But as they were saying earlier in the episode, specific idea is even better because then you can really do the tax loss harvesting really well. Okay. And one other thing is, what about stablecoin purchases or transactions? How are those taxed or do they even need to be reported or whatever.
00:50:03.410 - 00:50:38.490, Speaker B: The purchases using USD stable coins, it's not taxable. There are some stable coins. Theoretically, they are pegged to USD one to one, but there's some minor fluctuations sometimes zero point 99 1.1. I mean, unfortunately, if you want to be really conservative, those are like taxable events for those minus zero one or plus zero one. But on an annual basis, if you're constantly transacting with stable coins, those fluctuations kind of evens out. So that's my take on that.
00:50:38.640 - 00:50:46.358, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, maybe just in case you'd want to do it, but it's not going to have a huge material impact.
00:50:46.534 - 00:50:47.258, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:50:47.424 - 00:51:24.870, Speaker A: All right, because we've been talking about some of the kind of different forms and this issue with the wallets versus the exchanges. But I am curious, what are exchanges typically doing in terms of the types of forms they're sending out? I actually looked myself and it doesn't appear that there's kind of like a general standard for the way people are doing it because Cash app sends a 1099 B and Coinbase sends a 1099 MISC. So what are all the different forms that people might receive and how would that affect what they would do with their taxes?
00:51:25.610 - 00:52:25.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the simple answer is what our exchange is doing not enough? It's been an issue for quite some time and we haven't seen much precedence. Even an example is Coinbase was actually sued by the IRS for transaction data for customer records and still has not really given much thought or effort to having a robust solution. So from an exchange perspective or even a service provider perspective, we haven't really seen much attention or much care for the individual taxpayers. It's make sure you come in, make sure you pay your trading fees, and then good luck on the back end. So we're now starting to see more exchanges, especially this year with the movement of the 1040 and increased IRS enforcement, not only from enforcement, but investment, that exchanges and service providers are really starting to care more about. How do we serve our customers on the back end. As far as the forms, I think we both kind of smirked a little bit when we heard the 1099 B or 1099K or 1099 miscellaneous, because we've seen multiple forms that really don't provide a comprehensive report.
00:52:25.340 - 00:52:57.634, Speaker C: She had mentioned earlier, if you're using like a TD Ameritrade or an ETrade, typically an investor is using one platform and all that activity is happening on that platform. So I come into Schwab and I put in $100 and I make some trades, and then at the end of the year, I have my 1099 and then I'm pretty much done with crypto. The average investor that we've seen with our data set is using anywhere between six to ten different exchanges. Then they're using anywhere between ten to 15 different wallets. And that's an average user. We have some users that are using hundreds of different exchanges, hundreds of different wallets. They're making hundreds of thousands, not millions of transactions every year.
00:52:57.634 - 00:53:50.722, Speaker C: They have automated bots. You can get pretty crazy with it, but yeah, I think the value of, and not to shill either of our platforms too hard, but I think the value of our platforms is we've kind of gone in and do a lot of the grunt work for our customers and our clients. Instead of having to put together a spreadsheet from Binance and Coinbase and Gemini and Kraken and all these other things, we allow you to aggregate all your exchange activity, all your wallet activity. We do all kind of the messy hard work for you and then spit out these nice clean tax forms that you can either file yourself, send your tax professional. I believe we both have like TurboTax integrations where you can one click and drag and drop right into TurboTax and be done. So yeah, we've definitely seen exchanges and service providers not really care too much just yet. We're starting to see that from a partnership perspective as well, where exchanges are now looking for both of our platforms to help them handle their clients.
00:53:50.722 - 00:54:34.370, Speaker C: You mentioned like staking platforms before. We've seen like Slingshot or Staked or some of these other platforms that are understanding that what they're doing on the platform has a taxable event. Same thing with like a lolly, a fold. These other providers are now starting to realize that if they can provide easy to use and accurate tax software for their clients, it makes it a more enjoyable experience. So not to get on too much of a tangent there, but I think we're starting to see exchanges care. Our platforms and our softwares really do a lot of the dirty work for you, of Aggregating, all of that. And I think that's where the complexity of crypto comes from is that you're trading on five or ten different venues, you're trading between ten or 20 different blockchains that all have different ways to view them, you're trading between different wallets and things like that.
00:54:34.370 - 00:55:05.610, Speaker C: So the more complexity you have, the more you typically need to use a software like one of ours. But that's just my opinion and my perspective. But on the it really doesn't give the taxpayer, unless the taxpayer is just using Coinbase. Like if you sign in, all you do is put dollars in Coinbase. You make your trades just on Coinbase, you do nothing else. Then there's some ability to say those tax forms are useful, but the vast majority of people in crypto are not using one exchange. They're not using one wallet, they're using multiple.
00:55:05.610 - 00:55:17.710, Speaker C: And when you start mixing wallets, you start mixing blockchains, the ability to track your cost basis accurately, reliably and quickly becomes a little bit harder. And then that's where our software kind of comes in to help that process for our clients.
00:55:17.870 - 00:55:41.240, Speaker A: So you're essentially saying like, these forms are old, they are from kind of the time before crypto and so none of them is really perfect for reporting crypto. And so that's why we're not seeing the exchanges kind of like pick. One form to send. And then it sounds like you're also saying that even for you, this provider in this space, you're not really using the forms. Is that what I'm getting?
00:55:41.770 - 00:55:43.660, Speaker C: Pretty much for us.
00:55:44.830 - 00:56:16.958, Speaker B: Let me tell you the fundamental problem that we are having in the crypto space, right? So if you're dealing with TD Ameritrade or Morgan, it's easy for them to internally track the basis because of the nature of the space. And if I'm moving stocks from TD Amergrade to JPMorgan, they communicate with each other. So when I get the 1099 V from JPMorgan, they know my cost basis. But in the crypto space, if I transfer my coins from my ledger to Coinbase, I cannot expect Coinbase to know my cost basis.
00:56:17.054 - 00:56:17.458, Speaker A: Right.
00:56:17.544 - 00:56:44.762, Speaker B: This is the problem, and this is the reason why we don't have uniformity when it comes to information reporting. And it's not the exchange's fault, it's just the space. And that's why we need tools like Cointrack and Zen ledger, because we are those third party intermediaries that aggregates all those sources and give the taxpayer what they need. And we are the only people who can do that because we are in the middle. Exchanges cannot do that. Taxpayers cannot do that. It's too complicated.
00:56:44.762 - 00:56:50.478, Speaker B: It has to be that intermediary. So that's why these crypto tax software are super important, right?
00:56:50.564 - 00:57:12.546, Speaker A: Because you would have visibility not just to know what happens on the exchange, but even what happens in their ledger or their MetaMask or whatever. Okay, got it. All right. So, yeah, I was going to ask you a question about if someone is just using MetaMask or ledger or whatever, what they would need to do, but it sounds like really it's just that they need to plug into some kind of crypto tax software.
00:57:12.738 - 00:57:14.022, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah.
00:57:14.156 - 00:57:52.660, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so let's talk about one other new trend that it's not really involving money, but it is a kind of crypto transaction, which is NFTs became kind of a little bit of a thing this year. And by NFTs, we're talking about non fungible tokens, which are sales of digital art or collectibles. I don't really know how this is taxed, but my questions are divided into taxes from the purchaser side. So why don't we just start there? So if I'm collecting some kind of digital art, then what do I need to report or log or do I pay taxes on that?
00:57:53.030 - 00:58:26.030, Speaker C: Yeah, NFTs is definitely like a new trend in crypto that we're seeing. I think one of the benefits and one of the disadvantages is the fact that they're based on different ERC standards, most of them. So, for example, with a lot of traditional crypto, they're based on ERC. 20 TRC, ten TRC, 20 BEP two. And those are really like common standards that things can be built off of. So if you look at the crypto ecosystem, 5000 of the 10,000 tokens are some form of ERC 20. So in NFTs you have ERC 721 and 1155, which are the two main token standards that it can be built off of.
00:58:26.030 - 00:59:18.522, Speaker C: The good thing as what the NFT or non fungible token stands for is that you're not swapping these as for example, dollars, which you can swap one dollars for one dollars and it's the same thing. You're buying a specific and rare and unique form of property and the ability to track that is somewhat easy because most of the things are happening on chain. So you can see most of these platforms are using Dai or ETH or some type of crypto to purchase that transaction. If you go on like an OpenSea or a super rare or Rarible NFT platforms, you're not really able to go in with a credit card and purchase an NFT. You're using ETH or Die or some type of crypto. So seeing what you paid for it, seeing when you paid for it, seeing what that acquisition, that cost base is pretty easy. On the flip side, we're just not really seeing the velocity of those NFTs like we are with crypto.
00:59:18.522 - 01:00:01.178, Speaker C: So we're not seeing an ERC 20 token or ETH or Die being traded back and forth a million times. We're typically seeing in the concept of a lot of NFTs are based on like art, for example. So a user that's purchasing a piece of art, they're not really reselling that every day or trading that material, they may sell it later on. For example, we saw the crypto Punk sale. I know we weren't supposed to use dates, but within the last couple of weeks that went for $700,000. So we're seeing large purchases of NFTs, not only on the art side, but digital, digital music, digital content, digital creative assets as well. So we're starting to see the mixture of culture and currency come together, which I'm personally really excited about.
01:00:01.178 - 01:01:15.442, Speaker C: But as far as tracking it from a tax perspective, it's somewhat similar in the sense that you're still going to have a cost basis when you purchase that asset, whether there's not really much you can do with the asset yet. And I think that's the interesting part of NFTs is how do we make these things viewable? Do you put it on decentraland or somnium space? Can you put it into a digital art museum and have people pay a fee to view it like you would with the Louvre or Museum of Natural Art or something like that. But not to get too much on a tangent there, the tracking of the purchase is pretty standard and then because the asset is typically a 721 or 1155, being able to track where that asset went is pretty easy. And then if you sell that back into ETH or Die or USDC or whatever, then you'd have a similar accounting method, just like you would with a traditional crypto where cost basis, how long did you hold it, what did you sell it for and things like that. So it does become similar because a lot of times you're not able to purchase with dollars and then you're not able to sell that back into dollars. So even like the crypto punk reference I just brought up, that wasn't a sale into dollars. Crypto is used to purchase that asset from someone who paid crypto to purchase it originally, if that makes sense.
01:01:15.442 - 01:01:30.566, Speaker C: So because it's still kind of in that crypto ecosystem and not hitting these fiat rails, you're not seeing some of the complexity that could come with the accounting. So I know that's a little bit of a tangent there, but hopefully that gives a little bit of kind of clarity and context to NFTs.
01:01:30.758 - 01:01:37.686, Speaker A: Okay. And then I'm assuming for the creator their income from that is just taxes normal ordinary income.
01:01:37.878 - 01:01:46.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean if you're in the business of creating art yeah, it's just like getting paid in USD. Instead you're getting paid in some type of yeah.
01:01:46.450 - 01:02:13.240, Speaker A: Okay. And then I don't know if this is different or if know similar, but what about the people that are creating their own social tokens? Like there's Alex Masmidge who created Alex and then Marguerite Descartesl created Coin because they're kind of like creating their own sort of money or economy. So I'm not sure how they handle their taxes for that.
01:02:13.930 - 01:02:52.898, Speaker B: Typically creation of something is not a taxable event. I think the question arises when that person decides to sell it for some amount of huge money. In that case, most likely the difference, the cost basis and the sales proceeds will be taxed as some type of capital gain. So I haven't seen a lot of people it's not that prevalent yet, but I'm pretty sure as we move forward we're going to see so many of these great transactions and there's always going to be a lag behind the innovation and the IRS coming and telling these specific guidance. So at that know, we just had to come up with the reasonable guidance based on what we know.
01:02:53.064 - 01:02:53.394, Speaker C: Okay.
01:02:53.432 - 01:03:23.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I think it's like their fans are earning the coin by doing different things in economy and then later there's maybe a price attached. So we're over an hour but we still have a few important questions. During the DeFi craze this past summer, gas fees on ethereum were quite high. And in general high transaction fees have been an issue for quite a while on several different blockchains. So how do those fees that people pay affect their taxes?
01:03:23.722 - 01:04:03.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean if you treat the gas fees correctly, you could get tax benefits like say that you're transferring ethereum from one wallet to another. You could add the gas fees to the basis so when you later sell that coin you would have a lesser gain because you're kind of getting the benefit of paying for that gas fee. And if you're selling in a transaction, you could reduce the sales price with the gas fee. So that way you're kind of reducing that. So again, as long as you're kind of reporting those things correctly and capturing those correctly, you can get some type of tax benefits. And again, that's where the crypto tax software come into play because there's no way that you can do these things manually.
01:04:03.910 - 01:04:17.482, Speaker A: All right. And then at the end of the year, there may have been some people who made crypto donations because most likely over the course of 2020, people did see their crypto holdings go up. So how should those donations be handled tax wise?
01:04:17.626 - 01:05:05.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I think donations are a great tool for you to reduce your taxable income. And it's just one of those situations, like rare situations where IRS kind of gives you two benefits in one transaction. So, number one, when you donate long term coins to a charity, you get to bypass the capital gain taxes. So that's huge. Number two, you get the deduction equivalent to the market value at the time you send the coin to the charity, and that deduction reduces your crypto income and also, like, non crypto income, like W, two basis income and et cetera. So, yeah, it's good, but I wouldn't make the charitable donation decision based on the taxes. I mean, you should be motivated by other things, but it's a good way to reduce your taxable income, generally speaking.
01:05:05.410 - 01:05:42.300, Speaker A: All right. There's also kind of two really popular platforms for purchasing cryptocurrency that actually don't do something that some of these other exchanges that we were discussing allow, which is they don't allow people to withdraw their crypto to their own wallets. And so that means all they can do if they would like to dispose of it or not dispose of it, but I guess gain control of those coins is they would have to sell it within the app. So how would that affect their taxes? And what I'm talking about is PayPal and Robinhood here if I didn't mention them.
01:05:42.990 - 01:06:32.378, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a great timely topic, especially with Robinhood. So, yeah, I think the problem with Robinhood and PayPal is that right now, you cannot transfer out your crypto coins from those platforms to somewhere else. So for any reason, if you want to kind of completely move out of the platform, you're left with one option. That one option is you got to cash out your crypto, get the cash and go to somewhere like Coinbase and buy your crypto. But the problem here is that when you cash out, you got to pay taxes. So that's pretty unfortunate because people should have the ability to move to another platform without having to pay taxes. But these platforms, they just work in a way that if you want to move on, you got to cash out.
01:06:32.378 - 01:06:50.320, Speaker B: Again, that's a downside. But don't get me wrong, there's so much good things that are offered by these platforms as well. Especially Robinhood, it brought like a bunch of retail millennial investors to finance and expose them to crypto. So there's good stuff, but there's bad stuff as well.
01:06:51.570 - 01:07:17.480, Speaker A: So for years the crypto industry has been advocating for certain changes to the way crypto is taxed. In particular, they would like to see what's called a de minimis exemption for crypto transactions, which means that under a certain dollar amount, crypto transactions would not be taxed. So that would enable you to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin without triggering a taxable event. What do you think the prospects are now for something like that to go through?
01:07:17.930 - 01:08:06.710, Speaker B: Yeah, so this bill was introduced, I think 2019 or something like that, and then there was COVID happened and there's a change in new administration. So I don't even know where this bill is right now, but for those of you who don't know, it pretty much said that if you're transacting under $600 or less, it's not a taxable event. So that's the bill. I mean, it's good for the adoption, but at the same time, the way that bitcoin has been soaring over the past few years, for me it works more like an investment tool or a capital asset. I don't see people spending it to buy a cup of coffee or stuff like that because I don't think it's designed to work as a currency in my opinion.
01:08:07.210 - 01:09:10.380, Speaker C: I was just about to say, I think that the nice thing about the de minimis was just the sense that and I may be wrong, but I don't think it was specifically just around bitcoin. So I'm 100% on board with sheehan and I wouldn't use my own bitcoin personally to purchase starbucks or Dunkin donuts or anything like that. But I think if you have another asset that is currently used more as a medium exchange, I mean, I personally believe know as we continue to see a price increase and stabilize in bitcoin, we'll eventually get to kind of different aspects of money that it's used for. We're kind of still in that store of value range right now. But yes, I think that's the nice thing is that it's not just for bitcoin. So if you have other assets that you prefer to use, like a tron or something like that, where there may be a higher supply, where you can easily purchase more at roughly the same cost, then it kind of makes sense. But yeah, I don't think there's been much new news and I think under the new biden administration, it's kind of a wait and see with what biden yelling and some of the new appointments, where they go, where they started and how that kind of all plays out.
01:09:10.750 - 01:09:31.438, Speaker A: Yeah, there was one other potential change that FinCEN flagged, which is the agency released a notice saying it intended to amend regulations so that so called FBAR or foreign bank and financial account requirements are applied to crypto held overseas. So what does that mean? What does that mean for crypto holders?
01:09:31.614 - 01:10:17.322, Speaker B: Yeah, so right now if you're holding crypto in a foreign exchange or location, it's not subject to FBAR reporting. FBAR is like a form that you file with the fin sen whenever you have any type of assets exceeding $10,000 in any time during the period. So to be super clear here, it's not applicable right now. The FRA is not applicable crypto right now. But in January, the fincent released like a very brief note, I think 2022 or something like that, saying that they intend to change that again. That's all they said. So if they released that, if they passed that law, if you're holding crypto in, let's say, something like finance.com,
01:10:17.322 - 01:10:28.934, Speaker B: and at any time during the year it exceeded $10,000, you would have to disclose it. It does not mean that you got to pay taxes or anything like that. You just had to disclose it under the bank secrecy act.
01:10:29.132 - 01:10:52.486, Speaker A: All right, so why don't we end on tips for 2021? Because I think we can all feel in our bones that 2021 is going to be a big year for crypto. So what are your tips for people to establish habits that would help them now, to establish now so that a year from now they can breeze through their taxes?
01:10:52.678 - 01:11:45.242, Speaker B: Okay, so just know that IRS pretty much publicly said that they are going from this educational mode to more like enforcement type of mode starting 2021. So I would say just stop playing games and just report your gains for crypto and then just make sure you answer your questions correctly. Just be aware of how crypto taxes work. Just know like little things like selling your long term crypto is always beneficial. Do taxless harvesting, make sure you donate crypto if you have gained big amount of unrealized gains. And then last but not least, make sure you use some type of crypto tax software because that's the only way you're going to know your right amount of gains and losses. And if you don't use one of those things, you're going to be all paying taxes or you're going to be understating your income and you're going to expose yourself to the IRS.
01:11:45.242 - 01:11:47.200, Speaker B: So those are my points.
01:11:48.210 - 01:11:49.614, Speaker A: Jan, what about you?
01:11:49.732 - 01:12:34.750, Speaker C: No, but I think he gave a great summary. I mean, we've seen personally with our new 2021 customers that are coming in for likely 2021 tax season. They're purchasing on average 3.8 years worth of tax forms. So we're seeing a ton of increased adoption from a compliance perspective where they're coming back and either amending 1718 1920, they may have never filed for those years and they're now filing for the first time. So we're seeing a lot of increased adoption not only from the movement of the 1040 question, but we've also seen the IRS civil and criminal divisions now with investments into crypto tax software and blockchain analytics services to now be able to go out and use those softwares for enforcement. So we're seeing not only the increased compliance on the front end, but increased enforcement on the back end.
01:12:34.750 - 01:13:09.958, Speaker C: I think Shion mentioned the tax cost privacy is a huge ability to really offset your gains. And the cool thing is that it can be used for crypto and non crypto as well. So if you have W two income, if you have stocks, bonds, those types of things, donations is a big one. And then, as we mentioned earlier, just keeping track of what you're using I think is the biggest one. Shion mentioned using a crypto tax provider. I strongly believe in both of our companies, we've raised venture capital, we have built solid teams, solid product, been around for quite some time. So using a crypto tax software is definitely a great tool.
01:13:09.958 - 01:13:30.320, Speaker C: And then just making sure you're keeping track of what you're using as we started the conversation worth, you don't have to track every transaction or anything like that. Gas fees can be included in those wallet addresses, as we mentioned. So just really making sure you're tracking what you're using and then using a crypto tax software is really kind of like the bow on the end, I guess.
01:13:30.770 - 01:13:42.946, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, thank you for helping me give listeners a very comprehensive show where can people learn more about each of you and ZenLedger and CoinTracker and crypto taxes in general.
01:13:43.128 - 01:13:59.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty active on Twitter, my handle is at the cryptocpa, so it's pretty easy to find. If you need a crypto tax software tool, you can go to CoinTracker IO or you can go to Coinbase Tax Center. We are directly integrated there as well.
01:14:00.270 - 01:14:26.010, Speaker C: Yeah, as she had mentioned, my handle is not as nice. My handle is just Dhanam. Dhannum eight. Pretty active on Twitter. Our website is just ZenLedger IO. And I think one thing that may be interesting to some of your listeners as well, that may have outside crypto activity is in addition to our do it yourself options, we also have fully prepared tax professional plans. So we have a team of tax professionals standing by that can help you with your crypto and non crypto activity.
01:14:26.010 - 01:14:43.000, Speaker C: So if you just want someone to do it for you, sign off on it. And I think that's a big thing. We're seeing a lot of users that they want to make sure if the IRS comes knocking, they're knocking on the tax professional door, not their door. So just another thing that may be interesting for some of your viewers that may have activity outside of crypto that just are looking for someone who can handle both.
01:14:43.530 - 01:14:47.330, Speaker A: Great, well, thank you both so much for coming on Unchained.
01:14:47.410 - 01:14:48.758, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
