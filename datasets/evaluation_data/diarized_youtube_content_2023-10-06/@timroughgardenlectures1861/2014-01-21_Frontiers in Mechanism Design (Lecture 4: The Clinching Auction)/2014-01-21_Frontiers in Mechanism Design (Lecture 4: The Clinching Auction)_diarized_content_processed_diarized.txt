00:00:03.850 - 00:00:47.354, Speaker A: So one thing that's kind of bizarre is actually that that final theorem we did about the exposed incentive compatibility of that auction. Actually don't know who to credit that to. I haven't seen that precise statement actually stated anywhere. So I'm sort of drawing from four different papers from the mean I'll post them on the, on the course site if you want to have a look. But it anyways, yeah. So sort of drawing from what seems like a circle of ideas more than any one particular source. Okay, so time to move on to scenario number four, which happily, by and large will be easier than the unit demand setting we just did.
00:00:47.354 - 00:01:26.258, Speaker A: There's one nontrivial complexity which shows up, which is the main reason I want to spend some time on scenario four. Plus it'll be a cool auction. That's another good reason. And then again, looking ahead, so what we're starting out with this class the first three weeks or so is I basically want to focus on the tractable special cases where we can get everything we want, everything I want. I mean, we get a really strong incentive guarantee. So for ascending auctions, it's this epic guarantee. We get total surplus maximization and we get it using auctions which are computationally tractable.
00:01:26.354 - 00:01:26.614, Speaker B: Okay?
00:01:26.652 - 00:02:08.230, Speaker A: So there'll be lots of situations where it's simply impossible to get all of those things. And what I'm doing in these first few weeks is trying to give you a really thorough grounding with when we can get all of it. And so next week will be the culmination of that and it'll be this very fundamental class of preferences called substitutes. And the way I'm sort of structuring this is, I want to make it so that that in some sense will be the convex whole of everything we've seen so far. So we're looking at all these different scenarios that on the one hand are fundamental in their own right like theory of unit demand. Bidders, I think is very nice and very rich. But on the other hand, I think it'll be much easier to understand these so called substitute preferences with all these special cases to kind of fall back on that's kind of the bigger picture.
00:02:08.230 - 00:02:44.834, Speaker A: All right, so scenario four. So we're looking at multi unit auctions, meaning we're going to go back to the identical goods case. So scenario one, you might recall, was identical goods and unit demand. So now we're going to relax, generalize the unit demand assumption and it's going to be what's called downward sloping valuations. So we have M identical goods, but people in general want more than one.
00:02:44.952 - 00:02:45.620, Speaker B: Okay?
00:02:47.110 - 00:03:09.830, Speaker A: And so the way we're going to model this is vij is going to be your marginal value of getting a Jth copy of the good given that you already have J minus one. And so these as usual, will be known only to the bidders. So the private marginal value of Jth units.
00:03:10.570 - 00:03:11.030, Speaker B: Okay?
00:03:11.100 - 00:03:43.410, Speaker A: So if I give you some amount x of goods. Then I sum up these Vijs for all J at most x to get your overall value for all x of the goods. All right? So this is clearly not unit demand. So unit demand would be the special case where these are zero. Whenever J is two or more, that would be unit demand. Right? But downward sloping we will assume that VI is non increasing.
00:03:45.030 - 00:03:45.538, Speaker B: Okay?
00:03:45.624 - 00:03:54.150, Speaker A: And as you'll see, we're going to use this assumption over and over again. This problem gets a lot harder without this assumption. We may or may not talk about it later in the quarter.
00:03:55.210 - 00:03:55.960, Speaker B: Okay.
00:03:58.190 - 00:04:04.614, Speaker A: Good. So our goal is the usual one. We want an ascending auction with all the good properties.
00:04:04.742 - 00:04:05.130, Speaker B: Okay?
00:04:05.200 - 00:04:43.750, Speaker A: So epic and surplus maximizing and so on. And as usual, it might be a good idea to start with a sanity check and just ask, well, at least can we have a DSIC direct revelation version? And again, because it's surplus maximization, we sort of know what we should be doing. We should be doing the VCG mechanism. And I know you all know what this is, but there's a reason I'm doing this. So in the VCG mechanism, you just ask people for the private valuation and then the allocation rules. You're just like, okay, let's take the bids at face value and maximize.
00:04:44.650 - 00:04:45.398, Speaker B: Okay?
00:04:45.564 - 00:05:27.650, Speaker A: And so the thing I want to focus on right now is I want to understand that for scenario number four, surplus maximization is actually a pretty understandable problem. It's not that hard to do in particular, it's polynomial time, but even beyond that, it has some nice structure. So think about this for a second. The allocation rule of the VCG mechanism is max surplus with respect to the BIJS. So obviously you could enumerate over all feasible allocations and just pick the best one. But there's definitely a better way to a smarter way to do this. What kind of algorithm is sufficient for this? Just a greedy algorithm.
00:05:27.650 - 00:06:26.722, Speaker A: So basically you take all the BIJS for all I and all J, you just sort them from high to low and you just take the top M of them, the highest M. Okay? So with two bidders that may maybe you're giving seven to one of them and three to the other. Maybe they're interleaved, maybe b one of one was the biggest, b one of two was the second biggest and b two of one was the next biggest and so on. But whatever. Okay, so greedy is good enough. So that's what I want you to notice at the and then, you know, you have your usual VCG payments charge externalities and we're again going to be shooting for an ascending implementation that simulates the VCG outcome. So it's again going to be essential that we have a sort of better, more structured understanding of what these payments are to have any hope of having them fall out of some ascending implementation.
00:06:26.722 - 00:07:05.380, Speaker A: We need some understanding better than just that abstract one. And we'll do that, do that when we get there. But at least the fact that the allocation rule is so simple indeed, I mean, this is even simpler than in scenario number three unit demand. It was polynomial time, but it was matching, right? Matching is not a trivial problem. This is kind of a trivial problem. So that bodes well. So why spend any time on the scenario at all? Well, there is sort of a new challenge here, which is our approach from the unit demand setting through Walrazian equilibria is not going to work for scenario four.
00:07:05.380 - 00:07:48.238, Speaker A: So VCG outcome need not be in equilibrium. Now, while Razen equilibria I only defined for unit demand bidders, but it's quite straightforward to extend the definition to say this situation. So again you would just say unsold goods have price zero. And now you'd say instead of everybody getting their favorite good, everybody would get their favorite quantity at the current prices. Okay, so there's some four goods and they each have some price. And then I have some value for four goods and I'd subtract the sum of the prices on the four goods and it should be of any quantities that I could possibly have with respect to the current prices, I get my favorite quantity. So that would be a Walrazian equilibrium.
00:07:48.238 - 00:08:23.626, Speaker A: Again, prices and then an allocation. And so the claim is that here, the VCG outcome need not be one of these Walrazian equilibrium. It's sort of interesting because if you think about it, in the unit demand case, actually we proved a whole bunch of things, all of which were operating nontrivial. First, for these unit demand bidders in scenario three, we showed that there exists a rise in equilibrium, which again operori is not obvious at all. And for more general preferences, you'll even lose existence. So first, there exists 1. Second, there exists a smallest one that's component wise, smaller than any other waze in equilibrium.
00:08:23.626 - 00:08:50.840, Speaker A: Third, the VCG payments were always at most any waze in equilibrium. But then fourth, you actually have a quality at the smallest one between the VCG payment waze in equilibrium. For this setting, you still have those first three properties. There still exist waze in equilibria, they're still the smallest one and all of them still upper bound BCG payments. We just lose the fourth, we lose equality. It could be the BCG payments are strictly less than every Walras in equilibrium. I'll show you an example.
00:08:50.840 - 00:09:45.734, Speaker A: All I need are two bidders and two goods. So suppose we have one bidder with an additive valuation, just gets two units of value for each good that it gets. And then we have one unit demand bidder who only wants one good and is willing to pay one for one good. So the VCG outcome. So how do you maximize surplus? Well, clearly should just give both goods to bidder one was it pay? It pays the externality. So it takes the surplus that it rips away from other people by virtue of it being there. If it wasn't there, then bidder two would get its good for a value of one.
00:09:45.734 - 00:10:15.330, Speaker A: It doesn't get anything with bidder one there. So the externality is one so that's its payment. Bidder one gets two units and the total payment equals one. Because remember VCG, it doesn't really assign a price to each good per se. It assigns a payment to each bidder with unit demand. It was natural to induce. It gave you induced payment price on goods which is just what did the winner of it pay.
00:10:15.330 - 00:11:08.386, Speaker A: So in this context it's just the total payment of the bidder one is two. Sorry, is one for the two goods. Now could this arise as a wazi and equilibrium? And again waze in equilibrium you actually have by definition you put the prices on the goods. Okay, well to simulate the visa Giacom at Wazan equilibrium, bidder one has to pay one total. So the sum of the prices on the two items is going to be one. So it could only correspond to a wallwise in equilibrium price Q with total price one. Which means one of the prices is less than one because they sum to one.
00:11:08.386 - 00:11:34.700, Speaker A: They're both non negative. But to be able to arise in equilibrium and for bidder two to get nothing, it has to be happy getting nothing. Okay, but if there's some good out there with a price less than one, then this bidder is like, dude, I would have totally paid that for that good, I would have paid one for it. So bidder two is going to be unhappy if the sum of the prices is exactly one. So that's the sense in which you cannot realize a VCG outcome in general with a Wazan equilibrium, the prices are just too low.
00:11:45.490 - 00:11:46.400, Speaker B: All right.
00:11:46.850 - 00:12:51.960, Speaker A: And so on the exercises I'll ask you to think more about Wawas and Equilibria in this scenario because again, a lot of the nice properties still hold, just not this coincidence between the VCG payments and the smallest of the warrants in equilibrium. So how can we go forward? How can we pursue the possibility of an ascending auction in scenario four? So we can't get VCG outcome and smallest warranty equilibrium because they're not the same. So we have to pick. So either we could try to shoot for an epic auction with a non VCG but was in equilibrium, maybe small boss in equilibrium outcome. Or we could give up on the was in equilibrium property and just try to get VCG. But we have to do one of these. One would be challenging.
00:12:51.960 - 00:13:03.340, Speaker A: Okay, so at some future point, I'm still trying to figure out when. So later we'll show that one is impossible.
00:13:05.840 - 00:13:06.590, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:10.160 - 00:13:25.744, Speaker A: So one thing which I'll put on the exercise set is just kind of a very special case of this, which is if you just try to implement even just say like a direct revelation mechanism. So suppose you just ask people for their valuations. There is the smallest walls in equilibrium, just charge them that.
00:13:25.862 - 00:13:26.144, Speaker B: Okay?
00:13:26.182 - 00:13:51.332, Speaker A: So the first thing that we're going to just note is that's not DSIC. So if you don't use the VCG payments, but instead you use the walls in equilibrium payments, it doesn't work. Those of you who maybe remember something we talked about in passing last quarter, we talked about something called demand reduction. And that's kind of the problem with trying to use these rise in equilibrium prices. The problem is that a bidder might have an incentive to get fewer goods, but much cheaper.
00:13:51.476 - 00:13:51.940, Speaker B: Okay?
00:13:52.030 - 00:14:19.620, Speaker A: And so the VCG prices are lower precisely to take away the incentive for that kind of demand reduction. Now that just shows one particular approach doesn't work. Really what's going on here is that if you want to be surplus maximizing so we talked about this in single parameter mechanisms last quarter, where if you fix the allocation rule, it pins down the payment rule up to a constant. And there is an analog of that for the problems we're talking about here. And at some point I'll figure out a time to say more about it.
00:14:19.690 - 00:14:20.310, Speaker B: Okay?
00:14:21.080 - 00:14:29.300, Speaker A: But again, the high level bit here is that if we want a surplus maximizing auction, it's just not going to work for incentives to simulate any other payment rule.
00:14:29.380 - 00:14:29.864, Speaker B: Okay?
00:14:29.982 - 00:14:40.204, Speaker A: So we just have to punt on laws in equilibrium. It's just not going to work. So that's what I'll do next. So coming up next we're going to do this.
00:14:40.322 - 00:14:40.990, Speaker B: Okay?
00:14:45.520 - 00:15:02.752, Speaker A: All right, good. Frankly, the whole approach, the whole order of operations in accomplishing this is going to be exactly the same it was in scenario three. Happily, kind of every single step is considerably easier.
00:15:02.896 - 00:15:03.444, Speaker B: Okay?
00:15:03.562 - 00:15:58.596, Speaker A: But so the first step is we're going to say, well, we already mentioned this. If we're shooting for these VCG prices, let's have a better, simpler understanding of what they actually are. We're not going to have an ascending auction that just goes to these very abstract externality charging payments. So what's important is so we understand what the allocation rule looks like over here in this scenario four, let's understand what the payments look like. So VCG payments revisited. All right, so what do I mean by charge externalities? So again, what does this mean? This means max possible surplus for others. Okay, so you imagine deleting I and now just optimizing purely for the other N minus one people.
00:15:58.596 - 00:16:16.440, Speaker A: So obviously in a multi unit auction that would mean you just look at all ways to allocate these M goods where bidder I gets zero of them, all M are given to the other N minus one people and then you subtract the surplus of the others in the VCG outcome.
00:16:17.340 - 00:16:17.752, Speaker B: Okay?
00:16:17.806 - 00:16:27.308, Speaker A: So in other words, you look at the surplus of the other N minus one people if you optimize purely for them, minus their share of the surplus when you optimize for all N people.
00:16:27.474 - 00:16:27.852, Speaker B: Okay?
00:16:27.906 - 00:16:59.112, Speaker A: So again, this is the completely general definition. So now let's think about what that looks like for multi unit auctions, okay? And we're going to use the fact that surplus maximization is a greedy algorithm. And again, this should feel even better than scenario three. Scenario three, we had these two matching problems. Now we just have these. Each of these is just the outcome of some greedy algorithm where I'm running here, I'm running the greedy algorithm here. I'm running it on a subset of the bids as here with eyes.
00:16:59.112 - 00:17:02.600, Speaker A: All of the bij is deleted when I run this algorithm.
00:17:03.660 - 00:17:04.360, Speaker B: Okay?
00:17:04.510 - 00:18:01.624, Speaker A: So what is this, what is this expression in blue? So fix I, and let's say it gets xi units in the VCG outcome. And so what I want to do here is I want to look at other bidders Bkjs in sorted order from high to low. And this is exactly the relevant input for this computation. So for the max surplus deleting i, what would I do? I would sort all the Bkjs for K not equal to I, and then I would just take the top M. Now the relevant regions. So from high to low here. So first we have amongst all of these other Bkjs.
00:18:01.624 - 00:18:27.264, Speaker A: And again, remember, by downward sloping, these appear, these are just sort of each person's. Again, think about the truthful bids. Each valuation is already sorted high to low. So this is just some interleaved version of different people's sorted valuations. So over here, of all of these, we have the highest M minus xi. Again, xi is how many bidder I gets. So maybe there's 100 units overall.
00:18:27.264 - 00:18:29.780, Speaker A: This guy got ten. So these are the top 90.
00:18:29.930 - 00:18:30.630, Speaker B: Okay?
00:18:31.880 - 00:19:26.200, Speaker A: Then we have the next region, which are the next xi highest, and then we have everybody else. Okay, these are the rest. So these top guys, which of these two computations do they participate in? Which of those two allocations? Both, right? So when I is there, it's only to get ten. So 90 go to other people and who do they go to? They go to the highest Bkjs, okay? In both these xi guys or ten guys, these are really important. These are precisely the Bkjs that get allocated after I delete I from the optimization problem.
00:19:26.350 - 00:19:26.664, Speaker B: Okay?
00:19:26.702 - 00:19:41.664, Speaker A: So these are ten units that were not allocated to these other N minus one bidders I delete I, and now suddenly they are. So the sum of the Bkjs of these xi units is exactly the increase in surplus to the other N minus one people.
00:19:41.862 - 00:19:42.512, Speaker B: Okay?
00:19:42.646 - 00:19:50.050, Speaker A: So in other words, the difference between those blue quantities is exactly the sum of the Bkjs in this region here.
00:19:50.440 - 00:19:51.190, Speaker B: Okay?
00:19:55.640 - 00:20:11.880, Speaker A: So only after deleting I, and then these really are irrelevant. We could imagine even just deleting these from the input if we wanted. Okay, so good. So that sounds simple and it is.
00:20:11.950 - 00:20:12.216, Speaker B: All right.
00:20:12.238 - 00:20:22.092, Speaker A: But so let's actually articulate this structure in a way that'll be useful for us in a way that we could imagine maybe computing with an ascending option.
00:20:22.146 - 00:20:22.316, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:22.338 - 00:20:43.120, Speaker A: So what we're doing now is we're having the analog of reformulating this as smallest las and equilibrium. We're going to reformulate it as something actually even simpler. Okay, so equivalent. All right. Yeah. Okay. So bitter I gets some Xi units, like ten units.
00:20:43.120 - 00:21:12.200, Speaker A: And the overall payment of bitter I is exactly the same sum of these Xi things, like ten things. So it's going to be convenient to kind of ascribe even though VCG just gives sort of an overall price that Bitter I has to pay, it's useful to kind of think of that as there being a price for each of the Xi goods that it gets. So it gets xi goods. We're going to think of these Xi Bkjs as supplying those Xi prices for the different goods. And notice those are different prices.
00:21:12.280 - 00:21:12.524, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:12.562 - 00:21:58.524, Speaker A: These in general will be different numbers. So specifically, let's think about, let me actually define so this is for some good that I actually gets in VCG. So we can write this as the this is a little bit of a mouthful. So what I'm going to do is for the first good that biddereye gets, I'm going to charge it the lowest of these Xi. So the first good is its highest value. And that is the good that's going to be given the lowest price. And so then for each successive good that it gets, its marginal value will be going down and down and down.
00:21:58.524 - 00:22:00.476, Speaker A: And the price I'm going to be attributing to it will be going up.
00:22:00.498 - 00:22:01.470, Speaker B: And up and up.
00:22:02.400 - 00:22:13.650, Speaker A: So M minus J plus one highest BKL where here K is somebody other than I.
00:22:14.100 - 00:22:14.850, Speaker B: Okay?
00:22:15.220 - 00:22:36.010, Speaker A: So for example, when J equals one, that just says for the first good that bidder I was granted, I'm going to think of charging the lowest of these Xi bids to it. For the second good, that's the price. For the third good, that's the price. For the fourth good, that's the price. And so on, these are sorted high to low. So these prices are going up. That's all this says here.
00:22:36.010 - 00:23:12.790, Speaker A: And so one way we can understand the VCG payments is just for a bidder I that's granted J goods. It's paying this or it's paying this formula for each of the units that it gets. So some things to note, we've already talked about this. So first of all, just by definition. So what I'm trying to point out is there's some kind of, in effect, we're taking some kind of supply and demand curves and crossing them. That's basically what's going on in this mechanism. So just by assumption, by downward sloping, we have this property.
00:23:12.790 - 00:24:12.260, Speaker A: So the value for each incremental unit is going down and down and down. By the way I've defined these VCG prices, they're going up. So at the end and so therefore for all of them, it's going to be the case that V I of Xi is at least P I of Xi. So the price I'm charging for the highest and therefore for all of the units is at most the smallest value and hence all of the values of all the units you got. So why is that true? Well, we just need to check the last one. So the price for the last guy is just going to be this BKJ. And when I is actually in the computation, all of the XIs that are allocated intersperse with this top region, that's because they were allocated.
00:24:12.260 - 00:25:13.672, Speaker A: So these are people who lose when I is in the picture. Okay, so all of these Bkjs are lower than the top Xi of the ones that belong to I for the same reason, if I go one more in this sequence, the inequality flips. So V I Xi plus one is at most again, I can define this equally well for any J, so let me actually do that, okay, for exactly the same reason. Okay, so for the Xi plus one, bid of bidder I, that was actually not allocated by the VCG mechanism, which means it didn't make it in the top M. By contrast, if I plug in Xi plus one here all of a sudden, I'm talking about this bid, which is part of the top m. So this was in part of the top m. And this was not.
00:25:13.672 - 00:25:49.024, Speaker A: So this is smaller. And so again, the way to think about this is just there's basically some values, marginal values by the bidder. And then in effect, implicit in the VCG mechanism is some sort of price schedule. So it's like, oh, you want, well for the first good it'll cost you this, or you want another that'll cost you this, another, okay, that'll cost you this. With some increasing price schedule and what, the VC mechanism is implicitly doing it's for each bidder, looking where they cross and it's giving the bidder I exactly the units for the region where the values are at least the prices.
00:25:49.152 - 00:25:49.830, Speaker B: Okay?
00:25:50.760 - 00:26:18.296, Speaker A: And again, one thing to notice as you'd sort of expect, so these VCG prices, this is totally independent as you'd expect in a DSIC mechanism independent of I's reports. So one way to think about it is just the other N minus one bidders bid, they bid whatever they bid as a function only of their N minus one bid. So all of their Bkjs, that fixes the PIJs.
00:26:18.408 - 00:26:18.684, Speaker B: Okay?
00:26:18.722 - 00:26:49.384, Speaker A: So you can think there's actually sort of a rise in equilibrium interpretation here, although the prices are bidder specific. Okay, so arisen equilibrium. We have these just single set of prices, one for each good, and every bidder walks up, faces the same prices, picks their favorite here. And this is sort of a general statement about DSIC mechanisms just for a bidder I as a function of what the other bidders bid. Now all of a sudden, it's, again like you're walking into a supermarket or it's really here. It's like sort of a pez dispenser of goods if you're old enough to know what a pez dispenser is. Right.
00:26:49.384 - 00:27:25.540, Speaker A: And so we're basically each good that comes out of the pez dispenser has a price tag and each one is higher than before. And the obvious thing to do is just keep taking them until your marginal value for the next one decreases the price tag on the next item coming out of the pez dispenser. So what this is saying is, in effect, what the VCG mechanism does for you. It looks at the other bids, it sets up these price tags, and then it optimizes on your behalf. It gives you exactly the optimal quantity at that price schedule, given your values. Okay, good. One more thing I want to say about the VCG prices.
00:27:25.540 - 00:28:06.412, Speaker A: Right, okay, so why am I not happy? Okay, so this is progress. I mean, I think intuitively, this seems very well structured, very sensible. Again, remember, we're trying to simulate these in an ascending auction. Ultimately, we don't know what it's going to look like yet, but we want to compute these. And this is still looking much more like something in a direct revelation mechanism. I'm really referencing all of the bids of all the other people, so I'd have that in a direct revelation implementation. But the point of an ascending implementation is kind of to obviously, you do learn people's bids or values in an Iterative auction.
00:28:06.412 - 00:28:30.040, Speaker A: Like in the English auction, the original one, you learn when people drop out, so you can back out what their valuations were if they're playing truthfully. But you sort of learn them on a need to know basis. And this doesn't have that flavor, this expression, this kind of references all of the bids. So I want to do one more step and sort of reformulate this yet again, so it has more of this flavor of something you could learn on a need to know basis.
00:28:32.220 - 00:28:32.664, Speaker B: All right?
00:28:32.702 - 00:29:15.530, Speaker A: And it's kind of immediate, no hard work here. So also equivalent. So now I want to define it in terms of demand queries. So again, ultimately we're going to have some auction where we're going to have some price, we're going to ask people what they want. So I want some version of PIJ that references people's demands. So let me tell you so what is a demand in the context of scenario four? Well, it's just going to be at a given price per item, what's your optimal quantity? So let's just say the maximum number of goods j. So that VI of J is greater than Q.
00:29:15.530 - 00:29:55.670, Speaker A: So if I tell you that you have to pay Q dollars per unit for this to make sense. It has to be downward sloping. I've used that over and over again. Right, so your value per unit is only going down. So to know how many units you want before you should stop, you just go until the marginal value drops below the price per unit, and you know that's the right amount. So dab q is just how many you want at a given price q. Okay, so now here's another way to write p I of J.
00:29:56.360 - 00:29:57.110, Speaker B: Okay?
00:29:58.520 - 00:30:17.292, Speaker A: So let's just take J equal one for starters. So J equal one is the Nth thing here, okay? So it's just the value of whatever is in this box. So there's some number here. So here's how I'm going to define it.
00:30:17.346 - 00:30:17.948, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:18.114 - 00:30:38.960, Speaker A: So imagine actually, what does this demand say? This demand says for a given bidder, how many values do you have above this price? And so the thing I want to notice is what's special about this threshold is if I just go slightly above this threshold, that's exactly where everybody else's demands is exactly the sum of them is exactly m minus one.
00:30:39.030 - 00:30:39.264, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:39.302 - 00:30:44.644, Speaker A: So say the 100th, say the Mth BKJ here is 173.
00:30:44.842 - 00:30:45.684, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:45.882 - 00:30:57.156, Speaker A: Now consider the price 173 plus epsilon. There's exactly 99 Bkjs out there belonging to the bidders other than I that are bigger than 173 plus epsilon.
00:30:57.268 - 00:30:57.688, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:57.774 - 00:31:11.950, Speaker A: So I can characterize the M minus J plus one th highest number in here as the infimum of all the thresholds. So that the sum of the demands I e, the sum of the Vkjs above this threshold is exactly m minus J.
00:31:12.640 - 00:31:13.390, Speaker B: Okay?
00:31:15.920 - 00:31:19.264, Speaker A: So if you don't see this in real time, it's just stare at it later.
00:31:19.302 - 00:31:19.504, Speaker B: Okay.
00:31:19.542 - 00:31:30.352, Speaker A: There's nothing. Yeah, this reminds me of a clinching option. That's exactly what we're doing. That's exactly what we're doing. There was excellent. Very good. That's right.
00:31:30.352 - 00:31:44.010, Speaker A: So this may be familiar to some of you. This was on a problem set in 364 A. Absolutely, yeah, I figured that was three months ago, so thought you might be a little rusty, but if you had to write it out and lock, that awesome.
00:31:46.540 - 00:31:47.290, Speaker B: Okay.
00:31:51.660 - 00:32:27.076, Speaker A: Your excuse for the rest of the lecture if you want it sounds like you've earned it. Okay, so good. So PIJ is where'd it go? Yeah, imp. So the smallest price at which everybody else's demands drops. A lot of the stuff I talk about, you might want to just think about the case where all of the Vijs are distinct, where there's no ties. A lot of this simplifies I'm going to do it in the general case, but that might be easier to just parse real time. I'm going to write inequality here.
00:32:27.076 - 00:32:59.708, Speaker A: It's the first time this drops to below m minus j, but if there are no ties, then this is going to be equal, it's going to be the same thing. Okay, again, the point is, just imagine kind of sweeping a threshold from right. To left, and you're asking, okay, what is the point at which there's exactly M minus L people to the left of me, and that's going to be at the M minus L plus one highest bid. So why did I do this? Well, so here's a characterization of the VCG price, which is referencing only the demands of people.
00:32:59.794 - 00:33:00.044, Speaker B: Okay?
00:33:00.082 - 00:33:17.590, Speaker A: So all I need to know are what are the quantities people want at some sequence of prices? And that actually tells me exactly what the price should be. So that's starting to feel like exactly something that would unveil itself over the course of an ascending auction. That's what we're going to do. Okay.
00:33:19.400 - 00:33:20.150, Speaker B: Good.
00:33:21.160 - 00:33:54.864, Speaker A: So as advertised, let me tell you about the clinching auction. So last quarter we did. So what I'm going to tell you now is the original clinching auction by Ozabel. So last quarter I told you about an extension of the so we're doing it historically out of order. So last quarter we talked about a variant that was motivated about problems with budgets, which is not what we're talking about now. So now we're just in the usual quasilinear model. So one reason people have been building on this mechanism is because it extends to budgets more easily than other ones.
00:33:54.864 - 00:34:43.696, Speaker A: But this quarter we're more focusing on the ascending auction aspects. So this is the original one just for welfare maximization with no budgets. But what's nice about is it gives an ascending implementation in scenario four. All right, so this again will just be one of these auctions where we start the price at zero and we raise it and we wait. So basically we have the invariant that demand is bigger than supply, and as soon as the demand drops to be supply or less, we stop. So we're trying to equalize supply and demand. Now, on the other hand, remember, we definitely don't want to terminate with the laws in equilibrium.
00:34:43.696 - 00:35:06.684, Speaker A: We want to terminate with these VCG payments. And these VCG payments charge different things for different goods, or at least the way we're thinking about them. So we want our ascending auction to have that property. Also, the English auction did not have that property. The English auction, you had this current price and all the winners paid that same price of termination. So we don't want that. We somehow want the prices to change over the course of the auction.
00:35:06.684 - 00:35:42.840, Speaker A: So we're going to sell stuff along the way, not merely at the end. The stuff we sell earlier will be at lower prices. All right, so initialize so P equals zero. So this is case I'm not gonna I'm gonna ignore, which is that even at zero price, the demand is at most M. Okay? So in that case, just give the goods away for free and you're fine. So suppose at least at price equals zero, there's sort of over demand. Okay, so ask bidders.
00:35:42.840 - 00:36:12.790, Speaker A: So at each iteration at the current price. We ask bidders how many they would want at this price. And again, remember that's just very simple, really, just asking. Look how big a prefix of your Vijs exceed P, okay? So as P goes up, there's going to be of course fewer and fewer Vijs that are bigger than P. So these demands are going to be assuming bidders, bid honestly, these di's are certainly going to be dropping over the course of the auction. So ask bidders for their dips. Those are the queries we're going to ask them.
00:36:12.790 - 00:37:19.272, Speaker A: So if again the demand has dropped, halt and I'll tell you in a second about the allocations and payments, all right, but the main loop is as simple as could be. You just keep increasing P by epsilon until the demand drops to be of most of the supply, okay? And that's going to happen eventually, obviously. Okay, so allocation. Now in the simple case, and you might want to go ahead and think about this, the simple case would be you have some iteration where the sum of these is exactly M plus one, say, and then you bump up P by epsilon and then it drops to exactly M, okay? And so that's an easy case. So if the supply equaled the demand, you would just give people the demanded quantities in that last iteration. Now in general, especially when you've discretized like this, for all we know, the total demand is going to drop from M plus one to M minus one. It'll just skip m okay.
00:37:19.272 - 00:38:13.320, Speaker A: And basically we're going to always allocate, all M of the units and we're just going to basically do it arbitrarily amongst those sort of demands right at the threshold. So formally. So the final allocation, the X eyes, each bidder I will get at. So they'll get at least as many units as they demanded in the final iteration and they'll get at most as many units as they demanded in the penultimate iteration. So the sum of these is bigger than M by assumption, the sum of these is at most M. Okay? So give them that. So units to each I subject to allocating, all items.
00:38:15.420 - 00:38:16.170, Speaker B: Okay?
00:38:17.420 - 00:39:06.950, Speaker A: And it's not going to matter how you do this, these are the only constraints that matter. But again, I mean, in the simple case, you might want to think about that the sum of these just equals M and then there's a unique choice of what to do there. So let's talk about the payments. And really for the payments, we're basically just going to copy this formula up to the epsilon. So with this understanding of VCG payment. So if you haven't done this work of sort of trying to understand the VCG payments in terms of demand queries, it's hard to see where this comes from. But given this groundwork that we've laid, hopefully these payments will seem very sensible.
00:39:06.950 - 00:39:53.850, Speaker A: So for the Jth good, that a bitter I gets. I guess I suppose bitter I gets J or more goods. And for the Jth good, we're going to insist that it pays. Okay, so there's going to be a minus epsilon, but the main point is that you do the earliest, meaning the lowest price Q. So that the demand of the rest of the bidders. So these are over the prices queue that were actually tested by the auction. So what do we have here? Here we have it in femum.
00:39:53.850 - 00:40:13.300, Speaker A: So in effect, the auction has just discretized that into multiples of epsilon. Those are the only things we actually sort of queried people's demands at. We're just saying, well, what's our best approximation of this in FEMA? Let's just look at the lowest price at which this condition held, okay? At which that was at most the first price. Yeah, the first price at which that was at most M minus J.
00:40:15.910 - 00:40:16.660, Speaker B: Okay.
00:40:20.470 - 00:41:07.020, Speaker A: Let me actually write this to be more symmetric with that min Q. Again, this refers to the prices at which this auction actually queried bidders. And this Q must exist because at the end of the auction, if nothing else, the highest price we ever tried, the sum of all of the demands was at most M. Okay? So at that point, because bidder I got at least J items, the sum of everyone else's demands has to be at most M minus J.
00:41:07.950 - 00:41:08.362, Speaker B: Okay?
00:41:08.416 - 00:41:13.434, Speaker A: So if nothing else, the price at the last iteration will satisfy this.
00:41:13.552 - 00:41:14.220, Speaker B: Okay.
00:41:16.830 - 00:41:45.480, Speaker A: So that's the clinching option, right? And this has all the properties we want. Okay, so we have to prove those things. But again, the proof is definitely easier than scenario three. But that's the whole option. Let me just make sure this makes sense. Let's just go ahead and run it in the example which had no Walraz and equilibrium. So remember we had an additive bidder value two for both.
00:41:45.480 - 00:42:36.870, Speaker A: We had a unit demand bidder. Okay? So let's try to understand what are bidders demands. So d one of q. So what does that look like? So as a function of Q, what's bidder one's demand Q hit two, right? So remember, the demand is just how many units would you want at that price? I e. How long a prefix of your valuation, of your marginal valuations exceed Q, right? So bitter one is just two, comma two. So as long as Q is less than two, both of them do. If two is at least two, none of them do.
00:42:36.870 - 00:42:40.360, Speaker A: Okay, so D one of Q.
00:42:44.830 - 00:42:45.146, Speaker B: And.
00:42:45.168 - 00:42:54.250, Speaker A: Then similarly d two of Q is one for Q in zero one and zero thereafter.
00:42:55.070 - 00:42:56.010, Speaker B: Agreed?
00:42:58.690 - 00:43:52.190, Speaker A: Okay, so then looking at the clinching auction, and let's assume that one over epsilon is an integer, then basically what's going to happen is even in the very first iteration, right? So even in the very first iteration, the demand. So think about it from bidder one's perspective, right? The demand by others is only one right, so there's two units. The demand for others is only one even at the beginning, even when the price is zero. Okay, so that basically means that bidder one will clinch its first unit at the beginning of the auction at a price of zero. Okay, so in other words, I mean, I guess ignore this minus epsilon for right now. So basically even at zero this is going to be true for J equal one. Now for this to be true for J equal two, we have to wait until the price goes up to one.
00:43:52.190 - 00:44:14.870, Speaker A: So the demand of the other person drops to zero. Okay, so then the demand of everyone else is at most M minus two, most zero. And so that price one is what the first bidder will get that second unit at. And if you remember, those are exactly the VCG prices. So bidder one was supposed to be a combined value of one for both. That's happening. Zero for the first unit, one for the second unit.
00:44:14.870 - 00:45:08.990, Speaker A: All right, so that's just sort of a toy example of the warm up. But let's actually prove that this holds in general and I want to do exactly the same. Again, order of operations for unit demand, I want to first just do an analysis under sincere bidding. And I want to show you that up to epsilons, we in some sense simulate the VCG outcome, specifically the utilities of bidders in the VCG outcome. And then as we know, that gives us something automatic for these consistent deviations. But we want to prove it works for all deviations. And happily that's much easier in this case than for the CK option for unit demand bidders.
00:45:08.990 - 00:45:20.450, Speaker A: Okay, analysis. And again, for now we'll just assume without justification, sincere bidding.
00:45:20.950 - 00:45:21.700, Speaker B: Okay?
00:45:24.230 - 00:45:51.100, Speaker A: So first I want to talk about the surplus, then I'll talk about the better utilities. So let's first at least prove that this auction, assuming since you're bidding gets the allocation right, again, not worry about the payments. So the claim is that surplus of clinching is within the number of goods times epsilon of the max possible.
00:45:52.110 - 00:45:52.860, Speaker B: Okay.
00:45:56.130 - 00:46:58.240, Speaker A: So it's pretty easy. So the benchmark is VCG and so the VCG allocates to the top Mbijs and the surplus is just the sum of those. Okay, actually with sincere bidding, let me just write v's. So that's where we'd like to be. Now assuming sincere bidding, what do we do? What does clinching do? Well, the last two iterations of the clinching auction identify two nested sets of bidders. So basically two nested sets of these Vijs. So in the last iteration it identifies a set of Vijs all bigger than P.
00:46:58.240 - 00:47:47.300, Speaker A: And again, I can understand if people don't see this, but if you don't see it's purely because you don't have the notation mapping solid yet because this is a trivial statement. So let's remember we're thinking about the final iteration of the auction when it halts. So there's some current price, p $100 or whatever. What is dip? That's just how many units do you want at $100? And again, that's just sort of what's the length of your prefix? So for how many J's is your vij exceed? 100. Okay, so a dip is just a collection. So if dip equals to ten, that's just a collection of ten Vijs that are bigger than that threshold. So by virtue of halting with the sum of the dips at most m, that corresponds to a set of these entries in people's valuations whose size is at most.
00:47:50.550 - 00:47:51.300, Speaker B: M.
00:47:56.550 - 00:48:48.750, Speaker A: So needless to say, whatever cardinality this is, these are the highest of all of the VIGS. So this is a subset of what gets allocated in VCG. And then in the penultimate iteration, we identify a similar set with a slightly lower threshold with size bigger than M. Okay? So the optimal solution corresponds to a superset of B one and a strict subset of B two. And so we allocate to all of B one and rest to B two. And so the only error we could possibly be making is on Vijs that lie between P and P minus epsilon.
00:48:48.910 - 00:48:49.282, Speaker B: Okay?
00:48:49.336 - 00:48:58.786, Speaker A: So we're just making this discretization error of up to epsilon we waste at most epsilon surplus for each of our units. So overall it was an epsilon epsilon times M surplus loss.
00:48:58.978 - 00:48:59.720, Speaker B: Okay?
00:49:05.630 - 00:49:50.420, Speaker A: Any questions about that? So another way to think about it is this is doing an approximate this is approximately solving the top M sorting problem. All right? So at least the allocation is basically right. So in unit demand, we then moved on to say that the prices were basically right. So here, because it's not unit demand, it's actually a little awkward to try to talk sort of directly about prices. So instead what I want to do is I want to talk about Bitter utilities, which if you think about it, when you reason about deviations, that's what you actually care about. You just want to say bitter's utility is basically the same no matter how it deviates. So as long as we preserve those, well, all of the usual arguments will.
00:49:50.420 - 00:50:26.610, Speaker A: So this was the assertion, this is one and this is the proof of one. So here's the assertion. Two, that the clinching auction basically has the same bidder utilities as the VCG outcome. So for all bidders I utility in the clinching auction, assuming everybody bids sincerely, is equal to the utility in VCG up to plus minus M times epsilon.
00:50:27.850 - 00:50:28.600, Speaker B: Okay?
00:50:29.610 - 00:50:32.150, Speaker A: So this is the analog of saying we got the payments right?
00:50:32.300 - 00:50:33.000, Speaker B: Okay.
00:50:39.770 - 00:51:25.190, Speaker A: Let me keep that. So let me argue this proof of two. Oh, yeah. So let me just remind you. So basically the way I'm going to prove this is I'm going to remind you the sense in which we can think about the VCG mechanism as kind of optimally solving this supply demand curve crossover point for a bidder. And then I'll argue that the clinching auction is solving almost exactly the same problem, just with sort of slightly different prices. So utility is going to be basically the same.
00:51:25.190 - 00:51:51.470, Speaker A: Let me just remind you what's up with VCG because that's one thing we're comparing to. So imagine we were actually doing VCG and everybody revealed truthfully what their private valuations were. What would things look like from I's perspective? Well, from I's perspective, before it even submits anything. So just as a function of the bids of the other bidders, the bids of the other bidders define these prices, these PIJs.
00:51:51.810 - 00:51:52.270, Speaker B: Okay?
00:51:52.340 - 00:51:55.846, Speaker A: So again, there's nothing I can do about this price schedule.
00:51:55.898 - 00:51:56.066, Speaker B: Okay?
00:51:56.088 - 00:52:31.800, Speaker A: The price tags on the pez dispenser then as a function of bidderized valuation, as a function of its value, marginal value for you to the next goods. What the VCG mechanism implicitly does is it just says well, I'll give you items at the prices until it's not worth it for you anymore. The prices only go up, your values only go down. At the point that they cross, I stop. So in other words, I can think of of the utility in VCG as being the maximum over.
