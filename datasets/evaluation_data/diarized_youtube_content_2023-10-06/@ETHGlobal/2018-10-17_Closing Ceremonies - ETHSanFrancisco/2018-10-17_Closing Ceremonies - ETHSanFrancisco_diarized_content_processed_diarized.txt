00:34:01.930 - 00:34:08.720, Speaker A: All right, we're going to get started in about two minutes with the closing ceremony. So come on down.
00:41:16.070 - 00:41:16.818, Speaker B: Hello.
00:41:16.984 - 00:41:18.178, Speaker A: I like that.
00:41:18.344 - 00:41:18.818, Speaker B: Wow.
00:41:18.904 - 00:41:19.540, Speaker A: Hey.
00:41:20.870 - 00:41:22.130, Speaker B: Holy moly.
00:41:23.750 - 00:41:31.910, Speaker A: Do BitConnect jokes get funnier when you're tired? One more time. That's enough. No more BitConnect jokes.
00:41:31.990 - 00:41:42.478, Speaker B: All right. I think people in the back, you might want to come sit up here for this one. Kind of the main event right now.
00:41:42.564 - 00:41:43.790, Speaker A: How are we feeling?
00:41:44.930 - 00:41:52.858, Speaker B: How's it going? Are you tired? You're not tired?
00:41:52.954 - 00:41:53.502, Speaker A: Come on.
00:41:53.556 - 00:41:54.430, Speaker B: Are you tired?
00:41:55.750 - 00:41:59.954, Speaker A: I'm feeling good. All right. We are going to do a little selfie in here.
00:42:00.072 - 00:42:02.318, Speaker B: Come on, people. We want to see you in this picture.
00:42:02.414 - 00:42:04.002, Speaker A: So put your hands in the air.
00:42:04.056 - 00:42:05.166, Speaker B: Put your hands in the air.
00:42:05.288 - 00:42:07.766, Speaker A: Make so you can see yourself and retweet later.
00:42:07.868 - 00:42:09.206, Speaker B: How do we actually get in there?
00:42:09.308 - 00:42:09.958, Speaker A: On three.
00:42:10.044 - 00:42:11.430, Speaker B: Well, ready?
00:42:11.500 - 00:42:16.534, Speaker A: Yeah. One, two, three. There we go.
00:42:16.572 - 00:42:28.846, Speaker B: That will be somewhere at some point. Nice. All right. We do want to hear from you. I think we should definitely put our hands together for this crazy event. Please give yourselves a huge hand. I want to hear it.
00:42:28.868 - 00:42:29.694, Speaker A: Come on.
00:42:29.892 - 00:42:30.350, Speaker B: Nice.

00:44:37.290 - 00:45:15.614, Speaker A: So when you hear your team name, come over and line up to get ready to give your demo. You will have five minutes. We are going to be very strict about five minutes. I have a little like vaudeville crook. I'm going to pull you off stage for the good of all of us to be respectful of all of our time. So our finalists auger Pro Satoshi Safu browser Extension atomic X Shard Harburger Ads Gifty Sendput Quora Splitter Converter and crypto Pay Congratulations, guys. Congratulations to our finalists.
00:45:15.662 - 00:45:29.074, Speaker B: If you can make your way up here, that's going to be awesome, because we're going to have you present one after another. So I guess first to the stage. Maybe first on that list, if you have it.
00:45:29.192 - 00:45:32.802, Speaker A: First on the list was Auger Pro.
00:45:32.936 - 00:45:33.650, Speaker B: Auger Pro.
00:45:33.720 - 00:45:34.002, Speaker A: Ready?
00:45:34.056 - 00:45:34.980, Speaker B: Come on up.
00:45:35.350 - 00:45:54.788, Speaker A: You have five minutes. 20 minutes, right? Seems important.
00:45:54.954 - 00:45:55.670, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:57.160 - 00:45:59.430, Speaker A: This is a mic here. Okay.
00:46:00.040 - 00:46:01.670, Speaker B: Borrow my mic if you want.
00:46:04.040 - 00:47:29.750, Speaker A: We work in tech. That's.
00:48:07.430 - 00:48:30.090, Speaker B: Okay. So I guess it's going to take a little bit of time to do this. Have you guys checked out the planes? I think we can hear them, like, right now. Evan, do you want to come hang out with me? He's like, no. I mean, I guess this always happens, right? It's all just building anticipation.
00:48:32.510 - 00:48:37.078, Speaker A: Which connect line do you want me to yeah, yell it out. Shout it out.
00:48:37.264 - 00:48:39.920, Speaker B: Oh, God. Yeah, do that. Do it.
00:48:42.210 - 00:48:43.758, Speaker A: I'm definitely not doing that one.
00:48:43.844 - 00:48:47.440, Speaker B: No, that's all I got.
00:48:49.170 - 00:49:00.210, Speaker A: My wife doesn't even believe in me. I don't know. I always like, the we are coming, and we are coming in waves.
00:49:00.550 - 00:49:39.136, Speaker B: That's a favorite. The first time we've had to try to do stand up comedy. I think it's the first time I've ever had to it was your idea. Beginning the end of our comedy careers. Yeah. What do you guys want us to talk about? Anything material. Face reva.
00:49:39.136 - 00:49:39.910, Speaker B: Hey.
00:49:42.440 - 00:49:43.430, Speaker A: Well, I mean.
00:49:47.340 - 00:49:48.810, Speaker B: This is a safe space.
00:49:52.780 - 00:51:01.230, Speaker A: There'S. It.
00:51:03.200 - 00:51:04.220, Speaker B: Parsing.
00:51:06.080 - 00:51:07.630, Speaker A: Why don't we call another team?
00:51:08.720 - 00:51:10.350, Speaker B: I think it might be yeah.
00:51:14.980 - 00:52:13.404, Speaker A: Why don't why don't we call another team up and you can come back? Okay. Yeah, we'll do that. I have another team get that on a new laptop. Is the second team gonna work? Second team gonna work on this, or should we just but if we switch to a new team and a new laptop, everything extremely so a new laptop will work. Not a program thing. Doesn't do resolution. If we call the next team, pretty good chance it works, right? Okay, let me have my hands on a different laptop.
00:52:13.404 - 00:52:43.490, Speaker A: With with my laptop. Make sure the feed is good from here to the back of the room before we until he brings his laptop here. Make sure that we just do apologize. We're gonna switch out of that.
00:52:46.260 - 00:54:18.640, Speaker B: So apologies for the delay. We're going to do a little test on this so that the rest of the finalist presentations are very smooth. Please bear with us. Stay here, hang out. Evan, do you have the list?
00:54:18.710 - 00:55:21.632, Speaker A: Yes. All right, we're going to call the second team up while we deal with technical issues, because that always happens. Next up is Say toshi hello. Ready the adapter. I'd have to go back up. All right, I'm plugging. Can you confirm feed? Take a photo.
00:55:21.632 - 00:55:55.440, Speaker A: All right. And just for efficiency's sake, we'll have the on deck circle will be Seifu browser extension. So get ready for your turn. All right. Namila, are you coming? All right. Yeah. So we're team Satoshi, and we made a decentralized social media manager on ethereum.
00:55:55.440 - 00:57:02.052, Speaker A: And the simple idea is that anyone can connect their Twitter account and can have us tweet for them and basically get paid for us tweeting through their accounts. But the trick is that it's actually not us tweeting on their accounts, it's everyone in here. And so we've set up a dow that will act as a sort of decentralized social media manager for all these people that has sort of crypto economic primitives, similar to a token created registry, where anyone can propose a tweet for any person who's connected their account. And people in the community can vote to either approve that tweet or reject it. And that sort of contention between approvals and rejections creates sort of economic opportunity to pay the influencer. So let's jump through a quick demo. Do you want to go through? Yeah.
00:57:02.052 - 00:57:48.416, Speaker A: So east San Francisco's account is actually connected. And yeah, so you can tweet anything you want. And then if you get a quorum, which is 1% of all of the token holders, the tweet will go out after ten minutes. So let's see how that works with very bad internet right now. Cool. This is on main net as well, and if you want to join in, it's Satoshi.com and you can use your own tweet.
00:57:48.416 - 00:58:10.030, Speaker A: Tokens@satoshi.com AirDrop. Yeah. Anyone with an ETH SF GitHub can participate. Let's see. Yeah, so this proposal is being created right now. It'll probably take a little while, but let's see.
00:58:10.030 - 00:58:49.768, Speaker A: Yeah, let's look at some other ones. Let's see what other ones are like open right now. All right, there's one for Satoshi bot. What are the open tweets? Are the chairs greasy? Weird. Anyway, so basically the idea is to have anyone propose any tweet. You can do it right now and sort of vote on what is going to get tweeted out. I would suggest going to Satoshi.com
00:58:49.768 - 00:59:11.720, Speaker A: and trying to tweet for the ETH San Francisco Twitter handle because it's available right now. Thank you. Thank you.
00:59:15.710 - 00:59:27.438, Speaker B: Thank you, guys. Thank you guys so much. So we're back on track, it seems. That's awesome. Maybe we can give a little big round of applause for these guys. Come on. Good.
00:59:27.438 - 00:59:53.150, Speaker B: Okay, next up, it's Safu browser extension. Come on up. Sorry, can you just turn that just atomic x shard, please get ready to come on next.
01:00:25.530 - 01:01:01.250, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. We're presenting Seifu, our browser extension to help keep your private keys and addresses safeu. Basically, the concept here is that we noticed that a lot of us were keeping private keys and addresses in like, a text file locally. So we figured we could put in a Chrome extension instead and also add some interesting bits around us, some abusing, like an ETH call to get a bunch of balances, both balance and token balances really quickly. So here's the contract. We're going to be giving out kind of an explanation right up in utility library soon. TM.
01:01:01.250 - 01:01:44.680, Speaker A: Yeah. So like a typical wallet token scanner today is making a bunch of calls. Our approach basically just makes single calls to get many addresses, balances both ETH and the Seifu way cool. So we're going to give a brief demo on the Safeu extension. You can get it now at Safe Food XYZ. Sweet. Okay, so it was so fast you couldn't even see the loading.
01:01:44.680 - 01:02:19.084, Speaker A: One more time, please. All right, about a second. So that's loading 65, 200. How many tokens is that? Loading 180 tokens are loaded across four addresses, including regular ETH bounces. And so you're seeing like, the WiFi isn't the best here. So pretty instant response there. We have edit functionality, QR address.
01:02:19.084 - 01:02:51.680, Speaker A: It's fairly full fledged. We're going to continue improving on it in the next coming days and get like, a decent stable release out. And we have some Easter eggs that we'd like to show as well. So audio isn't plugged in, but if it was, you would hear first row. Got it. If anyone watches the Visnochi YouTube videos, you'll get the reference about it. Seifu chrome extension.
01:02:51.680 - 01:03:38.290, Speaker A: Congratulations. Next up is Atomic X Shard. And in the on deck circle by that sign right there. Let's have Herburger ads come down. Coming up, guys. Hey, everyone. So we implemented some sharding stuff.
01:03:38.290 - 01:04:20.886, Speaker A: We worked on the sorry, getting distracted by the feed. Okay, we're good on the feed. So we worked off of this sharding solution. So we had this sharding proof of concept that we started working on in Berlin where we had two shards. Now we went up to this big tree of shards, like any number of shards with a great visualization. And now we used to have just messages from two shards with or beside each other in the tree. But now we can do routing across the shards and we can move shards in the sharding solution.
01:04:20.886 - 01:04:57.630, Speaker A: And we implemented this all in the last couple of days and even had to do some research on the fly. But I would say let's take a look at the simulation. You guys see that? Yeah. So we have some shards here. They're oriented like this thing on the left. So a shard is like, connected with an edge underneath. If it's following the parent shard and it follows the parent shard to maintain consistency, these arrows that you see is the messages being routed across the shards.
01:04:57.630 - 01:05:31.410, Speaker A: When this countdown goes to zero, there's a good chance, like quite a high chance that we're going to see the shards move around. There it is. Oh, it happened a little early. The Shard three went and is no longer a child of Shard One and is now instead a child of Shard Four. And now messages, if they are going to be routed again, will route through Shard Four to get to Shard Three. Whereas like before, they would have routed through just Shard One. So we have the routing system also being kind of preserved by these operations to move the shards around.
01:05:31.410 - 01:06:41.522, Speaker A: And the point of that is basically to do load balancing. Anyone want to say anything else? I can keep going. Yeah. So the core idea here is that for as long as if there is a cross shard transaction and the message is sent between two shards or between any number of shards to the intermediate shards, then it will never be the case that some of the blocks containing the message are approved in some shards and in other short, the blocks that receive the message or send the message are not approved. So either at the end all the blocks are finalized that had the message being routed or not a single block of them is finalized. And so that enables executing cross shard transactions that touch any number of shards. Yeah, the way that I describe that kind of technically is that if the protocol has liveness, then your transaction will either be completely orphaned and not make a single dent on the blockchain state or the route will be completely complete and from origin chain to the end chain.
01:06:41.522 - 01:07:21.620, Speaker A: Oh, check it out. The shard is changing directions right now, changing orientation. This last shard on the bottom, it got orphaned by its parent and didn't have its new parent pick it up yet. And so it is momentarily an orphan shard that didn't have a parent at all in terms of its fork choice. And then it found its parent in number four. And that actually turns out to be just fine for the routing too, because the routing tables keep track of where the messages are going and the child gets picked up before any messages arrive to it. Because we have this like once in time message delivery model once in an order, as you know, we would like to have.
01:07:21.620 - 01:07:56.270, Speaker A: And the other cool thing is that because it's like a kind of 4K consensus protocol, we can achieve really theoretically optimal kind of overhead where we have relatively small number of orphans and a relatively large number of finalized blocks. Although we haven't done any displaying of the finality. These visualizations, by the way, show each a sliding window of the, of the tips of the fork choice. And these individual lines here show messages from the same validator. Let's follow this guy. The message is being routed here from shard seven to shard three. That's a decent number of hops.
01:07:56.270 - 01:08:21.254, Speaker A: We got like messages coming in the same color from both directions. It's kind of confusing. Normally they'd be different colors oh, there we go. So we got like the full route complete from shards, like seven to three. And now we're going to see in a moment the shards change orientation again and we're going to see, hopefully the shard be orphan for a moment, not have any parents. There we go. Then it's gone.
01:08:21.254 - 01:08:34.490, Speaker A: It was only orphan for a moment that time. I hope you like it. And check it out. It's open source. Find it on GitHub.
01:08:43.810 - 01:08:55.460, Speaker B: Way to go. All right, next up we have Harburger ads and can gifty go prep for coming up after. Welcome, guys.
01:09:03.670 - 01:09:38.346, Speaker A: How's it going? So we were really excited about the concept of Harburger taxes. It's been a hot topic lately because of Glenn Wheels new book, Radical Markets. He also did a paper with Vitalik and Zoe Hitzig the concept of herberger taxes. If you're not familiar with it, I first knew about it because well, let me tell you about it first. So you would self evaluate property. In doing so, you agree to pay taxes on it. If you were to say your property is very cheap, pay very low taxes.
01:09:38.346 - 01:10:09.126, Speaker A: If you were to say your property is very expensive, you'd pay expensive taxes. The kicker is that whatever you say your property is valued at, it becomes for sale at that number. So you have to be willing to sort of give an accurate number of what this property means to you because somebody can just buy it away from you. So you might want to protect it by making it really expensive, but then you're stuck with really high taxes. Might make it really cheap to have low taxes, but somebody might just take it away from you. I was first familiar with it because I'm from Kentucky. I grew up around horse racing, and the most common horse race is called a claiming race.
01:10:09.126 - 01:10:52.422, Speaker A: Claiming race uses basically harbor taxes. Claims race means that you want to race your horse, you put it into $1,000. Claims race, all the horses that go into this race are for sale for $1,000. If you were to have a really great horse that you know will beat all these bad horses, but everyone else knows as well because it's probably worth $10,000, you put it in this race, somebody's going to buy it from you for $1,000, you lose out $9,000 worth of horse. And so what feels like this really amazing way to force people into actually giving an accurate price for property has come up again. And we're excited to try something else with it. It's a little scary to apply this concept to houses because people live in them.
01:10:52.422 - 01:11:30.210, Speaker A: Maybe we shouldn't be experimenting with something that's so important to the livelihood of people. So we thought we'd try it out in something a little bit easier, which is advertisement spaces. So we made Harburger ads XYZ. You can see we have an interface where you can sell your ad space east san Francisco has been gracious enough to let us list on theirs. So I'll just list that. Take San Francisco.com, SF.
01:11:30.210 - 01:12:11.774, Speaker A: Hopefully the demo gods work. Put this transaction through. Once we are done, we can look for ads on my site, San Francisco. We can take this embed link and just pop over to the website. Now, we can see there is a Harburger Ads blank ad up there. Now say I come in as another user and I want to buy this ad space. I can just click this link, takes me over to the website.
01:12:11.774 - 01:12:34.440, Speaker A: I see. Currently the price is a dollar, so I want to purchase it. I say, actually this thing is way more valuable than that. It's worth $2. I want it to go to I don't know my name. I know what I do. I take it to Yahoo image URL we're going to go to@yahoo.com
01:12:34.440 - 01:13:08.946, Speaker A: and we can confirm our purchase. We pay for our transaction. In doing so, we've given the app permission to remove ERC 20s from us. We've allowed the app beforehand. Now, when we come back, we see that our Yahoo ad is at the top of the East San Francisco page. Feel free to come along, take the ad away from us and pay more for it and get taxed on the accurate price. Sorry, taxes go to the site.
01:13:08.946 - 01:13:34.106, Speaker A: Taxes go to the site owner. We use the graph for syncing our data and I think that's it. Yeah. Thanks. You all right? Fantastic. Next up is Gifty. Come on up, guys.
01:13:34.106 - 01:14:09.846, Speaker A: And send put. Get in the on deck circle, please. Thank you. HDMI or USB? Everybody. We're Gifty. My name is Alex. This is Andrew.
01:14:09.846 - 01:14:45.460, Speaker A: So we're really good friends. We've known each other since high school. We're really into cryptocurrency and crypto collectibles, but a lot of our friends and family aren't. And we really wanted at this hackathon to create a really good way of introducing people to their first crypto collectible. So one of the issues with actually sending somebody a crypto collectible is that you need to know what their address is. So what we've built is a open protocol called Gifty that allows you to send an NFT over SMS or via a URL so you can share it inside of a chat room. We're going to show you what it looks like live.
01:14:45.460 - 01:15:25.930, Speaker A: All right, so let's take a quick look here. I'm in my Coinbase Wallet app and if you notice, now next to my collectibles, there's a send button. I tap on that send button, I get a share sheet and I can now text this link over to Alex. All right, we'll switch over to Alex's device. Okay. In just a matter of moments, with Internet permitting, he'll get a text. Yeah, looks like two popped up.
01:15:25.930 - 01:16:06.592, Speaker A: So if he taps on this link in his text messages, it deep links him back into Wallet. And he's now claimed that collectible, so that's kicked a transaction off on my device. Thank you. So what happened there? Alex tapped on that link, and it sent a message to our Bridging server encrypted to let my device know that this is the address that the collectible is now going to. And we can now sign that transaction and submit it. So when the transaction is confirmed, that collectible will appear in Alex's wallet. So we designed Gifty to be an open protocol.
01:16:06.592 - 01:16:24.830, Speaker A: You can implement this inside of your own wallet application. All you have to do is implement a specific URL scheme. We also have the Bridging server. It's fully open source. It's well documented. There's a flow diagram if you do want to implement this flow. So please do go ahead and check out our GitHub, which is available via the Dev post link.
01:16:24.830 - 01:16:46.390, Speaker A: There's a flow diagram that lets you kind of see what's happening with the bridge server. It's pretty trust minimizing. You don't ever send your address to the bridge server. Unencrypted, the bridge server does not know what your collectible is, what you're trying to transfer, who you're trying to transfer it to, so you could run this yourself if you wanted to. Thank you.
01:16:52.360 - 01:17:13.484, Speaker B: Thanks, Gifty. Next up, we have sendput. If you guys could come up, set up, and also yeah, welcome. Also, Cora, if you can get ready for the next one. We're also looking for crypto pay. So if you are here, please find me or Evan now. Cool.
01:17:13.484 - 01:17:15.550, Speaker B: All right, Cora, you guys set up.
01:17:22.680 - 01:17:54.520, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Can I change the resolution on this or second, going to tweak some resolution because it's currently, like, Windows 2000. Cool. That's a little small, but it should do. Okay, awesome. So my name is Ellie Day. I'm a software engineer.
01:17:54.520 - 01:18:46.488, Speaker A: This is leanne. She's also a software engineer. We often accrue expenses related to flying out for a job interview, going to a conference, various things that will eventually be reimbursed from either our employer or a potential employer or a conference organizer. But usually because companies are slow, they have processes. It takes at least five to six weeks, even if we are right on top of submitting the expense report. So what we decided to make was something called Sendput. And the whole idea is, instead of waiting five to six weeks to get paid for your money that you're owed and that you've already spent, you can actually get a short term loan via Sendput that uses two key blockchain technologies to reduce risk and actually get people to fund these loans.
01:18:46.488 - 01:19:50.550, Speaker A: So I'm going to go straight into the demo if I can find where that window is. It's very small. So this is sendput. The way you get started is you enter in your email, I'll enter Leanne's email, and this is how you'd sign up. It's really easy because we've actually integrated with Bloom's API, which makes it really easy to know our customers and get their verified information when they're going to apply for a loan. So I'll just click get paid, and I'll hop over to Leanne's Gmail, which she logged into over here, and I guess they're thanking her for checking out Discord. I'll try to keep some of your email to a minimum, but looks like we have an email that came in and it's asking to confirm your identity with Bloom.
01:19:50.550 - 01:20:20.320, Speaker A: So the cool thing is you can actually just scan a QR code, which is provided via Bloom's SDK. It's sharekit. So once this loads, leanne will take her Bloom app and scan to confirm her identity. So there's a QR code somewhere in this Internet. It's actually going to my computer from somewhere. You know, those things often take a while. I can see things moving.
01:20:20.320 - 01:20:50.354, Speaker A: I mean, I have the image on my computer, so let me just open it up, actually. Here you go. QR code and app froze. Sorry. Cool. So can't really see it, but Leanne's going to swipe and maybe phone the phone that way it's processing with some nice little animations. It was confirmed.
01:20:50.354 - 01:21:41.426, Speaker A: So what just happened is Bloom verified her information with explicit confirmation and sent us a request with her verified information. So now we can jump over to here and we can take a look over here and we get an email saying, thanks for confirming your identity. So what happens now is Leanne can actually just forward her expense reports or outstanding expenses to us, and every time she does that, we can essentially process a loan. And every time she does, that goes on to Dharma. So this was a loan I submitted earlier, or she submitted earlier for lunch today, because just cheese and bread isn't really going to cut it after we've.
01:21:41.458 - 01:21:43.106, Speaker B: Been coding all weekend.
01:21:43.298 - 01:22:32.120, Speaker A: So this is for ten die. It's a very small expense, but if I'm a person with lots of ethereum or like crypto, and I just want to get access to a vetted source of loans, I can actually go and fill that order right from the application. And now you can see that I actually have an assortment of loans once this loads. So, yeah, that's the general idea in terms of go to market. One way to do it is to partner with companies that know they have a slow process. And just in the same way that airlines sell you travel insurance through a partner, big companies can just be like, hey, we take a while, but if you want cash sooner, just go through Sendput and yeah, it was really great using the two vendors. Yeah, thanks.
01:22:32.120 - 01:23:17.480, Speaker A: Great. Thank you, Sendput. Up next, Cora. And while they're getting up, splitter converter. Would you come up next by the sun, give it up for Cora. All right. Hey, everyone.
01:23:17.480 - 01:24:24.812, Speaker A: We'll keep this short and sweet. We know how tired everyone is, so we were focused on tackling the problem of a lack of structure when it comes to communication between different stakeholders in different crypto communities. So we've heard a lot of theoretical thought, leadership and thinking around the topic of governance, but very little done in practice. So we wanted to build a tool to help remedy that. We want to make sure that we're engaging all relevant stakeholders in conversations between different crypto communities. And we think that the current existing structures like Telegram, like Twitter, like Slack, et cetera, are not structured in a very engaging way for different stakeholders, right? So what we came up with was a tool called Cora, which is a governance tool that allows you to structure guidelines around discourse and allows for identity identification, stakeholder discussion, participation, and engagement around a distributed decision making process. So what we really want to do is provide a framework for different stakeholders to engage with each other, right? As simple as that.
01:24:24.812 - 01:25:13.260, Speaker A: And it's really all about engaging the relevant stakeholders in that discussion. So we're going to show you guys a quick demo of what we built. And we're also using identity with Bloom, so we'll dive right in. So my friend Kevin spoke about engaging the right stakeholders, right? How we are implementing that is we are assigning every stakeholder a governance token which is specific to that proposal, and that gives them rights to participate in that discussion. So let's say if I have 200 tokens, I can use them by commenting, by liking proposals, whatever I want to do with them. But once I'm out of my tokens, I cannot participate anymore. So it's a way to avoid spam and limit the involvement of every stakeholder.
01:25:13.260 - 01:26:43.438, Speaker A: So I'm just going to create a new proposal, so I'm going to create a new proposal which I would like the community to deliberate on. We chose the example of the Ethereum Community Fund, which wants to, let's say, fund two projects and would like to know the views of the community. Which one would they like to fund? Right? And in what order? Like, as in 50% goes to one project, 40% goes to another, or like, whatever balance, right. I create a description for my proposal, then I say what is like the minimum quorum of the participation tokens that should be spent for me to be able to reach a particular decision, right, exactly. Like how a quorum works. Let's say there's 75. Okay? Again, in this example, we're really using allocation to two different options.
01:26:43.438 - 01:27:49.320, Speaker A: In this case, we're using the Ethereum Community Fund as an example of how they would go about making a decision of allocating funds to two proposals that submitted for a grant. The transaction failed for some reason. I'm just going to try that again. Okay? I think I would know what the issue is. Just give me a moment. Sorry about this. MetaMask has like, failed account nons unless I refresh it.
01:27:49.320 - 01:28:36.458, Speaker A: Sorry about that. I'm just going to do it again. Okay, and now the discussion. And what I'm going to do is. Here is I'm going to prove that I am a relevant stakeholder using Bloom as the identity provider. So I'm going to scan this QR code. Yeah, I'll explain why he does it.
01:28:36.458 - 01:29:12.406, Speaker A: He's just verifying that he's a relevant stakeholder in this discussion using Bloom ID verification. So it's actually matching his email domain with the one registered with the discussion. And if he's accepted, he'll actually receive governance tokens and he'll be able to spend them to actually post a comment, engage in signaling within the discussion itself, in this case, allocation of two different resources. Right. So then he'll be able to submit a comment and this will actually average out the responses from every participant. So the core team actually has a better idea of what the relevant stakeholders actually feel about that decision. All right, thank you.
01:29:12.406 - 01:29:15.640, Speaker A: Sorry about the technical difficulties. Yeah, thank you.
01:29:16.890 - 01:29:32.218, Speaker B: Sorry we have to cut you off like that. All right. Thanks, Cora. Next is Splitter Converter, and if crypto pay can get ready nice. Glad we found you guys. Welcome to the stage. Splitter Converter.
01:29:32.218 - 01:29:34.160, Speaker B: Give some claps for that.
01:29:52.980 - 01:31:12.876, Speaker A: Greetings, fellow humans. Just going to adjust the resolution here. Okay, so my name is Chris Cassano. I'm the CTO of Deco Network, and we are building the on chain infrastructure to help DAOs find work and get paid through milestone based contract development work. So what I built for this hackathon is called Splitter Converter, and in short, it lets you to play a contract that can split and convert any incoming ethereum or dai according to the percentages specified right here. So the example use case that we're going to go with is that somebody wants me to build the next FOMO three DAP, and I say I'll build it, but I want 10% of all the profit forever, and I want it in die because I'm very risk averse. So we can deploy this contract.
01:31:12.876 - 01:32:07.808, Speaker A: And in this example, the person who's funding this project is the first address. They get 90% of any incoming funds and I get 10% as dai down here. And once it deploys, we can send some ETH and die to it and demo the rest of it. So I think that this has a few different really interesting use cases. The first is sort of like a royalties scenario where as a software engineer, instead of working hourly or per project, you can capture long term value and passive income from the projects that you work on and get a share of the profit forever. I think it's also really useful for ad hoc teams. So if you want to work with someone and you want to split the money that comes into the project a certain way and you want to do it trustlessly, you can use this.
01:32:07.808 - 01:33:24.550, Speaker A: And another great use case is even just for yourself, you could put the same receiving addresses in here and maybe you want some of your incoming ethereum to be converted to Dai because again, you're risk averse and you need to pay bills. So this would let you do that. And this uses the Kyber network to do the actual conversion. What I'm doing right now is I'm sending some ETH and some Dai to the contract that was just deployed. Give it a minute to confirm. And this is running on Robston and it's available at Slash Splitter right now, so you can feel free to give it a test if you want. Go ahead and pull up the Ether scan pages for both of these addresses so that you can see that they're empty.
01:33:24.550 - 01:34:23.070, Speaker A: They're both empty. No transactions. Looks like the ETH transaction was confirmed. Oh, and now the Dai is confirmed too. Cool. So I'm going to come back here, I'm going to click withdraw and it's going to split and convert simultaneously and send it all out where it needs to go. This is the pending transaction.
01:34:23.070 - 01:35:01.100, Speaker A: And here's just some math to demonstrate a little bit of how it works. So we sent in one ETH and we sent in ten die. Account one wanted to get 90% in ETH and account two wanted to get 10% in die. So account one should get 0.9 E and account two should get one die. And then the die is converted to ETH for account one, which is accounted for here. And the ETH is converted to die for account two.
01:35:01.100 - 01:35:26.900, Speaker A: And that's basically how it works. Here's the contract. You can see the ending addresses were 81 and 27. So 81 gets one, five 3.927 gets the 59 plus the one die. So that's it. Thank you very much, guys.
01:35:26.900 - 01:35:48.730, Speaker A: It thank you. Splitter converter. Up next, crypto pay. Come on up and in the on deck circle. Auger pro. Come on and get ready. Second time's the charm.
01:36:02.130 - 01:36:51.946, Speaker C: Hi, this is Satish here and I have my team, Sombe and Samyak. We all came from India to participate in ETH SF. So what we did as part of this hack is build a simple DAP. We named it as Crypto Pay. What we wanted to do is there is so much of community working all over the world. We wanted to create a payment link, payment gateway, kind of an interface where anybody could use it, create a link, share it with anybody all over the world and they can accept payments in crypto. Now, what we did is we integrated this with Kyber and MakerDAO and then Kyber we are using anytime, any token, anywhere feature where we can actually swap on chain, any token, so the user can pay in any coin and we will automatically swap it to Dai.
01:36:51.946 - 01:37:26.310, Speaker C: So we have taken Dai as a stable coin here because we want the person who creates the link wanted to make sure that if he wants to make sure a stable coin, we paged against USD. That's how we built it. So here is the dashboard. So what you can see here is the main stats, like how many active links are happening, how many transactions are going on right now. And then the Dai received so far. And then here on the top you can see that there is an accept payment link. When you click on it, you can get a small pop up window where you can give the description name and then you can give the die.
01:37:26.310 - 01:38:12.890, Speaker C: And then you can just create an access payments here. And then you can see that list coming up in the bottom in the table here. So if you just you can copy the link and then just share it. So this will just show up like this like a small pop up where they can integrate it with their websites or they can just share it with anybody and they can use the change token and then they can actually select any of the tokens that are available on the Kyber network and then just save it. Like I can just select the OMG and then automatically it will be converted to OMG and then I can just say pay now, it actually will pay immediately and then it will just submit the transaction on the blockchain. So I'll have some may explain a little bit more about the smart contract and how we have integrated with MakerDAO and Kyber.
01:38:14.430 - 01:38:55.186, Speaker A: So on technical background our crypto pay smart contract whenever a buyer comes to our DAP and make a transaction for example for 1.6 OMG our smart contract talks to Kyber network protocol that we have this much of OMG we want $20 worth Dai which is the example we are showing. Kyber network then will eventually send us die which will be released to the sailor. So the sailor don't want any fluctuating currency as a receiving payment. If they are providing $20 worth service, they want $20, not any currency which will fluctuate. But the user who are buying the services may have lots of token. 20 tokens, many tokens.
01:38:55.186 - 01:39:06.230, Speaker A: So they can just pay with any token. And with onchain liquidity of Kaiba network, we are converting that token into die. And the seller is getting into die similarly.
01:39:06.390 - 01:40:00.330, Speaker C: So the other use case that we have is we wanted to make sure the seller should be able to take a small CDP for the transactions that are happening from this. So they can just go and use the pay by loan option. And the pay by loan option, what automatically does is it actually creates an on the fly CDP on MakerDAO platform, takes the die that is required to be paid to the seller and it actually does everything in one transaction. So if you know the MakerDAO at creating a CDP itself is a two transactions. So we actually participated in our last hack in India and this was one of the idea that we had like we wanted to minimize the transaction and gas cost so we were able to do it here. So I can just do a pay by loan and this will automatically create a CDP. If the CDP already exists on the makerdoff with this address, it will just keep adding more ether and draw the die from that CDP.
01:40:00.330 - 01:40:38.210, Speaker C: The other important thing that we wanted to do was like what is the incentive for anybody to use this kind of platform? Because when you're anyway doing a stable coin then it is as good as fiat. So what we did is we actually created an option for settings where the seller can decide what is a percentage of split. He wants the payments into what kind of crypto here. So we have taken ether and die here as an example. 30% 70%. So we are going to on the fly split the transaction, store 30% of it in ether and 70% goes into the die so he can change his transactions. He can decide to do these changes on the fly.
01:40:38.210 - 01:41:00.746, Speaker C: So we are going to decide like we have still not completed this part we wanted to do, whether we should do a batch kind of a job to bulk transactions or we should do a transaction by transaction. We are just really thinking and we need to work more on this. So I think that's all these are the main use cases that we are trying to cover here. And same has some point that you want to make about the MakerDAO and loan?
01:41:00.858 - 01:41:24.440, Speaker A: Yeah, the loan thing. First we used loan for big payments like house, like car loans and others. Now my favorite feature about this is my favorite feature like just create loan and you can do the small loan payments with help of makerdaw protocol. Thank you.
01:41:28.010 - 01:41:45.920, Speaker B: Thanks guys. All right, we're going to have Auger pro backup. Thank you guys for coming back up here. We're going to test this out and also all of the sponsors giving prizes. Can you guys go get set up over here? We're going to be bringing you guys up soon.
01:41:46.530 - 01:41:55.436, Speaker A: Promising. Very good. All right. Woohoo.
01:41:55.548 - 01:41:56.560, Speaker B: Fantastic.
01:41:57.780 - 01:41:58.240, Speaker A: Okay.
01:41:58.310 - 01:42:24.250, Speaker D: Hey everyone. We are Auger Pro. We had some technical difficulties before. I don't know if you guys know what auger is, most of you probably do, but it's a decentralized prediction market built on top of Ethereum and anyone can make a market on auger. So someone could have made a market about whether our presentation would work this time. And.
01:42:26.380 - 01:42:27.532, Speaker A: We had the idea.
01:42:27.666 - 01:43:28.700, Speaker D: We love the technology behind auger because the decentralized Oracle and how it all works. But we wanted to build a really mobile friendly user interface to auger and we also wanted to expand the market a little bit more to show how you could use auger markets in a trading style interface, but also in a betting style interface. So this is our mobile app for iOS. And as you can see, we are connected to a hosted auger node which we deployed on Heroku. And these are live mainnet markets on auger and you can see a list right here of the featured markets that we pulled in. So max can go ahead and click on any of those. You can kind of see we give you more market info and we give you the amount of ETH at stake.
01:43:28.700 - 01:43:30.640, Speaker D: We also convert that into us.
01:43:30.710 - 01:43:31.088, Speaker A: Dollars.
01:43:31.174 - 01:43:36.192, Speaker D: How much at stake given the current price of the current trading pair of ethereum in the US.
01:43:36.246 - 01:43:36.812, Speaker A: Dollar.
01:43:36.956 - 01:44:21.520, Speaker D: And we also tell you when the market will end. We provide american style betting ODS for each market and then we also provide a time series pricing chart which really gives you the implied odds for the yes event. So the likelihood between zero and 100% that the current market thinks that that outcome will be yes. So it's really cool to be able to see the history there. And then max, you can go to the categories view. We also pull in some of the top categories of markets on auger and all these are pulling live data from auger as soon as you click into the market the category. So you can click on something like politics.
01:44:21.520 - 01:45:05.260, Speaker D: And now we see at the top there, there's even a finalized market whether kavanaugh would be confirmed. And you can see that the chart has already gone to 100%, basically even though the market ends in January because people have bid up the yes side all the way. And if you go back, you can check the trump to be reelected market. So pretty stable and yeah, that's about it. We're going to have a real test flight. We're going to post the link to that in the auger discord.
01:45:08.420 - 01:45:09.170, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:45:13.460 - 01:45:38.612, Speaker B: Yeah. So that concludes the finalists. I think we got to give all of these folks a big round of applause. Thank you guys for coming up and presenting. So glad that that worked. Okay, so as you know, there were some projects, there's some sponsor prizes that are actually coming, so we're going to be bringing up the sponsors. You guys have a couple seconds I think, to talk about the prize.
01:45:38.612 - 01:45:41.640, Speaker B: So yeah, to start off, maker.
01:45:46.540 - 01:46:19.044, Speaker A: I don't think we have to talk. Thank you everyone. We had over 15 projects work with us and I'm really glad that crypto pay got to demo because we're choosing them as our grand prize winners. They actually came out from bangalore, India for the event and we're going to give them 2500 die. No one worked on the CDP visualization actually one thank you leaving, but one person did but didn't finish. But we're instead donating or gifting that 2000 die between lending party robin bot and stable pay because you also had excellent projects. Also, maker is hosting an after party at five.
01:46:19.044 - 01:46:25.940, Speaker A: It's a mile away at the lot and thank you hackers. Thanks. New cipher.
01:46:26.100 - 01:46:27.560, Speaker B: Next up, new cipher.
01:46:31.340 - 01:47:29.016, Speaker A: That's fine. We had six projects hacking with new cipher and we wanted to award the price of $2,500 to the project called Keep well, a second, I think it was called Keep your should check it. It was a very long phrase. Keep your privacy with you. Yeah. And they created an application which shares medical data. But the interesting part is that they ported the proxy re encryption, which we did to iPhone, and it's fully working on iPhone, and it's actually very useful for us, even though we didn't ask that originally.
01:47:29.016 - 01:47:33.550, Speaker A: We didn't hope anyone will do it, but apparently they yeah.
01:47:34.160 - 01:47:38.940, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Cool. Next up seller.
01:47:39.860 - 01:48:31.536, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Mo from Seller, and this is our first ever time releasing our SDK, and it's so excited to see a lot of team building our SDK. And we're giving out three prizes. The first C Innovator price, which is the most innovative idea using Seller, goes to Slick, which is $2,500 in east. And they are building an gas smooth option market, basically. And the sea builder price, which is 500 in east, goes to air prediction. They are building a prediction market using our conditional off chain transactions. And the third price, which is a Cux it's for user experiences in off chain scalability platforms, goes to Seller Template for composite smart contract IDE.
01:48:31.536 - 01:48:42.230, Speaker A: They build a IDE with a component that you can easily compose and build, like a Seller based contract templates. So that's all. Thank you very much.
01:48:42.920 - 01:48:43.670, Speaker B: Thanks.
01:48:45.400 - 01:49:20.806, Speaker A: And next up, chainlink. Hi, everyone. I'm from Chainlink. We're a decentralized Oracle network that provides data access to APIs and off chain payments to your contracts. We had a grand prize winner in the form of micro subscription, giving them $4,000 worth of link. What they did was they had a contract watch cloud service via Chain Link. So if the cloud service didn't deliver uptime and it fell down, the cloud service no longer was paid.
01:49:20.806 - 01:50:23.402, Speaker A: And when the cloud service provided the uptime, it promised it was paid according to the performance of its guarantees, which the contract learned about using a chain link. In second place, we had Link set for $2,000 worth of link, which used a price feed to dynamically rebalance a basket of crypto tokens and trade them automatically based on price changes. And then in third place, we had B, three PO for $1,000 worth of link, where they basically had a voting scheme where they pulled in data about candidates. In each state, they populated a contract with that data about candidates, and then they allowed that contract to send out votes in the form of absentee ballots that a robot actually signed or executed on paper. And that's how you need to execute an absentee ballot. So they got a bunch of data about candidates, and then they had a robot send in absentee ballots in physical form. And so they were in third place for $1,000 in link.
01:50:23.402 - 01:50:24.460, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:50:24.910 - 01:50:28.410, Speaker B: Cool. Next up, Kyber Network.
01:50:33.670 - 01:50:59.686, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. My name is Desmond from Kyber. So we had a total of nine projects that were working with us. Building on top of our protocol, it wasn't easy to decide who was the actual winner. But we eventually decided on FET. They built a telegram bot that creates an Ethereum wallet for you so you can easily send and convert your tokens. They win a total of 3000 USD in KNC tokens.
01:50:59.686 - 01:51:16.014, Speaker A: If you don't like KNC, you can always swap it on our website. Right? So we also have honorable mentions we want to announce. We have total of four other projects. Crypto pay, robinbot splitter converter and DRB. Charge. You guys also win something. We'll contact you shortly.
01:51:16.014 - 01:51:19.540, Speaker A: I need to discuss this with my CEO, so thank you guys.
01:51:19.990 - 01:51:20.740, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:51:22.070 - 01:51:46.358, Speaker A: Next up, the graph. So many creative and useful projects this weekend. I'm Yaniv. The Graph is a query protocol. If you want to query your smart contracts using GraphQL, you can use the Graph. So we're giving two prizes today totaling $5,000. In second place for $1,500 is Margin Troll.
01:51:46.358 - 01:52:20.390, Speaker A: They built a subgraph for indexing data from the dYdX protocol. And for first place, for $3,500, a team that did an amazing presentation earlier is Harburger Ads. So they use ideas from radical markets to create a system for taxing and purchasing ad space. So thank you to all the amazing teams that built on the Graph this weekend. We're hosting a happy hour tonight, just five minutes from here at sessions from eight to 10:00 p.m.. So thanks. Hope to see you there and see you at the next hackathon.
01:52:21.130 - 01:52:26.360, Speaker B: Nice. Next up, blockboard. Welcome.
01:52:27.610 - 01:53:10.840, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. My name is Alex Paciano and I'm co founder of Blockboard. And first of all, I want to thank all the teams that was helping us to build the infrastructure and ecosystem for digitalized lending. And we have an API prize for best project with the greatest use case of our Dharma Relayer API or Lone Scan Analytics API. And I want to give this prize to the team of one person of Mark Brasso, and the project is Lone Star. And Mark built a nice native iOS application for Dharma Protocol and he was using our API for liquidity, so thanks, Mark. Yeah.
01:53:10.840 - 01:53:43.080, Speaker A: And next up set. Hey. Hey, everybody. I'm Felix from Set protocol. We're working on a bundling protocol so we can do great stuff like tokenized, ETFs or index funds. And we launched our developer platform just a few weeks ago, and we're really blown away by kind of all the developer activity happened this weekend. And we have a $3,000 prize split across three places for this weekend.
01:53:43.080 - 01:54:24.240, Speaker A: Third place goes to CAO or Chow, which built a charity platform to donate to causes and bundles of assets such as disaster kits and clothing basics. Second place is Primo Teeth, which built a way to invest in global indices in ethereum without ETH volatility exposure, using Set to bundle dYdX, short ether and like Auger Share. And first place is linkset, which built a fully trustless rebalancing set using kind of an Oracle solution, which was chainlink. That was very cool. If you're one of the winning teams, just come and get in touch with us, or we'll get in touch with you. And of course, if you're interested in what we're doing, we're hiring.
01:54:25.940 - 01:54:28.560, Speaker B: Thanks a lot. Next up, Bloom.
01:54:31.220 - 01:54:53.060, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. We had four prizes totaling $11,000. It was really hard to pick. We had over 15 entries, and I think they're truly innovative. So our first prize you may have seen Biology's tweet about a proven Merkel digital document signatures. Think of it as decentralized DocuSign that goes to Block. You sign using Bloom ID to verify those digital signatures.
01:54:53.060 - 01:55:25.340, Speaker A: Our second prize, which is one of the top ten finalists here, employee expense reimbursements take weeks or months. Sendput lets users get a fast loan using Bloom ID for financial data. They receive a $2,500 prize. And I think that's much needed in the world. Our third prize, which I think is truly, truly innovative, one of the holy grails of crypto is getting a Fiat loan. Getting a Fiat loan without a central counterparty lending party makes this impossible. With Bloom ID, they receive a $2,500 prize and then our last prize.
01:55:25.340 - 01:55:48.440, Speaker A: One of the biggest problems in journalism of the day is fake news. I think this one is absolutely just super innovative. They have a way to do cite it anonymous source, but actually prove who that person is without releasing that private information. Truly innovative. Crypto Source uses Bloom ID to make those anonymous citations verified. They receive a $3,500 prize. Thank you to everyone who submitted for Bloom API.
01:55:48.440 - 01:56:18.310, Speaker A: Next up is Quantstamp. Everyone, I'm Jared. I work with Quantstamp. We are currently betanet on Mainet protocol to do automated smart contract audits. Check us out, betanet quantstamp.com and apply to Run to be a node. The winner for the bounty and ours wins $2,000 for best improves the audit report.
01:56:18.310 - 01:56:34.570, Speaker A: And we thought that Quant stamp badge is a really simple, really clean way to display GitHub badges on solidity Quantstamp audits online. So it's really great. We're really happy. So thank you so much. Have a great day.
01:56:37.900 - 01:56:42.010, Speaker B: Next up connect. I'm saying that right.
01:56:42.780 - 01:57:21.812, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. I'm Rahul from Connect, and we're building a micro payment network based on state channels. So, first of all, I just want to thank all the developers and awesome teams that we got to talk to all throughout the weekend. We got a lot of great feedback on our own developer tools and APIs, which we're definitely going to iterate on. But without further ado, our prize for best use of our APIs for their use case was Canopy. So they're building a currency agnostic data payment protocol for data and service marketplaces. And our other prize for the most innovative project using Connect is KNXT.
01:57:21.812 - 01:57:42.252, Speaker A: Connect. So they built a decentralized version of our state channel hub using Orbitdb and IPFS so, $1,500 each. So thank you guys very much. Next up, Dharma. Hello, everybody. Hi. My name is Nadav.
01:57:42.252 - 01:58:06.724, Speaker A: I am from Dharma. Dharma is a protocol that enables borrowing and lending of crypto assets anywhere in the world. So we had two prizes that we were sponsoring. One was our kind of first place prize for the most innovative project built on top of Dharma. And then we had a runner up prize as well. We had a whopping eleven submissions that we had to sift through. And I just want to say, this is a really hard decision for us to make.
01:58:06.724 - 01:58:49.472, Speaker A: So kudos to everybody who built on top of Dharma this weekend. The runner up prize goes to Send Put. So, Send Put was up here earlier. They were building a platform that allowed employees to receive reimbursements from their employers instantly via Dharma loan, as opposed to having to wait two, three weeks for the actual reimbursement to get processed. So kudos to them. And then our first place prize for $2,500 goes to Lone Star, which was a gorgeous iOS native app that was basically like an iOS interface for borrowing and lending via Dharma. And we were just absolutely blown away by the quality of the submission.
01:58:49.472 - 01:58:51.990, Speaker A: So, great job, everybody. Thank you so much.
01:58:56.140 - 01:59:02.120, Speaker B: Are you going to Loop ring. Hey, welcome. Loop Ring.
01:59:03.100 - 01:59:18.380, Speaker A: Hi, everybody. Thank you so much. This was our first ETH Global event. We had a great time. So we had $7,000 across two project requests. The first was just build a Dex on top of Loop Ring. I should say we're an open Dex protocol.
01:59:18.380 - 02:00:13.664, Speaker A: Build a Dex, or peer to peer trading protocol. We are giving that to Looper Advanced Dex Trading Tools, who built some advanced Dex trading tools such as stop orders on the client side and did deep linking with our iOS wallet in second place for that. Or we're giving to Svotc, who built a permissioned liquidity pool using Civic as a front end to access our decks. So we'll give $500 in LRC to SV OTC and 3000 to Looper advanced Decks trading tools. Our second task was to build a smart contract for our version two protocol, which allows fees to be paid in any token kind of economic abstraction at the user level, which we have to convert into LRC to burn at the end of the day. So Crypto Pay, who you saw up here before, used Kyber network to convert our non LRC tokens. They did that in their spare time.
02:00:13.664 - 02:00:28.870, Speaker A: Super impressive. And so 1750 to them. And also Mariano from Easytrade used loop ring itself to convert the non LRC tokens. So 1750 to him as well. So, thank you, everybody.
02:00:30.520 - 02:00:31.428, Speaker B: Thank you.
02:00:31.594 - 02:00:58.670, Speaker A: Next up, coinbase wallet. Hi, everybody. My name is Pete from Coinbase. We want to help get your projects to actual users. For those of you thinking about taking your hacks to actual users to market, find us on our discord. You can find our discord link in the developer section of our website, wallet. Coinbase.com.
02:00:58.670 - 02:01:16.420, Speaker A: Our prize is worth of ETH. I'm sorry. Yeah. For best mobile optimized application. And it goes to satoshi. Congratulations, Michael. Namil, Paul and Graham.
02:01:16.420 - 02:01:17.990, Speaker A: Thank you.
02:01:18.680 - 02:01:21.060, Speaker B: So, next up, it's POA Network.
02:01:23.640 - 02:01:40.392, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Jeff with POA Network. We're a side chain of ethereum. If you're developing on ethereum, check us out. We're faster and cheaper. And who doesn't like that? We had such a hard time picking only three winners. There were so many out there. I think everyone in here deserves a round of applause for developing this weekend.
02:01:40.392 - 02:02:08.310, Speaker A: So thank you so much. Yes, exactly right, so we've got three winners. In third place, we had fungible non fungible tokens. They tokenized non fungible objects. In second place, we had 50 50 raffle, a novel use of blockchain to have a raffle. And in first place, we were really impressed with block work and the work that they were able to put through on our network. Thank you again, everyone.
02:02:08.310 - 02:02:40.584, Speaker A: And zero x protocol. Hey, everyone, I'm Tom. I work at zero x. We're a decentralized exchange protocol. I think we originally went to the hackathon with one 2500 XRX prize, but we were really blown away by the number of submissions and quality of submissions. I think people are really being creative when it comes to inventing new tokenized assets and trading those assets in new novel ways. So we're actually giving out 2500 ZRX prizes.
02:02:40.584 - 02:03:13.140, Speaker A: The first goes to primo teeth. They give access to global markets like the S and P 500 by bundling together auger and dYdX assets and then trading them on top of Zero X. Really cool. Really professionally done. Nice work. The next is Fungible non fungible tokens. They have created a way to basically decompose ownership of an NFT into multiple fungible assets and then use those assets to vote on how much the NFT should be bought or sold for, when to sell it, et cetera, using Zero X underneath.
02:03:13.140 - 02:03:18.570, Speaker A: So, congrats to both those teams. You can see us back at our booth and we can meet up. Thank you.
02:03:19.260 - 02:03:22.852, Speaker B: Thanks a lot. Thanks to all the sponsors prizes.
02:03:22.996 - 02:03:38.640, Speaker A: Yeah, big thanks to all our sponsors. They make this event possible. So now I'm going to read the gold sponsors maker new cipher. RCN Seller ZK Capital Liquidity Network.
02:03:39.140 - 02:03:57.844, Speaker B: Next up is the Silver Sponsors chainlink Consensus, Harbor Blockboard, Brave Addx Kyber Network the Graph Connect Set Scale Labs Blockchain Capital Shift auger, Quantstamp zero x Clearmatics.
02:03:57.892 - 02:04:40.192, Speaker A: And Dharma And our Bronze Sponsors compound Coinbase Wallet, Bloom Initialized Capital Gollum, iCASH dYdX Circle Crypto Baseball ECF the Ethereum Community Fund veil Gitcoin FPG Capital True USD By Trust token XYO Network token Data Wire POA Network Nervos Spark Labs amise Go loop Ring keep every DAP native the Bounties Network and Zilliqa. Thanks to all our sponsors that make this event possible. Let's give them a big round of applause.
02:04:40.256 - 02:04:58.250, Speaker B: Thanks to. All sponsors. So we're getting close to the end here, but we want to invite the co founders of ETH Global, Kartik and Liam, who've done an amazing job to the stage. Can we please give them a giant applause? Let's do that. Thanks, guys. See you later.
02:05:03.840 - 02:05:33.120, Speaker A: We'll probably just use this one. Hey, everybody. I am super tired, so I wrote things down and I'm just going to read them verbatim in case I don't miss anything. So it's so great to see everybody here. I am super happy that a lot of you are not sleeping entirely. And after 48 hours, we're coming to an end and I know that we're maybe 510 minutes away, so I'll try to make everything quick. Fingers crossed.
02:05:33.120 - 02:06:36.120, Speaker A: And I just want to thank all of you for just kind of being at this event. And we're super thrilled that this weekend kind of went through successfully and everybody had a great time. We were talking to all of our sponsors and attendees and getting feedback, and so we're super happy to see all these amazing connections and projects and just in general experiences being shared this weekend. So today, ten teams presented on stage and thanks to all of our amazing judges who did all the hard work for finding out and figuring out who those ten should be out of the 120, we kind of got to see a lot of those demos on stage live. And if you've never been to an East Global event, what kind of sets us unique is that this is not set up to be a competition. We don't have a notion of first, 2nd, 3rd places or actually, we don't even announce our official prizes other than the sponsors ones beforehand. We want this to be about kind of learning and experimentation and just being able to come down and play with the ideas and kind of see what is possible and use that as its starting point to work on iterate and just make something and just ship.
02:06:36.120 - 02:07:16.010, Speaker A: So we've never had specific ranks and kind of with all that said, the top ten teams that came up on stage are the official winners of this event. Each of the members on those teams will get two ETH as their prize. And I just want them to just want to give a big round of applause for all of our ten teams. We'll be reaching out to you over email and coordinating all of the delivery. We're going to go on the next slide for a second or we'll just switch on slides. I'm going to pass this to Liam. All right.
02:07:16.010 - 02:07:33.404, Speaker A: Oh, no. All right. Awesome. Great. So I don't know if you guys have ever run events before or have done anything like this, but it is exceedingly hard work. It is shockingly hard. How much ridiculous logistics goes into all of this.
02:07:33.404 - 02:08:15.544, Speaker A: AV, that random lamp over there, getting all the sponsors, inviting all of you. It's like months of effort. And so I really want to make sure that we get a chance to kind of take a step back and think about all the people that have put in all of this time to make this situation that we're in a reality. It's honestly really meaningful to me. We've done so much by taking this event and bringing it to the ethereum ecosystem. And there's kind of two main things that we've really been able to help in pushing it forward. The fact that we kind of come together these events every three, four months with Denver and Buenos Aires and Waterloo and Indian and all of these we're iterating as a community on this technology faster than anything I've ever seen.
02:08:15.544 - 02:08:44.288, Speaker A: We're constantly finding problems, solving them, working together. And honestly, I think that's just an immense success. So we should all be very proud of that. And so what I want to do is just bring attention to the people that have deeply believed in the vision that we're working towards and kind of made this a reality. So the first kind of group of people is the core organizing team. There's some very specific people that literally for the past several weeks, we just lost sleep trying to make all of this happen. So they are.
02:08:44.288 - 02:08:57.572, Speaker A: Andrew Dunscomb, who's our lead operations manager at ETH Global. Heather Davidson from l Four. Josh Stark. And please join me in thanking these folks. Jacob Will. Almsma Ken from eduardo Radolta. Sathia Perry.
02:08:57.572 - 02:09:10.350, Speaker A: Paul Martin. Helena Flack. Nikhil Gupta. Ethan Wilding. Shakti GOP. And Nashville. These folks have done so much to make this happen, so please honestly join me in thanking them as loud as you can.
02:09:10.350 - 02:09:50.452, Speaker A: The other folks I really want to do thank is you've probably seen them wandering around with the Buffercorn t shirts. The ETH Denver team actually flew out here specifically to help make this event a success. So specifically, John Pauler, Justin Moskvitz and Dan Shields. I think they're over there. Please join me in thanking them. There's also about 75 volunteers from not only just San Francisco, but from around the world that have flown in specifically. They just wanted to come here, be a part of the vibe and help out and make sure that everyone's having a good time, that you've seen them with white shirts.
02:09:50.452 - 02:10:42.462, Speaker A: I see a bunch of you right now. Can you please join me in thanking the volunteers who spend all this time in the weekend too? And finally, you've had the pleasure of watching them and being a part of this with us. Evan and Anna from the opening sermons and closing sermons, please join me in thanking them. They've done an awesome job as well. So I am about five minutes from concluding, and I like to go back to the slides actually, so it says one more thing, but there's actually a couple more things. I just had to submit my slides early so I couldn't change it. But today is the 7 October, 11 months and three weeks ago we hosted our first ever event, ETH Waterloo.
02:10:42.462 - 02:11:18.446, Speaker A: And back then, it was the first ever Ethereum hackathon, what was also one of the largest hackathons. It was actually also the largest hackathon in the world. We had about 500 people attend in Canada and that sparked what now is ETH Global. We've seen so many amazing things come out of this, anywhere from amazing companies, to developers, to new developers getting into this ecosystem. And as of this weekend, we have crossed over 4000 attendees from 40 plus countries in the past one year at ETH Global events. And this is just absolutely amazing. We never thought we'd get there, especially this fast.
02:11:18.446 - 02:11:53.900, Speaker A: And just to keep this momentum going, this wouldn't be an ETH Global event without announcing the next one. So without further ado, I'd like to announce our next event, which is also our official last event for this year. Eat singapore happening on December 7 in Singapore. With eat Singapore in about two months. We would have done six events successfully this year. And not only that, this cycle just keeps on repeating. We're already starting to plan what 2019 is going to look like.
02:11:53.900 - 02:12:20.582, Speaker A: That was good. Just good sound effects. We've already started to plan what 2019 looks like. By the way, you can apply for Eat Singapore right now. Applications have officially opened as of this morning. And not only that, we're also super excited to announce our first official event for 2019. It's Eat Denver, happening on February 15, and it's already set to be the biggest event we're ever going to have.
02:12:20.582 - 02:12:45.354, Speaker A: It's going to be twice the size of East San Francisco. So we're looking forward to these two events. And lastly, on logistics, we got one quick thing actually. You can check out Eatsingapore Co and Eatdenver.com to find out more about the details, as well as any other information you'd like to know about the event. And lastly, a quick logistical detail. We're about to wrap up Eat San Francisco.
02:12:45.354 - 02:13:15.960, Speaker A: And after this event, starting 05:00, we're hosting a happy hour with Maker at the Lot SF on 21, One Lombard Street. So we'll be making our way there from 05:00 and we'll go on till 08:00. And we hope to kind of see you there after kind of in a couple of hours. Hope you get some rest and get to pack up. And before we leave, we have this one last thing we want to do. We hope that this works because live demos or live attempts are always sort of dodgy. So we'll see how this goes.
02:13:15.960 - 02:13:51.600, Speaker A: Yeah, so the one last thing, just as a means of thanking everyone here and kind of getting a collective memory of what that looks like, we actually have a photographer. If you just all kind of stand up and turn around, just up there on top of the mezzanine, who we're going to try and get to get us a photo of all of us. Kind of just like getting a chance to wrap up. Thank everyone around us for what a great weekend this was. So giving him a chance to kind of set up and a bit making sure we're all visible. Let's please give him an opportunity to set up a shot, and let's get a final shot here. Everybody stand up and raise your hands.
02:13:51.600 - 02:14:14.340, Speaker A: Come here. Come here. Come say eat. Thank you so much for coming to San Francisco. We hope to see you at the next event.
