00:00:09.450 - 00:00:50.638, Speaker A: Looks like we're good. And the first team is Watchful Eye. So if you guys are ready to go, you can get that going. Should we screen share and then just play the video? Yeah, sorry. Yeah. For context, the way this session is going to go is we're going to try to keep it pretty close to what you would experience with the judging session. So I'm going to time these and we'll keep it at the four minutes for your video and then four minutes for responses and feedback from our pseudo judges today, Nicola and Mark.
00:00:50.638 - 00:01:11.006, Speaker A: So let me just get that timer set up and then you can start. All right, thank you. Sure. All right. You want to go ahead? Yes, you can share. All right, here we go. This is the Watchwell.
00:01:11.006 - 00:02:14.978, Speaker A: I The Watchwell I allows Aave debt holders to set an automated stop loss based on the risk factors of their loans. The Watchwall I uses an Oracle that monitors the prices of the debt and collateral and compares it to the user defined stop loss. Once the stop loss is reached, the Oracle calls upon the Watchwi to use an Ave Flash loan to repay the pre existing debt, swap the collateral for the flash loaned asset on the one inch Dex, and then repay the flash loan asset with the proceeds from the swap. To use the Watchy, a user must first take out a loan on the Ave protocol. When the user comes to the dashboard, they can see their total debt in ETH, their total collateral in ETH, and their loan health factor or their Ave health factor, just for the viewer's sake. In our wallet, we have ten die, which we borrowed from Ave, and we have ten alink, which is our collateral on Ave. So first the user has to specify the details of the position that they hold on Ave.
00:02:14.978 - 00:03:16.410, Speaker A: And as we showed a minute ago, the debt we have is in die. The collateral we have is a link, and we have ten die in debt. And let's liquidate one a link if we cross our threshold, because that's worth about $25, and that'll cover the debt. And let's say our debt price limit for die is usually around one. Let's just put one and let's say that when the link goes below $28, which right now it is, we want to go ahead and liquidate. So let's configure the Eye with the information that just adds that information to the Watchful Eye contract, confirm, then we have to approve of the Eye's intervention, which just means that the smart contract can move around the collateral asset. So go ahead and confirm that transaction.
00:03:16.410 - 00:04:12.830, Speaker A: So after we've approved and set up the Watchful Eye, we can actually go to the Watchful Eye contract and we can go and look at the Watchfly. Here's the Watchfly, and it's not really human readable at the moment, but that's just the way that it comes back. From the blockchain. So now that we see that the smart contract has the watchful eye that we created a second ago, we can check out the price Oracle. The price Oracle, as we said before, monitors the current price of the debt and asset and compares it to the watchful eyes set price limits. So let's go ahead and start that Oracle up. So we see that the Oracle pulled the watchful eye, saw that the price was below the limit, started to liquidate the position, and then successfully liquidated the position watched by the watchful eye.
00:04:12.830 - 00:05:05.252, Speaker A: And now that the liquidation is finished, we can verify that that debt was paid off in our wallet. And would you look at that? We have one less a link and 25 more die. So we paid off the initial debt and had a little bit of die left over. And aside from what we saw in the wallet, if you check the ave user data as shown on the dashboard, we can see that that loan was in fact paid off. And this is the watchful eye, and the watchful eye is always watching. Thanks for watching. That was three minutes 46 seconds by my clock, so you're well under.
00:05:05.252 - 00:05:35.570, Speaker A: All right, let's keep it going. Judges, what do you want to say? Look very quickly. It's definitely a needed use case. Of course I see good product market feat, maybe. Of course it can iterate on the usability, on the UI, but of course that's something that can be polished later. But it seems well functioning. It seems on, spot on.
00:05:35.570 - 00:06:26.332, Speaker A: Thank you. It's better if I turn on my mic, right? I've seen a good amount of progress since your last presentation, so congratulations on that. Thank you. And also good luck for the next few days for finishing up and polishing the product. As Nicola said, there's good product market fit for that. I will still say exactly the same advice. In terms of UX, you should really consider not asking or asking the less amount of information to the user, because everything that you need to configure the watchwood eyes is actually on the blockchain.
00:06:26.332 - 00:07:19.200, Speaker A: So you can just get user account data. You do a Web three call and you will retrieve directly if the user has a link of whatever amount of collateral, what is the collateral, what is the depth, what is the asset of the debt? And just ask the user when do you want to basically execute the trade? Because at the end of the day, it's a tech profit or stop loss when you look at it in the eyes of a trader. And just configure that part, just let the user configure that part, and everything that you can do on behalf of the user do it directly, and that will be just a much better UX. Okay, thank you. And the UI, I love the design and the what should I narrative. It's super cool. Yeah.
00:07:19.200 - 00:07:55.120, Speaker A: Thank you. Great. Yeah, I don't really have a ton of feedback other than I appreciate that you're using Scaffold ETH. I know a bunch of people have found this useful for helping them to get a little bit further on their UI without having to build their own from scratch. So I'm sure Austin would love to hear any feedback you have if there is some, anything else. If not, we're going to move on. Thanks for presenting.
00:07:55.120 - 00:08:23.472, Speaker A: Like I said, this is pretty close to what judging will be, except you'll have a few more minutes. I think there will probably be one more judge, three judges per, maybe two. But either way, this is very similar to what it will be on Monday and Tuesday, depending on when you've signed up. So thanks, Watch Fly for showing us what you've been working on. Next up is Malice and I'll just go ahead. Hello. Yes.
00:08:23.472 - 00:08:56.232, Speaker A: So I took you guys advice last time, and I actually created a flowchart showing how funds flow through the application. I did, because my demo is basically finished. Right. But you guys said I should have created a flowchart showing how this application actually works. So you want me to show the flowchart? That's fine. Yeah. So this isn't going to be your final video submission? You're just going to walk through some of your yes.
00:08:56.232 - 00:09:06.584, Speaker A: Okay. This is not my final video submission. Sure. All right. Yeah. I'm going to still time it just so we stay on track for people. But yeah, go ahead and do a quick run through, and we'll give feedback on that.
00:09:06.584 - 00:09:55.676, Speaker A: Okay, so basically, the way the application works is, in step one, imagine Peter has a hot dog stand, right? And he basically wants to accept ether as payment. Right. What Peter could basically do, he could deploy a store, right? And by deploying a store, he could use it to attract crypto paying customers to his hot dog stand. Right. So in step two, he's going to deposit $100 worth of ether into the store. Right. For simplicity's sake, we're going to assume that the price of ether remains constant, and it doesn't change during the process.
00:09:55.676 - 00:10:27.930, Speaker A: In step three, peter is going to stake $70 worth of the ether out of the available $100 balance that's on the store. Right. The reason why he wants to stake $70. Right? Because rather than giving a discount on his goods and services, which is the hot dogs, he could stake $70 worth of ethereum. Right. Hang on a second. Are you showing a different screen? Because all I see is 7% cash back.
00:10:27.930 - 00:10:42.270, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Wait, hold on. Wait. Let me stop sharing. Don't worry about it. Demo day. This is why it's a demo.
00:10:42.270 - 00:11:41.820, Speaker A: It's a training. Perfect. I don't know if I should start over real quick. Yeah, you probably should start over. All right, so in step one, Peter has a hot dog stand. He wants crypto paying customers to come to his hot dog stand and pay for ether, right? He's going to deposit a store. In step two, Peter is going to put $100 worth of ethereum into the store, right? The price of ethereum is going to remain constant in this scenario, we're going to assume that it remains constant and doesn't change, right? In step three, out of the $100 worth of ethereum that's deposited, he's going to stake $70 worth of ethereum, right? And the reason why he wants to stake $70 worth of ethereum is that rather than giving a discount on his goods and services by staking, he could still achieve the same effect by attracting customers to his business rather than giving a discount.
00:11:41.820 - 00:13:36.484, Speaker A: And it's important because I'm going to show you why it matters in the future. So in step four, the amount of the $70 worth of ethereum that is staked, right? So imagine that three friends came to Peter's hot dog stand to buy, let's say, $1,000 worth of food. Even though that's a lot of food, the reason why they want to go to Peter's hot dog stand now is because they want to get 7% cash back on that $1,000 that they're going to spend in terms of ethereum, right? So the thing is, Peter doesn't want to give back $70 worth of ether right away, right? So the $70 worth of ethereum is going to be locked up as collateral, right? And there's going to be a new token that's going to be minted. That's a one to one ratio with the amount of ether that's locked up, right? And by doing this now, when the ether is locked up, Peter can't remove it doesn't have the ability to no longer remove that ether from the store, but the users, the tokens that they get back is basically going to be a wrapped ether that's back in a one to one ratio with the amount that's locked up. So let's go to step five. So let's say at some point in the future, there's some disaster hurricane or virus or something, some unseen event, and Peter business is kind of slow. And Peter needs those funds that are locked up as collateral, right? What he is able to do now, he's able to say that, hey, I'm not accepting back those tokens that I gave out, right? And when the users come back with those tokens and respend it, the collateral would be unlocked and given back to Peter in his business, right? And let's go to step six now.
00:13:36.484 - 00:14:21.652, Speaker A: So this is where things start to get a bit interesting. So imagine that Peter's business is affected. The hot dog stand is really affected badly, right? The users still have the ability to use that token at a different store. So now imagine that Store B is run by Alice, and Store B. Is selling NFTs, right? So imagine that Alice previously had $100 worth of collateral in Store B, right? The users are able to spend that same $70 worth of tokens that they receive from Peter that's minted in a one to one ratio. And once they spend it at Store B to buy some form of NFT, $70 worth of Ether would be unlocked back to Alice. Right.
00:14:21.652 - 00:14:50.940, Speaker A: And Alice would still have $70 worth of collateral in Store B. Right. And finally, let's go to the final part, which is step seven. So in case seven, right. Peter still has the $70 worth of collateral locked in his store, right. But he still needs those funds. But his business is too badly affected where nobody don't want to come back.
00:14:50.940 - 00:15:21.800, Speaker A: Users don't want to come back and spend those tokens at a store. So Alice decides that, hey, there are more circulating supply of those tokens in the market. So she's going to put up $70 worth of collateral relief at a rate of 30%. Right. By doing that, what Peter is able to do. Right. He's able to make a trade with Alice's store of the $70 worth of collateral that he has.
00:15:21.800 - 00:15:58.252, Speaker A: Right. By making a trade of about the 30% that Alice put on the $70 right. Peter would lose $21 worth of Ether. It would go to Alice's store. Right. And that $70 that Alice put up as collateral relief would be locked as collateral, and $49 worth of Ether would be available to Peter. And by doing this, we maintain that all the tokens that are minted in the system are always backed by Ether.
00:15:58.252 - 00:16:35.116, Speaker A: Right. So users always have somewhere that they're able to spend the Ether, whether it's by buying NFTs, whether it's by going out to a restaurant, buying clothes, wherever anybody is able to create a store. It doesn't even have to be a valid business. Anybody could create a store. And this is how, basically and all of this could just happen just by scanning a QR code and paying for something Ether, all of this is able to happen. All right, cool. That was a bit over, but I'm sure once you start to make your video, you'll be able to trim it down.
00:16:35.116 - 00:16:55.936, Speaker A: I would be able to make it shorter. I basically have a demo already. I just got to finish another part of the UI. But this is basically how it works. Users would have to use ENS names to name their stores. So I would be able to go online, say, for example, I go to Germany. I'm in Germany.
00:16:55.936 - 00:17:12.696, Speaker A: I'm in this city. I could search, okay, let's see who's accepting Ether in this location. Right. And then I could find places where I could spend my Ether and get 7% cash back. Right. Without the use of a card. It's completely peer to peer just by scanning a QR code.
00:17:12.696 - 00:18:21.228, Speaker A: Got you. Why don't we move to Nicola and Mark? If you have any feedback or questions, look quick one. It's definitely helpful to see the diagram and the flowchart. Last time, I think we all struggled to explain and understand. There is a very interesting vision behind it, for sure. The one thing I am not concerned but something to think about is the fungibility that you want to, in a sense provide for the network that you're building. So that's not going to be super intuitive for the masses, right? So I see the vision and I see that a sort of iteration of these crypto networks can take off, but think maybe about how easy you can integrate the stores and the fungibility.
00:18:21.228 - 00:19:32.100, Speaker A: Not really technical, but on a qualitative way like to make understand that people can go to one store to another and mint and it's a little bit heavy lift on a consumer side, right. At the end, it's not very clear what's the benefit for them. So I would try to make it as clear as possible for all the participant in the network what are the benefits of doing this? Because it sounds not super easy or light to do in a click. This is like the technical flow, but it's very simple for the customer because I'm just able to search, say, for example, I'm interested in a restaurant, I'm in this area. I'm able to search, for example, let's say New York City, this street, let's see who's running a store. And I'm just able to go there and just scan a QR code, pay for something with ether. And the tokens that I receive back are backed by ether one to one, right? And it's 7% of what I spent.
00:19:32.100 - 00:20:19.504, Speaker A: Right? It's backed one to one and I couldn't assure that it's backed one to one because the ethers that's locked up by the merchant, they're not able to touch it. The only way it's unlocked back to them is if a user actually comes back and spend the minted tokens. The minted tokens are so think of the minted tokens as something like Die, right? They're backed and they're able to trade between different users, right? And they're essentially an ERC 20 token, right? They're basically a form of wrapped eat. That's what they are. Right. Okay, got you. The merchant.
00:20:19.504 - 00:21:25.036, Speaker A: The benefits of the merchant is that you don't have to give a discount on your goods and services. You could stake and still achieve the same effect by not giving discount. But in terms of some future event where your business is struggling, that amount of ether that's locked up, you could always say, hey, I want to unlock those tokens that I locked up in the initial stages. Mark, do you have anything? One of the things at the core of the project is that I do believe that ether is an asset and Dai, for example, is a currency and it's not exactly the same thing. I don't believe that there's a future. I'm not part of the bitcoin maximalists that think we all going to pay in Satoshi to buy stuff and make our groceries. And I think it's going to be the same thing with Ether because at the end of the day, an asset we usually don't pay with financial assets or stuff.
00:21:25.036 - 00:22:31.104, Speaker A: I don't buy a car with Tesla stock. If I want to buy a car with Tesla stock, I sell the stock into a currency that I use as a medium exchange to actually buy the services or the and on top of. So the good thing we have inside the Ethereum ecosystem is that we have the stable coins. And basically I'm much more confident that there's a future that more and more people pay with Dai, USDC or whatever stable coins they want to use. And in the eyes of the customer and the shop owner, they don't have to expose themselves to highly fluctuating assets. And also stable coins are much more borrowed in DeFi. So if your shop owner, for example, is tend of just staking or whatever they do with the eat, they do exactly the same thing.
00:22:31.104 - 00:24:24.432, Speaker A: But with Dai, I think that just the passive income of the Dai deposited will allow to slightly maybe generate over time the cash flow that is needed to back your local currency, the free tokens, one to one and basically have some kind of monetary supply that increase according to the interest of the deposits of the owners. And because having local currency, I don't know how it is in other countries, but in France it's quite big. There's a lot of local currency within the city, within area cultural stuff and there's definitely a use case for that. I just think that a stable coin to be used at the core of your product would be much more easier to implement and also to adapt for all the actors involved. So the thing is, each store is also able to accept other currencies, for example, like USDC, Dai and so forth. The problem at the core however, cause I did research and try and doing it with a stable coin at first but at its core one of the main problems with the current ERC 20 model that all stablecoins have is if I'm supposed to make a payment. Currently the transfer function it would just transfer without having no formal way to actually check to see if there is enough collateral to back what would essentially get minted.
00:24:24.432 - 00:25:12.056, Speaker A: But with Ether, the interesting thing is that you could have a fallback function that would be able to check that right, any smart contract can implement a fallback function. So ERC 20 is a standard, but on top of the standard you can build whatever you want. So if you want to have a fallback function, so a method that doesn't have a name and just execute whenever you send some money to it, you can obviously do it with an ERC 20 token. ERC 20 just means there's a standard. This is like the core stuff, you need to be named ERC 20 token. But you can add new stuff on top of that. So I don't think there's a technical limitation.
00:25:12.056 - 00:25:59.120, Speaker A: Maybe I'm wrong on this, but I don't think there's a technical limitation. I don't want to get too far in the weeds, but these are both good feedback from Nicola and Mark. One thing I will say, Warren, is this diagram is a good step from the last time we spoke. But if this was on the slide, it's still too many things going on and the text is too small or there's too much text. So for your submission video, try to condense this. Take this one step further and cut down the amount of text. Try to get it down to, like, bullet points of what happens at each step, and that will help judges really quickly scan over all these parts of your project, and then it'll give them a better understanding.
00:25:59.120 - 00:26:37.900, Speaker A: So less text. And try to make it a little bit larger where you can. And remember that it's going to be a single slide and you're not going to be able to zoom into it. Okay, so have each step on a single slide and just no, it's good that it's all together, but I just need, like, for example, store hub, make that larger to occupy the full box there in step six. That's just one suggestion. But then these large blocks of text, I'm not going to be able to read that if I'm seeing this in a presentation. So try, know, trim it down, condense it where you can, and that will help a ton for legibility, for whoever's judging.
00:26:37.900 - 00:26:56.884, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, sure. We're going to move on to the next project, but thanks, Warren. It's good to see progress from the last time, and hopefully you'll be in my judging session. I can see the next step of improvement in a few days. All right, next up is Revert, and I'm going to let you guys just start it.
00:26:56.884 - 00:27:24.136, Speaker A: I'll time it just so you have an idea of how long you're going, but you can start whenever you're ready. Okay, sharing my screen two. Well, not add. I will subtract D from that. Okay. Am I on? Okay, so this is our landing page. So Revert is an analytics platform for liquidity providers and DEXes.
00:27:24.136 - 00:28:05.080, Speaker A: So you can connect your account with MetaMask or Portis. But for this demo, we're going to use the very notable Noobi ETH account. And so what we're doing right here is first it gets any historic position, which is really easy from the Uniswap subgraph. We're just doing uniswap for now, but we go and also query the blockchain and see any event pertaining to those historic LP positions. So like the mint, the burns, any transfers. And from this, we built the historic and complete position of the account. So we can see here the dashboard.
00:28:05.080 - 00:28:33.296, Speaker A: Hey, warrior. Yeah. Really quick, can you just start with a one or two sentence summary of what the project is. Yeah, sure, sorry. Revert is an analytics platform for liquidity providers on like I think that's like a one sentence definition. Perfect. This is the dashboard, right? These are the open positions.
00:28:33.296 - 00:29:34.740, Speaker A: It looks pretty bad as this is the total PNL for the open positions. But if we toggle here for the historic exited positions, we get a really different story. This is the current open position and on the left side we see the metrics that are pertaining to this specific position, like the current assets, what was invested or withdrawn, possibly the difference between what's invested and withdrawn, any possible staking rewards. And on the right side we see what's pertaining to the pool itself. So like the volume for the last three days, the reserves, the volume to reserve ratio which will inform what kind of fees you can expect to get per dollar invested, the prices for each of the assets and the price divergence between those assets which would inform what kind of divergence, those you can expect. And in the position log you can see all the relevant transparent. You can see here this position was staked at some contract.
00:29:34.740 - 00:30:37.950, Speaker A: But part of the work we have to do is see detect what type of Abi the contracts conform to. We have like a few this one clearly there's some rewards that hadn't been computed for this position. But if we go for example, to this one which was also staked in two different contracts, we can see that it correctly computed like the Sashimi and Sushi rewards which would show the important difference. Like pool PNL is only the returns from the positions, from what was getting computed from fees and possible diversion loss. And the total PNL includes all the rewards and also possibly all the gas costs. And you have like a little index of all the relevant transactions. And if you go to pool history, you can get a much nicer visualization of the same metrics which are really pertaining to the pool itself.
00:30:37.950 - 00:31:29.340, Speaker A: From that you can get an idea if you should maybe exit your position at this point or if it looks positive given the volume to reserve ratio and the price divergence. And yeah, just have an historic log of all your exited positions. These are exited positions. So the asset value is zero, but you can still get the pool on PNL computed given what was originally invested and what was withdrawn at the point of exit. And there's a lot much work to do. But this is our minimum viable product using only uniswap for now. We will be adding other pools, we will be adding other futures like notifications.
00:31:29.340 - 00:32:12.904, Speaker A: It's important to maybe be aware once you're getting close to either going negative in your PNL or otherwise, once the price divergence comes back to a point where you want to exit at a profit. That's the idea. Analytics blot are prompt, but also to give you very actionable information with regards to what you want to do with your positions and I think that's it. I don't know. Yeah, that was 40 seconds over but totally possible to trim that down. Let me stop your sharing. Yeah.
00:32:12.904 - 00:33:09.544, Speaker A: So good job. You're pretty close to the time limit. One thing I recommend is you have a lot to demo but it's always good to start with. Like I asked you the name of the project, a couple of slides that just have the name of the project, the summary of what problem you're solving or rather the problems that you see for your specific users and then how you're solving it and then you jump into your demo. It doesn't have to be more than 30 seconds. You can just do you recommend adding a couple of slides then before the demo? Yeah, it's a good way to just get everybody accustomed to what you're actually attacking and then you jump into your demo. Another thing you can include, I'm sure you probably have a few things here but some features that you weren't able to include or things that you didn't get to finish but you'd like to continue working on like have that as the last slide at the end of your presentation.
00:33:09.544 - 00:33:30.870, Speaker A: But I think you're like 85 90% there. This is a pretty good overview. I'll let Mark or Nicola pick it up if they have any feedback. Sure. Look, I agree to me even more than 85 90% there. It's very impressive. Vario, good job.
00:33:30.870 - 00:34:36.932, Speaker A: It's very useful. I liked it a know with my I would say business and crypto network mind I always think of where it could go and starting the product, going into business, going into a crypto network that can attract powerful network effects. So what I would suggest you to think is yes, this is a very good product. There is a strong use case it can be on top of you can pull more than be on top of other protocol but you can pull from one decks and whatever. One thing I would like to ask you is can you combine the position? I don't know if I missed that. Can you actually combine the position and have A-P-L overview of your portfolio? Sort of. So it kind of becomes like a portfolio management tool which is very powerful but it's different from ZERIO and Zapper.
00:34:36.932 - 00:35:21.028, Speaker A: This one is more on literally an overview of what you're holding and the risk that you're managing. So think it more like a risk management tool for LP and stuff. Yeah. So can you combine the positions? Yeah, it's the first that has total aggregated position you can toggle between the open positions only or your historic exit positions to see your PNL either. And you're exactly right. This is specifically for LPs and not like a general wallet tool and manage risk is a good way to define it. Yes, absolutely.
00:35:21.028 - 00:35:55.552, Speaker A: So total position I. Didn't know if it was referring to the total of one position above all portfolio. Yes, I mean, there's so many things and think about it also, I don't know, you can have a link for option protocols and you can hedge it by itself. It's very powerful as a tool. So good job. Thanks. Yeah, I have to share that I'm impressed you gain yourself a new user and I hope you have good servers because I will shit it around.
00:35:55.552 - 00:36:57.776, Speaker A: So expect a lot of connection in the next few hours. And during your presentation I tested and it's actually on mainnet, it's working right now. It's an actual working project. There's still a lot to do and to improve, obviously, but it's a fully fledged project as it is today and it's completely impressive what you managed to build. And what the challenge I can see for this kind of project is how to maintain and keep the flow of new asset to watch. And that will be, I think, the most technical challenge because right now I have the sense that you are doing a bunch of ethergs call. So basically when I connect my wallet with my MetaMask, you basically say balance off, balance off, balance off, and then just ask for everything that is inside your whitelist of LP pools.
00:36:57.776 - 00:38:09.290, Speaker A: But if the guy has like 200 different pools with many transactions, it would take like 1020 minutes to load and servers are not cheap. So I don't know if you sell host or how it works on your site, but it's quite a challenge. And also there's new tokens happening like every hour. So how to keep up? Did you think about this aspect? Do you want to open source your back end so anybody can do a pull request and basically do the legwork to add a new asset to monitor? Just like, for example, VFAT I'm thinking of VFAT Tools that is doing some yield farming monitoring as well and they have this model so everything is open source, the GitHub is public and if you want your protocol to be supported by vitfat, you can build the pull request yourself. Yeah. So first there's truly no back end. This is all JavaScript talking directly to everything.
00:38:09.290 - 00:39:04.444, Speaker A: But we bring another important point though, you're absolutely right. Once you get to these accounts that have 100 positions, it'll take a lot of time. So having a back end then that can catch those type of accounts. So it's faster yet it's definitely an improvement that we plan to make. I think you asked something else that I'm forgetting right now because the project is very interesting, but in order to work you will have to constantly monitor new pools. So it's quite a technical challenge. I think it's possible technically to do it automatically, but at some point you will need to do some curation because you have the ambition to, for example, monitor if this token that is linked to a farm is there.
00:39:04.444 - 00:39:54.668, Speaker A: Some claim rewards, but not every single token is a fork of uniswap, which is a fork of yam or whatever we add this summer. Some token and some project have not very standard way to claim reward to stake and all this kind of stuff. So what did you think around this area? Yeah, you're exactly right, man. I wish everyone was using the original synthetic staking rewards contract and it will make my life much easier. But yeah, for now it's going to be sort of like a cat and mouse game determining the different abis. Right now we have four or five different abis which we can, and some are used by a lot of different pools. But you're right, it is like a constant work.
00:39:54.668 - 00:40:45.128, Speaker A: I'm hoping eventually the industry will converge in some sort of standard with regards to that. But yeah, open source is definitely something we are considering. It will be ideal if we could somehow make it so that people can contribute those avis that are specific to their own project without necessarily requiring to open source the whole thing. I mean, I love open source, obviously being in this industry, but strategically for building a company, I'm not sure if we're ready for doing that. But maybe there's somewhere in the middle where we can just expose an interface where the farms can add their unique APIs or something with that. And thank you so much for the kind words. Mark, congratulations and I really hope you keep working on it after the academy.
00:40:45.128 - 00:41:03.088, Speaker A: I continue, thank you. Excellent. Thanks for sharing. Some good feedback from Mark and Nicola. Victor, if you're ready, I will let you start and I'm going to time you. Are you going to share a demo video or what's your plan here? Yes, I'm ready. I'm sharing.
00:41:03.088 - 00:42:38.940, Speaker A: Okay, I will start the timer once you go ahead. Hello, I'm presenting future salaries, a fair way to pay salaries to San. Looks like we lost sound. Yeah, don't have the sound. Destroy again. Victor, victor, why don't you could you maybe give me the can you give me the YouTube link and I'll play it? I think what happened is you didn't share your audio, so it's coming through your speakers and then going into your mic. Or you can try to reshare it by one of the things you have to remember to do is there's a little checkbox in the bottom left and it'll ask you to share your computer sound.
00:42:38.940 - 00:43:21.748, Speaker A: I think that might be the issue. Yep. I can't tell if you're waving to me or you want me to check the DMs or something. He's also muted. Can you unmute him? Cran? Yeah. Victor, do you want to try? And what we can do is to take the next team and then go back to Victor. Don't worry, Victor, you will have your time to shine.
00:43:21.748 - 00:43:36.436, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So who's next? Jaciendes, do you want to try and share. That would be Lucia and Javier.
00:43:36.628 - 00:43:56.130, Speaker B: Hi. Yes. So it's me and Javier. I think he is. Yeah, he's here as well. So our project, Haciendas, is an in browser game. So, Trent, do you have the video link? Maybe you can just play the video.
00:43:56.500 - 00:43:59.744, Speaker A: I can find it, but if you have it on hand, that would be.
00:43:59.942 - 00:44:28.712, Speaker B: I'll just send you the link. So I'll send it just to everyone? Just to the chat.
00:44:28.856 - 00:44:29.550, Speaker A: Sure.
00:44:30.400 - 00:44:31.790, Speaker B: So it's on there.
00:44:33.440 - 00:44:43.010, Speaker A: Okay, it and you'd like me to share this?
00:44:43.780 - 00:44:46.124, Speaker B: Yeah, if the audio is better sharing.
00:44:46.172 - 00:45:06.728, Speaker A: From your screen, it will be the same either way. But I have it up, so I can do that for you. Are you new to DeFi? Is that coming through, or is it.
00:45:06.734 - 00:45:08.890, Speaker B: The audio a bit low.
00:45:10.220 - 00:45:44.430, Speaker A: Feel free to increase the volume as well. All right, here we go. Not seeing anything on my side. Really? To start it? Yeah. Oh, did I switch to the wrong screen? Sorry about that. It's all right. It's a practice day for everyone, apparently.
00:45:45.490 - 00:45:48.420, Speaker B: I can try to share my screen.
00:45:49.990 - 00:45:54.020, Speaker A: Yeah, if you want to go ahead and try. It's actually a good practice for you as well.
00:46:00.410 - 00:46:12.600, Speaker B: Okay, let's see this. Go back to the start. Okay, so let me know if the volume is.
00:46:16.670 - 00:46:20.940, Speaker A: There'S no audio. There's no audio. Okay.
00:46:21.550 - 00:46:24.860, Speaker B: All right. Sorry, Tim, I think you will have to share this.
00:46:25.170 - 00:46:28.862, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll try it again and make sure I'm actually on the right screen this time.
00:46:28.996 - 00:46:29.680, Speaker B: Okay.
00:46:32.930 - 00:46:38.820, Speaker A: We could see the screen. The video didn't start.
00:46:39.590 - 00:46:40.386, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:40.568 - 00:47:14.442, Speaker A: Previously isn't that zoom that is trying to prevent to have another source of volume, perhaps? Yeah, I'm not sure why it would do that for me. I think I have all my settings properly. Victor, we are seeing your message. We basically still no audio. Yes, we do have audio. Let's do that. Yeah, let's do that.
00:47:14.442 - 00:47:34.018, Speaker A: Okay, cool. And Victor, we saw your message. Your turn is just after don't worry. Do you find it hard to wrap your head around token swap and liquidity pools? It's so confusing. It's even been called weird DeFi. No one really knows what's going on. You're not alone in being confused, and Haciendas is here to help.
00:47:34.018 - 00:48:15.310, Speaker A: In the magical world of Haciendas, you can meet and chat with other defiers. You can chat with other characters and trade tokens with each other. Haciendas offers you a simple and intuitive chat interface to chat with your friends and make new ones in the game. You have assets stored in your inventory. Use them to deposit, swap, transact, and borrow. Not only can you see how many tokens you have by opening the inventory, you can also drag them around for making real world transactions. Not only can you chat with the other players, but you can also transact with them using real cryptocurrencies.
00:48:15.310 - 00:48:57.566, Speaker A: Simply drag, drop, determine your amount, and send. If you'd like to exchange your tokens for some other coin, you can go visit the market and swap out ETH for die or several other coins. We've leveraged the power of one inch exchange so you can easily exchange your coins for others with the least possible hassle. We hope this video made you want to learn more about the exciting world of DeFi, and we're happy you're starting your journey with us. Try it out today. All right.
00:48:57.748 - 00:49:21.714, Speaker B: Thanks, Trent. So, yeah, that was our demo video. And just a quick note on that. We're still working out two more key actions. One is the governance feature. The other one is, I think, token swap. So we will be adding more content to this video and expanding sort of like what the game can offer.
00:49:21.714 - 00:49:50.878, Speaker B: So this video is work in progress is not complete. We'll also edit it to be more fluid. So in the beginning, it was a little bit the pacing wasn't right because we're very tight on deadline. But yeah. So this is the idea. And let me know how I can present this better. If you want more introduction on what this is about, the roadmap and stuff.
00:49:51.044 - 00:50:22.680, Speaker A: Yeah, it sounds like you already know what you have to add to this. It was not enough knowledge. I want to know everything about this project. You've given us, like, a tiny sliver, and it seems like a really cool concept of thanks. I really want to open up a medieval pawn shop for Avi there with, like, a small ghost that acts as a tailor and you can deposit your die and the small ghost will give you a die in exchange into your inventory. Let's do this together. Yes.
00:50:26.350 - 00:50:35.766, Speaker B: Maybe just, like, some background on why this game was created and what we're trying to solve is that the format.
00:50:35.798 - 00:50:46.894, Speaker A: Of this yeah, you can do that now, but definitely you'll want to include that as a few slides or just like a little bit of preamble before you do a demo video.
00:50:47.092 - 00:50:50.462, Speaker B: Oh, so you actually want that information in a demo video as well?
00:50:50.516 - 00:51:01.240, Speaker A: Yes, that would be good to have because this is going to end up as part of a project showcase. So when somebody goes to look at your project, it's good to have a little bit of background in the video itself.
00:51:01.770 - 00:51:55.750, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, we'll add that. Yeah. So our target audience are people who are new to DeFi, so they have some sort of basic understanding of cryptocurrency, but they're not anywhere near proficient at using different DeFi apps and different protocols. So there are three pillars of this game that tries to solve that problem, kind of bringing innovation to people who are used to conventional banking apps and conventional everything. So what we see is, like, the gap between DeFi, where everything is very abstract and use a different mental model, and what people are used to for money being very visible and tangible and even very social. So we're adding three things to help people learn.
00:51:55.750 - 00:52:38.580, Speaker B: So basically to teach people how to use DeFi protocols and to make it less daunting for them to start using these tools. So we're making it more social. So the feature where people can walk around, meet, so meet virtually other users and have a real interaction with them before swapping tokens. So that's the social aspect. We're making it more visual for users to see how token transaction happens. Because oftentimes when you're doing transaction between wallets or sending it into the ether, you don't really see where it end up. And there was no visibility into the back end like the system.
00:52:38.580 - 00:53:44.274, Speaker B: So just having that interactivity on the front end for them to drag and drop the tokens, it appears and disappears from their inventory. Add more realness to these transactions. And the other thing is just make it more fun. So the game idea is to make it less boring. Instead of looking at strings of hash and digits up to twelve decimal points, we just make it a bit more dummy proof in a way that they can still learn different protocols in a way that kind of prepares them to start using Ave or Uniswap or all kinds of DFI apps. So we are adding the governance feature to it. So in the Governance feature they are able to vote on proposals in a very kind of fun and visual way that they're literally voting on pieces of paper in a town hall building.
00:53:44.274 - 00:53:46.060, Speaker B: So that's the idea.
00:53:47.630 - 00:54:25.446, Speaker A: I think this is really great. I'll echo what I said before. Is it's a really cool concept and we've only seen a part of it. My one question is, would this make more sense on the testnet? If you're trying to is it more an educational tool or is it an interaction space for people who are already in DeFi? Because if you're trying to get somebody to learn how to use these protocols, it's pretty tough to do that on Mainnet currently. Especially if somebody's just learning about this stuff and then they go to make a transaction and the transaction cost is more than the actual amount sent.
00:54:25.548 - 00:54:25.958, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:54:26.044 - 00:54:42.214, Speaker A: I would strongly suggest if you can not by Sunday, obviously look at doing this on a testnet or a side chain like Medic. I think that would really help the educational tool aspect of this. But I love the concept.
00:54:42.342 - 00:55:11.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is currently living on a testnet and the users get fake ETH. Obviously they're not going to have to connect their real wallets. So that's another way for them to feel like they have some confidence to start doing stuff without or having to learn how to set up a wallet. But Xavier can correct me if I'm wrong here. I think we're also using right?
00:55:11.180 - 00:56:18.934, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It makes a lot of sense to have an integration of Quickswap, for example, on Matic and just enjoy the game as this kind of game and the targeted audience, at least at the beginning will be people just discovering crypto. You have like onramp for example with transact directly on Matic, so you have almost no transaction fee where you can convert a small amount and have it directly inside the game. So that's probably an integration that might be interesting and then just use in the market Quickswap and do everything on a side chain directly from day one because it will kind of ruin the user experience if you try to do it on the settlement layers this day. Yeah, we'll definitely do that guys, quick feedback as well. I like it, it's interesting. It's sort of like two different vertical crossing roads.
00:56:18.934 - 00:57:08.220, Speaker A: So it's very appealing. One thing I risk to sound like a broken record, but that's also my role, I guess. Here, always think about it. Yes, is a cool product, is something fun, but also it can be a business. Is it investable? Does it acquire value? Can we park economics on it? Can we attract users? So always at least have on the back of your mind all those additional metrics that will help you make it more fun, more interesting, more attractive and more valuable as network effect.
00:57:08.910 - 00:57:51.960, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So when we were thinking about the business model is this game when we're presenting it. So the demo project is branded for Aave. So there are Ave branding elements. They're trading Ave tokens aUSDC and they're going to use the Ave governance protocol to do the governance stuff. So what we're thinking is that this can be kind of like white labeled for different kind of DeFi projects. So say if I don't know, SushiSwap is trying to onboard new users, they can use this game as kind of like the onboarding process.
00:57:53.850 - 00:58:05.210, Speaker A: Just charge me some rent for my shop, my Avish shop in the game, I will pay some rent, don't worry about it. Yeah, this is genius. Very good concept.
00:58:07.570 - 00:58:24.610, Speaker B: But I'm sure there are other ways to monetize it if people actually start using it and then when we can see which features engage users the most, that's monetization opportunities. But right now what we're thinking is just white label.
00:58:25.270 - 00:59:23.190, Speaker A: Yeah, look, monetization is especially on the vast majority of the conversation that we have with very early like precede or seed stage. It's not really the focus. Right, because users usability, UI traction, that's the most important things. We also saw massive multibillion company on Web Two that didn't know how to monetize and then all of a sudden just turn the page and they do monetize and they fund it. So it's not a priority. I see it in crypto and on the blockchain sphere it's more about something sustainable. Like crypto is about economics, right? And crypto economics, if it's fun, if it's cool, it's going to just last until it's cool something else.
00:59:23.190 - 00:59:39.366, Speaker A: But if you build some economics behind it, then it's going to be more sustainable. So don't really focus on we need to find a monetization. Right now it's not needed, but think about sustainability of the network. That's it.
00:59:39.548 - 00:59:40.280, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:40.650 - 00:59:52.574, Speaker A: Super. I don't want to cut the discussion short because there's a lot to go over, but we do have three more projects, so we're going to move on to the next one. Thank you, Lucia. And Javier. This is really cool. Thank you.
00:59:52.692 - 00:59:53.600, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:59:55.650 - 01:00:09.650, Speaker A: All right, round two. Victor, you want to try and share? We'll get this going. Hello. I'm sharing again. I assume this time it will work. I'm starting to share. Hello.
01:00:09.650 - 01:00:30.682, Speaker A: I'm presenting future salaries. A fair way to pay salaries to scientists, research developers, might be journalists, et cetera. I will show the demo. Here is the demo. Anybody can register for a salary. Let pressing just one button. Suppose I'm registered here.
01:00:30.682 - 01:01:06.690, Speaker A: I have tokens on account. Tokens paid every second, you see? Every second. And I mean to withdraw by a single MetaMask transaction. Anyone you can donate. If we will press this button, we see noch is safe, where we can choose the date the donations will be transferred and can pay in sir or token. I have even sorry. Gitcoin version of my software.
01:01:06.690 - 01:01:36.680, Speaker A: A model for Gitcoin. I'm showing it now. I'm switching to the presentation. Future salaries, project prediction market of prediction markets or how to hire Google to create an oracle. How to finance science and preserve they're transferring money from the future. How to hire search engines to do the job for us. How to use Prediction market to stimulate the market to create Oracle for us.
01:01:36.680 - 01:02:12.788, Speaker A: Prediction Markets a prediction market is here. As a definition, the traders tend to buy a conditional token if they expect that an event happens in the future. So prediction markets aim to transfer value from the future to the present. A prediction market could be a good tool to determine salaries of scientists. Make salary determined by predicted score in the future. For example, after 100 years, a promising student could receive the same salary as an established Nobel Prize winner. We can receive future donations in 100 years and pay this money now.
01:02:12.788 - 01:02:37.020, Speaker A: Huge salaries for us. The big trouble is that somebody needs to pay to develop and run Oracles in the future events. I'd like Google to do it for me. If you want Google to do it for us, we need to create market that will pay for Google. My market will pay to search engines. It's decided by votes. So diagram during 100 years.
01:02:37.020 - 01:03:07.952, Speaker A: After 100 years. So I might idea up you saw it. That pays every registered user one token per second. Everybody employing himself at any moment can't request to recuperate user salary. That is, to create a new token for him if he changes the job, retires or dies. The thematical model of transfer money from the future and more in my scientific article pain salaries to scientists using prediction markets on blockchain. Thanks for your attention.
01:03:07.952 - 01:03:50.130, Speaker A: Please question I've finished. Cool. Yeah, you're definitely under time, so if you want to add maybe another let's see, less than three minutes, so you have another minute. If you wanted to expand on things, just so you know, my first feedback is you might want to consider putting the slides before the demo. That way people can have a better understanding of your project before you start. I did consider, but decide it's best to show how it worked first to see what it is for the user, how easy it is to use it. Okay.
01:03:50.130 - 01:04:40.236, Speaker A: The other thing is you had a slide with a diagram that showed the relationship between people making markets and then people receiving payouts, but you were only on it for a split second. So maybe stay on that slide a little bit longer just so judges and anybody looking at the video can understand the flow of ether through the system a little bit better. I understand, but I don't think it would be better because the diagram it would take too long time to really analyze the diagram. It would take all the time just show that it exists. I think it would still be helpful to have you stay on it maybe at least for ten or 15 seconds. Again, you have extra time. You're well below the four minute limit.
01:04:40.236 - 01:05:06.040, Speaker A: So I would stay on that graph a little bit longer and just try to explain the flow of funds. But it's your choice whether to do that. I'm afraid it takes entire four minutes to explain it makes no sense. I think so. I'm not sure, but I think so. Okay, yeah, I would still recommend that. But it's your choice how you want to present the project, nicola or Mark.
01:05:06.040 - 01:06:02.650, Speaker A: I'll turn it over to you. Look very quickly. It is definitely more organized and clear than the previous time. I still see a little bit of jumping from paying salary going to scientist Google. I don't know, I didn't really get the reference that you have on Google at some point on the slides. And then one suggestion I would give is keep it as general as possible in terms of use cases. I understand that you have this interest and pathos for paying salaries for scientists, but I would keep it more general just to the common audience to understand better.
01:06:02.650 - 01:06:53.476, Speaker A: Yes, audience people to understand better. Also more versatile as application. So that's my feedback. Do you mean to say paying salaries to common good producers instead of saying pain salaries to scientists? It seems like that if you say paying salaries to scientists, it's just that very specific niche but maybe can be broadened to a larger scope. No, let me explain. I agree on that right now. So this system is very appropriate for paying salaries to scientists and software developers, free software developers.
01:06:53.476 - 01:07:42.052, Speaker A: It also may be good for paying salaries to journalists, but I'm not sure and important thing, it's a good thing for paying to open source and open access publishers but to enumerate the full list takes much time. I decided to focus on true look. Also since we are on crypto and blockchain the developer and open source, I would say salaries use case is pretty strong. What use cases? Like you said, scientists and developers. Right. So of course I would probably shift onto developers. Since you will find so many developers interested right into the model, maybe they can contribute.
01:07:42.052 - 01:08:40.956, Speaker A: So you recommend to say paying salaries to open source developers if you think about who is going to spend right, Mark? Yeah, support to open source software, let's say Wario that did a super quick project just before. I want to support him for X amount of die per month and it's paid like every block or every second in increments for as long as he keep doing a great job at revert finance, I think a tool like yours can be useful. In that case. We have very different accents. I'm Russian, you are probably from I forgot, you don't understand what I speak. Don't worry, mark is echoing what Nicola is saying that it might be a good use case to consider open source developers. So.
01:08:40.956 - 01:09:12.470, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with Nicola and Mark as well. Maybe you can consider describing it to a broader audience, not just scientists like I know you did mention developers or journalists, maybe it could be broader than that. It's like just public goods paying salaries into the future. The hard part is that the quality of the work need to be measurable. Scientists work can be measured. Free software developers work can be measured. But how to measure journalists, how to measure whatever I don't know if it's possible.
01:09:12.470 - 01:09:42.080, Speaker A: Well, I mean if it's subjective or if it's by the community of people who get value from it, wouldn't they just be able to measure it themselves? Excuse me? I told it, it's measured by future search engines. Traders predicted how it will be measured. There is prediction determined the price now that is the salaries. It works this way. Okay, got you. Yeah, I guess they could all fit into that model. Roughly.
01:09:42.080 - 01:10:26.380, Speaker A: Repeat any other comments or suggestions? I need community review of my project. It would be better if I publish it on my internet without first getting a review for many people. I'm trying, but it's hard to get a review. Yeah, I mean that's what we're doing now. We're giving you some feedback and some comments. Detailed review of details. I don't know how deep we can get in this session but at the end of the hackathon you'll have a showcase with a description, this video that you've produced and maybe that will allow no, I'm in detailed review after reading all the details, how it works.
01:10:26.380 - 01:10:57.584, Speaker A: Not all the details, but my article, my white paper needs to be read before giving any comments. It makes no sense to comment in detail without reading it. I don't know if it's a reasonable expectation that people should read the white paper before understanding the project. It's a very unusual project. It's impossible to explain in short. I explained in short, but not in details. Okay.
01:10:57.584 - 01:12:17.100, Speaker A: Yeah. Just keep in mind that for judging, it will be like you already made a short video, so it's going to have to be explained in the short video. Judges aren't going to have the time to read a long paper. All right, we're going to move on to the second to last project, which is liquidify Morris. Are you don't really I don't have a video available right now. I just wanted to roughly discuss my idea, which is I'm basically just following the Escrow protocol and trying to have multiple people join, perhaps like a flash loan or just get a collateral debt. Do you have slides or anything that we can look at concrete? Let me share my screenplay.
01:12:17.100 - 01:14:04.510, Speaker A: Okay. Do you see the screen? Yes. Basically, I just want to expose the flash loan, and at the point of the loan, I'm trying to have it so you can have multiple people and also multiple assets. Basically, it's been done before, but I was thinking that after the loan is put in and before it's paid back, perhaps you have multiple users in an Escrow, and before that loan is paid back, they could put it in a pool and get interest on that. Okay, so are you looking for feedback on your general concept? I guess just the general concept because it's very slow, my process. It's one thing once you have the loan and then you have that period before you pay it back. So I'm wondering if it's feasible to have multiple users join, put a deposit in, and then attempt to maybe arbitrage that before the loan is paid.
01:14:04.510 - 01:14:49.310, Speaker A: This is I don't have a deeply technical background, so I might have to outsource this to Mark or maybe Nicola. Yeah, I don't have any comments on the technical parts of this right now. I think it's more a technical question to unlock yourself from this situation. And I don't think the current session is the best match to have this kind of discussion and to go deeper into it. So what we will do is that please add me directly on Discord and I will create a group with you and we will fix that together. Don't worry about it. Okay, but let's talk about the project and the back end side of things.
01:14:49.310 - 01:15:37.230, Speaker A: We will stop that at a later point. Let's try to have this section about the project in general. Okay. Yeah, I was just trying to just take advantage. So why don't you state the concept of the project really simply in one or two sentences? I guess facilitating an escrow and then having multiple people join in and then. Perhaps apply the loan, a flash loan at that point, and then during the loan, deposit that in a lending pool to earn interest. I guess that would be very quick.
01:15:37.230 - 01:16:23.950, Speaker A: On the technical side, that's not an option because there's no time concept within a flash loan. A flash loan is a transaction that starts with borrowing some funds, do some stuff with it, and then sending back the money. And everything happened at the same time from a technical perspective. So as there's no time frame, there's no accrual of interest. So if you take a flash loan and deposit some money into Ave and then withdraw that money and pay back the flash loan, you are guaranteed to lose money because the flash loan is not free. There's a flash fee and there will be no actual accrual of interest. So your gains for that operation will be zero.
01:16:23.950 - 01:17:07.108, Speaker A: What about putting it into a pool? There's no time frame, everything happened at the same time. I guess it would have to be before a loan. In other words, you just have a bunch of people who give you that. You'd be able to have more collateral if you have a larger group. There's no concept of collateral in a flash loan, so it's zero collateral loans to flash loans. So having a Dow with like 1000 e in it will not change the situation of the flash node at all. And I think that's a discussion we should have after the session.
01:17:07.108 - 01:17:51.360, Speaker A: And to get back to all the Ave protocol works, I would be more than happy to support you on that. And David as well is not present today, but it's also his job to support you on that side. Don't worry about okay, that sounds great. Yeah. To echo Mark, I think you may have a misunderstanding of how flash loans work in that you can't use a flash loan to gain interest in depositing a pool because it's never actually in the pool. It goes in and out within the same block, so there's no interest to accrue. But yeah, Mark and some of the other Ave team members are probably best suited to walk you through that or look closer at your code in the discord.
01:17:51.360 - 01:18:55.176, Speaker A: Nicola, did you have any quick? I mean, I guess on this aspect, Mark is your man. And when you gravitated to the pool, it sounds like the multiple parties wanted to run a strategy together. But yeah, it didn't really make sense with the timing of the Flesh loan, so I was actually confused myself. But then Mark took off the doubts from the table. So that's it for and what about just an escrow, a straight escrow? I guess that would be like three parties where one person would monitor that escrow amount that multiple people would have deposited. But I guess there would have to be a reason for that someone to be paid back. Um, yeah, I was just thinking to see, you know, just to group the funds together first or during the loan.
01:18:55.176 - 01:19:55.660, Speaker A: But of course not during the loan because it's too quick. But I guess group the funds first and then pool them together, gain interest. Yeah, I guess a loan would be pull out on their own. So if you want to pull funds in order to take a loan together, your only advantage to do that would be like the economies of scales are doing one borrow transaction instead of three, for example, or X amount. And you may consider that you will save on transaction fee doing that. But the thing is that setting up the smart contract vault in order to set up the funds, depositing there, then initiate and execute the transaction from the vault to borrow and then distribute it back the fund to the user will I'm quite sure of it. Cost you way more in transaction fee than just do the action separately.
01:19:55.660 - 01:20:55.440, Speaker A: And if you consider any individuals, there's no difference of benefit in DeFi. In general, if your position is $100 or $100 million, you will pay probably the same rate. Of course, there's the liquidity available in the reserve that will change the interest rate depending of the available liquidity. But there's no direct advantage to pool funds and borrow together unless that's the main use case. So there's a community that wants to pull funds together to borrow in order to fund a project together that might be a use case. Yeah, definitely follow up with the Ave team. They are experts in anything flash loans, but that's probably best on discord and async.
01:20:55.440 - 01:21:26.928, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. All right, we're going to move on to the final project, which is guardians. But before that, just a quick reminder for everybody. Submission is Sunday, February 7, at 11:59 p.m.. So basically midnight, you got to get in your stuff before that because directly after that, we're going to be reviewing videos and leading up to it, making sure people have good sound quality, they didn't speed it up. We want to make sure that judges can understand your video. So we have some guidelines that we've put in the discord.
01:21:26.928 - 01:21:59.620, Speaker A: Please make sure to check those. If your audio is messed up or there are any other issues, we will ask you to rerecord because otherwise the judges will not be able to understand what your project actually is. Remember, Sunday midnight Eastern is the submission deadline, and we've already got about a good chunk of the projects coming in, so that's good to see. If you don't have it, you still have a few days, and if you need feedback, please reach out to anybody on the ETH Global team. We're more than happy to provide video feedback. Emily, is there anything else that I missed?
01:22:03.500 - 01:22:20.460, Speaker B: No, nothing specific. Yeah, I guess. But everyone here has got their videos kind of on the go just to make sure to put a lot of effort into those videos because that's like a true showcase of the work you've put in this past three weeks.
01:22:20.610 - 01:22:58.724, Speaker A: Right. The other thing I'll mention is judging is you can sign up for a slot. Now, the judging is going to be Monday and Tuesday of next week. You're not obligated to nobody's required to be judged, of course, but it's a good way to get feedback in a structured setting from people who work full time in the space. And if you're interested in that feedback, that's how you're going to get it is by signing up for a judging slot. Okay, we're going to move on to guardians. Mohammed, if you want to go ahead and share, are you going to be just talking about your concept or do you have a demo? I will be just talking about the concept.
01:22:58.724 - 01:23:24.620, Speaker A: We still working on the demo, but we have some codes and I have a diagram to explain the project. Okay, go ahead. Thank you. Okay, can you guys see my screen? Yes. Awesome. So just before, I want to talk about the project, guardians of Wallets. So the idea was to solve the problem of recovering wallets.
01:23:24.620 - 01:24:24.212, Speaker A: I know it looks like a little bit far from DeFi, but we introduced DeFi to this project as well. So we have been thinking and there have been a lot of solutions like storing it with your family member or delegate it to an institution, but we went for very different approach. So the idea will be a user connected to our application and he can actually ask to store his password. What's going to happen next is his separate will be splited into multiple pieces and our smart contract going to get random guardians to store his key. So how it's actually working? Once the seed phrase are splitted, they are encrypted with the public key of the guardian chosen. They are chosen randomly. We're using chain link to generate some random numbers to match people that the guardians, that they're going to hold the password and then we encrypt with a master key.
01:24:24.212 - 01:25:05.516, Speaker A: This is very important. This is the only password that you need to remember. Once this is done, we're sending all these things off chain and the guardian will receive an alias. For example, for me, I'm going to name it Cucumber. And then he will have Cucumber and one seed phrase encrypted with his public key and then with a master key and he need to store it. And then we generate a token for him, which is a one on one token that he will be earning interest on. And every time this user come back and ask for his password recovery, we will release the price or the award for storing this password.
01:25:05.516 - 01:25:41.132, Speaker A: Of course, this is a payable service. The second part of it, which is very important, the question is like, what happened? If he lose the access to our application, we give him the chance to store the guardian list in IPFS. So it's going to be like see cucumber. And this is the user, the public key of the address of people holding my password. And it's going to be a redundancy because maybe when we want to retrieve the password later, one of the guardians cannot answer or he no longer have the password. So we have redundancy as security. The same thing happened when you want to recover it.
01:25:41.132 - 01:26:11.210, Speaker A: So you just come and ask to recover your password. You send like the master key, which is encrypted for each user. So it's going to be encrypted by the public key of each guardian. And then you send it to the smart contract. And then the smart contract need to forward that to the guardians so they can send you your password. And then there is an acknowledge. It's like an agreement that could be signed so we can release the token for them.
01:26:11.210 - 01:26:47.570, Speaker A: That's the idea. I hope that it's clear and yeah, if anybody have questions, the thing, the back end is very simple. It's an invitation sent to the guardians who want to activate to accept it, they need to accept it. And then we have list of guardians and everything else just for this demo is happening here. All the encryption is happening on JavaScript side. So all in the split and encryption of the word is happening in JavaScript. This is just for the demo.
01:26:47.570 - 01:27:29.312, Speaker A: It's not going to be like that. We have like a back end. That's it. If you guys have a question, please don't hesitate to ask her. Who wants to start? So the first thing maybe I missed it, but how is chainlink involved in this? We just need some random we just like for example, the VRF. Okay? Just to get some random numbers. And we can choose the guardian randomly so that they should not know each other.
01:27:29.312 - 01:28:02.084, Speaker A: They should be completely random. Yeah. So if you're going to use I probably say this every session, diagrams are really helpful, but if you're going to include this in your slides, I've been recommending people for their four minute videos. Start off with a few slides to introduce the problem they're solving, how they solve it, and then a diagram for a layout. I would simplify this dramatically. Like it looks like this is a technical diagram where you have your functions and stuff in there. Try to get a normie friendly version of this for people who might not be technical, that would be really helpful.
01:28:02.084 - 01:28:26.076, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, sure. I think we already have a simple one as well. Okay, perfect. Yeah, just generally the concept is good. Yeah, please go ahead, I'm listening. Yeah, the concept is good. Not everybody can be expected to self custody.
01:28:26.076 - 01:29:28.692, Speaker A: And I think the middle road is some sort of recovery scheme like we've seen in Argent or even Gnosis is kind of along that. Gnosis multi SIG is somewhere along that spectrum. So it's a worthwhile project mark or Nicola do you want to have any feedback? Look very quick before Mark can really add much more on the technical side. It's interesting. There is definitely a market it fits in between existing solutions. I would like to ask you about how you envision it. Isn't it a standalone application as you said or you want to be on top of different solution? You want to be like white label? How do you envision the final product to look like for the user and where the users can actually interact with it? Yeah, that's a very good question.
01:29:28.692 - 01:30:25.892, Speaker A: So we're basically thinking to deploy this on matic blockchain because we want low fees and also we're having a lot of transaction happening off chain, especially when we handle the seed phrase even that it's encrypted but the public key. But for now we're discussing that it's going to be a standalone application. Okay, got you. But definitely if there is anybody in a sponsor who is willing and interested to integrate it I'm just thinking any wallet who want to integrate a service like that. Yeah, that would be cool. Yeah, I think that's the main project market fit actually having one of the existing wallets to directly sponsor or buy the technology or whatever. You can still have it open source, but the implementation and the know to implement.
01:30:25.892 - 01:31:40.208, Speaker A: It on behalf of wallets could be something very valuable like in our ecosystem it happens quite a lot at the end of the day, it's quite interesting I have to say it's quite a twist because usually recovery scheme you are based with people you know as guardian and you introduce this context of randomization to have people you absolutely don't know as guardian. And that might be interesting. I would need more information on what is the incentivization scheme for the Guardians to actually do their work and keep your data. Because I'm not a good guy. If you give me some data to someone, which is just a chunk, a file I have to keep on my computer, I will forget about it three day after and just never think of it again. And if there's some kind of incentivization that might be interesting and yeah, these kind of things. We were also thinking that he can actually put it on IPFS as well.
01:31:40.208 - 01:32:24.364, Speaker A: Since nobody knows about this guy. It's not connected. He's going to just put all his private storage seed phrase in one place and once we need him, he can come back and call it. Otherwise, he can always put it in a hat or cold storage as well. But the motivation will be really the award because he's sitting on award, he's earning interest on his Avi token but he cannot get him unless someone asks to recover the password. So if you don't have the password and we have redundancy, remember? So if we come and said like who has the first, for example the first part and we send it to the first person and if you don't have it we're going to the second one. Right.
01:32:24.364 - 01:32:38.084, Speaker A: So this is the motivation. So it's like a proof of work, kind of. So if you don't give me back the password, you're not getting paid. Okay. Mockley. Thank you very much for your work. Of course.
01:32:38.084 - 01:33:09.660, Speaker A: Thank you. Sounds good. I was actually impressed that Victor understood my Italian English better than your French English. There was no explanation. To me, it's all right. But there's a lot of French today in the session. Hello, Xavier.
01:33:09.660 - 01:33:43.892, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, guys. And probably we're going to wrap up everything and have a video ready and please don't hesitate to contact me on my discord. It's going to be nice to have more feedback. So quick question, Trent. On Monday and Tuesday are twin session. How does it work? From Monday and Tuesday, there will be a bunch of sessions.
01:33:43.892 - 01:34:17.744, Speaker A: You're not obligated unless you've been signed up for some of them, which you probably have. You will only be in like, one per, I think, if that. But you should have a calendar invite that will bring you to, um I think we're we're going to wrap up here. Sake, I see that you added your name, but if you don't just I want to be sensitive of people in Europe. Nicola and Mark. I know Mark is there, so it's getting later for him. So I think we're going to wrap up here.
01:34:17.744 - 01:34:58.944, Speaker A: But I can have a one on one session with you where I review your stuff as well and then Benson, you had asked a question. Just DM me and I'll answer that in discord. But again, thank you to Mark and Nicola for not only showing up to this session, but the previous weeks. It's been a huge help getting hackers ready for submission and we can't wait for Sunday and then judging next week. Everything's going to be wrapped up next week. On Thursday, I believe, is the big finale where we'll have the finalists come, we'll have a big live stream and it's going to be really great to see which projects really push towards the end and got an amazing product out of this. So thank you again.
01:34:58.944 - 01:35:11.904, Speaker A: I appreciate your help. Mark and Nicola. Sure. It was fun. Learned a lot of stuff from project and also from Mark. Extremely valuable comment as with Trent as well. Thank you guys.
01:35:11.904 - 01:35:13.870, Speaker A: Speak soon. All right. Thank you.
