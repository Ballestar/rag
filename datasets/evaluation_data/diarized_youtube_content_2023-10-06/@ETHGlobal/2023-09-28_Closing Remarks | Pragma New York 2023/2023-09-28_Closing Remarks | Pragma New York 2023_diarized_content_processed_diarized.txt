00:00:07.210 - 00:00:50.974, Speaker A: Before we kind of close off and go mingle with each other, I want to just take 1 minute to thank everybody for being here. There's a lot of people that were involved in making this happen. So I want to give a quick shout out to a few parties, especially kind of a few of our sponsors and partners, arbitram, WorldCoin Filecoin Polygon and a lot of people who made this happen logistically. So I want to give a massive shout out to Nick and RHC for catering, bentley Maker, AV St Party Rental, mitchell's NY Logistics and this venue, Chelsea Square and the venue staff. This has been an amazing venue for us to use and they've been very gracious with letting us use it and actually make this into what the event has been so far. So please give them a massive round of applause. And last but not least, the ETH Bubble team who kind of put all this stuff behind the scenes for you.
00:00:50.974 - 00:01:28.600, Speaker A: So I hope you all enjoyed this and you probably have seen a lot of people here walking around making sure things are happening on time and you're going to see all of them here tomorrow and for the rest of the weekend if you're coming to the hackathon. So please give a massive shout out to the rest of the Youth Global team as well. And last but not least, this is just one of our couple of remaining pragmas. So without further ado, I want to just also give a quick shout out that the next one is going to be in Istanbul right at DevConnect Week. So November 16, that Thursday before the hackathon in Istanbul starts. You can find us there again and with that, check out Ethgobal.com for all the new details on this and thank you so much, really appreciate you being here.
