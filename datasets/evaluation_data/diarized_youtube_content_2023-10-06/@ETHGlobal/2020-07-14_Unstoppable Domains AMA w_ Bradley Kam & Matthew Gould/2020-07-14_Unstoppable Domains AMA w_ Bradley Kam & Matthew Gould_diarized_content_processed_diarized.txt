00:00:03.210 - 00:00:03.760, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:00:07.170 - 00:00:11.440, Speaker B: Okay, looks like we are good.
00:00:12.370 - 00:00:13.840, Speaker A: Live stream is up.
00:00:17.650 - 00:00:44.666, Speaker C: Awesome. Cool. All right, great. So let's kick this off. So, first of all, thanks, everybody, for coming out to this. We're doing an AMA with one of the founders of one of our sponsors, Unstoppable Domains. Obviously, Unstoppable is supporting us and hackfs, and we're really excited to be working with them and to have us at the event.
00:00:44.666 - 00:01:13.540, Speaker C: So we're going to dive into probably a bunch of topics here. And just for everybody else, the structure is going to be I'll start off some kind of early questions, and after that, we'll open it up to everybody. So feel free to, at that point, just raise your hand or otherwise just indicate in the chat that you have a question. We can just do direct questions. So that'd be so maybe we'll just start this off. Brad, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us. Excited to have you here.
00:01:13.540 - 00:01:32.940, Speaker C: Maybe I think a great place to start would just be chatting a little bit about maybe where you started kind of maybe from an educational point of view, and then kind of like what you studied and why that interested you, and then maybe some of the first things or early things that you worked on in your career before.
00:01:34.030 - 00:01:54.786, Speaker B: Sure, sure. And thanks for having me. So I'm from Atlanta. I went to college very near my house. I went to Emory. Actually spent very little time on my campus. I spent most of my time hanging out at Georgia Tech because that's where all the founders were.
00:01:54.786 - 00:03:08.950, Speaker B: People at Emory would just go to medical school or go get a law degree or something like that. Whereas all my friends, including Matt, who's our CEO at Unstoppable, he and I are high school friends, and he went to Georgia Tech. So I wound up hanging out much more over there for that reason. I studied maybe sort of an unusual background for startups in general, but I studied international politics and corruption, particularly, like, authoritarian regimes around the world and political conflict and problems associated. One of the kind of key themes, I guess, in that arena was issues with resource rich countries. So there's this idea called rentier state thesis, which basically says that if you have a bunch of valuable stuff in the ground randomly in your country, then it means your country is less likely to have democracy because the government doesn't need the people's will in order to have control. So there's a bunch of oil in the ground, a bunch of diamonds in the ground, a bunch of cocaine to grow whatever it is that leads you away from democracy.
00:03:08.950 - 00:03:15.866, Speaker B: So I studied politics, even went to DC for a few months for grad school, dropped out, determined that that was.
00:03:15.888 - 00:03:17.660, Speaker A: Kind of the wrong path and that.
00:03:18.190 - 00:03:43.300, Speaker B: There'S really no change happening there and that I should go and focus on startups. So I did real estate related companies first before moving to San Francisco and working on a marketing software company called Talkable, which is like enterprise SaaS software company that's all pre crypto. Although I was spending a lot of time playing around with crypto at night.
00:03:45.190 - 00:03:45.842, Speaker C: Cool, awesome.
00:03:45.896 - 00:03:46.114, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:46.152 - 00:04:14.160, Speaker C: And I think you mentioned it. But you've been friends with Matt, who's the CEO since high of. I know you guys have worked on many, many things together over the years. Just kind of like I think you just mentioned, maybe talkable, maybe dive into a little bit about what you were working on there and then maybe as a good segue kind of leading into how you both sort of started getting into crypto and kind of where your thoughts went on there.
00:04:14.610 - 00:05:30.642, Speaker B: Yeah, so so Matt and I both moved out to San Francisco to work on Talkable, which is a company that another one of our friends from Georgia Tech founded. So Matt was the head of product, I was the head of sales and then eventually became CEO. So we were apprising similar roles here where I'm kind of running the business side of things and Matt's running the product side of things. So we've done that sort of mode together previously, which is pretty cool in terms of mean, Matt's going to have to tell his crypto discovery story, so I don't know exactly where it was that he first read about it, although he is the one who got me into it. And this was early 2013. We were living in the Mission actually in this hacker house in San Francisco called 20 Mission where I believe the second bitcoin exchange in the US was launched out of our basement Trade Hill and Vitalik was coming and giving talks in our courtyard before Ethereum launched. So this was sort of a hub.
00:05:30.642 - 00:05:55.950, Speaker B: Matt was going to a lot of the early bitcoin meetups, and so we were just kind of hanging out with talking to enthusiasts, starting, I guess, back in early 2013, and we're just kind of following along in the background, playing around at night. And then Matt decided to kind of go full time crypto in 2016 and started going down the road that eventually, eventually led to unstoppable.
00:05:57.090 - 00:06:06.626, Speaker C: Awesome. I feel like all good stories start with a Mission hacker house at some point. It's definitely a popular theme. I think this is a big one too.
00:06:06.648 - 00:06:15.026, Speaker B: It was 40 people at one time, so a lot of crypto folks have cycled through there at some point or another, either gone to parties there or.
00:06:15.048 - 00:06:16.360, Speaker A: Lived there or whatever.
00:06:17.130 - 00:06:38.220, Speaker C: Awesome. Very cool. When you first started kind of thinking about unstoppable or maybe otherwise thinking about products in the crypto space, did you have kind of any ideas before you ended up settling on unstoppable? What were you thinking about? What was kind of like the main bits that excited you about it?
00:06:38.830 - 00:06:40.220, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think.
00:06:42.130 - 00:06:42.718, Speaker A: There was a.
00:06:42.724 - 00:07:31.390, Speaker B: Couple of pieces to it. One piece was, I guess, our group. We were not protocol developers. We were following along with what Ethereum was doing. But definitely we're focused on trying to make stuff easy to use, really focused on the user experience piece. And that's kind of how we eventually came to domain names, was that there were these networks that existed and functioned and were amazing ethereum, IPFS, others, and yet there was really no very limited usage of them, at least for really important use. Cases were really not happening yet.
00:07:31.390 - 00:08:07.800, Speaker B: And we saw the problem there as a user experience problem. And then the solution ultimately was naming. But the solution wasn't immediately apparent. The first thing that we kind of focused in on, or I should say that Matt and Braden, our co founder, focused in on was, hey, these networks are super hard to use. What do we do about that? And that was kind of the germ. And so Braden and Matt were hacking on some ideas and then came to, hey, naming would solve this.
00:08:09.450 - 00:08:09.862, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:08:09.916 - 00:08:10.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:10.300 - 00:08:24.720, Speaker C: Do you want to maybe chat a little bit? Like, specifically what that core functionality that naming functionality kind of enables, and why it was such a great way to start unstoppable as a company, basically.
00:08:25.650 - 00:08:59.490, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, so there's a couple of things. One is just that it's very hard. I mean, just like what DNS did for IP addresses, it was very hard for the web to take off if there wasn't some easy mapping to something that humans could remember and understand. And so prior to DNS, it would have been pretty difficult for websites to get popular. You'd have to copy and paste a random string of numbers and hope that people would somehow have something to do with that. That seems pretty difficult.
00:08:59.490 - 00:09:48.822, Speaker B: And then I think on the crypto side of things, you have this extra complexity because you're trying to tie in all these different networks, too. So the domain name can tie 50 different blockchains together in a sense, where you can be pointing your domain name to addresses across any number of blockchains that people might be using for payments. On top of that, also all these decentralized storage networks. So you have this problem of all these different protocols that are all being used right now, and no easy way to tie them together. And domain names solve this problem. Another thing that domain names do is that they are financialized. So it's not just about them being this Identifier.
00:09:48.822 - 00:10:08.206, Speaker B: It's about them also being this asset. And this concept has been well built in Internet 1.0 with DNS, where domain names are this prized asset, $50 billion plus asset class digital asset already. So it's kind of like perfect for.
00:10:08.228 - 00:10:09.694, Speaker A: A blockchain, if you think about it.
00:10:09.732 - 00:10:43.574, Speaker B: A giant digital asset. A giant digital asset class that's sitting around on centralized servers, cue crypto to step into this market. So it also seemed inevitable and because this domain name form factor is already understood by the world, it actually is easier than maybe some other crypto products to talk about. Even if you don't really understand blockchains or you don't really understand crypto yet, you probably do understand domain names.
00:10:43.622 - 00:10:44.220, Speaker A: So.
00:10:46.350 - 00:10:55.646, Speaker B: The initial germ of understanding doesn't require the crypto background. In the same way that I found personally when I was first reading and.
00:10:55.668 - 00:11:36.780, Speaker A: Learning about crypto, I actually needed to study money. And I didn't understand money before crypto. In a deeper sense, I didn't understand things like broad money calculations that tell you how valuable is the US dollar, what's the market cap of the US dollar? Never thought about a question like that before crypto. So I actually had to do this gigantic deep study into the nature and history of money before I could even get my head around crypto. I don't think the same is true for decentralized domain name. Yes, you need to understand decentralization, but in some ways the parallels are actually simpler. Super long answer.
00:11:38.110 - 00:12:24.986, Speaker C: That's good. I think it's definitely true that it's interesting when you're building, I think, software for crypto, you're essentially building software inside of an economy that preexists. So you kind of need to be able to think deeply about what are the different considerations around price and how people could utilize whatever you're creating. Even something as simple as an Ft could be used as collateral for a loan at some point someday, right? And you don't really get control over that. So it's good to know these things. And then I think also maybe another kind of longer form question that I think any founder could talk about. What were some of the early day decisions that you've looked back on now that it's been, I think, almost about two years or so, that were either really good early decisions you made.
00:12:24.986 - 00:12:45.970, Speaker C: I know a lot of people on this call and watching this later are likely going to be kind of starting their first companies out of hack FS and what they build here. So I think it's always good to know what were some of those early decisions that ended up being paying dividends down the road and what were some of those that may have been mistakes or otherwise just like not the right prioritization?
00:12:48.710 - 00:14:20.238, Speaker A: So I guess one thing that we decided early on that I think was really important was we decided to build our own registries as kind of the core part of our stack. And the reason why that was so important is because it enabled us to control and build all of these different pieces on top in just the way that we saw fit. So it was the thing that kind of unlocked the broader market of tools. And so when we first started, we talked about how we were building a domain registry and this was going to simplify your crypto payments. That was a very narrow focus and I guess you could say there was something that was a little bit off there that we were focused narrowly on crypto payments, whereas we realized later that it's really more about the decentralized web holistically and the decentralized web has payments in it. But that's just kind of one feature of the decentralized web, not kind of the core feature of our product and what we were trying to do, but so building these registries wound up being this core piece because it allowed us to build a community around what we were doing. And so we have the registries, we have a community that supports the registries, that's excited about them, that wants to build on top of them and that kind of allowed us to go and build a user base on top.
00:14:20.238 - 00:15:16.674, Speaker A: We have a whole bunch of different tools that we're building. We have a registrar like our own version of GoDaddy, that's a big piece. And then we also have web tools that allow you to build like you can build a blog on IPFS and launch on IPFS without being technical, things like that. So those pieces, registry, registrar and web tools, all three together are what the company is building. But we needed this registry piece and that was an early decision that was maybe not immediately obvious. So that's probably the biggest one to call out, I guess I should still say very specifically what things were not as good. I think this narrow focus on payments early on was not as good and also just kind of led people to not to kind of maybe miss the bigger picture point.
00:15:16.674 - 00:15:42.214, Speaker A: The bigger picture point is a decentralized Internet. A decentralized Internet requires on the regular internet you can pay, you can view content and you can communicate. And the decentralized web will have all of those components too, just self sovereign, not one of those. You need all of them in order to have a decentralized internet. So that was a later realization got.
00:15:42.252 - 00:16:15.894, Speaker C: You and I guess kind of really nice segue, I think, to some of the new stuff that you've just kind of recently announced. And obviously there's also a hackathon prize for people that are building on top of it. So you mentioned that you built up this user base around the registry and just recently you announced a decentralized chat, which I think makes a very good use of that community that you've built up so far. Can maybe chat a little bit about the kind of unstoppable chat and what you guys have been working on and maybe what led to building out this piece of software and what excites you about it.
00:16:16.092 - 00:16:44.938, Speaker A: Yeah, and so communication is a core part of the Internet. We launched a decentralized chat protocol called Dchat. It's the first of many decentralized chat protocols. We think there probably will be and should be many. And that's good. The core principles of a decentralized chat protocol, we believe should be. The user controls their messages.
00:16:44.938 - 00:17:17.890, Speaker A: They're encrypted, they're stored on peer to peer storage. The domain name is the username. So that it's easy for us to communicate and find people, but also so that the username is self sovereign. And this is super important right now. If you use Signal or whatever, they use your phone number for identity. Messages are stored on their servers. So if they were to get hacked, if they were to get shut down, if they were to ban you, you would have no more access to your chats and they're not portable.
00:17:17.890 - 00:18:05.238, Speaker A: If you move chat to a protocol, you get the opportunity for users to have shared inboxes. So we launched Unstoppable Chat as the first app on top of the Dchat protocol, but other apps are going to be launched as well on it. And each time I go to one of these apps, I get a shared inbox. My messages are the same, my contacts are the same, and it's all encrypted stored by the user. It's a completely different structure for how messaging should work. This seems super timely given what's going on in the world. The Earn It Act being proposed in the United States essentially would force companies to monitor the communications on their platform and therefore they might need to put a backdoor under their encryption in order to follow this law.
00:18:05.238 - 00:18:45.558, Speaker A: If the user controls the chats, this is not relevant anymore. So this is actually a protection against some of the encroachment that is happening by governments around the world onto tech platforms. And basically what's happening is the structure is wrong. Companies control the data because companies control the data. Governments want to regulate the companies for what they're doing with the data, want to get access to the data, et cetera. If the user controls the data, all of this goes away. And so it's critical at this moment in history that we make this shift to decentralized systems us.
00:18:45.558 - 00:19:20.830, Speaker A: Otherwise I don't think it's going to be super good for us. I mean, humans, I don't think that the outlook for the world is rosy if we continue to allow this type of corporate control over us. And I think it's getting worse quite quickly. So that's why we thought it was important in terms of the hackathon. So we have a hackathon prize for building out a decentralized chat protocol on IPFS. So for those of you who are interested, please check out our channels. Please participate.
00:19:20.830 - 00:19:40.520, Speaker A: This is a huge opportunity. The IPFS community will, I think, go wild when we have a great functioning chat protocol. I think there's just thousands, tens of thousands of users ready to play around with your technology. So it's a great opportunity to get something out there.
00:19:42.090 - 00:19:42.550, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:19:42.620 - 00:19:43.094, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah.
00:19:43.132 - 00:20:15.586, Speaker C: And I think I'll start filtering some of the questions from the chat and then open it up afterwards. But I guess the question is for the future of Unstoppable chat. Are you guys interested in kind of this is a question from Josh. Planning to include audio or videos or images and that sort of stuff and then maybe back. Our hitchhiking on that is also what does the plan look like for unstoppable in the next five years? In the next ten years, what are you guys excited to bring to market? How are you thinking about this going forward?
00:20:15.688 - 00:20:54.606, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think we definitely want all aspects of communication should be able to function on IPFS and the decentralized web. So all of the above? Yes, I don't think we're going to be the ones to build all of it. Unstoppable chat is sort of an example app for the market. Yes, our users are using it, but we think there's going to be dozens of apps. We think Wallets are going to start supporting things like Chat. DApps are going to start supporting things like Chat, these features browsers, these are going to be tools that it's just a plugin. So it's going to be something that apps of all different types are going to start using.
00:20:54.606 - 00:21:43.918, Speaker A: So I don't think it's going to rely so much on just what we're building in terms of what we're building. Generally though, we want to be the easiest way for people to onboard to the decentralized web. So right now the decentralized web has 20,000, 50,000 users maybe tops, something like that. And that number needs to be 5 billion. And so that is the process that we're going through, which is make it easy, provide more tools. Like right now if you want to go and build a website on the decentralized web, your tooling is very limited. So where we're trying to be over the course of five years is that that's not the case.
00:21:43.918 - 00:21:56.180, Speaker A: Shopify has thousands of tools, tens of thousands of tools for you to use in order to build out great applications on the internet. That's what we're missing and that's where we're trying to go.
00:21:57.990 - 00:22:35.486, Speaker C: Gotcha. And then maybe one last question from me and from the YouTube audience. And then we'll move on to questions directly here specifically related to that. We chatted about the early days. The kind of idea came from improving the user experience of using crypto and then you chatted about kind of having full fledged of tools like how does unstoppable balance between decentralization and having everything be fully in the hands of the user versus user experience and adoption and onboarding and that sort of thing. Really relevant question for anybody who's really building any DAP they want mainstream users to use.
00:22:35.668 - 00:23:40.530, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think you need to make sure that your security model is really sound and that that's kind of the first thing. So I think all of this stuff only works because the technology is self custody. Because the domain names are ERC, 721 tokens stored by the user, because all updates are made only by the user, by signing a message with your private key. The whole reason why any of this stuff works is because we're relying on the security of the Ethereum blockchain. And so I think you need to make sure that that security model is central to whatever you're building first. After that you're just trying to figure out as many ways as possible to make the clunkiness that is now inevitable because of point number one, as not clunky as possible. And so one of the things that we did early on is we have a transaction processor that enables you to allows us to pay fees for users transactions.
00:23:40.530 - 00:24:07.066, Speaker A: And the reason this is important is that if not, you need to have $0.05 in your wallet every single time you want to do something. And if that's the case, then you're not going to do a lot of stuff and you're going to have a whole bunch of users that are going to be like, oh crap, I don't have Ethereum in my wallet. Okay, now I need to go and transfer. Okay, now I need to wait five minutes. Now I'm going to do something else. So that's not the way to get users to use the tech.
00:24:07.066 - 00:24:40.760, Speaker A: So that's a solution. It doesn't compromise on security, but it does improve the user experience. So that's one example of a strategy. I think this is really the I'll give you maybe one more. So one other one is we have a pool of users who were not familiar with common Ethereum wallets. I know this seems crazy to this audience. We've all been using MetaMask and others for years probably.
00:24:40.760 - 00:25:19.678, Speaker A: But that's actually not the majority of crypto users. The majority of crypto users have not used MetaMask, have not used Ethereum products. The majority of crypto users are not core Ethereum folks. The community is way bigger than that. And so we want people to be sending any crypto using domain names. We want people from any community, crypto or non crypto, to be using a decentralized web. Now it's mostly crypto first, but all of that has led us to do things like we created an option for you to have email accounts.
00:25:19.678 - 00:25:54.650, Speaker A: So if you're not ready to claim your domain name, you can create an email account and get a domain and then you can claim it later. Seems like a small thing that helped conversion a lot because some people aren't ready to learn how to handle their Ethereum private key yet and so they have other options. Now you should always claim your domain as soon as possible. You want to take custody of your assets as soon as possible. That's the safest thing. But that can be two steps now. So those are a couple of examples.
00:25:54.650 - 00:26:56.800, Speaker A: I would say this is probably the most important thing to think about if you're going to be launching a crypto project, how do you reduce as many points of friction and this isn't even crypto specific, it's just that crypto is hard to use, so there's a lot of opportunities. But this is your job, constantly finding more ways to get the product into the hands or mouths or whatever of your customers and you really want to just shove it in there. You don't want to say to your customer, hey, go figure this out. You want to say, how do I make it incrementally easier every single day to make it so more and more people can adopt? Because your first hundred people, they'll probably deal with whatever kind, they're your friends, they're true believers, whatever, they'll deal with anything. So the first hundred or thousand users are going to be very different than the next 10,000 users and the next 100,000 users. And every single time you want to get one of these further away circles to onboard your product, it's going to need to be even easier. So it's a constant journey towards a user experience that's actually ready for the whole world.
00:26:57.410 - 00:27:20.520, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree and like you mentioned, it's the same thing whether you're building a centralized piece of software in traditional Web Two or even Web Three world. Right, so, yeah, always be thinking about how you can iterate and Davy test and validate and everything. Right, awesome. Very helpful advice. Cool. I think what I'll do here is I'll turn it over to some of the people in the chat. Just going through questions in order here.
00:27:20.520 - 00:27:30.380, Speaker C: Josh, I think you're up here first with a few of your questions. If you'd like you can unmute and show your video as well and just ask these questions directly if that works for you.
00:27:36.400 - 00:27:37.550, Speaker D: Can you hear me?
00:27:38.240 - 00:27:39.556, Speaker A: Yes. Yep.
00:27:39.608 - 00:27:48.980, Speaker D: So I had a few questions. So is Unstoppable domains the sole admin for top level domains?
00:27:49.400 - 00:28:36.400, Speaker A: So admin is maybe a term we would need to define. The idea behind a blockchain domain registry is that you wouldn't need an admin. So you mint domains and then the user controls them forever. You don't need to rely on what the registry does ever again. These are ERC, 721 tokens that are just in your control. We don't have any subscriptions, so there's no policy to be set longer term. So I think the best way to sort of sidestep the issue of admin is to remove any needed ongoing relationship between the registry provider and the end user.
00:28:39.960 - 00:28:46.070, Speaker D: So are there any other top level domains planned for the future that are going to be similar?
00:28:47.320 - 00:29:11.020, Speaker A: Not at this time. We're really focused on the web tools. We think that we have two registries. We think the biggest problem right now is the ecosystem of tools to use. So that's really where the next few years, that's really where we need to be focused. So no immediate plans, it's all web tools.
00:29:13.520 - 00:29:29.920, Speaker D: So we have top level domains in Web Two and they're managed by the Iana ICANN or whatever those organizations are. What would happen or are you worried about if they approved at Crypto or Zillow?
00:29:31.400 - 00:30:24.580, Speaker A: We're not worried. We've had a lot of conversations with folks in those organizations, and broadly speaking, they don't see their role as this very activist, activist type role. They're really trying to be kind of like a community. Good. Preventing collisions. And so previously the way to prevent collisions was to ensure this biding process around domain names so you wouldn't have multiple browsers and other parties wouldn't have to decide who to resolve which is the right one. Now, what's happening is it's possible to launch on alternative technology and get support from browsers? Like, for example, we have Albert browser that resolves crypto natively.
00:30:24.580 - 00:31:30.916, Speaker A: And so they now will have an interest in not having people collide with us because we're the system that's live with browsers. So it's actually bad now for browsers and for the Internet community to have those things happen. Being a sort of conservative organization that is trying to protect Internet users, I think makes us pretty aligned. So no, I don't see any issue. But I think that in general, with the decentralized web, the gatekeepers here really are the browsers and the web tools they decide. And I think they're going to continue to expand their editorial power in this way over time, in that it's not about any one central servers that say, like, this is the official DNS record. It's about what the community believes should be supported and should be resolved.
00:31:30.916 - 00:32:11.652, Speaker A: And so it really comes down to the browsers. It's a different way to look at this market. But I think we're already seeing this develop in general. I think we're seeing a lot of interest from the traditional web world in the decentralized web. I think maybe the crypto community would be a little surprised by how philosophically aligned they actually are. They thought this was the Internet they were building in the first place. They thought they were building a peer to peer Internet in the they thought that they were building up, you know, a system that was going to be controlled by the world and not controlled by corporates.
00:32:11.652 - 00:32:40.400, Speaker A: And it kind of slipped away from everybody. And so the problem when you're talking to the traditional web community is a decentralized web. Good. It's are you guys really going to make it this time? People have been promising us this for like 20 years. Like, there was this alternate there was this alternate system. There was Tor, there was this, there was that. There were so many different people that have come to us with this story, and so we're a little jaded.
00:32:40.400 - 00:33:16.990, Speaker A: That's the response you get. Not, this is bad. And so now we're just having to know, like Ethereum and IPFS, these tools, they're up to the task. And this is the conversation that we were we just we launched the chat protocol out of Mozilla's. Mozilla has this incubator called Fix the Internet, and they're. Not very ideological about which networks are going to do it, but they're basically like the internet's broken. We heard that some of you decentralized web people might be about to fix it, so we want to amplify that.
00:33:16.990 - 00:33:40.710, Speaker A: So we're seeing all these really good signals. It's really just a skepticism about whether or not these networks are actually ready for primetime. And that's what we're trying to do. And I think that's what this hackfs community is trying to do more generally is make the decentralized web ready for primetime. In which case I think we're going to see a lot of support from the traditional web community once we can achieve that.
00:33:43.400 - 00:33:44.470, Speaker D: Cool, thanks.
00:33:47.320 - 00:34:10.990, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, I mean, that's part of the reason why we're running this event honestly is that we think it's a really good time. There's a lot of great technologies that are kind know, finally ready for market launch and really can be critical pieces of the infrastructure for this new decentralized web. Also, Thomas, you had a really good question in the chat. I'm not sure if you're able to unmute and show your video.
00:34:11.600 - 00:34:14.110, Speaker E: I can't show my video for some reason.
00:34:16.100 - 00:34:16.850, Speaker C: Yes.
00:34:20.180 - 00:34:58.990, Speaker E: There it goes. Yeah. So that's so interesting. You were talking about people 25 years ago thinking we were going to change the world. I was definitely one of those people definitely got burned. I'm just interested, like I totally understand and agree with user owned, user encrypted data, but it seems to me the way that the internet is broken today is that these companies own this data and then they're selling that data. So what exactly are we going to be selling if it's not the user's data?
00:34:59.920 - 00:36:05.392, Speaker A: This is a great question and I actually think this is the biggest question to answer for decentralized web tech more generally than the technical solutions. Now this may not be as fun of a conversation for folks to be having, but this is probably the harder thing to solve for. And I don't have all the answers for sure, but I can give you a few that we've already seen. One is brave browser. Brave Browser pays you to watch ads, they're not selling your data in the same way. So we have already seen one of the first successful decentralized web companies brave building a browser, already figure out a way to start monetizing there and using advertisers to do it. So it doesn't mean that advertisers need to disappear in this new web model where users control the data.
00:36:05.392 - 00:37:02.310, Speaker A: It just means that the power structure changes and the user presumably makes money there rather than just getting a free product. So that's one thing. We sell domains, so we have a business model that is directly related to building out the decentralized web. There's also web tools. The Shopify model I think is really powerful. So Shopify doesn't get a cut of your revenue, shopify doesn't control your customers, but they do sell you tools for you to build out web applications. So that's another really big area where I think people are going to be the biggest thing that I think people believe about the traditional web that I don't think is true is that users won't pay for stuff.
00:37:02.310 - 00:37:30.636, Speaker A: And there's been this thesis going around in Silicon Valley that users need everything to be free and ads and whatever and that's the only way users are going to engage with products. I don't think that's true. I think the users are going to pay for stuff. I think they're going to be happy to pay for stuff. It's going to mean that those products are going to need to be higher quality. But that's good. Like a lot of the stuff that we've been using, a lot of the tools that we've been using that are ad supported, they don't change that much.
00:37:30.636 - 00:38:17.180, Speaker A: As great as Facebook and Twitter and Reddit and these other tools may be, they're not evolving at a particularly fast rate. They're not providing new YouTube, they're not providing new and interesting user experiences at the rate that they should be. And the reason why is because they're monopolies. They're data monopolies. They don't have to be. If there were 50 YouTubes that were all competing to the death trying to make the most awesome video app for users, and we controlled our video and it was stored on IPFS, and we permissioned these networks to be able to have access to show it, then we're going to get far better apps and maybe users are going to pay for that. Maybe users are going to pay the content creators directly and applications that drive that traffic will get a fee.
00:38:17.180 - 00:38:47.270, Speaker A: I think there's just so much money that's going to flow around the world when you have a more digital economy that there's going to be no shortage of business opportunities. So I think ads are a cancerous business model. The way that they're structured, not the best business model. And they've led three companies essentially to take all of the revenue, take a little cut off the top of the internet, and that's going to go away and that's going to expand the market. I don't think it's going to shrink it.
00:38:48.920 - 00:38:58.650, Speaker E: Thank you. I'm sort of kidding a little bit, but throw you back to 1990. That's exactly what everyone was saying back then.
00:38:59.180 - 00:39:04.636, Speaker A: I know, and that's the whole point is that it didn't work out this.
00:39:04.658 - 00:39:10.364, Speaker E: Last time but now we have these tools like cryptography that might help, I hope.
00:39:10.562 - 00:40:08.716, Speaker A: And I think that when you can provide decent experiences, like you may not be able to provide Facebook level experiences, but when you can provide decent experiences that are self sovereign, that's going to be a competitor, that's going to change the landscape. It's not going to allow these data monopolies to be able to steamroll the entire world and force them to use an app where they control everything because you'll have a slightly more awkward, maybe self sovereign version over here. And that's going to create the competitive drive that's going to make it possible for those to be the mainstream platforms in the future. So I think once you have self sovereign options that are decent, it's going to be way harder for these centralized options to be able to fight longer term. And this is like a 20 year fight. It's going to take a long time to knock YouTube and Facebook off of their data monopolies, but I think it's important. I think it's actually critical that we do this as humans.
00:40:08.716 - 00:40:40.264, Speaker A: I don't know if you all have been seeing this lately, but YouTube is now showing me vitalik ETH giveaway Scam ads. I don't know how they're not going to wind up being legally responsible for people losing money. It's disgusting that this is happening. So I think the system is just so broken that there's going to be an army of people trying to take the market away from them because we need to. Great.
00:40:40.302 - 00:40:41.160, Speaker E: Good luck.
00:40:41.920 - 00:40:42.670, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:40:45.710 - 00:41:19.138, Speaker C: Cool. That was a great discussion. I love that. Any other questions from the crowd? We actually just recently our videos from content that we own started being played in these giveaway scams, leading to massive confusion. So 100% agree that ownership of data is such a big deal here, just don't have control. Awesome. Maybe we'll wrap up on a nice kind of wrap up question.
00:41:19.138 - 00:41:36.890, Speaker C: Kind of any advice that you have to this crowd of people that are listening. Kind of very likely at some point to be first time founders if they're taking part in this event. Kind of any kind of advice or feedback you have for somebody who's done this before in crypto, especially just for the audience.
00:41:37.870 - 00:42:28.362, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I'm going to sound a little unpopular here, but you really got to think about your business model. It's the thing that drives the direction of your product. And the reason why this is important is because if you want to make real change, you need to create a flywheel. You need to build a product, distribute a product, and have the distribution of that product make it easier for you to build more product. And that loop needs to be there and it needs to be there basically all along. That's what you're discovering during that first year or two out there in the wilderness where your friends are telling you how crazy you are and your family is embarrassed whenever anyone asks them what you're up to. When you're in that phase of startup building and this totally happens.
00:42:28.362 - 00:43:11.400, Speaker A: And you should ignore all those people, by the way, as they're telling you that, but during that phase, what you're trying to figure out is how to build your flywheel. And if you leave that part out and you just build awesome tech, it's not going to matter, unfortunately, because you don't have a way to sustain it. You don't have a way because whatever you built is not going to be awesome enough next year. You're going to need to build more. You're going to have to keep building for years in order to actually make any kind of real change. So you really need to figure out how is that going to work in such a way where when I build this awesome product, it enables me to build more awesome product. So I would solve that problem.
00:43:11.400 - 00:43:15.160, Speaker A: I would consider that your most urgent problem.
00:43:17.210 - 00:43:39.530, Speaker C: Awesome. It's great advice. Cool. Well, you know, I think I speak for everyone here. Thanks so much, Brad, for taking the time to chat with us. And we're really excited, like I mentioned at the beginning, to have unstoppable as part of this event, excited to see what people build on top of unstoppable chat and otherwise kind of what kind of funky crypto domains they come up with. But yeah, thanks so much for taking the time and it's great chatting.
00:43:39.690 - 00:43:40.800, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
00:43:41.730 - 00:43:43.280, Speaker C: Awesome. Take care, everybody.
00:43:43.650 - 00:43:45.530, Speaker A: Thanks. Bye.
