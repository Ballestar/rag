00:00:07.210 - 00:00:26.200, Speaker A: Hi, all. I'm Tom. I'm a unity developer here at Mona. Mona, if you don't know, is a metaverse platform where you create digital spaces and experiences. People can't people can join, you can share them. You can create games, you can create art galleries, you can create WebView. Can imagine really.
00:00:26.200 - 00:01:04.298, Speaker A: Inside of Mona we have this feature called Visual Scripting. And that's what the session is going to be about. So I've got this self sample project cell that we'll go through and I also have some links that I will share. So here's this space that I prepared for the session. I can share a link here. If anyone wants to jump in, they can totally do so and explore it in their own time or during the session, wherever you feel like. So essentially, Visual Scripting is a way in Mona to create interactive functionality.
00:01:04.298 - 00:01:37.322, Speaker A: So what I've created here is this NBC dialogue system where you can walk up to this hologram guy and you can have a chat with him. It's very similar to a lot of RPG games and such. Like if you've played any of those in the past, it has like text and this menu, you can set different options. There's some dialogue which I generated this cool AI tool called Suno. Shout out to those guys. I'll also drop a link to them in the chat. Anyone who's curious, I see people saying they're in there.
00:01:37.322 - 00:02:02.046, Speaker A: I'm in a private session, so I'm not going to see you guys running around. But have fun in there. But yeah, you can use the Q and E buttons to select different options and he'll reply to you and give you information. And this is all done with Visual Scripting. And this is just one of the sort of many things you can do with Visual Scripting. You can create dialogue systems like this. You could create puzzles or like escape rooms.
00:02:02.046 - 00:02:26.780, Speaker A: Like you want to be crazy. You could try and remake like Call of Duty or something. Or like, Rocket League. Whatever tickles your fancy, I guess. Yeah, I'm going to be here to show you the ropes. I won't be going super basic because I'm going to assume people might be familiar with scripting and stuff like that as it's a hackathon. And I'm sure you can pick up the basics on your own as we go.
00:02:26.780 - 00:02:51.186, Speaker A: So here we are inside of Unity, inside of the Mona SDK. We have our own SDK project. It's built inside of uni that you need to use to build spaces. It's more information about that in our docs, which you can find on the Mono website. So here we are. This is the space Life threw together really quickly in Blender. It's not super pretty, but it's okay.
00:02:51.186 - 00:03:11.766, Speaker A: So with the dialogue system, obviously you're solved speaking to this character here. So we have this Hologram character. On this character we have an anime. Anime has two states. It's super basic. He has like a talking state and an idle state. So when he's talking he switches to the talking state and vice versa.
00:03:11.766 - 00:03:48.850, Speaker A: These are just some animations I got from Miximo. If you want animations, it's a great resource essentially that's outside of visual scripting. This is the animation system but it's controlled by the visual script. So when you first walk up the stairs there is this collider here and this collider interacts with the visual script that's on it. It's called the activator. And essentially what happens is when the player walks into this, it's going to enable this conversation game object. And this is the manager that manages the whole conversation.
00:03:48.850 - 00:04:23.300, Speaker A: So I press play, I actually have a few nodes up here which allow it to work inside of the editor. But you can see what will happen is the conversation that this activator will start conversation game object and that will sort of get everything rolling. It's just super easy to do. In visual scripting we have this concept of event nodes. Event nodes are something that get triggered when you press a hotkey or when the game starts or there's various event nodes inside of the visual scripting graph that you can access.
00:04:24.230 - 00:04:34.740, Speaker B: Sorry, I wonder if you could just zoom in ever so slightly into those at the bottom there.
00:04:36.630 - 00:04:43.400, Speaker A: Is this back, can you see? I got full screen. Unfortunately I actually can't zoom in on this. This is like fixed size.
00:04:43.770 - 00:04:50.346, Speaker B: Okay, no problem. I mean you're doing a great job of explaining so thus far. Yeah, no problem.
00:04:50.528 - 00:05:23.300, Speaker A: This is the activator. It's very basic. Essentially when you walk into this collider it will trigger this event, this on trigger enter event and it will then try and get the tag of the object which triggered it. In our case we want the tag player because we only want to activate this when a player walks into the tag. And that will enable this other object which has its own visual script. As you can see, this visual script is much larger. This is the one that does the bulk of the logic for the dialogue system.
00:05:23.300 - 00:06:19.114, Speaker A: But essentially what is happening is inside of our game objects. In this conversation we have a UI system and there's several objects for responses and several for inputs. You can see these are all individual objects and they're labeled one through three or one through two depending which it is because of the different number of options. But you could expand this type of system and have a really expansive conversation system if you wanted. Obviously this is just a demo so it's just some script that Chat GBT wrote for me. But if you wanted to have a full story or a tear guide or I don't know, helper, you could do all that sort of stuff with this type of system which is very cool. So let's dive into this graph a bit.
00:06:19.114 - 00:07:02.914, Speaker A: So it's all split into several categories some of these are like custom events that I've set up and some of them are unit events. So it all starts with this on enable event. So the other script, when it enables this object, it goes to this unable event and it says to play this response and I'm triggering a custom event down here. So this is the response event. So what this does is you give it a value and depending which value you give it, it disables all events and then it enables the one you want. So this correlates with the numbers of the responses in here. So you can see 0123 on the hierarchy.
00:07:02.914 - 00:07:29.770, Speaker A: Maybe you can't see because they're really small, but hopefully you can get the idea. You give it the number and it plays that event. When it does this, it does a few other things as well. It sets the animator state of the NPC to the talking state. So he starts waving his hands around and explaining. And then also there's a voice line. You probably can't hear it when I showed you on screen share, but if you go in the space yourself, there's voice lines.
00:07:29.770 - 00:08:11.960, Speaker A: So we get the length of the voice line and we wait until it's finished and then we go back to the selection state. The selection state is managed by these other events here, these free. So there's a navigation event, there's a highlight event and there's a select event. These navigation event and highlight event, they're cluster related. Essentially, when you are in the experience and you're pressing cycle, you might be able to see down here by zoom in. It's going to trigger these events. You can't really see it's being nasty to me.
00:08:11.960 - 00:08:46.894, Speaker A: Triggered this navigation event. Essentially we're looping through the elements in this input list. There's free inputs, so a value of free and then it overflows. If you go to full, it goes back to zero and so on. But essentially this keeps track of which option you have selected. And then the highlight event is what is changing the colors when you're changing changes the colors and stuff of the UI elements. This is what manages that.
00:08:46.894 - 00:09:13.560, Speaker A: This is called from this. It's kind of just like a visual thing. And then the select event is the one that triggers when you actually select an option. So it's like whoa, why are you it's going to tell me it's the Hologram, it's going to do that whole business. And this is triggered by this. This is very basic. Essentially it just takes the currently selected object from the highlight from the navigation event.
00:09:13.560 - 00:09:59.560, Speaker A: It's stored in a variable on the side here and then there's a switch statement that triggers the correct response. But yeah, as you can see, there's not that many nodes. It does seem a bit scary at first, but once you dive into it, it's not that complicated. This sort of sample project will be available after the project for people to rip into and try and reverse engineer. I see a question. Is visual scripting similar to scripting in Second Life? I've never actually used scripting in Second Life, but it's very similar to Unreal Blueprints if you have an experience of that. A lot of these visual scripting systems are very similar in design.
00:09:59.560 - 00:10:40.596, Speaker A: They all have nodes, obviously, and then you have variables and events. So if you've used something like Second Life, I'm sure you could probably dive into something like this and pick it up very quickly. A bit of uni knowledge would definitely be helpful with certain events, lifecycle events which trigger certain times in uni, such as when the game starts or once every frame and stuff like that. So if you had some unity knowledge, you would have some background knowledge on those already. If not, there's not that many of them. They're fairly easy to learn. But yeah, this is kind of an overview on how this works.
00:10:40.596 - 00:11:13.362, Speaker A: We do have some other visual scripting samples already in. We have this Mono library with some assets in it. Here, give it a minute to load. This has some assets as well. We have this recently launched Monocapture which has its own visual scripts. It's slightly more complicated than this, but that's also a good project to dive into if you want. Yeah, I'm kind of happy to take some questions if anyone has any.
00:11:13.362 - 00:11:18.740, Speaker A: I'll try my best to answer them. Let me scroll through, see if there is any going on.
00:11:21.290 - 00:11:49.200, Speaker B: Of course. Yeah. Everybody do feel free to drop your questions in the chat, Tom. I mean, I'd love to start off myself, I see Quaison is following up, but yeah, I don't know if perhaps you could share some highlights of some projects which have been built. Obviously you mentioned that the opportunities are nearly kind of endless as to what people may build, but I just wondered if you had any particular highlights yourself.
00:11:51.650 - 00:12:46.640, Speaker A: Yes, so this space that I linked actually polls to two other spaces with a bunch of interactive features. So if you're in here, these two things, Paul's, if you look at them and left click, you can jump into some other spaces that have previously been created. Another Mona employee shot out and it has this really cool system where the whole map if you want to know more about it, you can ask the NBC guy, he'll tell you all about what do you mean by that? Can you move objects around? You can totally move objects around. You could potentially create like a visual script that generates the seed when the level started and have like a randomized world every time as well. That would be possible.
00:12:51.030 - 00:13:10.710, Speaker B: Yeah. Quiz. Feel free to expand on that if that's not quite what you meant. There's also another question, Tom, which says how easy would it be to make these Vs events available on Mona library as drag and drop templates for their individual builds and use cases.
00:13:11.530 - 00:13:43.746, Speaker A: Yep. So for this specific NPC Soap sample project, I'll probably clean it up a little bit, and then we'll put that on the One library. In terms of these events themselves, I think they're specific to graphs. I don't know if you can reference scripts between graphs. That might be something for us to look into. But we can totally upload individual graphs as assets and you could download them that way. We could distribute those through the Model library or Discord or whatever we decide we want to do.
00:13:43.768 - 00:13:46.580, Speaker B: That amazing.
00:13:48.170 - 00:13:48.774, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:13:48.892 - 00:13:50.310, Speaker B: Can you create a game?
00:13:50.460 - 00:14:18.320, Speaker A: Yeah, you can totally create a game. Your imagination is the limit. It's almost a full uni API is accessible through visual scripting. You could create, like, I don't know, a basketball game. I know there is a basketball game somewhere that someone created. If you search on the Model Discord, perhaps you'll find it. I know there was another guy, he built this spaceship, but you have to fly around like a racing game.
00:14:18.320 - 00:14:40.600, Speaker A: That was very cool. Yeah, you can totally create games. We're also looking at adding a bunch of custom nodes that will allow you to do things like access external APIs and stuff like that. So once that opens, people better do the most stuff. I see a link to the basketball. Again, if anyone wants to check that out, it's in the chat and key code.
00:14:41.690 - 00:14:58.038, Speaker B: That's amazing. Are there any libraries or a general link where people can go to potentially look at the full catalog of games? I don't know if we could possibly get a link to that. Or, Tom, if you want to explain that a little bit further.
00:14:58.214 - 00:15:18.340, Speaker A: Yeah. The best place to find spaces is just go to Marketplace. Just link to that here. This is all about our minute spaces. A lot of spaces are not minted. Those ones will not necessarily be here. Some of them might be.
00:15:18.340 - 00:15:39.590, Speaker A: But yeah, if you want to check out spaces, definitely check this out. There's a lot of awesome stuff going on. I highly recommend a lot of them. Fallen Giant has a lot of co interactivity with cutscenes and stuff like that. But yeah, there's like hundreds and hundreds of spaces to go through. Not all of them have interactivity. Some of them do, some of them don't.
00:15:39.590 - 00:15:59.150, Speaker A: Another great place to find spaces is the Monovas Discord. A lot of people post, like, work in progress, things that they're building there. I can drop a link to that as yeah.
00:15:59.220 - 00:16:16.690, Speaker B: Tom, I don't know if you've got anything else planned. Please do tell me if I'm jumping in, but perhaps for people who are looking to use Mona, I'm not sure if you could share any insights as to where they could get started in terms of building their projects.
00:16:17.030 - 00:16:34.010, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So, like I mentioned at Start, we have our own SDK. You can find this on our webpage or on GitHub itself. Let me pull it up. Here it is. You can download our soap. Start project on GitHub.
00:16:34.010 - 00:17:05.250, Speaker A: You can load that into Unity. There's full tutorial on how they're all done in the README. You can go and you can start importing objects from your favorite 3D tools if you're a blender guy or anything. If you don't have any 3D experience you can still take part in Mona. We have this library of assets you can use like drag and drop style. You can find free assets online and like kit bash spaces. That way you don't have to be a 3D artist to take part in lorna.
00:17:07.830 - 00:17:50.930, Speaker B: Yeah, I see somebody's just commented in the chat saying there are tons of helpful docs. Yeah, to all of the participants currently here, please do make use of all links being dropped in the chat and of course to anybody watching the recording of this session all of these links will be shared in the description of the video as well. So yeah, lots of links being shared so please do feel free to browse through those. Tom, I've just noticed a question in the question panel which says how easy would it be to make these Vs events available? Sorry, that was just a replication from the previous chat.
00:17:54.390 - 00:18:35.550, Speaker A: But yeah, the types that for example with this dialogue system we could extend this like I mentioned, you could add more dialogue. It doesn't have to be a hologram. He could be like an NPC that walked around the map. You could talk to you can make him a quest giver make your own quest system or something if you wanted. You could hook it up to an inventory system or skills and stuff. You can kind of do almost everything you can do in uni within the visual scripting system and then bring that into a space in Mona and create some really cool interactive experiences. The concept of this is not like just take this it's to try and learn from these sort of things and then come up with your own ideas.
00:18:35.550 - 00:19:05.180, Speaker A: So hopefully we'll be spite to people to have a play around of it. My recommendation for anyone trying to learn this stuff is just play around of it. If you get stuck, there's lots and lots of tutorials and stuff online or you can ask a favorite AI chat bot, I'm sure he'll have an opinion. If no one has any more questions, we wrap up.
00:19:05.550 - 00:19:32.100, Speaker B: Tom, perhaps one more just in terms of the Bounties and people who are looking to build their projects. Obviously you shared that people can kind of use this and build whatever they like and yeah, just if you could confirm in terms of the Bounties and the hackathon, the types of projects people might want to build or whether you're happy to just see any kind of open ended things being built on the platform.
00:19:35.500 - 00:19:58.144, Speaker A: Yeah, I believe there is some specific bounties for certain types of things, I actually don't know what they are. I'm actually part of the development team. I'm here if you want more information on that. There's probably some links to what will appear in Chat or you can join the monoverse Discord or check out the Socials. I'm sure they'll have specific information on that. Yeah, there we go. Thank you very much.
00:19:58.262 - 00:20:10.900, Speaker B: So there's a link there to the website's. Apologies. And so just to clarify, the first poundee yes, Tom loading them up. Perfect. So if you scroll down you should see Mona.
00:20:15.020 - 00:20:50.756, Speaker A: There we go, here we go. So there's like some specific bounties best website or app that uses bonus business and avatars in interesting ways. We have this whole avatar system. We use the VRM avatar system which is this interoperable system that you can use on many platforms. You can definitely interact with avatars and visual scripting if you get a bit creative. If you have any questions regarding any of that stuff, definitely hop in the Mollibus Discord. And I'm always there to answer questions as well as lots of other people as well.
00:20:50.756 - 00:21:16.972, Speaker A: And then we have the best interactive components using visual scripting. This would be stuff like what we've built here. Some things that come to mind will be, I don't know, maybe you want to create a mini map for your space. Maybe you have a really big space, you keep getting lost, you have like a map or something. Maybe you want a jetpack, I don't know, maybe you really like football and you want to play some football or soccer for our American friends. Yeah.
00:21:17.026 - 00:21:53.560, Speaker B: Amazing. I think I'm really interested to see for this particular bounty what people come up with. It seems like people's imaginations could get carried away, but I'm sure, yeah, some really cool projects will be built. Unless there are any more questions for now, just while we wrap up. As I've mentioned, all of the links are being shared in the chat. You have the discord zone on the encode server where you can ask any questions to Lamona team. And as Tom mentioned as well, I believe there's amona Discord Channel as well.
00:21:53.560 - 00:22:32.992, Speaker B: So just whilst we see some background images of a really cool Rocket game. Yeah, I'd just love to thank the Mona team one last time, Tom, for a really cool session. Thank you very much for taking us through that and also to the rest of the team for sharing all of the docs and resources in the chat. So yeah, thank you very much to the team. Once again, thank you to all of our participants for attending all of the workshops. It's been really great to see you here and we do hope you have enjoyed them but also gained some insights to help you build your project. So we'll be in touch very shortly.
00:22:32.992 - 00:23:08.490, Speaker B: A message will go out tomorrow to next steps for you all, but if you do have any questions or problems with building your projects. You can reach out to me for general questions, and you can also reach out to all of our sponsors in the sponsor zones for any technical issues or problems that you're encountering. So, yeah, all do keep in touch. We're really excited to see what you all build. And for one final time, I'd just like to thank Tom and the team once again for a really incredible session. So thank you all very much, and we'll keep in touch and see you soon.
