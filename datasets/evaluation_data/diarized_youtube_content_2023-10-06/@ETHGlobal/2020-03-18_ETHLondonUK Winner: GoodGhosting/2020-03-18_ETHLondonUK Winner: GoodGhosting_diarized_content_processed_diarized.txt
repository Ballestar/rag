00:00:00.570 - 00:00:09.230, Speaker A: So good ghosting. Right. So, you know when you get ghosted by a girl from a dating app, she never shows up. Right. It sucks.
00:00:10.930 - 00:00:13.760, Speaker B: This is going to be an app that you're going to want to get ghosted on.
00:00:14.370 - 00:00:36.360, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's the origin of the name. So it's a savings game. So we're using Ave in the background. Users commit to deposit 990 die every week. Users who follow through for a year eventually get to withdraw all their money. And users who drop out lose all the interest.
00:00:36.360 - 00:01:07.746, Speaker A: They can still withdraw their principal, but they lose all the interest. So what happens is, users who stick to it get a higher Apr than they would if they just put the money in. Ave starts off like this and then over time, you see people start dropping out. They start ghosting you. Your friends aren't as loyal as you thought, but your Apr goes up, so you're happy. Right. So ghosting but made good.
00:01:07.746 - 00:01:54.530, Speaker A: So, yeah, this is what we built it's on coven at the moment. We can show you in a second, but one thing I did want to talk about is that we have a very good referral program. So if you have any friends who you think might ghost you, this is a very good way to find out if they're good friends. So invite them. You will get 10% of the interest that they should earn, and if they invite other friends, you also get 1% of that. So it's very good to invite friends and you'll find out if they're good friends or if they'll ghost you over time. We can also calculate some stats so you can check out how many players are in, who are the most infectious, players who have spread the love more.
00:01:54.530 - 00:02:11.000, Speaker A: And you can also see the prize it grows every day and how long it's going to take before the game ends. Yeah, we can show you our Quick demo. We call it quick. It's not actually Quick because it's web free stuff, so it's going to take a while.
00:02:16.170 - 00:02:23.770, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's only one button in this app and you need to press it once in a week or you will be hosted or you will become the host.
00:02:24.430 - 00:02:26.474, Speaker A: Yeah, we think this is the best.
00:02:26.512 - 00:02:32.220, Speaker C: UX one button, actually, metamax makes it like a five, but that's different.
00:02:36.610 - 00:02:46.754, Speaker A: Okay. And it's going through, we think, in the background, and over time, over time, covan it's taking its time.
00:02:46.952 - 00:02:57.490, Speaker B: Approve the contract to spend your die and then you can send the next confirmation. Then it will send the then it's sending the die.
00:02:58.170 - 00:03:16.710, Speaker A: Guys, let's clap for it. Come on, come on, give it, give it some cheer. Come on. Yay. Success. So we didn't ghost anyone this week, but maybe next week we'll drop out, who knows?
00:03:20.730 - 00:03:22.140, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah.
