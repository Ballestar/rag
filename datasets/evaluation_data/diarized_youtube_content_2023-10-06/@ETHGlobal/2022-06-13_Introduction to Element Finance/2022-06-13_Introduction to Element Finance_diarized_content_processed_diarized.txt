00:00:07.370 - 00:00:33.894, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. I'm Matthew Brown. I'm one of the founding engineers at Element Finance. And today I'll be going over the Ethnyc hackathon workshop that we're hosting. So let's get started. So today I'm basically just going to talk about a little bit of a history of Element Finance and how the protocol works. And then we'll jump right into the hackathon topics and we'll talk about the three things that we'd love to see people build.
00:00:33.894 - 00:01:16.326, Speaker A: So first, we have new yield sources. So currently we wrap yearn mostly, and we'd like to see some more protocols added to the Element Protocol to generate fixed yield sources. So secondly, we also have structured products. So again, we'd love to see people build on top of the Element Protocol and we can talk a little bit about what structured products means and give you an example. And lastly, we have the Elfie NFT project that we gifted to our community during our Dao launch. So we'd love to see people build on top of this. There's a lot of potential here to bridge the gap between the NFT and DFI worlds, so we'd love to see what the community can come up with here.
00:01:16.326 - 00:02:00.770, Speaker A: And we'll talk about some ideas there soon as well. This whole video should be about 1012 minutes long, so let's dive in. All right, so what is element finance? So, Element Finance formed a couple of years ago in 2020. We did a main net launch last year, and since then, we've updated our protocol to a V 1.1, added some upgrades, and we've also launched our Dow along with that NFT project that I mentioned earlier. So what does Element Finance do? So basically, we're a fixed rate yield source protocol, and we'll talk about how that works. But basically what we do is we wrap variable yield sources.
00:02:00.770 - 00:03:01.960, Speaker A: So these can be pools that you can find on urine curve many other places around the Ethereum ecosystem. And the way we do that is we implement a token splitting strategy to create the fixed yield. So how does the protocol work? So, if you know how traditional pools work, you basically start with any asset, say ethereum, and you can put that into some sort of pool that generates variable interest. In return, that pool will give you an LP token that generally represents your share of that pool. So as the assets accrue in the pool, when you redeem your LP token, you'll get more ethereum or whatever asset you put in out than what you started with. Element Finance works a bit differently, but sort of the same. We take that same pool and we wrap it.
00:03:01.960 - 00:04:06.300, Speaker A: Now, when you put your asset in, say, ethereum again, what you get out this time is not an LP token, but two tokens, a principal token and a yield token. So as you can probably guess, the principal token is just what you put in. One key difference, though, is that when you deposit through the element protocol the funds are locked for a period of time and this is sort of critical to creating the fixed yield. So when you put the tokens in at the time that you redeem them, the principal tokens are worth one to one whatever you deposit. So in the example here, if you start with one ETH at the time, you can redeem them when the term ends, the principal token can be redeemed for that one ETH that you put in. The yield tokens, on the other hand, are whatever interest is accrued from the underlying pool. So say a year goes by and that yearn pool had about a 20% interest over that year.
00:04:06.300 - 00:04:43.334, Speaker A: So the yield token will accrue that value over that one year and then at the end of the term can be redeemed for however much has been accrued. In this case it'd be about 0.2 e. So where does the fixed yield come from in all of this? So again, let's say we start with one ETH and we mint that one principal token and yield token. We have a one year term that had about a 20% variable rate. So again, at the end of the term, one principal token can be redeemed for one ETH and one yield token can be redeemed for about 0.2 e.
00:04:43.334 - 00:05:16.610, Speaker A: Let's say at the beginning of this term, the person who minted the principal token and the yield token doesn't really want to hold on to their principal they just care about the yield. And there are several reasons for this we can go into later. So they sell their one principal token at a discount for 0.9 east. And the reason they have to sell at a discount is because again, the funds are locked. So there's sort of an opportunity cost here. Nobody would buy it at exactly one e because they have to wait some time to be able to redeem it.
00:05:16.610 - 00:05:36.614, Speaker A: So they buy it at a discount and they hold on to it. So the seller of that principal token has now only invested 0.1 e. Remember, they bought the principal token for one ETH, they sold it for 0.9 ETH. So now they've only invested 0.1 ETH and they expect to make 0.2
00:05:36.614 - 00:06:16.070, Speaker A: ETH off the yield token. So this is one strategy in the protocol. You can basically gain some pretty good capital efficiency if you only care about that variable yield. You can sell your principal tokens at a discount and sort of leverage the yield tokens in this way. So the buyer of that principal token bought it at a discount for zero point 98. They know when the term matures they'll be able to redeem it for one E and that's what generates the fixed interest. So the buyer of the discounted principal token knows that the value is going to go from 0.9
00:06:16.070 - 00:06:59.506, Speaker A: when they bought it at the beginning of the term up to one E and an addition there of 0.1 e is about 10% fixed interest. So those are the basic token economics here. Basically, again, principal tokens are just worth one to one whatever money was put into the term when you try to redeem them. The yield tokens again are just whatever interest accrues. So at the beginning of the term, they haven't accrued any interest, so they have no value, but at the end they'll be able to be redeemed for whatever interest has accrued. And we also talked about how the protocol works.
00:06:59.506 - 00:07:40.330, Speaker A: Just basically a simple token splitting where we separate the principal from the yield. And that's basically element finance. All right, so now let's go ahead and talk about our hackathon topics. So like I said before, there are three that we'd like to see people get involved with. There's the new yield sources, structured products, and building on top of the NFT project. So to go into the first one, new yield sources, this one's the most straightforward. So we currently wrap urine vaults which have the variable yield sources that we do the token splitting on to create fixed yield sources in the Element protocol.
00:07:40.330 - 00:08:11.900, Speaker A: So a couple others that we're looking to add to the protocol are Ave and Mstable. So we have a lot of code that you can use as boilerplate and examples to figure out how to do this. We'll also set up a discord channel for you guys to reach out to us on. And so these are the two that we're looking at. Feel free to propose others. And this one's pretty straightforward. And again, we'll share out some resources for you guys to look at to get started on.
00:08:11.900 - 00:08:56.518, Speaker A: So the next one is structured products. So again, yeah, we would love to see some people build on top of the protocol. There's been some pretty cool work recently. Fiat Dao has recently integrated with the Element Protocol to use principal tokens as collateral. So an example of a structured product here is the principal token protected vault. So the basic idea behind this is that you can use principal tokens that have a guaranteed appreciation because whenever you buy them at a discount, you know, at the end of the term, you can redeem them one to one. So you can use that difference.
00:08:56.518 - 00:09:56.502, Speaker A: So let's say, you know, they're going to accrue 5% interest. You now have that 5% guaranteed to invest in some other really risky product. So if there's something out there that has potential to return really high yields, but it could potentially not yield anything, you could use the guaranteed interest in this principal token protected vault to invest in that risky product in a derisked way. So we think there's a lot of potential for this kind of thing and we'd really love to see somebody take a crack at it. There's also many other ideas. Feel free to reach out to us again on Discord or come up with your own idea for how to use principal tokens in DeFi. All right, lastly, we have our Elfiverse NFT project, so we'd really love to see people build on top of this, there's some really cool ideas that have been proposed.
00:09:56.502 - 00:10:39.794, Speaker A: So like I said right now, it was just a gift to the community during our Dao launch, and they're simple NFTs with no utility. But we would love to see somebody bridge the gap between DeFi and NFT. So there's a lot of really cool ideas here. So one thing that people could do is add attributes for different things within the governance protocol. So if somebody's voted on X number of proposals, they've created proposals. If they have so much voting power in the system, if they're a member of the GSC, you could have different attributes to kind of represent all of these things. You could also just have attributes for fun that aren't necessarily related to the governance protocol, and some of the attributes don't have to have any utility.
00:10:39.794 - 00:11:06.194, Speaker A: You could even just make a game to help the community engage with one another. So, yeah, again, there's a lot of potential here. We would love to see what the community comes up with to sort of bridge this gap. I think it'd be a lot of fun. So those are our three basic hackathon topics. Quick note on resources here. So all of our stuff is hosted on GitHub.com,
00:11:06.194 - 00:11:55.998, Speaker A: element phi, and there are some repos for the protocol here that are pretty useful if you're working on the core protocol. So if you're working on structured products or adding new yield sources, these first two repos will be pretty useful elf SDK and Elf contracts. The SDK has some methods on there to help you integrate with the contracts. The Elf contracts repo has the actual contracts themselves, with some example code and boilerplate in there for you if you're interested in working on the NFT project. The council repo has the governance protocol, those contracts, and the NFT contracts repo obviously has the contracts for the NFT project. Here's a link to our discord. We'll share that below the video as well.
00:11:55.998 - 00:12:19.894, Speaker A: So, again, feel free to reach out to us anytime if you have other ideas that you want to check with us or if you want to get help with your implementation. We'll be around. All right, so that sums it up. Those were our hackathon topics. A little bit about element finance. So that's all I have for you today. So happy hacking, and we can't wait to see what you guys come up with.
00:12:19.894 - 00:12:20.580, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
