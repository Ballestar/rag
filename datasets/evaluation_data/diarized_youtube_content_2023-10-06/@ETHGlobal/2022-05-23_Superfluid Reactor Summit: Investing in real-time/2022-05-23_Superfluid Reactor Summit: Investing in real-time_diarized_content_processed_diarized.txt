00:00:06.410 - 00:00:22.734, Speaker A: All right. With that, we are ready for our next talk. And that'll be Sonny from Ricochet Exchange talking about investing in real time. So I got a preview of what he's going to talk about, but without further ado, let's welcome Sonny and I'll let you take it from here.
00:00:22.852 - 00:00:23.520, Speaker B: Hi.
00:00:24.970 - 00:00:28.760, Speaker C: Thanks Kartik. Just going to pull up my screen really quick.
00:00:33.550 - 00:00:41.530, Speaker B: Awesome everyone, I'm Sonny, really excited to be talking to you guys about real time investing today. It's a concept I helped pioneer at Ricochet Exchange last year.
00:00:41.600 - 00:00:43.274, Speaker C: And today we're going to be basically.
00:00:43.312 - 00:00:49.054, Speaker B: Defining what real time investing is, go over why you want to invest in real time and the advantages of doing it.
00:00:49.092 - 00:00:51.658, Speaker C: And then lastly, break down some projects.
00:00:51.674 - 00:00:53.054, Speaker B: That are currently in the ecosystem, building.
00:00:53.092 - 00:00:55.890, Speaker C: On top of the concept of real time investing.
00:00:57.990 - 00:01:01.954, Speaker B: So first, what is real time investing? Let's put a definition to it.
00:01:01.992 - 00:01:04.402, Speaker C: So I define real time investing as.
00:01:04.456 - 00:01:21.446, Speaker B: Initiating a superfluid payment stream by the second on chain payment stream to a special superfluid enabled smart contract which we call Super Apps, which will take the money that you've streamed into the smart contract that being the super app and periodically invest it into the target investment asset of your choice.
00:01:21.558 - 00:01:25.526, Speaker C: So the only thing that you're really doing here to interact with this recurring.
00:01:25.558 - 00:02:01.254, Speaker B: Automated investment process is simply starting a superfluid stream. There is no need to repetitively do deposits or swaps. It's all abstracted into a single constant by the second superfluid stream. And so some examples of this would be streaming your money into a super app which will accumulate Ethereum for you, streaming your money into a super app which will invest into bitcoin for you. You can even get more advanced, such as streaming your money into a super app that will invest it into yield bearing tokens or even staked Sushi LP positions. So the possibilities with the real time.
00:02:01.292 - 00:02:05.878, Speaker C: Investing are limitless and it's really kind.
00:02:05.884 - 00:02:42.974, Speaker B: Of a paradigm shift when it comes to investing, which we've traditionally experienced in kind of discrete swaps, transfers and deposits. So let's talk about now why you'd want to invest in real time. Let's point out the real advantages of real time investing. So the way we traditionally experience DeFi investments and those kinds of DeFi investment vehicles is through discrete transfers. And so with real time investing, you're taking away these kinds of discrete transfers and these swaps and you're replacing them with continuous payment streams.
00:02:43.102 - 00:02:45.486, Speaker C: When you think of investing or staking.
00:02:45.518 - 00:02:51.366, Speaker B: Your money in Aave, you traditionally take X amount, you go to Aave and you deposit it. Or if you want to swap X.
00:02:51.388 - 00:02:54.966, Speaker C: Amount from USDC into Ethereum, you go.
00:02:54.988 - 00:03:14.890, Speaker B: To Sushi Swap, you go to an AMM and you make that happen with a single transaction, right? And if you want to invest recurring in a recurring basis, you'd have to basically go and you'd have to do these on your own. You'd have to go every so often and make these swaps, make these deposits and that's kind of cumbersome and it requires transactional upkeep.
00:03:15.310 - 00:03:18.718, Speaker C: With superfluid streams we're able to and.
00:03:18.724 - 00:03:37.026, Speaker B: The composable nature of them. You're able to essentially hook up these payment streams into these DeFi protocols and these DeFi investment vehicles through super apps and you're able to basically abstract away those discrete transfers and deposits into continuous payment streams and basically make investing in.
00:03:37.048 - 00:03:41.426, Speaker C: These kinds of opportunities hands off and effortless.
00:03:41.618 - 00:03:52.874, Speaker B: The second part here is the fact that real time investing is responsible. It's a responsible way to invest. Some of us are familiar with the concept of dollar cost averaging. Dollar cost averaging is the idea of.
00:03:52.912 - 00:03:56.602, Speaker C: Doing fixed investments on fixed intervals into.
00:03:56.656 - 00:04:05.006, Speaker B: An asset of your choice, right? So example here would be investing $5 into Bitcoin every single day. So the power here is that you.
00:04:05.028 - 00:04:09.390, Speaker C: Are investing in basically every single price.
00:04:09.460 - 00:04:30.390, Speaker B: Instead of picking and choosing different prices and trying to time the markets. And so as a result, you're diversifying away price risk, which is very powerful, especially in the kinds of markets that we're seeing today. You may believe heavily in ethereum and the future price appreciation of it, but if you had bought in a lump earlier this year you would be like well in the red.
00:04:30.460 - 00:04:33.058, Speaker C: And so with real time investing you're.
00:04:33.074 - 00:04:50.902, Speaker B: Able to linearly accumulate these kinds of investment assets and basically remove price exposure as a one time lump thing and make it kind of a gradual linear exposure which is a more sensible and responsible way to invest. The third aspect here is the networking of cash flows.
00:04:50.966 - 00:04:53.398, Speaker C: So the idea here is that if.
00:04:53.424 - 00:05:01.130, Speaker B: We have an ecosystem of money moving in real time, you can network cash flows from inbound streams into investment streams.
00:05:01.210 - 00:05:02.446, Speaker C: And so this is so critical to.
00:05:02.468 - 00:05:12.882, Speaker B: The superfood ecosystem that I've basically dedicated a slide to it. So the quote here is if money can move in real time, it should be able to be put to work in real time.
00:05:13.016 - 00:05:14.386, Speaker C: And so the idea here is if.
00:05:14.408 - 00:05:32.698, Speaker B: We'Re having an economy where we're constantly paying for things in streams and we're receiving our income in streams and we're having this money move around by the second, we have to wait for that money to accumulate and then kind of do our swaps and investments in these kind of discrete one off transfers. The user experience hasn't been improved that much.
00:05:32.864 - 00:05:34.634, Speaker C: And so the idea here is to.
00:05:34.752 - 00:05:41.062, Speaker B: Basically connect these kinds of real time cash flows that are moving around in this digital economy to investment cash flows.
00:05:41.126 - 00:05:43.294, Speaker C: Such that the second that this money.
00:05:43.332 - 00:05:52.366, Speaker B: Hits our wallet, we can put it to work with these investment cash flows. So by creating an ecosystem of real time investing apps and giving people the.
00:05:52.388 - 00:05:56.126, Speaker C: Opportunities to invest in these traditional D.
00:05:56.148 - 00:06:48.238, Speaker B: Five vehicles with real time cash flows, you're able to basically provide more utility for these people that are having real time finance. And you're also able to reduce the kind of transactional upkeep that these people would traditionally experience without these real time investing applications. So overall, it really adds more utility to people using streams. It gives you another reason to transact in streams and kind of is an incentive to enter the real time finance economy. And yeah, as the ecosystem grows, I'm sure that the use of these real time investing apps will grow as well. So that's the idea here. Kind of like if you're receiving say, 10,000 USDC per month in a salary stream, like buy the second superfluid salary stream.
00:06:48.238 - 00:06:50.046, Speaker B: An example of using network cash flow.
00:06:50.078 - 00:06:53.826, Speaker C: Will be carving off a stream of.
00:06:53.848 - 00:06:56.486, Speaker B: Like 3000 USDC per month into a.
00:06:56.508 - 00:06:59.426, Speaker C: Real time investing app, which will convert.
00:06:59.458 - 00:07:04.114, Speaker B: It into Ethereum or something for you basically kind of cash flow in investment.
00:07:04.162 - 00:07:05.160, Speaker C: Stream out.
00:07:07.370 - 00:07:12.570, Speaker B: In an adjacent stream. So that's the idea of network cash flows.
00:07:13.950 - 00:07:19.670, Speaker C: All right, so I want to talk about two basic entities that could use real time investing.
00:07:19.750 - 00:07:39.518, Speaker B: Kind of dumbed it down into individuals and Dows or organizations. So when we think about individuals and their use of real time investing, well, traditionally when we invest, we think about that in a monthly amount, right? We say, okay, I'm going to invest $500 into my Roth IRA each month. I'm going to invest a few hundred dollars into Ethereum.
00:07:39.694 - 00:07:41.346, Speaker C: And this usually requires us to make.
00:07:41.368 - 00:07:45.826, Speaker B: Those manual deposits on our own. We have to go into our accounts, we have to do those transfers and.
00:07:45.848 - 00:07:51.782, Speaker C: We have to make that in a manual fashion. And so with real time investing, you can automate that.
00:07:51.836 - 00:08:24.354, Speaker B: You can basically create a customized automated investment plan by choosing different real time finance, real time investing apps, and which kinds of investments you want to invest into, and customize which rates you want, the rate at which you want to purchase these assets and essentially create like a streaming portfolio. You can basically say, okay, I want 100 USDC of each month, I want 100 USCC of the D Five Pulse index each month. These kinds of different assets, you can basically customize them into a real time streaming portfolio and make that process very.
00:08:24.392 - 00:08:28.030, Speaker C: Easy and hands off and basically initiate.
00:08:28.030 - 00:08:31.650, Speaker B: It with single start stream transactions. So it's very simple.
00:08:31.800 - 00:08:34.626, Speaker C: And so it's really awesome the way.
00:08:34.648 - 00:08:40.774, Speaker B: That we're able to abstract this away into a single start stream. It's amazing. User experience and traditionally accomplishing this is.
00:08:40.812 - 00:08:42.930, Speaker C: Very kind of difficult and technical.
00:08:43.010 - 00:09:17.038, Speaker B: Some people, they make these kind of investment scripts that connect to their wallet and kind of do it in that kind of fashion. Some people, they try to go through centralized exchanges and facing very heavy exchange fees. This is a very kind of nice, lightweight, simple way to accomplish it through superfluid with real time investing. The other entity here are dows or organizations or businesses a lot of these Dows, they sit on a lot of idle capital on chain and they have a low risk tolerance in putting that capital to work.
00:09:17.124 - 00:09:18.254, Speaker C: And so a lot of the conversation.
00:09:18.302 - 00:09:35.000, Speaker B: Around putting it to work usually comes down to the strategy of dollar cost averaging, like I spoke on. And this is really like the primary way that these Dows put their capital to work in that kind of responsible fashion. These Dows, they don't want to be in the business of having active trading groups and things like that.
00:09:35.610 - 00:09:38.406, Speaker C: They simply want to find the most.
00:09:38.428 - 00:09:49.046, Speaker B: Simple way to gain exposure to the assets that they trust in. And real time investing is the best way to do that. You simply start a stream and there's no need for that kind of transactional upkeep, which can be difficult with Dows.
00:09:49.078 - 00:09:50.838, Speaker C: Because you have these multi sigs.
00:09:50.854 - 00:09:53.290, Speaker B: You have levels of permission with these treasuries.
00:09:53.370 - 00:09:56.618, Speaker C: And having to work with those kinds.
00:09:56.634 - 00:10:17.906, Speaker B: Of recurring investments can become difficult when you can turn it into single streams and superfluid automation, it becomes a lot easier for these Dows and reduces that kind of red tape. The other kind of red tape that real time investing reduces for Dows is decision making. So with real time investing, DApps an.
00:10:17.928 - 00:10:20.034, Speaker C: Example here will be like a Dow.
00:10:20.162 - 00:10:56.500, Speaker B: They can trigger an on chain start stream transaction that will invest, say, 10% worth of its treasury into an asset over the course of the year with a single vote. So that really kind of paints the picture of how these Dows can basically turn their investment strategies into very kind of simple decisions because it's all kind of coming down. It's kind of all abstracted into an easy StarStream transaction. So does help Dows in those kinds of that kind of sense as well. So that's the idea on who these real time investing kind of painting the picture there.
00:10:57.590 - 00:11:04.798, Speaker C: Let's kind of flip the page and talk about the kinds of projects that are in the ecosystem building these kinds.
00:11:04.814 - 00:11:32.974, Speaker B: Of real time investing solutions. So the first I want to talk about is Butter. Butter was a hackathon project from, I believe, ETH Amsterdam. They help Dows essentially diversify away from their governance tokens over time using superfluid streams by streaming those governance tokens into balancer v two pools. And so the reason this is powerful is because Dows oftentimes they have a lot of financial exposure to their own governance token, right? I believe the Masari report reported that.
00:11:33.172 - 00:11:39.306, Speaker C: Most Dows have like over 90% of their value locked 90% of their treasury.
00:11:39.338 - 00:12:10.214, Speaker B: Value locked within these governance tokens. And so Butter allows these Dows to gradually over time, reduce their exposure to these governance tokens into more solid assets such as stablecoins or blue chip tokens, such as ethereum or wrapped bitcoin. And so that's what Butter is accomplishing. Hope to see that project take flight soon. Another project we have in the ecosystem is the Damp protocol. Stands for Decentralized Asset Management protocol. We refer to them as Damp.
00:12:10.214 - 00:12:23.706, Speaker B: They are working on a project called DSIP, which essentially allows you to dollar cost average into managed portfolio positions on Dhedge using superfluid streams. And so essentially, you're automating these streams.
00:12:23.738 - 00:12:27.054, Speaker C: Which will stream money into these different.
00:12:27.092 - 00:13:07.126, Speaker B: Portfolio managers on Dhedge that run these kinds of different investment portfolios based on their own kind of strategies. It's quite advantageous for investors that are looking for this kind of manage exposure in a responsible fashion. And last but not least, we have Ricochet Exchange. Ricochet Exchange is the real time investing OG. I helped Co found it last year. Ricochet Exchange allows you to basically dollar cost average into investment assets into various tokens of your choice. Ricochet Exchange was the very first community deployment of a super app on Polygon.
00:13:07.126 - 00:13:16.142, Speaker B: So they're kind of the real OGS when it comes to not just real time investing, but also development on superfluid in general.
00:13:16.196 - 00:13:19.662, Speaker C: And so they're so important that I.
00:13:19.796 - 00:13:33.026, Speaker B: Dedicated a slide to their flagship product, the Rex Market. The Rex market lets you essentially dollar cost average with superfluid screens. I want to kind of break down the kind of architecture of the Rex Market super app.
00:13:33.128 - 00:13:35.506, Speaker C: So the Rex Market Super app here.
00:13:35.528 - 00:14:10.320, Speaker B: Is represented by the Ricochet logo in that black box there. Essentially what we have here are users, investors, they stream in their dix into the Ricochet Super app. That Ricochet Super app every 30 minutes has a keeper trigger the distribute function. The distribute function takes the dix that is accumulated in that Rex market super app turns around to SushiSwap or an AMM, swaps it to the target asset that in this case being ethereum, and then distributes that ethereum back to investors all in one shot using Superfluid's Instant Distribution Agreement. And so.
00:14:12.210 - 00:14:13.838, Speaker C: This is an amazing user experience.
00:14:13.924 - 00:14:19.374, Speaker B: They're just streaming in money and they're dollar cost averaging. And it's also very scalable.
00:14:19.422 - 00:14:23.566, Speaker C: Because believe it or not, this Rex.
00:14:23.598 - 00:14:54.558, Speaker B: Market can have like a million different users and it will still have the same fixed gas cost when it comes to distributing that target asset ethereum back. To the investors because it uses something called the Instant Distribution Agreement by Superfluid, which basically assigns distribution shares to the different streamers based on the size of their streams. And so there's no need to do kind of individual transfers up and down the list of people who are investing through the Rex market. So it's a very kind of interesting scalable structure to do this kind of.
00:14:54.564 - 00:14:58.682, Speaker C: Real time investing and it's super powerful.
00:14:58.746 - 00:15:15.060, Speaker B: And it's honestly the very best way to do on chain DCA. I've done my homework, I've looked at all the models and this is the most scalable framework to make it happen. So it's a great app and it's made possible by superfluid. I also want to touch on the fact that using the Rex Market is noncustodial so.
00:15:17.030 - 00:15:21.126, Speaker C: When you invest, when these.
00:15:21.148 - 00:15:22.678, Speaker B: People are streaming their money into the.
00:15:22.684 - 00:15:25.414, Speaker C: Rex market contract, at any one time.
00:15:25.452 - 00:15:47.838, Speaker B: The Rex Market contract only holds 30 minutes worth of the total value streaming into it. And so as a result, there's very little TBL in these Rex market contracts. And so there's little smart contract risk. And also that ethereum is distributed straight back to investors. So these investors, they don't have to go to the Rex market contract and claim the money on their own. It just shows up straight into the wallet. And so they can start using it.
00:15:47.924 - 00:15:50.110, Speaker C: In their day to day and take.
00:15:50.180 - 00:15:56.462, Speaker B: Action with it and take advantage of other DeFi opportunities as they see fit, as the money is straight in their wallet.
00:15:56.526 - 00:15:59.966, Speaker C: So, yeah, that's the deal here with Rex Markets.
00:16:00.158 - 00:16:03.490, Speaker B: The best model for on chain dollar cost averaging.
00:16:04.150 - 00:16:05.426, Speaker C: So, yeah, I want to end the.
00:16:05.448 - 00:16:07.490, Speaker B: Presentation with a call to action.
00:16:07.910 - 00:16:09.614, Speaker C: Real time investing is growing.
00:16:09.662 - 00:16:41.198, Speaker B: It's going to grow with the superfluid ecosystem. And so I highly recommend that you join the community, join the real time finance and real time investing conversation by hopping in the superfluid discord up in the Ricochet Discord. You'll find the links there at Ricochet Exchange. Go build something. There are so many things that have not been built yet with real time investing. We still need an app that lets you stream your money into stake, ave a Tokens. There's just so many different ideas out there and our devex team is ready to help you get off the ground with them if you want to kind of pick them up.
00:16:41.198 - 00:17:01.618, Speaker B: And we'd love to help and basically help developers bring these kinds of real time investing apps to production. And the lastly, use Ricochet Exchange, try out their app. It's live at app ricochet Exchange. You can try today and it'll really give you a taste for what's possible with real time investing.
00:17:01.714 - 00:17:03.106, Speaker C: And yeah, I hope you guys embark.
00:17:03.138 - 00:17:04.930, Speaker B: On that real time investment adventure.
00:17:05.090 - 00:17:06.102, Speaker C: That is my talk.
00:17:06.156 - 00:17:16.470, Speaker B: I want to thank you all for your time and attention. Go follow me at Sonnyjaser on Twitter and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the Superfluid reactor summit.
00:17:16.630 - 00:17:18.426, Speaker C: Thank you. Amazing.
00:17:18.528 - 00:17:48.406, Speaker A: Thank you so much for that, Sonny. It's been an amazing presentation. We're getting in a couple of questions from the audience. I'll start asking them and in the meantime, if anybody on the audience have more questions, just type them up in the chat and we'll relay them here. So the first question is, I think we'd love to get a bit more understanding of how are people able to get the Etax Token from providing Dai. So I guess what's happening behind the scenes and if you can sort of COVID that flow, I'll start with that.
00:17:48.428 - 00:17:54.182, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So essentially what's happening is the Ethex is being streamed into the Rex Market.
00:17:54.236 - 00:17:57.510, Speaker C: Contract is accumulating there, the distribute takes.
00:17:57.580 - 00:18:11.878, Speaker B: All this, it basically sweeps all the dix that's landed in the contract. It takes it to an AMM, converts it into ETH, so basically, like, basically regular Ethereum, then wraps it into ethics, that being the super token version of.
00:18:11.904 - 00:18:14.286, Speaker C: Ethereum that's able to be distributed with.
00:18:14.308 - 00:18:36.046, Speaker B: The Instant Distribution Agreement. Then it is sent out to investors all at once using the Instant Distribution Agreement. And the reason that's possible, accounting wise, is because the Rex Market Super app, it assigns distribution agreements sorry, distribution units to investors proportional to the size of their stream.
00:18:36.078 - 00:18:36.226, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:36.248 - 00:18:43.046, Speaker B: So if you're streaming in 200 die and I'm streaming in 100 die per month, you're going to receive twice as much of the Ethereum as I do.
00:18:43.068 - 00:18:45.126, Speaker C: And so based on that accounting, the.
00:18:45.148 - 00:18:47.062, Speaker B: Rex Market Super App is able to.
00:18:47.196 - 00:18:51.286, Speaker C: Distribute out the ethics in the commested.
00:18:51.318 - 00:18:58.666, Speaker B: Amounts based on this kind of proportion accounted for in the Instant Distribution Agreement. So, really cool stuff there.
00:18:58.768 - 00:18:59.978, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
00:19:00.064 - 00:19:27.830, Speaker A: Hopefully that also makes sense with the person who has the question. And there's another question that came in, but I think it's more directed towards Superflow at the protocol. So I'll still ask it to you because I think you can still answer it, but if we need more clarification, we'll have somebody from the Superflow team directly answer on the chat. So the question is just overall, I guess, how dynamic actually, let me say that directly, can we control the stream using an external dynamic value in terms of what the amount is that gets distributed?
00:19:28.730 - 00:19:31.238, Speaker B: Control the stream based on the what? Dynamic value?
00:19:31.324 - 00:19:33.800, Speaker A: Just any externally defined dynamic value.
00:19:34.890 - 00:19:35.542, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:35.676 - 00:19:39.914, Speaker B: So Superfluid now has a thing called ACL. So this is called access control list.
00:19:39.952 - 00:19:43.818, Speaker C: And so basically, with this kind of.
00:19:43.824 - 00:20:01.582, Speaker B: Functionality, you're able to give a super app the ability to control your stream and change the stream rate on your behalf. And so you could have a Keeper or an Oracle or something connected to that super app, and then the super app could respond to the changes in the Oracle based on whatever kind of.
00:20:01.636 - 00:20:03.582, Speaker C: Indicator or KPI it is and then.
00:20:03.636 - 00:20:10.146, Speaker B: Adjust your stream rate accordingly. And so using that, you can accomplish something like a stream investing tool that.
00:20:10.168 - 00:20:12.366, Speaker C: Will only invest between a price range.
00:20:12.398 - 00:20:13.202, Speaker B: Or something like that.
00:20:13.256 - 00:20:15.842, Speaker C: So, definitely possible. Awesome.
00:20:15.976 - 00:20:28.950, Speaker A: Well, that's a lot more kind of power on the programmability of the streaming payment. So hopefully, Filipe, that answered your question. And with that, I want to thank you for taking the time today and really appreciate this. Karda.
