00:00:00.170 - 00:00:45.594, Speaker A: It's more of a brainstorming session. This is an opportunity for everybody to just talk with other hackers, talk about your idea for a couple of minutes, and then see if there's any feedback. Sometimes there's great feedback. Sometimes people need to think about it for a little bit. So this is the start of conversations. Like, if something comes to you after this event is over, reach out to that hacker in a this is a good opportunity to talk in real time about your projects, but this should be an ongoing conversation, especially for the first week, as ideas and teams are forming and changing. Again.
00:00:45.594 - 00:01:12.500, Speaker A: If you just joined. I'm Andrew from ETH Global. We also have Luke from ETH Global, and Shangan is here also. Again, this is meant to be an open forum, so there's a sign up sheet. I'm going to open up right now and see who is the first team, if anyone has signed in. Look at that. We don't have any projects that have yet signed in.
00:01:12.500 - 00:01:26.754, Speaker A: Does anybody want to talk about this whole event is predicated upon no formal there's no formal agenda other than people just talking about ideas.
00:01:26.802 - 00:01:27.910, Speaker B: Brainstorming.
00:01:33.950 - 00:01:37.846, Speaker A: Just enter in the sign up sheet.
00:01:37.958 - 00:01:40.686, Speaker B: Oh, I know. Let's see if enough people have it.

00:01:41.988 - 00:01:43.582, Speaker A: We shared it in the waiting room.
00:01:43.636 - 00:01:48.110, Speaker B: But we didn't necessarily share it standby.
00:01:51.970 - 00:01:57.810, Speaker A: I stupidly shared it just for the waiting room. Here we go. I'm putting it in the chat.
00:01:59.350 - 00:02:06.040, Speaker B: That's the sign up sheet in the chat. Feel free for our first team.
00:02:09.450 - 00:02:23.766, Speaker A: Some other resources for coming up with ideas for hacks is we put it and you should have this in your hacker dashboard. The sheet should be the brainstorm session.
00:02:23.798 - 00:02:36.350, Speaker B: One, which I think I just shared. I will share it again, because as people join.
00:02:41.250 - 00:02:48.900, Speaker C: Andrew, they're wondering which feedback sheet we should be entering. Feedback one, two, or oh, I see.
00:02:50.870 - 00:02:52.180, Speaker A: Feedback three.
00:02:52.630 - 00:02:54.900, Speaker B: I didn't even realize there were the other ones.
00:02:55.290 - 00:02:57.080, Speaker C: I'm going to close those out.
00:02:59.210 - 00:02:59.862, Speaker B: Okay.

00:03:22.830 - 00:03:23.820, Speaker C: Hold on.
00:03:28.530 - 00:03:30.734, Speaker A: Like is proof of attendance here?

00:03:54.940 - 00:03:56.216, Speaker D: I am here.
00:03:56.398 - 00:04:01.796, Speaker A: All right, talk about your idea. See if we can get any feedback.
00:04:01.908 - 00:05:14.700, Speaker D: Sure. So, hello, everyone. My name is Cash. I'm a self taught software developer for about ten years now, and I don't have a clear idea yet, but I'm looking at how we might use a network of custom dows to facilitate capital flow into early stage ventures. So I noticed that there were a lot of DAOs that showed up last year, like the Moloch Dao or the MetaCartel Ventures Dao, which were intended to be more VC type Dows for angel and Seed funding. I'm wondering whether there might be a possibility to build a unique capital product using DeFi Lego bricks to encourage money from the Crypto Sphere impact the rest of the world outside of the Crypto Sphere. Let's say the thing that I'm very curious.
