00:00:12.040 - 00:00:48.264, Speaker A: Hi everybody. So sorry about that delay. We were having a little bit of some technical issues but we're here now, everything's worked out and yeah, thank you so much for your patience. This is the deploy going on Scale for Gasless and Faster Transactions workshop. Here we have Dima from Scale who's going to be leading this workshop. And if you guys have any questions throughout the meeting, feel free to pop them in the chat and he'll get to them as soon as possible. Thank you again.
00:00:48.264 - 00:00:50.730, Speaker A: And Dima, whenever you're ready.
00:00:52.080 - 00:01:00.430, Speaker B: Yeah, tell me guys. Hello guys. Do you see my screen? If yes, then thumbs up.
00:01:02.880 - 00:01:04.770, Speaker C: Hey Dima. Yeah, we see your screen.
00:01:05.380 - 00:01:20.310, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, great. So sorry for delay. My name is Dima. Here is Celine. We are from Scale and we are welcoming you on our Scale workshop. So let's begin.
00:01:20.310 - 00:02:35.576, Speaker B: Sorry. So we welcome you on our workshop and Scale. What is scale? Scale is an ethereum native multi blockchain network that is fully compatible with whole tools that are working with Azilium, like Webster, like Remix, like other stuff, truffle, Open, Zeppelin and et cetera. So what are the main features of the scale? It's fast EVM, execution, it's contract deployment. Fast contract deployment transaction is like working very fast. It is decentralized file storage that allows you to store your file right on the blockchain. It is interchange transfer that allow you to swap tokens between chain and the main net between chains and what we are providing to you on this hackathon.
00:02:35.576 - 00:02:56.768, Speaker B: So every team that's building on Scale is claiming to get some scales back. And for this you just need to sign up the form on our site. Salim can send it to Zoom.
00:02:56.864 - 00:02:58.740, Speaker C: I'm going to send it to the chat.
00:02:59.400 - 00:03:37.356, Speaker B: Yeah. So you just need to sign up and you will get some skills work. It's really cool. Some t shirts or other stuff. You will like it. And especially what is useful for the app developers, you can get a mentor that will help you with your project, with integrating, with integrating scale into your project. And the main thing that is maybe most of you wanted to hear is scale prices.
00:03:37.356 - 00:05:06.380, Speaker B: It's $12,000 in scale and it will be splitted between teams and how it will be splited, I will tell in the ending of the meeting. So keep watching and you will know everything about scale and about scale prices. Let's go next and let's talk about scale and how you can use it and how you will set up and work with it. And some cool features that scale allows to you to work with to begin with. Let's start from the scale setup and run because the guys that are connected to this meeting, I hope, I really hope that we'll use it and we'll get some prizes and some t shirts. Yeah, so to get some t shirts, you firstly should get this SDK software development kit for working with scale. So to get access to your scale SDK here and get some t shirts, you should go to this link and sign up and get your own EMA SDK.
00:05:06.380 - 00:06:16.610, Speaker B: And when you get it then you will ask yourself how we can use it. And the usage is pretty simple, let's go to the site and get the information. So every information about setup, about running, about examples and other stuff can be found on this website imasdk. So let's get started with me, with myself, I already cloned the repo and do this stuff from the list of the installation script. But it's not so complicated. Firstly you should git clone the repo to your laptop then you should create n file. Let's check how it looks like.
00:06:16.610 - 00:07:38.008, Speaker B: So here it is. You just need to set two keys. Two keys from easy key, private key and test private key and this address, these addresses, that is for these keys. So that's everything that you need to add to the env file to run our SDK. The next step is to run the command run SDK and it takes some extra minutes. So I just run it a few minutes ago and it will download all useful stuff for your work and deploy the useful contracts for IMA for interacting with interchange messaging agent. Yeah, so right now I've already run EMA SDK on my laptop and you can check whether it works just to type in docker PS.
00:07:38.008 - 00:09:06.680, Speaker B: So if it works, you will see the three docker containers like IMA, the cable itself, truffle ganache, that is like the main net and you will interact with a main net on the real chain, on the pro chain. But for SDK we are using like Ganache. And there is another container in next that I will talk you a little bit later about some cool stuff with this container. But for now it allows you to get access to the s chain right by in such useful way. You just need to connect to localhost s chain and then you will get access to the s chain. For example, I'm using get attach attach and it works. So that's how it setting up, it's how it installed on your laptop and then we can check, we can connect MetaMask to it to go with your assets.
00:09:06.680 - 00:10:33.264, Speaker B: Right now I have created some pails that I have passed to the env file. You can these two key pails are already in my MetaMask account. It's like the workshop s chain and workshop three, don't ask me why, because workshop three so the workshop s chain is account that is owner of the chain like the blockchain and if you wanted to deploy something you will use this account. So right now let's check transactions, let's check deployment contracts. And to begin with, let's send some ETH from one account to another account. Just through MetaMask, it's already connected to the network. To connect from MetaMask, you just need to go to Settings network and put these credentials into the new network.
00:10:33.264 - 00:11:40.440, Speaker B: So workshop in my SDK RPC, like I showed it to you before and chain ID is static like 74565 and after this you will connect to the MetaMask to the MetaMask to the IMA SDK. So we already connected and let's transfer some tokens from one account to another account. Okay, I'm so rich. Let's send some extra money. Yeah. So now I'm sending into inside this blockchain we have two accounts and transferring some ath from one account to another account. Here it is.
00:11:40.440 - 00:12:37.340, Speaker B: So the transaction is already confirmed and that's it. You have the confirmed transaction just in a few seconds. Let's go further and let's go to the contract deployment. So I'm using for my internal development, I'm using Ram, you could use Truffle or Web Three JS as you wish. Every stuff that is working with Ethereum will also work with S chain because S chain is fully Ethereum compatible. But let's take Remix and try to deploy some contracts on the S chain. To work with Remix, you just need to take your MetaMask inside to it inject it Web Three and let's deploy something from the Remix.
00:12:37.340 - 00:13:31.704, Speaker B: Okay, let's choose some test contour compile and let's deploy it. Yes, so we are deploying it to scales from MetaMask. Yes. So the contract is deployed it's so fast as you can see. Also let's call some transaction on this contract and check whether it will be so fast as contract deployment. MetaMask confirm and here you are. The transaction is mined and confirmed.
00:13:31.704 - 00:14:37.200, Speaker B: So let's take a look. Yeah, it's the number that we sent to store. So as you can see, the deployment of the contract, the transactions, the sending of ETH interaction with contract going in very fast way. So you can set up the SDK and try it by yourself. But scale S chains is not scale also have some really interesting stuff. Let's go further to the next and the next point is Interchange Transfer. So for Interchange Transfer is we are calling him IMA interchange Messaging Agent that is bridge between the main net chain and other chains.
00:14:37.200 - 00:16:21.348, Speaker B: So you can use this IMA just by the link to start developing from this chain messaging agent. If you wanted to send some tokens or something else, you just need to use this IMA GS Lib. It's very useful, it's very easy to understand and it's really fast. So for intention chain Messaging agent, we could swap, we could send the tokens here c 21 ERC 1155 so you can send them all. Yeah. So let's take a look onto the IMA JS library. You can find the documentation on our Docs portal and everything that you needed is already here about documentation, about how to install it into your project, how to connect to chains, how to work with it from JavaScript, code from Node JS and also we have some code Snippets that I will show to you.
00:16:21.348 - 00:18:07.990, Speaker B: So we have some code snippets on our docs portal. You can take one of them and check how it works. I have taken one, it is JavaScript that is used library and let's take a look how it works. So this script is sending ath from the main net to the S chain and then after this we will send from the S chain to the main net again. So as you can see, firstly we are like moving our balance on this chain from zero to ethereum zero point and after this we send this ethereum back to the main net. So you can use it on the main when you go to the m two s transfer, you are transferring it to the S chain and you can use it inside the S chain like working with it like the common token and so on and so on. The same way is working for Air C 20, AIRC 721 token and AIRC 1155.
00:18:07.990 - 00:19:19.288, Speaker B: So you can use it, you can check it and it's fully on the blockchain and is fully secure. Let's go next. And what we have next it is decentralized file storage. So it's our feature that allows you to store file right on the blockchain. And we also provide the interface to get the files from the blockchain storage right by the common URL. So the old docs for file storage you can find on our website like this. This is the full overview of File storage but when you will developing stuff you definitely will use File Storage JS Leap.
00:19:19.288 - 00:20:53.470, Speaker B: It is NPM package that is using to interacting with the file storage through JavaScript interface. And here is the whole stuff, the whole documentation about it. You just need to import it inside your project and upload some files, download some files you can do everything you want like the common file system you can create files, delete files, create directories, delete directories, you can get information, meta information about files and so on and so on. So let's take a look on the file storage. So I run UI for file storage it uses the File storage JS library and you can scale network organization repository, scale demo file storage if you wish you can ask me, I will send the link also. So I already run it onto my laptop and let's choose a file that we will upload. Okay, so the app pull loading is.
00:21:09.620 - 00:21:14.316, Speaker C: When you have a second, can you explain the difference between main chain and the S chain?
00:21:14.348 - 00:22:32.552, Speaker B: The scale chain while file is uploading to the file search and it's already on the file search. So what about main chain and our blockchains? So our chains as I said previously, we are like multiple blockchains, we are MultiChain solution. We have a lot of S chains. Each of the chains contains 16 nodes and each of them are connecting to each other and we are using like consensus algorithms distributed key generation and the BLS signature to protect everything, to sign the messages, to sign the transactions and check the validity of the system. And because of this, now we have very fast transactions. As you see, transactions deployment contracts are working in a few seconds. That's because of our protection, our security and our infrastructure, our architecture.
00:22:32.552 - 00:23:27.144, Speaker B: So there are a lot of such chains on the scale network. You will use your own chain that you will spin up on your laptop. But the realist chains, we already have chains on the main net contains 60 nodes and it's already working. So let's go back to the file storage. Now we are uploading it into this S chain and you can delete it. But let's take a look what the file is and how can we get it. Yeah, I just call it like the simple website just from the URL and get the file.
00:23:27.144 - 00:24:34.240, Speaker B: So to get the file from the file storage, you can just pass the simple link into your browser or you can interact with this URL inside your application and so on and so on. But the main thing that you can easily get access and unlike the simple file on the centralized network, but this file is on the S chain on the decentralized network. So it's like the blogger so huge. Okay, so you can also delete it. Let's delete it. And now you cannot get access to this file because it is deleted. All right, so let's go further and all stuff as I said, you can found on our docs portal, our doc scale, file storage and file storage JS docs portal.
00:24:34.240 - 00:25:48.212, Speaker B: Okay. And as I see, there are a lot of people on this zoom configuration. You can get some mentors for your project when you will sign up our form that will help you to interact with scale to spin up. If you will have some strange things, you will have some problems, you can ask them or you can ask our support team in the scale sponsored chat on the discord. Also you can just type the scale chat and you will be redirected to our discord channel where we can help you and we will give you support. And let's get to the most interested part for you it's scale prices and how it will be for ath global. So we are providing some prices.
00:25:48.212 - 00:27:01.810, Speaker B: The main price costs $3,000 of scale and the others once it's kilimanjaro price, the price number three and it will be cost for you, it will give you $2,000 of scale. Also we have a special NFT price for the project that will be implemented. Our scale solution is NFT. I will make you some tip, you can use the file storage and save the NFT inside file storage and get this file storage link to get the link to the NFT. Yeah, you are welcome and you will get the price. You will get $2,500 scale if you will do this. And there is one extra price for integration our scale inside your project.
00:27:01.810 - 00:27:45.010, Speaker B: It will worth $2,500 of scale. So that's it. I hope you will be interested in this price in our technology, in our cool features and just register on our website, get IMA SDK and start working with it. It's really easy and really interesting and have a lot of features and you can get some money for this. Okay, so that's it for me. Yeah.
00:27:50.420 - 00:28:11.850, Speaker C: We have a question from Lyle or Lil. Sorry, I'm not sure how to pronounce exactly your name, but I was asking about the benefits of going through a multi chain approach like scale vs. Other approaches. And Avalanche is also doing that. So if you want to explain that, also jump in.
00:28:12.220 - 00:29:10.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so the main benefits as you saw it's, the time of the transaction confirmation like very fast. Now it's like few seconds and the content deployment is making in seconds. But what about security? We algorithms and maps for protecting our customers. Yeah, this BLS DKG consensus algorithm that is working on the back end of this chain, all the stuff provides us the good security and it's really worth. Yeah, thanks.
00:29:11.040 - 00:29:29.650, Speaker C: Yeah. And also just as more people are getting on boarded to a lot of projects or just using crypto more, we are having a solution that you can expand and have you on chain where you don't have to share with a lot of people.
00:30:02.820 - 00:30:05.904, Speaker A: Sorry to interrupt. Can everybody hear me okay?
00:30:06.102 - 00:30:06.850, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:09.880 - 00:30:48.700, Speaker A: Yes, I can hear you. Unfortunately, we do have another workshop that is coming up shortly and I have to cut this one off. But I'd really love to encourage everyone to continue this conversation in the scale sponsor Discord Channel. And yeah, thank you so much, Dima and Celine, for this workshop. I know it wasn't easy getting everything situated, but everything seemed to run smooth at the end. We really appreciate your hard work and dedication. I do want to encourage everyone to also head over to the other workshop that is happening right now, which is sublime.
00:30:48.700 - 00:30:58.560, Speaker A: And yeah, thank you so much for this great workshop again. And yeah, find everybody on Discord. Have a really great day everybody. And bye.
