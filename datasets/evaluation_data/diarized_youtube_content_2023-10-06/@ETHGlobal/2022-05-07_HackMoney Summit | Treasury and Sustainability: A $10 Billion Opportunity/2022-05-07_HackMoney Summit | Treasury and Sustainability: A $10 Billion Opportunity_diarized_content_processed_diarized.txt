00:00:00.330 - 00:00:04.974, Speaker A: You awesome. Okay, cool.
00:00:05.012 - 00:00:05.934, Speaker B: So we're going to move on to.
00:00:05.972 - 00:00:23.838, Speaker A: Our next chat, which is going to be with Kaido. So the title is called treasury and Sustainability $10 billion Opportunity. So, yeah, Kaido, when you're ready, feel free to yeah, there you are. Awesome to have you back on the ETH Global stage. And I will turn it over to you.
00:00:24.004 - 00:00:41.180, Speaker C: All right, thank you so much. And thank you, ETH Global, for organizing this. This is great. I'll share my screen really quick. Give me 1 second. So today I'm going to be talking about treasury and sustainability, a $10 billion opportunity. Hope that's a good enough cash line for everybody.
00:00:41.180 - 00:01:19.734, Speaker C: So first, a little bit about me. I work on incentive design, llama Dow. My work encompasses governance, design, tokenomics, liquidity management. And my goal is to create systems to help protocols achieve their vision in this very cyclical market. And at llama Dao, we're building the economic infrastructure for DAOs. And here are some partners we're working with, or have worked with in the past, such as Ave, Uniswap and many others. And previously I was with Trader Joe, which is a decentralized exchange avalanche, which with about 2.4
00:01:19.734 - 00:02:09.602, Speaker C: billion TVL at its peak. And this is where when I joined, we had about 40 million TVL. So during my time there, I saw firsthand the explosive growth these protocols can have, and also a problem when this growth becomes hard to sustain. One day a protocol could have billions of dollars at its disposal and in a few weeks that become a 10th of that. And in a few months, they can't even sustain their team and have to lay people off and eventually close the project. So I've become interested in the sustainability of crypto projects and I have also went on to propose some sustainability projects for game economic designs and liquidity system to combat this vertical nature and this sustainability problem. However, sustainability of a project is multifaceted.
00:02:09.602 - 00:03:06.934, Speaker C: So in this talk, I will focus on one thing, which is Protocol Treasuries and how can we use that to ensure longer sustainability. So the goal for this talk is to answer a few questions. So the first one is what is protocol treasury? Why should I build for it? The second one is what are the current solutions in the space? And lastly, the most important to you guys, which is what can you build? You may have known by now, I'm not really great with PowerPoints, but I hope this will be a fun and actionable talk to you all hackers out there. So what is treasury and what is the problem here? So, protocol Treasury's definition is a very general one. It's assets owned by protocol for future development. And this is really broad by design because when it encompasses different functionalities here. So maybe a few examples would help us to understand what this really is.
00:03:06.934 - 00:03:59.242, Speaker C: So few examples of what protocol Treasuries are used for grant programs right, we see the price pool for tech money and these are given from protocols. And normally people would incentivize others to build on top of their own protocol. Another big spending is on ecosystem building where you want to build partnership with other protocols and sometimes that involve monetary value transfers. And lastly, which is actually the biggest part, which is budgeting. So you need to pay your salaries for your team, you need to pay for operations, you need to pay for your marketing and also events and outreach. And out of these treasury use cases, the last one budget is actually the biggest on the high end. Next we're going to just switch gear really quick and talk about how big is this space.
00:03:59.242 - 00:04:41.714, Speaker C: So on the left you can see that this is just a time series plot of total treasury value across time starting last year, ending this year. So right now there's currently about $9.5 billion in these protocol treasuries and it has increased ten X in the last ten months. And if you remember, in the last ten months there's not really any bitcoin or ethereum price actions. So a lot of these come from native Dow protocols launching and Dow building up. And when I first heard about it, I had an overwhelmingly positive response. I was like, this is amazing, these protocols are doing amazing things and they have so much capital to attract talent and innovate.
00:04:41.714 - 00:05:07.066, Speaker C: However, there's a catch. Most of these protocol treasury is made up of its native token. And I will showcase in this slide how concentrated that is. And in the next slide I'll discuss why this may not be a good thing. So we first start off with Unisoft's Treasury makeup. So unisop is decentralized exchange on Ethereum. It's the second largest protocol treasury.
00:05:07.066 - 00:05:41.030, Speaker C: It has the second largest protocol treasury at 1.6 billion. However, 99.9% of that value is its own uni token. UDX is another project, algo Stablecoin Living on Salana with the third largest protocol treasury at 620,000,099.4% of its total value is locked in its native token. And maker Dow, one that everyone a lot of people is very familiar with, is the 14th largest protocol treasury value and 99.2%
00:05:41.030 - 00:06:04.766, Speaker C: are in its native token. And some people might think I'm cherry picking here I am a little bit. But while a few projects protocols have a little bit more non native assets, the percentage is still very high. So right now Lido is one of the ones who's doing extremely good. They're a decentralized 2.0 staking solution provider. Even though they're doing really well.
00:06:04.766 - 00:06:32.042, Speaker C: They have the fourth largest treasury treasury, they have the fourth largest treasury value. Still, 88% of this treasury is in its own native token and the one is Mango Market on Salana. Out of the 500 million, they have 88%. So you can see this trend as in most protocols where most of these $9.5 billion we're talking about here are actually highly concentrated in different native tokens out there.
00:06:32.176 - 00:06:32.860, Speaker B: So.
00:06:34.590 - 00:07:32.570, Speaker C: Why is this a problem? There are three main problems with this high level of concentration. Number one is the market is very volatile so there can be sharp decreases in your treasury value. These downturns where most people in crypto are very used to nowadays your valuation can drop 50% to 95% just in a matter of weeks. For example, unisop in the last six months its total treasury value dropped by 65%. And the second thing I want to stress on which is the most important thing is growth normally requires cash but not native token. I'll try to elaborate here a little bit. What does that mean? In a very simplified model, if we think about how these things work is treasury rewards people and people drive growth, right? However, in the end, people still needs to trade with the market to exit your native token to pay for their daily expenses.
00:07:32.570 - 00:08:30.810, Speaker C: However, native token is really hard to exchange into cash or ethereum or other very liquid assets. For example, if we use 1% of uniswap's treasury 1%, which is about 2 million uni tokens, it will cause uniswap's price to drop 40%. And if you want to use 10% uniswap treasury it will actually make uniswap price go to zero. So this is extremely harsh for the protocol itself and also its community. And lastly, why this is a problem is the Huddle, what I call the Huddle versus sustainability problem. Imagining you are a protocol founder or your protocol member within the team and you want to tell your people, tell your community members that we need to diversify or we need to sell our tokens to give to others. How can your team, how can you be a team, tell your community members to huddle and at the same time dunking your own token.
00:08:30.810 - 00:09:34.750, Speaker C: This requires careful communication and more importantly, an important and explicit agreement with the community that what you're doing is okay and everyone agrees and is on the same page. However, that it's very, very hard to achieve. So if cash is so important, the question we should answer is how can we generate cash from treasury? And in this slide I want to talk about basically what are the current solutions for Protocol Treasury to achieve this, to achieve sustainability, to generate cash, to continue growth. As you can see here, I put potential in parentheses because some of these projects are not live yet or has now gaining significant traction due to its complexity or just for other protocols to utilize. For these current solutions I divide them into three categories. So I call them innovative solutions tried by solutions and low hanging fruits. However, these categorization is not meant as seeing which layer is better than the other because many times simplified solutions actually wins.
00:09:34.750 - 00:10:17.758, Speaker C: However, I do believe we're still in the searching phase in which we're trying to find more optimized solution to handle protocol treasuries. So on the bottom here we have the low hanging fruits, what I call them. These solutions are already established and have been used by protocols. The middle one are triadfi solutions. These solutions basically borrow existing established ideas from corporate finance and implement them into on chain contracts. On top are innovative methods and these solutions are less utilized in the traditional world or less known to most people but brings promising ideas to crypto. I also added in a risk spectrum because a lot of these things involve risk.
00:10:17.758 - 00:11:04.610, Speaker C: The things on the right would have more risks than things on the left. However, you should know that these are all relative risks and these risks are very different based on different projects. So first on the low hanging fruits there are a few very simple low hanging fruits, right? You can sell your token on the market which I would suggest using MEB protected Trades and also using Dex aggregators. The second is native yields. So for example if you are a protocol, your treasury has USDC and you're not spending them, you can deposit, you can basically be a lender on Aave or Compound to earn native yield. Or you have Ethereum, you can exchange or stake ETH with Vido to become 2.0 staker.
00:11:04.610 - 00:11:51.230, Speaker C: And on the far right we have these what we call yield aggregators such as Year Finance, Convex, Pull Together and many others. And what they do is you don't know which one has the best yield for your assets so you just give it to them and they help you optimize that. In the middle are Tritify solutions. There are three main buckets for tritify solutions I talk about here fixed rate lending, debt issuance and private investment in public equities. And I'll talk more about what Pip means a little bit later. So fixed rate lending is very straightforward. You have some amount of capital you're not utilizing now can deposit them for a fixed time for normally a higher Apr or guaranteed Apr.
00:11:51.230 - 00:12:34.730, Speaker C: Right? Now, element Finance, Notion Finance and many other projects support this. That issuance is very similar as in some cases you collateralize your native tokens and you borrow money against it and then you can basically use that money to generate income or you can use that money to pay your paper growth. And the two very prominent figures here are Porter Finance and Debt Dow. Their mechanism is a little bit different, I'm not going to dive into it but they have very interesting design choices. Lastly is pipe. This is just sort of like if X Six and Z wants to invest in a coin that already is public. So what they can do is what people call a strategic investment.
00:12:34.730 - 00:13:31.626, Speaker C: Sort of these OTC deals facilitated by OTC trading firms such as Genesis Trading. And lastly are what I call innovative solutions or these solutions that are less familiar to most people. So we have uma, we have Lock, we have Faye and ribbon and each of them have very different design choices. I'm also sure there's a lot of others out there that I don't have time to cover to fit into this graph. And then in the next few slides, I just want to quickly go over each of these innovative solutions to give you guys kind of an understanding what they're trying to do and how maybe you can combine different ideas together. So first is Uma success token. And in the past I talk about OTC deals and normally what would happen is let's say for example a six and Z wants to buy lido.
00:13:31.626 - 00:14:03.134, Speaker C: What would happen would buy some lido token. What would happen is it would contact the lido dow and then they're going to have a real life legal contract. And for example, if lido right now is one dollars, they're going to buy it at $0.6 per lido or $0.7 per lido and lock it for two years. The problem here is that it's very hard to generate community buy in and you have to go into a legal agreement through OTC decks. One example that didn't pay now was for Sushi swap.
00:14:03.134 - 00:14:55.450, Speaker C: They were trying to diversify but they couldn't because community voted down. And what Uma does is that instead of buying it at a discounted price for these private investors, they can buy a current price. But their upside is that if the token price increase above a certain price or what they call a strike price, they can have more upside. Next is block protocol streaming auction. So in the past, protocol sales only is a fixed price. And the problem is that it's hard to agree on token sale price for a community because everyone have different opinions and it's hard to make sure everyone is happy. And what law does is it's a continuous streaming option based on Tiwan as a specific set of automated market maker and people can basically commit capital and withdraw online capital at any time.
00:14:55.450 - 00:15:56.510, Speaker C: This movement will change the implied price of these government tokens. Next is fate. Protocols turbo. And in the past basically what you can do is I have mentioned is that protocol can deposit their tokens into Aave or compound and use that as collateral and borrow against it. However, most protocols do not meet the risk parameters to be listed on Aave or they do not meet the parameter sets for using something as collateral because those needs to be really liquid and there's losses the amount of risk ave has to protect against the lenders. So what faith protocol does is that you can collateralize your native token and you can earn interest on its cash value with Turbo. Meaning if you have 100 million in your native token, you can deposit that, you can borrow $10 million, which is 10% of that, and then use that $10 million, maybe generate five hundred K per year, a 5% stable yield to pay for your different expenses.
00:15:56.510 - 00:16:54.098, Speaker C: Ribbon here. This is Ribbon Treasury and in the past basically most forecasts do not have a diversification plan. They don't explicitly say when we're going to sell our tokens for cash. And the problem here is that because it's just hard to agree on diversification during a bull run right when the price is increasing. No team wants to talk to the community that we're going to sell 200 million or 2 million or 5 million tokens on the open market because that doesn't make anyone happy. So what Ribbon does is I create discovered call vaults which basically give protocol the freedom to diversify based on some price target and earn premium at the same time ahead of time. So you can decide during a crab market or a bear market that sometime in the future this is something we're going to do.
00:16:54.098 - 00:17:49.300, Speaker C: And in that case everybody knows ahead of time and that's very easy for people to generate buy in. I've been talking a lot about these different ideas, what people are building and now the question is what can you build? Just by looking at this you may seem like actually most things already exist. However, if you remember I mentioned that although these are solutions, they're only potential solutions. A lot of these tools are extremely, extremely hard for developers to understand and especially for those who doesn't have a strong finance background. And the trade off of different parameter choices for any of these projects is very hard to visualize. So the adoption of the system in protocol treasury is still very low. And this resonates back with the $9.5
00:17:49.300 - 00:18:35.594, Speaker C: billion slide which 90% to 80% of treasury still sits in stablecoin, still sits in its native token, not really earning anything or producing anything. So what can you build in this part? I basically want to give you guys three kind of methods to think about this problem or three angles to think about this problem. So the first thing is to build something that can there's something existing and we want to decrease the trust subsumptions of that. Essentially we want to code agreements on chain. So there's two examples I give here. The first one is the token swap contract. What token swap is it's a way for protocols to exchange their treasury tokens with other protocols to build partnerships.
00:18:35.594 - 00:19:36.130, Speaker C: For example, I'm protocol A, they're protocol B. We want to engage in some mutual relationship. What we can do is that we can exchange our treasury token so we own some value in the other project but at the same time we can engage in governance and many, many other things. However, there's not a very great way to code this contract. And for every time you want to engage in this relationship normally a new contract will be right, will be written. The second thing is the private investment in public equity or we can think of this OTC trades mostly right now happens off chain. However, there could be some simple contracts people can cook up for a hackathon where you can think about how can we make that on chain in a way that not just OTC desks can utilize them, but also other people and also other Dows without legal entity can engage in these transactions.
00:19:36.130 - 00:20:11.998, Speaker C: Next is to decrease the coordination friction. Basically these are two kids to manage these positions. Like I said, it's really complex for people to think about what's the correct strategy or even maybe the correct strategy doesn't exist. So some very simple ones are simulators for payouts. I think based on some past data, based on some heuristics, this is what we think the payout will be. Or what are some risks on downsides, on sensitivity analysis, these very traditional finance stuff. The second I think is very underrated, which is easy to understand front end.
00:20:11.998 - 00:21:08.622, Speaker C: I know we have team building on decentralized UIs. I think those are very important. And also important is to make sure they're easy to understand for users. Because if I am a uniswap token holder, I shouldn't be an expert for treasury diversification or management. So how can you present something that the voters or the governance token holders can understand and engage with? It's very important. The last one is brainstorm new ideas for you, maybe heard some idea back in your graduate econ class or undergrad math class or any kind of class, any kind of concepts outside the crypto world and bring them into the crypto world through making an on chain transaction. And I think those are the three main ways for a hackathon project I think will be great to see some innovation in those fronts.
00:21:08.622 - 00:21:30.300, Speaker C: And if anyone is interested in talking about these, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at zero Xkaido and I'm very happy to help you guys out to narrow down your space, search space and et cetera. And that is the end of my talk. I still have a little bit of time, so I would love to answer a few questions if anyone have any.
00:21:36.890 - 00:21:40.280, Speaker B: Thanks, Kaido. I'm just taking a look at the chat to see if there are any.
00:21:52.350 - 00:21:58.400, Speaker C: Just a quick question, Jacob. What is the general background for these hackers we have?
00:21:59.570 - 00:22:41.350, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. I think it's a very mixed bag of people, but certainly the main focus is everybody's very interested in DeFi. So I think it's largely a group of people who want to build the things that you just built, I think, or you just defined. So I think that's interesting. I guess one question that comes to mind about the talk that you mentioned right now. We are seeing this big advent of Treasuries growing in the last couple of months. As you mentioned, we are kind of still in quite a bull market, which makes it difficult, like you mentioned, to sort of trade away from growth.
00:22:41.350 - 00:23:02.402, Speaker B: How much of this problem do you think is simply mathematical, almost like a liquidity problem versus how much of this actually ends up being inner Dow politics or treasury politics and being able to win people over. How much of this is math and how much of this is feeling do you think?
00:23:02.456 - 00:23:55.140, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a great question which goes to this slide about your friend is not your exit. What do you mean? In my opinion, I think most projects who think about long term, they know this is a real issue. It depends on project by project basis. But for most of the projects I engage with, I think the team and the general community realized we need to build a word chest for a potential bear market. And I think that's very important. And I don't think there's a lot of inner politics against this. I think it's more on the communication maybe, as in how do you communicate that from the inner circle of the project to the outside circle, people who maybe have a more speculative bet on the token price.
00:23:57.910 - 00:23:59.540, Speaker B: Got you. Very cool.
00:24:01.110 - 00:24:32.414, Speaker C: And I think that the low hanging fruits is not enough right now. So that's also why I don't think we see a lot of hype in the space. And the reason being if you think about these low hanging fruits, what it requires, that requires non native assets. So if you don't have non native assets, those doesn't really work very well. And that's where the triedfi solutions come in to generate those non native assets. And I think they're good and they're great. I think they're a very good first step.
00:24:32.414 - 00:24:40.660, Speaker C: However, at the same time, how can you innovate on top of that at the same time moving forward while keeping it simple and for people to understand and use?
00:24:42.310 - 00:24:44.660, Speaker B: Got you. Awesome.
00:24:45.750 - 00:24:46.500, Speaker C: Cool.
00:24:47.510 - 00:24:49.838, Speaker B: I don't see too many other questions in the chat.
00:24:49.934 - 00:24:50.580, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:24:51.110 - 00:25:00.354, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a great talk. Thank you so much for putting this together, sharing. Obviously it's a big topic right now. It might not feel that way because things are going up.
00:25:00.472 - 00:25:01.042, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:01.176 - 00:25:08.234, Speaker B: But it's going to be very obviously important in future where things aren't always going up.
00:25:08.432 - 00:25:17.560, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. All right, thank you so much for having me and great event and thank you for organizing and I'll see you guys soon.
