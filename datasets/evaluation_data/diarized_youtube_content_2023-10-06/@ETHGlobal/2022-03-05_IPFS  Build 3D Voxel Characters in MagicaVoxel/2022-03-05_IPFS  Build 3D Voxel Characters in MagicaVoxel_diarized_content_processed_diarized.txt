00:00:00.170 - 00:00:20.800, Speaker A: Workshops. We have Pan from Protocol Labs IPFS Filecoin here to do a workshop on build 3D Voxel characters and the magic of Voxel. And questions go in the Zoom chat if you have any. Pan will leave them all till the end, so definitely stick around. And with that being said, I'll hand the mic off to Pan.
00:00:22.130 - 00:00:47.820, Speaker B: Thanks a lot. Anna hello everyone. Pan. I am a filecoin IPMS advocate. I'm very passionate about design and Greek graphics. In fact, I began my career as a designer a few years working as an artist and got into coding while trying to animate computer graphics. So it's safe to say that I'm really happy to be here today.
00:00:47.820 - 00:02:28.190, Speaker B: I'm very excited to be given this opportunity to teach you how to model your very first Voxel game characters using this open source 3D Voxel Editor Magica Voxel. And if you haven't heard of Voxels before, this is just like a very brief introduction. What are voxels, you ask? Voxels are just like 2D pixels except they live in three dimensions. So if you have painted using early Microsoft Paint program, then it's very similar except in Magical Voxel you will be painting in x, y and z axes instead. And why are building Voxel style furrow games, right? Like what are the benefits? What I can think of is for one, it is really quick and easy to model and gives your NFT or game a better time to market, right? You don't have to hire really experienced 3D modeler or anything like that. If you want to launch your NFT project or a game, anyone can actually model your Voxel characters. It has the nostalgic look and feel of those eight bit Nintendo games, so it's really relatable to the general audience and not just hardcore gamers.
00:02:28.190 - 00:03:49.562, Speaker B: Voxels are highly configurable because they are very modular, right? So as you can see, so it is much easier to create variations, attributes and props for your NFTs or game characters. If you have done some gaming in the past few years, you might have come across this really awesome game Crossy Roads, being shown here on the screen. It was a very popular arcade game a few years back where the players sort of control an animal character, the most prominent one being a Voxel chicken to cross the roads and just dodge the obstacles like cars and trains. The game actually popularized the modern boxer style game and since then there have been many knockoffs and other games being inspired by Crossy Routes to go all box style. After the success of Crossroads, of course Minecraft, yeah, I forgot to mention this, of course Minecraft. It's probably like the first ever 3D game that made Voxel style store popular, so that's kind of a legend up there. For one's word.
00:03:49.562 - 00:04:05.760, Speaker B: I think there's a pretty good chance Cross the Road to use Magical Voxel for their game design as well because my Magical Voxel is free and anyone can use it. But if you know anything better, just please let me know.
00:04:07.250 - 00:04:16.100, Speaker A: Hey, Pan, sorry to interrupt you really quick. We can see your speaker notes. Not sure if you have them up on purpose or not.
00:04:16.710 - 00:04:19.700, Speaker B: Oh, no. Okay. Sorry about that.
00:04:20.230 - 00:04:21.140, Speaker A: No worries.
00:04:22.550 - 00:04:23.300, Speaker C: Cool.
00:04:24.630 - 00:04:27.142, Speaker B: All right. Better now?
00:04:27.276 - 00:04:27.960, Speaker A: Yes.
00:04:28.410 - 00:05:03.570, Speaker B: Okay. So today we'll be modeling Biscuit here's biscuit. It's our final coin resident 4G Biscuit. This is the hackers hackers Biscuit. We will spend a bit of time getting to know our way around magical Voxel UI and some of the components here. Then we will talk a bit about the basic of designing and building Vossel characters from my experience as a designer. Just enough to wet your appetite and get you playing afterward.
00:05:03.570 - 00:05:47.870, Speaker B: And then I'll dive into building the Corgi model while we learn how to use the tools in match the Vossel. By learning, by joining. Because I believe getting your hands dirty is a lot more fun than just listening to me lecturing. Then in the end, if we have some time left, I'll be happy to answer any questions from you or otherwise. Feel free to join our finecoin Slack or DM me on Twitter or Discord. My Twitter username is at pancyshane pancychain. And my discord username is Pansy.
00:05:47.870 - 00:06:24.970, Speaker B: P-A-N-C-Y. Pansy hash 5150. So before we begin, we need magical waffle, of course. So please go ahead and use the link to download here the first link on the screen. If you like to just follow through with this workshop. And also the second link here. It's pretty optional.
00:06:24.970 - 00:07:26.160, Speaker B: You can download OBJ to glTF using NPM to use as a command line tool or JavaScript library on your front end to convert OBJ models to GLB. And what is the GLB format? GLB is a format that's using all kinds of stuff online, like VR, AR, web apps. It supports motion animation. It also is very fast because it has a very small size. So GLB files are kind of like a binary version of if you have heard of this, it's the glTF GL transmission format file, which uses JSON instead. So it's human readable. GLB is not human readable, but it's very popular format to be used on the web just because it loads very fast.
00:07:26.160 - 00:07:44.340, Speaker B: So the command line OBJ two glTF command line is totally optional but highly recommended. I can see someone is having fun.
00:07:45.050 - 00:07:49.720, Speaker C: Sketching on the screen. That's cool. Someone is being creative here.
00:07:51.690 - 00:08:50.490, Speaker B: Okay, let's go on to modeling your design. All right, so I'm assuming that a lot of you are designing your ears or you have some design passion here and that's why you're here. So we're going to talk a little bit about how to model your design in the perspective of a designer or modeler. So you can see here, all I had to start with was this 2D cartoon version of the Corg. I didn't have much to start with, so it was pretty fun also because it left a lot of rooms for creativity and interpretation. Here are the keys to modeling your Vossal characters. The first is to capture a few distinct qualities of a character apart from colors.
00:08:50.490 - 00:09:43.530, Speaker B: Colors are, surprisingly, are the least important representation of something. For instance, if one day I just turned green and my hair turned red, you would still be able to tell it's me, right? So we don't think of colors as being the identifying trait. We can use them as variation in your NFTs or whatever. As an example, you can see the corgi here. What I think makes a corgi. A corgi are maybe the long upward neck and the big chest. It's a very proud job, right? When it's walking or it's standing straight, it looks very proud.
00:09:43.530 - 00:10:45.790, Speaker B: And of course, compared to its stature, it has a very stubby set of legs. And of course, the chunky and much bigger hind legs and the buttocks. So these are the qualities you want to capture when you model your walks of characters. And here are some more examples of modeling Voxels after textile based art. As you can see, to the right is the 2D version of the artwork or design from this music video, gimmick proof from Filecoin. And to the right hand side are the Voxel models I created. The second key to modeling your design your Voxel is to get the right proportion of a character.
00:10:45.790 - 00:11:42.902, Speaker B: Here you can see the pickle heart character. Here the wrapper guy. Here his iris yeast. The black spots in the eyes are clearly one unit pixel in the 2D version, right? So that could be converted to a unit Voxel one to one in three D, and I started with that, and the rest kind of followed in related to it. Since pixels and Voxels are very similar, the only challenge, I think, lie in interpreting the depth or the size of the model based on the 2D pixels. So I did some guesswork around that. That is where you get to be really artistic and critic about your modeling.
00:11:42.902 - 00:12:18.954, Speaker B: And after all, it's really all about not taking your original design literally and really make sure the Voxel models look great on their own. Okay, so let's dive into magical Voxel UI and control and let's go really quickly. I hope by this time, if you wanted to follow through, you already have magical Voxel on the screen. But if not, this session is recorded.
00:12:19.072 - 00:12:21.280, Speaker C: So you should be good to go later.
00:12:23.810 - 00:13:14.560, Speaker B: If you can see here to the right hand side of the screen of the magical Voxel UI here, that's the color palette. So it should be really familiar to a lot of you who have done some editing, graphic editing before. So let's just choose the colors and whatnot here. They have some predefined colors. And right down here you could see you could also add your own colors to the right hand side of this color palette is the brush pane. The brush pane is really important. It's actually where you'll be using it a lot.
00:13:14.560 - 00:13:47.590, Speaker B: The brush pane here, most of the time you'll be using the three brushes here, voxel brush, face brush, and box brush. And for each brush, you could actually choose an action, attach action, erase action, or paint action. Let me show you yours. So I'm using the voxel brush, and then I choose the erase action. As you can see here, you can sculpt away voxel by voxel.
00:13:48.590 - 00:13:49.980, Speaker C: That's pretty cool.
00:13:55.070 - 00:14:01.680, Speaker B: All right. And the attach action, I'm still using the voxel brush, let you.
00:14:04.290 - 00:14:04.942, Speaker C: Let you.
00:14:04.996 - 00:14:17.860, Speaker B: Build you let you paint or add boxes in any color that you like. Keep in mind that boxes are like pixels, so they are the smallest units here.
00:14:19.590 - 00:14:20.740, Speaker C: There you go.
00:14:21.190 - 00:14:49.910, Speaker B: And of course, paint. Paint means you can paint the existing voxels in any color that you like. Again, you can see that we're painting the whole voxels. Okay, we're not painting just any side of the voxels. We're painting the whole voxels. The face brush here is very interesting. It lets you deal with the whole face, contiguous face.
00:14:50.000 - 00:14:51.262, Speaker C: Let's see this face.
00:14:51.396 - 00:14:53.150, Speaker B: I want to erase this face.
00:14:53.300 - 00:14:54.400, Speaker C: There you go.
00:14:56.050 - 00:15:13.006, Speaker B: So I can erase it face by face. I can switch to attach mode, and that would just add more faces. And of course, paint, you can paint.
00:15:13.038 - 00:15:14.900, Speaker C: It face by face.
00:15:20.230 - 00:15:33.382, Speaker B: Oh, and by the way, just how you rotate your model and zooming or panning is very similar to any other 3D modeling software here.
00:15:33.516 - 00:15:35.080, Speaker C: There's no surprise here.
00:15:35.530 - 00:15:50.310, Speaker B: Last but not least, the box brush here just allow you it's very similar to the voxel brush that allows you to kind of build planes of voxels instead of like dots of voxels.
00:15:50.650 - 00:15:56.830, Speaker C: You can build planes all it's pretty handy.
00:15:57.250 - 00:16:04.126, Speaker B: Okay, let's move on to down here below. Here, below the brush pane, you would.
00:16:04.148 - 00:16:04.720, Speaker C: See.
00:16:06.470 - 00:16:07.714, Speaker B: The view pane here.
00:16:07.752 - 00:16:12.580, Speaker C: So you can let's delete the model here.
00:16:18.410 - 00:16:21.720, Speaker B: You can choose how your space will look like.
00:16:22.410 - 00:16:24.614, Speaker C: Turn on the edge, you can turn.
00:16:24.652 - 00:16:26.646, Speaker B: Off and on the grid and the.
00:16:26.668 - 00:16:28.840, Speaker C: Frame, stuff like that.
00:16:29.690 - 00:16:46.234, Speaker B: And of course, the center here is the editor, where you mostly work with your model. And then to the right hand side of your editor window here is the edit pane here.
00:16:46.272 - 00:16:49.966, Speaker C: So what you can do, okay, what.
00:16:49.988 - 00:17:36.510, Speaker B: You can do here is that you can delete your model, you can flip your model and you can scale your model. And there's a lot more things you can do to transform your model. And to the right hand side here is the project pane. So that's where you can save and open your projects and stuff like that. And the last one here is the export pane here. So that's where you export your model into some other file formats, like OBJ, for instance. Okay, so without further ado, let's try to dive into building our corgi.
00:17:39.010 - 00:17:46.782, Speaker C: I'm going to show you this corgi really quickly. All right.
00:17:46.836 - 00:18:03.350, Speaker B: And this is Biscuit, our resin corgi. I can render it as well. So Magical Boxo has a really decent built in renderer, as you can tell.
00:18:04.040 - 00:18:24.490, Speaker C: So let's start with this, and then I'm just going to delete the model oops check really quickly.
00:18:25.200 - 00:18:43.730, Speaker B: Okay. So if you're starting here from scratch, just delete whatever model you're seeing on your screen and then make sure your space is set to 40 x 40 x 40, so you have some room to work with.
00:18:46.500 - 00:19:00.550, Speaker C: Okay. And right now, I'm just kind of bringing up the corgi. Okay.
00:19:02.460 - 00:19:18.590, Speaker B: So keep in mind that I'm modeling from the model that I've built already. In real life, you'll probably be modeling from sketch or from 2D sketches and stuff. So it would just take a bit more work here.
00:19:21.600 - 00:19:22.350, Speaker C: Okay.
00:19:22.880 - 00:19:29.088, Speaker B: So for me, I like to start with the snout of the dog. It's just like a very easy place to start.
00:19:29.254 - 00:19:30.192, Speaker C: So let's see.
00:19:30.246 - 00:19:32.848, Speaker B: I think I should start with four.
00:19:32.934 - 00:19:37.676, Speaker C: X four voxel cube.
00:19:37.868 - 00:19:42.420, Speaker B: So let's start with a box brush and attach action.
00:19:44.280 - 00:20:02.232, Speaker C: And then let's do it. Four x four. There we go. Very good. Let's change the color to something more realistic here. Boom. Okay.
00:20:02.366 - 00:20:12.140, Speaker B: And then I'm switching to the face brush and attach action so I can extrude it up. Four volt units.
00:20:12.960 - 00:20:13.710, Speaker C: Okay.
00:20:14.560 - 00:20:21.424, Speaker B: And then I'll switch to volkso brush and then paint mode. Paint action here.
00:20:21.622 - 00:20:26.672, Speaker C: And then I'll just paint the nose. And watch this.
00:20:26.726 - 00:20:57.900, Speaker B: This is something that is really handy here. Go to the mirror option here, right under the brushes, and then click X. What it does is it lets you kind of copy whatever you're working on across the X axis, sort of like reflecting your work to the opposite side, which is really handy because a lot of times your Vossal characters are symmetrical.
00:20:59.040 - 00:21:05.790, Speaker C: So I'm going to show you this. So I'm just going to paint the nose and see this.
00:21:06.240 - 00:21:11.410, Speaker B: It just automatically painted the other side as well.
00:21:13.940 - 00:21:15.584, Speaker C: And then I'm just going to use.
00:21:15.622 - 00:21:17.372, Speaker B: The vaults and brush and the erase.
00:21:17.436 - 00:21:21.796, Speaker C: Action to scalp away the mount a little. That's it.
00:21:21.818 - 00:21:26.676, Speaker B: I've got the snout. And then I use the move tool.
00:21:26.858 - 00:21:28.356, Speaker C: Move it up a little bit so.
00:21:28.378 - 00:21:29.830, Speaker B: It'S easy to work with.
00:21:30.280 - 00:21:32.320, Speaker C: Just kind of go around here.
00:21:32.490 - 00:21:36.264, Speaker B: Let's do the head of the dog here. Let's start with the box.
00:21:36.382 - 00:21:44.410, Speaker C: And then let's do the orange brownish orange for the skin tone. Okay.
00:21:45.120 - 00:21:45.628, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:21:45.714 - 00:21:48.990, Speaker C: Attach the box. There we go.
00:21:50.000 - 00:22:14.432, Speaker B: Switch to face brush and then use attach action to extrude it a little bit here. Know that we're still doing the mirror thing here. So that's why right now I'm on a face brush. I'm using the face brush and then attaching the voxels.
00:22:14.576 - 00:22:17.396, Speaker C: I'm going to do this offset. Yeah.
00:22:17.498 - 00:22:21.076, Speaker B: So you can see your work is actually being reflected on the other side.
00:22:21.098 - 00:22:24.870, Speaker C: Which is pretty cool. Touch.
00:22:25.260 - 00:22:31.640, Speaker B: Going to extrude this up. 1234 voxel units.
00:22:32.140 - 00:22:32.888, Speaker C: Great.
00:22:33.054 - 00:22:36.380, Speaker B: Now let's paint the eyes here. Let's see.
00:22:36.530 - 00:22:38.812, Speaker C: Should be around. Okay.
00:22:38.866 - 00:22:43.420, Speaker B: Sorry. Block tool brush and then paint action.
00:22:46.240 - 00:22:47.660, Speaker C: And voila.
00:22:50.100 - 00:22:50.896, Speaker B: I'm happy.
00:22:50.998 - 00:23:13.752, Speaker C: Let's do the iris. It's pretty awesome. Okay, now let's move on to the ear. The box brush attach. Let's do the ear here. Oops, now that's a different color.
00:23:13.886 - 00:23:18.170, Speaker B: I can use the eyedropper to select the color that I want from the model too.
00:23:18.700 - 00:23:28.252, Speaker C: That's what I did. The box brush attach. There you go. Nice, right?
00:23:28.306 - 00:23:30.270, Speaker B: And then I use the box brush again.
00:23:32.000 - 00:23:36.620, Speaker C: Kind of build something here.
00:23:36.690 - 00:23:37.816, Speaker B: And then the face brush.
00:23:37.848 - 00:23:39.708, Speaker C: I use the paste brush to extrude.
00:23:39.724 - 00:23:40.930, Speaker B: It up all the way.
00:23:43.060 - 00:23:43.584, Speaker C: All right.
00:23:43.622 - 00:23:47.856, Speaker B: And then I use the voxel brush and the erase action to just kind.
00:23:47.878 - 00:23:50.870, Speaker C: Of scalp away the parts I don't need.
00:23:53.000 - 00:23:57.796, Speaker B: And then I use the face brush and then erase action to just get.
00:23:57.818 - 00:24:03.610, Speaker C: Rid of the whole thing. Now I can select.
00:24:05.580 - 00:24:06.744, Speaker B: The paint here.
00:24:06.862 - 00:24:16.156, Speaker C: And then I can paint with a voxel brush. Can paint the inside of the ear like that. Okay.
00:24:16.258 - 00:24:20.990, Speaker B: So we're kind of almost there. This is like the hardest part ahead, actually.
00:24:22.000 - 00:24:32.064, Speaker C: And then let's paint this part here as well. Okay, happy here. Now we're going to use the face.
00:24:32.102 - 00:24:35.970, Speaker B: Brush and then attach. And then we can extrude this. Oops, sorry.
00:24:37.540 - 00:25:02.330, Speaker C: I like the orange color. Extrude it all the way to the ground. That and then let's approximate here. I need to be a little taller. So I'm going to move this up here and then just use the face brush to extrude that more. And then let's approximate his body.
00:25:03.900 - 00:25:09.710, Speaker B: Use the box brush and detach to create like a plane for his body.
00:25:12.000 - 00:25:12.990, Speaker C: Like that.
00:25:13.360 - 00:25:17.550, Speaker B: And then face brush to extrude it.
00:25:20.480 - 00:25:44.200, Speaker C: Okay. So I'm going to move him up a little bit more like that. I'm happy with the size. Then I'm just going to use the voxel brush to erase this part. I don't need choose the face brush is better. There you go. Much faster.
00:25:44.200 - 00:25:50.648, Speaker C: Okay.
00:25:50.734 - 00:25:53.764, Speaker B: And let's start modeling the legs.
00:25:53.892 - 00:26:37.530, Speaker C: Let's do this. Okay. Before that, let's just paint this part here. Take the light yellow and then paint. All right, let's just detail here. We can just kind of paint that. There we go.
00:26:38.380 - 00:26:41.064, Speaker B: Okay, let's use the box brush and.
00:26:41.102 - 00:26:58.124, Speaker C: Then attach to make the base for the front leg. Should be around that, maybe bigger then that. And then use the face brush to.
00:26:58.162 - 00:27:00.140, Speaker B: Extrude all the way to the ground.
00:27:01.140 - 00:27:15.090, Speaker C: Okay. I kind of like the length of the legs here. So I'm just going to oops, sorry. Just switch to the box brush and then do this. Okay.
00:27:15.460 - 00:27:21.328, Speaker B: So I have a pair of nice planes. Walks up planes for the front legs.
00:27:21.504 - 00:27:38.356, Speaker C: Pretty great. So I'm just going to paint the socks for this guy here. Voxel paint. Oops. Use the paint and then paint away okay.
00:27:38.478 - 00:27:40.620, Speaker B: And then I'll use the face brush again.
00:27:40.690 - 00:27:50.750, Speaker C: And then just kind of extrude it out a little. Oops, there you go.
00:27:51.140 - 00:27:53.196, Speaker B: And then let's do the hind legs.
00:27:53.228 - 00:27:59.280, Speaker C: Here's.
00:28:01.780 - 00:28:03.330, Speaker B: The box brush again.
00:28:03.720 - 00:28:20.870, Speaker C: And then the hind leg should be slightly higher up here. All right. And again, we use the box brush to define the plane and then the face brush to extrude down all the way here.
00:28:22.540 - 00:28:24.424, Speaker B: You use the box brush to kind.
00:28:24.462 - 00:28:27.992, Speaker C: Of oh, we can just sculpt this away, actually.
00:28:28.046 - 00:28:31.064, Speaker B: So use the Foxel brush and erase.
00:28:31.112 - 00:28:43.890, Speaker C: Action and make his hind leg a little round and cute like that. Okay, I'm happy here.
00:28:46.980 - 00:28:51.100, Speaker B: Okay, and then let's stay with the voxel brush.
00:28:51.260 - 00:29:13.992, Speaker C: Paint the socks. What am I doing? I forgot to choose the paint locksol and then paint away. Okay. All right. Kind of happy here.
00:29:14.046 - 00:29:15.992, Speaker B: Use the face brush and then just.
00:29:16.046 - 00:29:19.224, Speaker C: Extrude it so that they are as.
00:29:19.262 - 00:29:20.804, Speaker B: Thick as the front light.
00:29:20.942 - 00:29:33.248, Speaker C: Again, sorry, face attached. Boom, boom, boom. Okay, you sort of like have the whole thing and just the tail here.
00:29:33.334 - 00:29:37.010, Speaker B: So I'm just going to turn off the mirror option here because it's just easy.
00:29:38.100 - 00:30:06.568, Speaker C: Let's just also erase. Make his butt off a little rounder and then the box. Okay. Maybe a little bit too much. Okay. All right.
00:30:06.654 - 00:30:08.680, Speaker B: And then I use the box brush.
00:30:10.220 - 00:30:30.928, Speaker C: Just maybe make one more here. Up here. That's it. Boom. We have the cordy. Okay. If we should have some time here.
00:30:31.014 - 00:30:46.832, Speaker B: Okay, so here's the thing. What you can do is that if you press tab, you enter the worm mode. So with worm mode, you can sort of just move things around without touching the model. So you can't edit the model directly.
00:30:46.896 - 00:30:48.324, Speaker C: But you can sort of move things.
00:30:48.362 - 00:31:03.244, Speaker B: Around in the world mode. This is where you work on separate isolated components. So you can choose to work on the legs, the face, and your heads and ears and stuff like that as.
00:31:03.282 - 00:31:11.150, Speaker C: Separate components, which is pretty handy. So let's say if we choose this.
00:31:12.800 - 00:31:29.030, Speaker B: Space and then we press tab to go back to the editing mode, we won't be able to touch our portion model because we're in a different local space, which is pretty handy because right now. So that you can just kind of model something else.
00:31:31.000 - 00:31:37.220, Speaker C: Entirely isolated from your other models.
00:31:37.720 - 00:31:38.470, Speaker B: Okay.
00:31:40.780 - 00:31:41.352, Speaker C: All right.
00:31:41.406 - 00:31:46.250, Speaker B: Now it's the time to go to export. Okay, let's save this first.
00:31:47.900 - 00:32:05.452, Speaker C: All right, let's duplicate this. Yes. And then let's put some name here. Biscuit clone one, save. Boom.
00:32:05.516 - 00:32:08.240, Speaker B: And then now you can export to OBJ.
00:32:11.300 - 00:32:21.556, Speaker C: Let's find this so you can save it here.
00:32:21.658 - 00:32:25.876, Speaker B: And then let's switch to our terminal here.
00:32:25.978 - 00:32:32.090, Speaker C: This is totally optional, but kind of recommended here.
00:32:32.540 - 00:33:25.704, Speaker B: So if you have downloaded OBJ two glTF here, this is where you can use it. You see in the folder here, you can see a lot of a bunch of files, OBJ files and MTL files. Material PNG files for the textures. So it's kind of difficult to handle all these files totally online. So use this command line OBJ to glTF to just kind of convert the OBJ file to this GLB file here. And this GLB file right here is very small, and you could totally use it for your NFT store and stuff because everything is self contained. You have material, color.
00:33:25.704 - 00:33:47.558, Speaker B: Everything you see in your editor will be embedded in that single file, which is pretty convenient. So, yeah, congratulations. If you've been following through, you have.
00:33:47.644 - 00:33:51.510, Speaker C: Created your first Vossel module.
00:33:53.690 - 00:33:57.190, Speaker B: It's not basic. The biscuit model.
00:33:57.260 - 00:34:04.780, Speaker C: It's already a good start here. Hold on.
00:34:08.270 - 00:35:10.782, Speaker B: So the next steps I recommend is to try to upload your GLB files to NFT of the storage and use the CID to fetch and display your 3D creations on your NFT store or game. And you can also just use the JavaScript library of NFT storage as well. If you want to programmatically, do that on your front end web application. You can also try to import your OBJ model into Blender and add some rickings Kinematics and use them in the game engine like Unity. Also check out Mixamo, I think. So after you wreck your model, you could plug in some predefined animations and start seeing your characters animate without having to do any work. And again, thank you for being here.
00:35:10.782 - 00:35:29.320, Speaker B: I hope this has been fun and useful for your NFT and gaming projects in the future or within the buildquest event. If you need some help or questions, again, just hit me up on Twitter, Slack or Discord. I'd be willing to help.
00:35:30.170 - 00:35:31.590, Speaker C: Is there a question?
00:35:31.660 - 00:35:39.240, Speaker B: Yes, of course. Maybe a minute more to answer a few questions.
00:35:46.570 - 00:35:50.360, Speaker A: You feel free to come off mute if you want to ask your question live.
00:36:04.630 - 00:36:26.040, Speaker D: What's up? Sorry, I think I didn't have the correct yeah, my question is, is it possible to use an image, right, of a drawing as a background so I can use it to sort of replicate it on Magica Boxer? Maybe I miss.
00:36:27.530 - 00:36:30.082, Speaker B: So can you repeat the question again about the background?
00:36:30.146 - 00:36:51.150, Speaker D: Yeah, I have an illustration, and I would like to use it as a background, so maybe I can or like in Cinema 4D, you can put them in one of the views and sort of it is your guideline not to then mold it into a 3D object. So I was thinking maybe here I could use an image and then kind of like drew the box cells.
00:36:52.050 - 00:36:56.500, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Yeah, I think you can totally do that.
00:36:56.950 - 00:36:59.460, Speaker D: Okay, how would I do that?
00:37:00.870 - 00:37:07.090, Speaker B: So I'm not sure at the top of my head, but I can find out the answer for you.
00:37:07.240 - 00:37:08.398, Speaker C: All right, sub.
00:37:08.504 - 00:37:09.078, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:37:09.164 - 00:37:09.800, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:10.810 - 00:37:15.558, Speaker B: You want to hit me up on Twitter or anything? Yes, we can follow up on this.
00:37:15.644 - 00:37:17.446, Speaker D: Definitely. Awesome, thanks.
00:37:17.548 - 00:37:17.958, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:37:18.044 - 00:37:19.260, Speaker B: Thanks for your question.
00:37:23.950 - 00:38:03.670, Speaker A: Does anyone have any other questions for Pan. Awesome. So we can end this workshop here then. That was super interesting pan. I really enjoyed seeing that and I think everyone else did too. So thank you, Pan, for taking the time out of your day to do this workshop for the buildquest hackers. For the rest of you, if you have any questions for the IPFS team that you can reach them on both the Eastglobal Discord and their discord.
00:38:03.670 - 00:38:18.870, Speaker A: And with that being said, we have more sessions or workshops planned for the rest of the day, so definitely hope to see you at all of those as well. And once again, thank you, Pam, for doing this really interesting workshop.
00:38:19.610 - 00:38:27.280, Speaker B: Thanks Adam, and thank everyone for being here. Feel free to just reach out to me if you have any more questions or even at home.
