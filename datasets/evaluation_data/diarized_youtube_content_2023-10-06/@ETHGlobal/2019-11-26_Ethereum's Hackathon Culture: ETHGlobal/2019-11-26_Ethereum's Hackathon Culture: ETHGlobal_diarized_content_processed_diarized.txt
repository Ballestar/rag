00:00:10.650 - 00:00:42.234, Speaker A: So the feeling at ETH Waterloo is a combination of electric and monastic. You have this kind of electric excitement of people who have traveled a long way to be here, who are doing something they love. And it's monastic because you also have people who are just like deeply focused on the code they're writing, like they have been for the last 16 hours. And somewhere in between those two ends of the spectrum, you get ETH Waddley. So we've done 14 events so far and these events have spin over five continents and it's been an amazing moment for us to see how we can actually make the Web Three division possible. In each of these places, talent is.
00:00:42.272 - 00:00:56.846, Speaker B: Universally distributed, but opportunity is not. And I think that what ETH Global does is it helps bridge that gap and kind of level the playing field by democratizing access to some of the best of the best people in the crypto space.
00:00:56.948 - 00:01:18.120, Speaker A: Well, I think it's really special because there's not really that many communities or it's really the only community where people are creating these kind of decentralized apps that are sort of permissionless and open and kind of just exist out there and everyone kind of seems aligned along the values of openness, transparency, decentralized finance, that sort of stuff. And so it's a community that's just really cool to be a part of.
00:01:24.170 - 00:02:05.074, Speaker C: A lot of the best Ethereum projects that we've seen have come out of hackathons in some form. CryptoKitties came out of a hackathon, a lot of scaling projects came out of hackathons. It's definitely a really good breeding ground for cool stuff. It's a super welcoming community. It's just a bunch of people who are really excited about the potential of this technology and just want to build amazing stuff. I think people have the understanding that this is a really new ecosystem and a new technology and that everybody individually will succeed if we succeed collectively. I think it's hugely valuable for somebody to come here that's especially new to Ethereum or Web Three in general and come here and learn from a bunch of mentors that have come out.
00:02:05.074 - 00:02:09.762, Speaker C: So this is probably the most effective environment to learn about Ethereum.
00:02:09.826 - 00:02:21.402, Speaker D: Honestly, I love the vibe of a hackathon. It really motivates me. I'd say that it's a great way to get exposed to a new technology, it's a great way to meet people that are completely new and also really deep into this stuff.
00:02:21.456 - 00:03:33.706, Speaker A: I was able to really experience the community and the types of people here and it was just really an eye opener of what hackathons are and how you can build yourself up in a community of people who are really here to help you. When we first came know, we see a lot of companies, there's a lot of companies we know and we work with. But after coming to East Waterloo, we met so many new developers and new blood into the ecosystem with really fresh ideas. And it's very inspiring to talk to them and learn how they see this space and how they would see all these infrastructure pieces, DeFi pieces kind of fit together. So we've been to Paris, the Denver, the Singapore, San Francisco, all over the world, some of these great cities where there's Ethereum Communities. And we brought the Ethereum Community to those regions, from the top sponsors in the industry to the top industry experts as judges and other hackers that just want to keep building with new people that they might become friends with or even build businesses with along the way. Yeah, I think East Global is actually well, you guys have been very intentional about trying to engage the local community and the different places that you have put on these events.
00:03:33.706 - 00:04:07.160, Speaker A: So that's actually really exciting to see. We've run more than 14 events on five different continents with developers from more than 75 countries. They have built combined more than 500 hacks. I'm excited to double down on what we've accomplished over the last two years and just expand even further. What really kind of we're focused on in 2020 is how do we actually scale this up even more so that anybody who's even semi curious about what could be done with Ethereum or Web Three or just what these events are like, is able to participate. And this is what we want to offer as a bigger platform over the next few years.
