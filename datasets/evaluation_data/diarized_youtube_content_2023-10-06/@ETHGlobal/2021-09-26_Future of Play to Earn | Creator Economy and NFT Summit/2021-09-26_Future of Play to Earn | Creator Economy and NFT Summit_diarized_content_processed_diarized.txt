00:00:06.410 - 00:00:36.920, Speaker A: With that, we are ready to move on to our next talk and that is going to be a far side chat between Gabby and Linda. Linda is going to be interviewing Gabby here. Linda is from Scalar Capital and Gabby is the co founder of Yieldfield Games. They're going to talk about what the future of Play to earn looks like and how NFTs and just gaming is taking over the world. So I'll let them do most of this intro and talking. And without further ado, let's welcome Gabby and Linda on screen.
00:00:41.910 - 00:00:44.260, Speaker B: Hello. All right.
00:00:46.090 - 00:00:54.218, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks for having us. So Gabby, can you just give a brief background on what Guild Guild Games is?
00:00:54.384 - 00:01:42.758, Speaker B: Sure. So YGG is what we call a play to earn gaming Guild. That means that we are a dao that invests into NFT assets of different play to earn games. Meaning games where you have NFT assets that earn some form of tokenized yield. These assets are then lent out to our player base, the members of the guild and then they play the games and basically earn some form of money that can be ultimately swapped out for Ether or to fiat. So we started doing this in Axie Infinity where we were lending out axis in what is called a scholarship or a lending program so that people can earn money in the form of SLP tokens and convert it to fiat. Most notably in the Philippines.
00:01:42.758 - 00:02:01.360, Speaker B: This blew up last year during the early kind of COVID lockdowns where people were stuck at home and couldn't find any work while they were home and they found Axie as a way to earn income that was actually multiples better than their local opportunities at that time.
00:02:01.890 - 00:02:16.046, Speaker C: That's awesome. I am curious though, you mentioned Axie. There's just been a lot of blockchain games in the past. What really appealed to you and your community for Axi and why do you think that that's become so popular?
00:02:16.238 - 00:03:00.414, Speaker B: Sure. So Axi has been around since 2018 and what really changed was when they introduced the form of yield in the form of the SLP token. So SLP is generated when you win matches inside Axie Infinity and what gives it value is that there is in game utility for the token. You actually have to use it or burn it as an ingredient when you have to breed two axes to create a new one. Now you can't buy any axes from the team itself. All of the axes that are generated are bred or created by community members who are known as the breeders in the game. So for people who are breeding they buy the SLP so that they can create a lot of axes and then sell these axes in the marketplace to new players.
00:03:00.414 - 00:03:16.360, Speaker B: So this is a very interesting kind of crypto economy that you see inside a game where it uses blockchain either in the form of NFTs for assets or fungible tokens for yield. As a way to kind of create an economy around it.
00:03:17.690 - 00:03:23.420, Speaker C: And then where have you seen what regions have taken off with this kind of work that you're doing?
00:03:23.790 - 00:03:55.460, Speaker B: We've seen it take off all over the world, but most notably it's taken off in regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America. So in Southeast Asia you have countries like Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia doing really well. And in Latin America you see countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, where I guess the income that people are earning here can be at times much higher than the local jobs that are available.
00:03:56.470 - 00:04:12.186, Speaker C: And then what do you think are the future of Play to earn gaming? Is it just going to be these scholarship rentals or what other use cases do you see here?
00:04:12.288 - 00:05:10.966, Speaker B: Right, so I think that the future of work is increasingly going to be in these virtual worlds and online games that are connected in their economies to the blockchain somehow. So right now we're earning a living online by going to different websites, doing some knowledge work. But I think increasingly there will be plenty of different jobs that will be available for people in basically video games, online worlds, and what we call the metaverse economy. So at the very basic, you may be a scholar or someone who is borrowing assets to play games and then earning some kind of income from that. There are people who are more, I would say, entrepreneurs like the breeders in Axie Infinity or landowners in a game like Sandbox or League of Kingdoms, where, yeah, I basically own land. And maybe you're leasing them out to people who are playing the game. There's also a lot of people who are doing content creation around these games.
00:05:10.966 - 00:05:54.198, Speaker B: So streamers the YouTubers who have their own followings. And what's interesting about this is that Play to Earn is bringing an additional business model to content creation where you don't necessarily have to be a top creator to be earning money. It's really hard to earn money as a top creator unless you really have a lot of viewers. But because of the business model Play to Earn, if you're good at the game, you can be creating good content and actually making decent amount of money at the same time. The other things I'm really excited about are really just the creative jobs that are going to be available in these games. So for example, you can be a digital fashion designer creating clothing for your avatars. You can be the one creating avatars or maybe buildings.
00:05:54.198 - 00:06:11.150, Speaker B: You may even be a blacksmith inside an RPG creating weapons for other people. So I think that the future of work is increasingly tied to the creator economy and really giving people access to jobs that are interesting to them and leverage their unique skills.
00:06:11.490 - 00:06:20.046, Speaker C: That's really cool. I know that the Play to Earn space is growing really quickly. What has been the challenging aspects of kind of growing?
00:06:20.078 - 00:06:58.122, Speaker B: YGG, I guess there's many challenges, but interestingly, the biggest one has not been technical, it's actually been cultural. We've been, I would say accustomed for the last 30 years. To think that playing games are a waste of time. They don't contribute anything to us. And I've been joking that moms have been yelling at their kids for so long about to stop playing games, and now these same moms are yelling at their kids to finish the daily quest in Axie Infinity so that they can get their daily income. So having that mind shift, we were actually learning really important skills when we were gaming. We were? Doing mastery.
00:06:58.122 - 00:07:24.194, Speaker B: We were doing pattern recognition. When we were playing MMOs, we were doing things like coordination, except that players weren't getting paid for it because there wasn't a business model for it. So now in player owned economies, now that people can invest in the assets and earn yield, you can actually get paid for this. It becomes a legitimate form of job, of an income. And I think we have a long way to go in kind. Of convincing people that this is indeed.
00:07:24.242 - 00:07:48.814, Speaker C: Real and then talking about that. I guess whenever you turn something you like to do into a job and you kind of have to earn an income from it, it can kind of make it less fun. So how do you strike a balance with these games and making it fun while you're still earning an income? Does that potentially ruin the experience? I know people talk about that potentially ruining experience.
00:07:49.012 - 00:08:20.680, Speaker B: For me, I think people have kind of thought of fun as something they do outside of work and work is something they do for money that may not be fun. If you actually have the opportunity to combine these where you're doing something that you enjoy, have it be meaningful work and get paid for it. I think it actually aligns persons interests better. I think when people think of playing games for work as not being fun is when maybe they think of their fun as separate from what they do from work.
00:08:22.010 - 00:08:36.058, Speaker C: Got it. And then can you also talk about for those that are really interested in play to earn, how they can get started? I know there's a lot of different discords and there's just a lot of overwhelming information so what are some of the resources you recommend?
00:08:36.224 - 00:09:04.550, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So there is a play to Earn documentary that was produced by Yield Guild and Axie Infinity. So you can definitely head out to YouTube and look for the Play to Earn documentary. We have our discord. Discord Ggygg. And when you go into our discord, you see a very vibrant community. We're a little over 60,000 people now that take a look at these different games and then form Sub Guilds inside our community to play these games together.
00:09:04.550 - 00:09:35.150, Speaker B: So apart from the players that are playing Axie Infinity, there's also discussion of many other games. And then people can gather and play games like League of Kingdoms, for example, or games like Splinterland. So there's a lot of different sub communities that are forming inside YGG, and if you want to just get info there's guild or yieldguild IO for our website where you can mint a free badge, you just have to pay gas and that makes you a guild member.
00:09:36.290 - 00:09:44.642, Speaker C: And then you mentioned League of Kingdoms and Splinterlands. Could you describe a little bit about what those games are like and kind of how people play them?
00:09:44.776 - 00:10:30.690, Speaker B: Sure. So for League of Kingdoms it's a strategy game similar to Clash of Clans, for example. The big difference is that players own the land that the game is being played on. So in the guilds instance, we own an estate of 286 pieces of land and the guild builds on top of it. And whenever money is spent on top of that land, when players spend on inapp purchases, a portion of the money spent goes to the landholders. So Splinter Lands itself is a card game that's been around on the hive blockchain and we actually see a lot of activity. And there's also a scholarship model where you can lend out cards to other people and they also have a land sale.
00:10:30.690 - 00:10:40.200, Speaker B: This game has been around for a couple of years and we're seeing really good retention and engagement activity. So I think the game is actually doing pretty well.
00:10:41.130 - 00:10:54.954, Speaker C: And then I know that a common criticism of play to earn is that how is this sustainable activity? And I personally know that just playing video games growing up there's always like gold farmers and all kinds of things.
00:10:54.992 - 00:10:55.370, Speaker B: That's right.
00:10:55.440 - 00:10:59.894, Speaker C: I'm curious to hear your perspective on how this is sustainable activity.
00:11:00.022 - 00:12:08.050, Speaker B: Okay, so the way I see it is that people are increasingly going to invest in assets that are online and on chain in these virtual worlds and economies. So when I take a look at a game like Axie Infinity for example, I start comparing it to a digital nation and its daily volume is its GDP. So now what is in the game that will make people invest in it? There must be something that can give them either enjoyment in the game or maybe their assets can increase or maybe they're looking for some form of yield. So it's no different basically than a regular economy except you're controlling these inputs and outputs via the game and then these assets are being transferred to the blockchain basically in the form of NFDS for assets or Tokens for currency maybe. And yeah, that means that you have actually self contained economies inside these games. And as long as there's reason for people to put money inside these economies, then it will bring about sustainability.
00:12:10.070 - 00:12:15.090, Speaker C: And then I guess what has been the most surprising part for you when starting YGG?
00:12:16.470 - 00:13:09.090, Speaker B: The most surprising part is just the diversity of people who have found play to earn work. We're not just seeing kids who are basically creating guilds and then going on raids inside these games. People are using them either as an income supplement or in some cases either as complete income replacements or even as their own businesses. From people who are trying to get to college, for example, to grandparents who are retired and are using this to supplement their pension. It's been great to see that there's a lot of people around the world who are now exposed to the crypto economy without one needing to know crypto in the first place. And second, they actually don't need to have any money in the first place. All they need is a skill that billions of people around the world have is like they need to have gaming skill.
00:13:09.090 - 00:13:21.000, Speaker B: So it's incredibly inclusive and we've seen that it has really included and onboarded people to the crypto economy who might have never wise been done so.
00:13:22.170 - 00:13:32.266, Speaker C: And then how are people finding out about YGG or just Play to earn in general? Is it just word of mouth or how is that happening?
00:13:32.448 - 00:14:19.610, Speaker B: It's super community based. So the way that Play to earn has been spreading has not been through traditional paid user acquisition channels like maybe a Facebook or a Google, it's really been by what we call a community acquisition. So we identify community leaders around the world that are basically good at cultivating communities and we give them access in the form of NFT assets content and our tech platform so that they can create their own play to earn communities or sub guilds around the world. And when these communities do well with these games, when they earn some money, other communities get interested as well and it's proven to be a really good way for user acquisition without having to pay any third party entity.
00:14:22.030 - 00:14:37.438, Speaker C: And then also curious about do you see more traditional gaming companies coming into the space for Play to earn? And then if they do so, do you think that that's going to change the landscape much or are they going to kind of have to be more crypto native? How do you see that playing out?
00:14:37.604 - 00:15:49.400, Speaker B: I think it's actually incredibly difficult for the kind of giants of today's world in games to successfully adapt to Play to earn. A big reason for that is that their current model is doing really well and they may be, for example, giant companies that are publicly listed that have their own shareholders. There's a lot of, I would say, regulatory uncertainty in the world of crypto and NFTs and it's very hard for these companies to embrace Play to earn because there is the risk involved of adding a token to their game and how would their shareholders, their lawyers feel about that? What we've been seeing instead is that there's a lot of talent coming from the traditional gaming space in Free to play in MMOs, who are now heading to play to earn. And they have the skills in creating virtual economies and they have to orient them more towards player owned economies where players are basically creating value and selling to each other instead of the publisher or the developer selling items directly to the players. But yeah, we're seeing a lot of really good talent start new studios right now.
00:15:50.810 - 00:16:11.950, Speaker C: And then one thing that I've noticed, and you're definitely more of an expert here, so curious your thoughts is the traditional gaming community can be a little bit toxic sometimes. But I've noticed that a lot of the play to earn community, they're really welcoming and helpful towards each other, kind of what have you noticed about the differences between the culture and why do you think that's the case?
00:16:12.100 - 00:17:25.000, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think personally part of that has been the unique culture of Axie Infinity community. The greatest thing about Axie is that the game had always been attached with a very welcoming community. People who didn't know anything about crypto or didn't know anything about the game had always been welcome and there's been a core set of kind of really strong community believers that have kind of tried to stay true to this culture even as it had scaled up to more than a million users. But in the greater NFT community there's this whole, I would say, positivity and ethos of helping each other. And it's really my favorite thing about Play to earn where people are really happy that they're able to invest whatever money they have into excess axes that they're providing out to people in countries like the Philippines or Venezuela where people there might not have a lot of good choices for local jobs. And it makes them happy to be able to provide these kind of, I guess, new form of gig work to people around the world. So there's a really strong undercurrent of that and I think it's really crucial to Play to earn even as we scale it up.
00:17:25.530 - 00:17:35.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I was actually going to ask that do you think this is going to be sustainable as more people come into this space and then how are you planning on helping to maintain that culture?
00:17:35.974 - 00:18:30.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that it's going to be a real work in progress. There is no guarantee that this kind of culture will really persist as we grow bigger and I think that's actually where guild communities come in. Guilds are a collection of people who are bound together and to do something as a group and that's basically what DAOs are. And we kind of use the guild and a Dao kind of interchangeably in YGG context. And I think it's up to us at the founder level of YGG to kind of express our values so that we can attract like minded people who want to stay in our guild and basically build together with the same set of common values. And hopefully that kind of radiates down to the sub guilds communities we have in different countries around the world, even if they tweak and localize basically their culture for their own unique communities.
00:18:31.630 - 00:18:46.094, Speaker C: And then regarding the guild structure, can you talk more about how that looks like internally and how do you keep up with all those communities? It seems like there's so many different sub guilds and different languages and countries. How do you manage that?
00:18:46.212 - 00:19:38.898, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely not easy, but we call Yield Guild a guild of guilds or a dao of dao. So we're not actually one guild. We are an umbrella or a federation of lots of different player communities. And the reason that we set it up this way when we started is that no one really wants to be in a guild of a million people, right? Like it's too big, it doesn't feel personal. So you want to be in a group of maybe your five friends going on a raid or maybe even 100 people who are in your immediate vicinity. So Yale Guild itself is set up into a lot of different sub guilds that are either organized by region, by community, or around the assets of a particular game. And that makes it feel smaller because you care more about your immediate community and people that you're playing with on a day to day basis than anyone else.
00:19:38.898 - 00:20:01.720, Speaker B: But on top of that yield, guild provides the NFT assets, the capital, the tech infrastructure so that we can empower these guilds, especially these community leaders who are great at building community cultivating it, recruiting players, and they don't have to worry about the technology side, the capital side, and we just help them do what they do best.
00:20:03.230 - 00:20:11.210, Speaker C: And then related to that, how do you hire people as a dow? How do you go about finding community managers?
00:20:11.710 - 00:21:12.800, Speaker B: So the great thing about community managers is that they're not employees, they're basically their own entrepreneurs who are good at building community and are able to monetize it by working with yield guild. So at first we work with community managers that already have their own kind of personal axis scholarship. Maybe they have a few dozen or a few hundred axis scholars. But it's hard for them to scale because it takes a lot of capital to create a lot of these axes. And we partner with them, we basically give them access to our axes and the platform that manages it and we do a revenue split. So how the revenue split works is it's 70 2010, 70% of the SLP earned goes to the scholar or the player, 20% to the community manager and 10% to YGG, the guild. And as a community manager, as some of our managers have maybe over 500 scholars of their own, it actually adds up quite a bit if you're able to scale how you are leading your community.
00:21:14.770 - 00:21:36.310, Speaker C: And then I know that 70 2010 structure might vary across outside of YGG and across different scholarship managers, I guess. How did that break down? Kind of why is that breakdown the case? And what else have you seen? And I know you have thoughts on some of the different structures. We'd love to hear them.
00:21:36.460 - 00:22:20.130, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's really important for us that the player or the scholars actually receive a majority of what they earn. I think it's really important for the future of the space that we are kind of changing the structure of how people are earning from a fixed wage, for example, to where they're being rewarded for their own upside. So that's very important for us and that's why we give the majority to the players. And as they go online, it means they're not just having a job anymore, they're being compensated for something that matches their ability, which, if you do that, you're enabling a lot of people around the world to make money basically based on their talents.
00:22:22.090 - 00:22:42.874, Speaker C: And then I also had a question around barriers to entry. So, I mean, it can be really confusing sometimes for people when they're first starting out with a wallet and kind of learning about how to use anything in crypto. So how are you kind of helping to navigate that space and have you seen what are you seeing as the biggest barriers to entry for people?
00:22:42.992 - 00:23:36.320, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually a really great question because crypto can be really confusing and I think we aren't there yet in crypto in the terms of just really seamless onboarding. And this is really where the magic of community comes in. So at Yield Guild, for example, if you come in as an Axe scholar, you don't have to know anything about crypto to start with. You don't have to know anything and you don't even have to have any money to start with. You're given an account, you log into that account, you start playing games and you start earning SLP. And during that time you're interacting with the community, you're being given content that will tell you what a crypto wallet is, how to play the game. And after two weeks, when you receive your first payout from SLP, from your revenue share in the game, you can bet that these players are very motivated to learn how crypto works when it's time to pay out.
00:23:37.890 - 00:23:48.462, Speaker C: And then do you have any numbers that you can share on kind of how large play to earn or some numbers from Yggd that can put this into perspective for the audience?
00:23:48.606 - 00:24:34.494, Speaker B: So we are paying out somewhere between one to $2 million every month right now to our community members. So this is the 70% share of SLP that they have. So we have around 5000 scholars, which is just a little under 10% of our community member base in the discord. But I think just if you think about how many people around the world would want to earn money by playing video games, I think we're just like super early. We're just getting started. I think that number will ultimately be in the billions of people. So while Yelia does under 100,000 members and Axe itself, the best performing game has a little over 1 million daily active users, I think.
00:24:34.494 - 00:24:36.880, Speaker B: Yeah, we're just barely getting started.
00:24:37.650 - 00:24:55.942, Speaker C: Yeah, that's so tiny compared to traditional games. So, also curious on the investment side, because you invest in NFT land, what does that process look like for you and the community of how you're deciding to invest in something? Is there someone managing that process or is it just community driven? How does that process look?
00:24:56.076 - 00:25:49.286, Speaker B: Yeah, so we do have an internal team that really looks at these games as similar to an early stage VC, but instead of investing in equity, we actually take a look at assets first. So we look at acquiring the NFTs that give yield. We take a look at how the economy works, where is the money coming in, how are people getting paid? Is this sustainable long term? We like to invest in the NFTs and their associated governance tokens and while it is not community driven in the decision making, we do have what we call a play to earn council, where we get signals from the community on what games interest them. So we use the community as kind of scouts to see what's out there, what's interesting. And yeah, it's happened several times in that the interest from the community has ended up with us making an investment as well.
00:25:49.468 - 00:26:02.890, Speaker C: That's really cool. And then I guess what really excites you right now as you're seeing others building and play to earn, is there any trends or anything people should be paying attention to beyond what we've already discussed?
00:26:03.390 - 00:26:35.080, Speaker B: There's just an incredible diversity of new games that are coming out from racing games, virtual worlds, there are full MMOs being built, there are kind of strategy games. So yeah, that's the exciting part in that. Once all of these worlds get built out, there's really no shortage of choice for you to choose what kind of adventure you want to be in, what part of group you want to take part of and earn an income at the same.
00:26:37.770 - 00:26:47.770, Speaker C: So what have you noticed beyond the earning income piece really resonates with people about joining YGG or kind of the play to earn movement.
00:26:48.270 - 00:27:32.570, Speaker B: So I think actually a lot of people aren't motivated by the income alone. They like the concept of I'm coming in, investing my time and probably some money, forming a group with like minded people and going on these adventures and then getting rewarded for these adventures. So it's like going on DND with your group, but the money that you earn is actually real. So it's that rather than a pure financial transaction, instead the community aspect is actually stronger and I think that's what makes it sustainable for any game or a community where if you see people having fun with these games before they start earning serious money. I think that game will be more sustainable.
00:27:33.630 - 00:27:46.986, Speaker C: And then we saw Will talk about Loot prior to this talk, curious what you think about how Loot and kind of similar gaming primitives are going to impact play to earn.
00:27:47.098 - 00:28:06.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I really love the experimentation around Loot. I think that the community is trying to figure out what kind of game experience is really going to be built around that. And it's not at a stage yet where YGG can see a game that earns yield that we could invest in. But yeah, I really love the experimentation behind it.
00:28:07.430 - 00:28:12.680, Speaker C: And then so what comes next for YGG? Like, what are you focused on right now?
00:28:13.130 - 00:28:54.370, Speaker B: So we're doing a lot of international scaling. We call it the kind of like Uber for digital asset strategy, where we are going out region per region and creating regional subdos with local community managers who basically know the communities on the ground. And while they're like smaller versions of YGG in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in India, in China, and they're kind of configuring YGG towards the particular tastes of each market. So they may be playing different games, for example, slightly different assets, different kind of nuances in the community and language. And that's how we'll be onboarding millions of people to play to earn.
00:28:54.870 - 00:29:02.100, Speaker C: Very cool. So I wanted to leave time for audience. Q A kartik, are you going to be reading those offer?
00:29:02.870 - 00:29:25.114, Speaker A: Yes. Linda gave it was an awesome chat. We have a lot of questions. We have a whole spectrum of things coming in from the chat. So there's a whole mix of people who are trying to understand what YGG and Fatal Earn is and sort of how NFT and gaming sort of mix and then also already understand the YGG ecosystem. And they have more questions about that. So I'll try to do a whole spectrum of a lot of these questions.
00:29:25.114 - 00:29:43.186, Speaker A: Maybe just to start off, you kind of touched on this a little bit, but could you give a slightly bigger overview on sort of what your community is right now? Like, who are your users? Are they students or adults or people with jobs as well as doing this thing for fun? Like, just a little bit more detail around who they are and how they.
00:29:43.208 - 00:30:35.140, Speaker B: Kind of the demographic base is extremely broad, and I would say it's worldwide and from, I would say, college age to adults. And even we see people 60 plus. For example, my dad is actually playing Axio Infinity and using it as kind of supplement to his pension. So it's very broad. I think 40% to 50% are around Southeast Asia right now, particularly the Philippines, where they started going viral. But yeah, we're seeing a lot of communities go up, even in Latin America, across Africa, and even in places in US or Europe where the community base is smaller. But a lot of them tend to be more like the asset investor type, meaning they're the ones investing in these NFT assets and then lend them out to people from around the world.
00:30:35.750 - 00:30:47.750, Speaker C: I wanted to ask related to that, I know you've talked about your son and how he playing. So can you talk a little bit more about how he got into it? How old is he and kind of what was his experience?
00:30:47.900 - 00:31:15.630, Speaker B: Yeah, right. So my son is twelve years old and he started off playing Axio Infinity two years ago. I actually lent him some axes and he was just playing the game and earning SLP and yeah, that's actually how he started having a crypto portfolio. And he used the SLP to buy the governance token of axie excess when it came out last November and also to buy YGG tokens, the guild, when it went public in July.
00:31:16.930 - 00:31:27.262, Speaker C: And then what does he think of all of like does he understand kind of the broader movement or is it kind of just more like kids playing games? I'm curious.
00:31:27.406 - 00:32:04.080, Speaker B: So interestingly, for kids like him who have never grown up in a world without Internet or even without cryptocurrency, it feels completely normal for them to have digital currency that has value. I don't think a lot of kids his age own crypto, but at the same time it's completely normal for them. There's no concept of what is a real currency and what is not. For him it's just another maybe digital points he's keeping track of, but this one is something that converted to fiat or to offline money. Wow.
00:32:04.850 - 00:32:23.990, Speaker A: Another sort of set of questions are just around understanding how the dow of dows sort of is structured here. So you obviously are a big focus there is on Axie, but could you walk us through sort of how you think about adding or supporting more dows or more games and just kind of what that process is like and sort of how you decide what to prioritize?
00:32:24.570 - 00:33:23.610, Speaker B: Well, this process is still very much, I would say, underway, but if there are regions being formed or if there's a lot of activity for one particular game, we basically create a subdao under it. And we did this for one game, League of Kingdoms, where it has actually as its own token, ygglok, that is owned by the members of that subdao and there is governance. So we set up a snapshot page for Governance and they've passed several proposals. For example, where the yield that was earned by the land, which is in Dai, was converted into CDI so that it would earn more yield on top of that. And then there was also another proposal passed by the subdao so that the yield that they earned in the last few months were actually they bought YGG tokens when it went live. So it's pretty interesting to see how this collective action in these subdaos have their own little kind of sub communities.
00:33:27.550 - 00:34:06.966, Speaker A: There's like a whole thing I'm trying to in a way stop myself from digging into but we'll see how much we can go in. One big question that I have for you is obviously you have a community of thousands of people and not just like members who are on discord or something, just active contributors to this. Let's talk about Tooling. You're managing this at scale. There are so many different pieces here, so many different subcommunities. Could you talk to us about how do you think about Dow Tooling or It's tooling to make your own ecosystem better and sort of what some of the common things are just everything around that. We'll kind of dig into a lot of things from there.
00:34:07.068 - 00:35:20.170, Speaker B: Right? So our approach is we want to start simple and then figure out the bare minimum that we need and kind of just evolve as we go along. We don't want to start with a very complicated piece of Dow tooling and then kind of have to be stuck with it. So that's why we started with Snapshot which is super lightweight and actually we just hired a full time Dao manager who's already done the concept of subdos in another protocol and we're trying to see how does that evolve. So all of the assets are run by Gnosis multisig which is very important part of what we're doing. So if you have your Gnosis you have the ability to create a token and then you can do Snapshot, you can basically get started with a subdao. And what we're building internally is a way to kind of create a gamer profile for the people who are part of our guild, which means we are rewarding NFTs that are not transferable to people who are doing certain actions within the guild. And the non transferable NFT is a very important primitive in our end because it allows people to kind of prove that they did certain actions.
00:35:20.170 - 00:35:27.934, Speaker B: And you can't buy that or trade that off anybody. So now you're creating a rich profile of basically achievements that someone has done.
00:35:27.972 - 00:35:42.840, Speaker C: Inside the guild related to that. There's I think, a lot of builders in the audience. And what feature requests do you have for some of the Dow tools or things that you think are missing in the tooling space that you'd love to see built?
00:35:43.850 - 00:36:49.238, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very good question. I think there's really no concept yet of nested Dows which is what we're doing and just the ability to do that and then the asset management is also a very important thing. So for example, for guilds to be able to really invest in millions of dollars of assets within games, the lending part is actually really important. I have to be able to delegate an asset to another user whether via at the wallet level or at the application level and just trustlessly prove that they're able to use it. They have access to it without being able to run away with that asset. So this is actually still, I would say, the key missing piece that will allow NFT based economies to really grow to potentially trillions of dollars at scale. I have to be able to buy a land or then lease it out to someone and then have rights over that to be able to lend someone my sword and not be afraid that that person disappears forever.
00:36:49.238 - 00:36:54.220, Speaker B: So this is one of the key components that is really not been solved yet.
00:36:54.670 - 00:37:05.518, Speaker C: And is the way that you solve it through a new standard, or can you build on the existing standard and kind of iterate from there? How does that work?
00:37:05.604 - 00:37:58.210, Speaker B: I think the long term solution is to create a new standard that wraps the NFT, ERC, 27, 21 standard, and this adds delegation and permission rights to it. For example, if someone lends me an NFT, I still have to be able to use it in an application context. I have to be able to do smart contract calls with it, but maybe there will be restrictions on what I could do with it. For example, I can't sell it, I can't transfer it to another address, it can only go back to the sender, and maybe I'm streaming a payment to whoever owns it, and when I run out of money, then the NFT goes back to the original owner. So it's still very complex, and I think the hard part of creating a new standard would be actually getting everyone to adopt it, but it absolutely needs to happen long term.
00:37:59.190 - 00:37:59.666, Speaker C: Got it.
00:37:59.688 - 00:38:17.270, Speaker A: And then, Kartik, maybe last question before we move on to the next talk. You obviously started this a couple of years ago, and there's so much that's happened in the past few months alone. If you could do something differently, what would you have done if you were to start YGG this year?
00:38:17.420 - 00:38:53.780, Speaker B: Oh, wow. So we actually started YGG less than a year ago. It's been ten months only, and just so much happened in the last ten months. We didn't foresee, even as one of the biggest fans of YGG, that everything would just begin to take off shortly after we founded it, I think. Shucks I don't have really anything that I wish I do differently, but we've been very fortunate that we actually set up a way to scale this before NFTs. Absolutely. And yeah, like, I have zero regrets there.
00:38:56.310 - 00:39:08.018, Speaker A: Well, Gabby, Linda, thank you so much for that amazing conversation, and I hope everybody's questions got answered. If you have something else that comes up, we'll be able to relay those questions to you, but really appreciate your time and thanks again.
00:39:08.184 - 00:39:11.430, Speaker B: Thank you again, linda Kartik, thanks for having us. Bye.
