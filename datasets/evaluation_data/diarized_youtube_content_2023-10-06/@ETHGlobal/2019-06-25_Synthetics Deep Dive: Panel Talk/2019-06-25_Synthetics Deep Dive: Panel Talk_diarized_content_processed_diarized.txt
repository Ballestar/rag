00:00:00.570 - 00:00:38.294, Speaker A: Just to get a quick take, who has no idea what a synthetic asset is, either in crypto sense or in financial sense in general. Cool. And who is kind of curious about it, heard some things and just wants to learn more. All right, so you're not going to learn everything in the next 25 minutes, but hopefully we're going to get you guys to a place where you're well equipped to understand who are some of the leading projects and be able to ask better questions. So this as a panel so we have some of the leaders working in Synthetics here today. Come up in a second. For those of you guys have never heard the term, I'm going to do just a super quick 32nd level setting, and then maybe they can correct me.
00:00:38.294 - 00:01:17.800, Speaker A: So if we're talking about a share of Berkshire Hathaway, for example, which is an asset that costs somewhere around $100,000, and that's the only unit in which you can buy it that's obviously not accessible to a lot of people. So you could issue a different type of asset that is denominated in some percentage of what Berkshire Hathaway costs. And basically, you can buy a dollar of it or $2 of it or whatever else, which obviously opens the opportunities for people to own something that's backed by the price of Berkshire Hathaway, but accessible at a much larger set of markets and budgets. So that's kind of where we're going to start. That's all I'm going to say. And then I'm going to turn over to the experts. So Kane, Charlie, Elson, you guys, come on up here, please.
00:01:17.800 - 00:01:33.330, Speaker A: Madison, I think, is running late, so unfortunately, I have to start without her. So just to begin, can you super quickly just give us who you are, who you with, what your deal is, everyone?
00:01:33.480 - 00:01:50.950, Speaker B: I'm a partner at Paradigm. We're a crypto investment fund. I spend a lot of time on the early stage side of things and have focused on unintentionally, focused on DeFi and synthetics over the last, like, two or three years pretty closely.
00:01:51.770 - 00:02:11.630, Speaker C: Kane from Synthetics, so we started off as a stablecoin project and kind of evolved as the market evolved and market shifted towards a synthetic asset platform. So we now have a dex that allows you to trade synthetic assets, like synthetic bitcoin synthetic. BNB.
00:02:13.410 - 00:02:29.620, Speaker D: Hey, guys. My name is Allison. I'm one of the co founders of Uma, and basically, we built a decentralized contract platform that lets anybody create synthetic derivatives on pretty much anything using any margin currency they want, and then we're also contributing to decentralized historical research.
00:02:30.630 - 00:02:38.470, Speaker A: Awesome. So, Kane, your company is called Synthetics. So you're probably the best person to correct or add to my definition what is a synthetic.
00:02:38.890 - 00:03:13.814, Speaker C: I thought it was a good definition. In fact, I really like the Berkshire angle as well. We should totally do that. I think accessibility, I mean, that's a bit of an edge case right. Like a single share is $100,000 shares. Not visible but in our view synthetic asset is certainly a synthetic asset on Ethereum which is what we're building on. It's kind of any asset that is tracking the price of an asset that is not on Ethereum or even potentially on Ethereum and allows someone to have exposure to the price of it without actually holding the underlying asset.
00:03:13.882 - 00:03:23.362, Speaker A: Is that what's also known as a derivative? As a synthetic derivative just for all of you guys, where does the line start between a stable coin, a derivative and a synthetic? If there is a line?
00:03:23.496 - 00:03:42.010, Speaker D: A derivative always has somebody. A derivative always has somebody who's long and somebody who's short. So the way I think about a synthetic asset is just take one of those positions, either the long or the short and all the margin and associated obligations with that account and in our case tokenize it for distribution.
00:03:44.110 - 00:03:49.200, Speaker A: Does the synthetic asset always have to be collateralized? Is that a feature of it?
00:03:50.850 - 00:05:32.366, Speaker B: It's kind of a deep topic but I would say so far today we've been able to build pretty interesting things with fully collateralized protocols and I actually think we're still very early in understanding how far you can push that. Some of the team at Maker and others have put some really interesting work out on sort of like what being fully collateralized means in an abstract sense like how far can you push this? Can you share liquidity between different synthetics through a clearinghouse like Maker? Does it make more sense to structure them as independent ones? I think practically as of today we have 500 projects working on identity on Ethereum and none that work at all. And so it's probably going to be a long time before we have the ability to assign any kind of credit risk on an individual level. So for anyone, for any users that are using synthetic asset protocols today I expect they'll remain fully collateralized for the most part on at least one think. And before we get to the point where we have actual credit in the ecosystem you'll probably see people issuing credit to DAOs like Maker or others where they have some notion of identity and a shelling point around them meaning concisely. If you were to offer to sell me a bond day as an anonymous Ethereum person there's no way I would buy it because there's no way I would underwrite your credit risk. If MakerDAO as a community were to say we're going to issue bonds in the form of a token right now, I would probably purchase it like I would be able to assign some credit risk to it.
00:05:32.366 - 00:05:45.502, Speaker B: So like TLDR uncollateralized synthetics or unclateralized derivatives are probably I bet they get issued by Dows and credit starts with organizations instead of individuals.
00:05:45.646 - 00:05:58.166, Speaker A: So you talk about users, you guys both run user facing platforms. Who are the users of synthetics today and who do you want the users of synthetics to be in the near term? Who is the platform accessible to?
00:05:58.348 - 00:06:09.494, Speaker C: So for us, as I said, we started out as a stablecoin project, and you can see my shirt kind of funny, but Tether is kind of like a synthetic asset.
00:06:09.542 - 00:06:10.730, Speaker A: How do you feel about Tether?
00:06:14.830 - 00:07:20.078, Speaker C: I think the issue you have is there's kind of two sides to this, right? There's credit risk, there's counterparty risk. Who or what is providing the value, right? And then you've got this other aspect, which is where is this price feed or where is the mechanism coming from that's determining the price? Is it an auction mechanism? An open market? Has it been traded? Is it an oracle? Which I think most of the cool stuff happening at the moment is around this Oracle problem. We have the oracle problem. A lot of people have it, and it's something that I think needs to be solved. But you've got these a few different components that kind of come together to give you an asset on Ethereum. As an example, like synthetic bitcoin, and to kind of contrast that with wrapped bitcoin, which is another bitcoin implementation. One of them uses bitcoin in custody for BitGo and some various other components to give people price exposure to bitcoin on ethereum, which is a nice thing to have because you don't need to leave the ethereum ecosystem and you can get exposure to the bitcoin price.
00:07:20.078 - 00:07:56.758, Speaker C: With us, we use an Oracle to get the same kind of price exposure without actually having custody. And those are kind of two different approaches. But you need those three things, right, to kind of get this thing. But to come back to your question of who's using it, I think right now and for the foreseeable future, speculation is still the main use case. And so for us, we've kind of gone into crypto synthetic assets. So, like inverse indices of bitcoin, E and B and B as well as long tokens. So people want to be able to trade that kind of thing because it's speculation.
00:07:56.758 - 00:08:11.230, Speaker C: And that, I think, in the short term, is where we're going to see the most activity. But things like equities being able to hold Apple shares or Tesla shares or Berkshire shares on Ethereum are really cool. But I don't know if we're quite there yet for users coming into that.
00:08:11.300 - 00:08:22.686, Speaker A: Cool. So I want to come back to Oracle problem because I think it's fascinating and maybe explain it to the audience a little bit. But before that, Allison, do you agree and how do you see the use cases, maybe geographically and demographically?
00:08:22.798 - 00:09:26.570, Speaker D: Sure. So we think of ourselves as being a B, two B to C platform. Our ultimate success depends on end users actually finding utility from our protocol existing. But currently the level of financial sophistication that's required to interact with our protocol is somewhat high, right? Like even a really simple financial derivative carries some risk. And it's not quite a system where we feel like it would be in the community's best interest to be literally completely permissionless right now without further education. So right now the users of our system are basically financially sophisticated, like funds, market makers, other liquidity providers that want to create some sort of financial derivative that now find it easier to do so using our infrastructure. And ultimately they're the ones that are meeting real end user needs, which, as Kane mentioned, given the current kind of user base in crypto, typically centers around speculation and volatility.
00:09:26.570 - 00:09:47.680, Speaker D: But I definitely think that kind of longer run if we really want to get kind of broader adoption, mainstream adoption, it's not going to be through these mega volatile assets, but really rather through genuinely stable, censorship resistant yielding store value and other sound investment products.
00:09:48.210 - 00:10:35.070, Speaker B: I'll give a controversial response to that. I would say I agree with that in the long term. However, today what is working looks a lot more like gambling than building normal financial products. And there are some interesting the specifics of what we're required to do today do give a pretty good intuition for why that might be the case. So let's think about people have built option protocols on top of Ethereum today and none of them, there are no options on top of Ethereum today. There are option protocols, but there are no options. And why is that? For the most part, people don't really care about these types of products where the payoff bounds relative to the fact that you have to fully collateralize these things.
00:10:35.070 - 00:11:07.580, Speaker B: No one really cares, no one's really take on the opportunity cost, no one wants the premiums, they're so small. Arthur Hayes wants to build knockout barrier options for Ethereum, which are basically just gambling. It's the equivalent of Ether is at $200. I'll setting a knockout barrier at 1000 at 5% today. So I'll give you a 20 x payout on one Ether for a 5% premium if it breaks $1,000 in the next year. That's like a gambling contract. It's not like a normal financial product.
00:11:08.190 - 00:11:08.934, Speaker C: It's hedging.
00:11:08.982 - 00:11:43.246, Speaker B: It is hedging. The point I would just make is for better or for worse, both in terms of what users want and just structurally how much inefficiency there is to the actual transaction costs in the system, not having access to credit literal transaction costs on top of Ethereum, like how frequently people want to be transacting in these markets and how efficient they can be. Clearly the market is pushing us towards lotteries at this point, like those kinds of products, and I would expect that those are the things that work in the near term.
00:11:43.438 - 00:12:13.578, Speaker A: Got it. So I want to come back to another huge potential inefficiency another problem in the space called the Oracle problem. So just to get everybody in the room on the same page. So let's say that Keynes company synthetics, they have an asset that is mapped to gold. So essentially they collateralize something. And one unit of that, I think they call it synths, one synth is essentially equivalent to one unit of gold. Somehow they have to get the price of what gold is in the commodities market, and usually that or metals market, and that will come from an Oracle.
00:12:13.578 - 00:12:43.190, Speaker A: So another company could pop by and also have a synthetic asset that also represents gold, and they could collateralize it similarly or differently, but they'll have to do it equivalently, presumably, but they might use a different price Oracle. There might be web network latency issues. So the actual price of these synths might not be the same across every synthetics provider in the world. So to turn that over to you guys, how is that problem playing out right now? What are some of the solutions? Is that something where you think developers should focus their attention?
00:12:43.530 - 00:13:13.134, Speaker B: I'll give a super quick. Different synthetics issued by different issuers with different characteristics should trade at different prices, even with the same price Oracle. If you are going to underwrite different levels of credit risk to different issuers, for example, a maker and a maker competitor, clearly Dai and Dai competitor version should trade at different prices. And the Oracle component is like, in our opinion, just a crypto specific example of credit risk or the types of things you normally underwrite.
00:13:13.182 - 00:13:53.774, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I'm going to back up and kind of frame the Oracle problem again. So I actually see it as kind of two problems. One is literally defining the data set and getting it securely from wherever it currently lives onto the blockchain in a usable format that smart contracts can interact with. And the other is really around recourse, upgrades, arbitration, et cetera. So if you think about kind of like your traditional financial world, derivatives exist. All those derivatives also need Oracles from the fiat world. And basically what happens is that generally speaking, people find themselves able to come to an agreement either through natural language or some standardization that's happened over the years.
00:13:53.774 - 00:15:18.520, Speaker D: But they also know that if there's a disagreement, they can go sue each other. And that's actually kind of what makes financial products historically really hard to transcend geographical borders and the paperwork and all that other stuff that's required makes it really hard to kind of serve slightly down, slightly lower on the financial pyramid. So if we take all this stuff into kind of the blockchain space, lots of solutions currently exist for how to, how or are in the works, for how you create fault tolerant, safe, secure ways of getting data from point A onto the blockchain. But I see kind of the problem that needs more solving and what we're working on at uma, around arbitration and recourse. So we kind of think of it as fundamentally any Oracle that you build, no matter how robust or well designed or whatever it is there's probably some configuration of the world in which it can actually either become corrupted or just no longer relevant. And so the system that we've built is basically like a system that uses economic incentives to ensure that any corruption that you've tried to engage in on an Oracle will actually be economically unprofitable if you buy into our recourse system.
00:15:20.170 - 00:16:27.294, Speaker C: So I'll just step one step back from that and say I think fundamentally the issue is you have the real world and then you have this trustless world or what should be trustless and you're trying to join them together. Right? And it's a question of the trade offs between how much do I as a user of this system want to trust where this data is coming from the Oracle and so you can have mechanisms where there's arbitration and recourse and all those sorts of things but ultimately what we really want is a trustless Oracle, right? Because that's where you're kind of breaking the system, you're putting these assets into a trustless environment but then there's this thread of trustfulness that kind of connects back into the real world and it's a hard problem, there's a lot of people working on it. I know Hayden's working on some stuff for crypto assets chainlink is working on different mechanisms, you guys are working on it. For us it's not a problem that we are trying to solve directly. We've kind of just put up our hands and said we've got a proprietary Oracle. It is trustful right now. It allows the system to work.
00:16:27.294 - 00:16:44.500, Speaker C: The system is very experimental, it's small scale and we're working as quickly as we can to kind of move away and sort of edge away from that trustfulness. But that's the fundamental issue. We want a fully trustless system that's self contained and that's a hard thing to do when you need information from real world.
00:16:45.350 - 00:16:52.834, Speaker A: I was going to just follow up directly. Do you think there's a sort of an arms race that's going to happen for who is going to be the decentralized Oracle?
00:16:52.882 - 00:16:53.366, Speaker B: I hope so.
00:16:53.388 - 00:16:53.682, Speaker A: Choice?
00:16:53.746 - 00:16:56.220, Speaker C: I hope so. Keep working on it.
00:16:57.870 - 00:18:14.578, Speaker B: I think there's like a fairly decent chance that there's no optimal design for this that it's in the same category of problems as incentive compatible identity which is very probably just not attractable problem, it's more of a heuristic solution problem and people will continue to pick the best available option for them at the time. So if you look at Auger seems like reasonably okay as a very good, it probably works on a pretty low resolution or low tick frequency timescale as an Oracle yet to see anything that's not at least somewhat trusted that pushes it towards what we want as a general decentralized Oracle. Now that being said, even if it's not possible maker exists today and it works, we have a clear path here of this is not the hill we need to die on. In trying to build these products. And if in five years we get to the point where we have the arms race and we've been trying to create a perpetual motion machine, would that be the end of the world? No, probably not. All this stuff would still work. It'd be a little heuristic and annoying, but it would still work and not say that we shouldn't attempt it.
00:18:14.578 - 00:18:20.370, Speaker B: But just like, I do not view this as like, if we don't figure this out, none of this matters.
00:18:21.990 - 00:18:47.660, Speaker D: I guess the way that I kind of think about it is that a fully trustless, decentralized Oracle matters only if it's being used for something. And even though we all say, like, we all have the Oracle problem, all of our contracts meet an Oracle, it's kind of like most projects are focused on delivering product to meet end user cases first and then going back and figuring out more robust Oracle solutions, more decentralized Oracle solutions for it later.
00:18:48.350 - 00:19:21.826, Speaker A: So for those of us in the room that are interested in sort of how crypto will affect global financial systems and flows, if synthetics, because they're so open potentially to everyone, they could actually become higher in volume than a lot of the underlying assets that they're derived from. So if you have more synthetic gold trading all over the world globally, than you have gold, are you giving the ability to traders of those synthetic assets to actually affect the price of the underlying commodities? So if all the synthetic traders short gold synths, is the price of gold possibly going to drop?
00:19:21.858 - 00:20:16.006, Speaker C: I mean, you already have that, right? That's it. That is the reality we live in, right? So I guess the question is, do we want to transplant that reality where synthetic versions of gold futures, et cetera, are traded in an open market? And we're kind of seeing this interesting thing at the moment. We've got a trading competition where people are trading and they're trading on ethereum. So everyone who's in this competition can see all the positions of everyone else, right? And they're using that information to kind of see where is the market going, like, what's happening. And that kind of transparency, I think is really powerful. And the fact that you don't have a central clearinghouse or need for arbitration, et cetera. Obviously there's trade offs, but I think a marketplace where it is much more open and transparent, what's going on will be very powerful because that's the status quo.
00:20:16.198 - 00:20:50.900, Speaker B: I give two answers on this. The first would be, yes, absolutely. Synthetic markets impact physical markets. Like, look at BitMEX or gold or silver or whatever. Like pick a market and weather futures. You don't actually affect the weather, but whatever, of course that's going to happen. And I think the crypto part of it is an interesting argument because the reason the amount that these synthetic markets unduly or the amount they influence these physical markets, not entirely, but largely is about the inherent transaction costs to the physical markets themselves.
00:20:50.900 - 00:21:45.158, Speaker B: And so it's like, why would I take out a synthetic dollar yen loan as a Japanese company as opposed to actually going to access US credit markets like dollar terms? Transaction costs largely. Same thing with physical gold trading. The fact that in the US equities have this regulatory mode on settlement, that sucks. That's why generally the size of synthetics on any given market is related to the transaction costs underlying the actual market and how much inefficiency there is in them because of that, that is a problem, but whatever, it's one that's always existed. So in this case, I made two points here. Crypto is interesting because the underlying assets, when they are actually crypto native, have substantively lower transaction costs from a market efficiency perspective than any physical markets do. And so you should see that effect less in crypto markets than you do in traditional markets for the most part.
00:21:45.158 - 00:22:25.730, Speaker B: And then two, it's pretty clear, I think, at this point that this is the way that we get to scale an integration with traditional markets. I think it is far, far more likely that the graveyard of securitizing, traditional equities protocols, whatever things. Then in five years from now we look back on that as the graveyard and say like, oh well, the way that we actually started influencing traditional markets were synthetics on like Oblivion Real Estate Index. That is totally just people wanting to put on risk positions without needing to deal with any of this legacy stuff and all of the headaches that entail.
00:22:27.110 - 00:23:21.970, Speaker D: It also just kind of comes down to use cases. So in your traditional fiat world, most major institutions can access any number of derivatives for the underlying spot markets. And yet you do actually see arbitrage opportunities exist and continue to exist for some period of time either. Because even in the crypto world, sure, transaction costs are lower, but there is still some cost integration and maintenance and the development of the code and the testing of the code and all these other things, and the hope. The goal, of course, is for all of that too, with open innovation, be able to escalate really quickly towards robust solutions, but creating an index that just automatically replicates 100 different tokens, 25 of whom are on their own blockchains. Another 25 that are like staking tokens that have different staking protocols and requirements that'd be way more convenient than literally going out there and doing that with 100 underliers.
00:23:22.390 - 00:23:35.880, Speaker A: Cool. So before we wrap up, one last final question. You guys have been very helpful explaining synthetics to us. How can we be helpful to you? Who are you trying to hire? Fire fund build? What is your priority and how do people get in touch with you?
00:23:37.130 - 00:24:39.722, Speaker B: I'll just give an answer on something I'd like to see built then. Sure. Right now you have a bunch of protocols that are coming out where I think the best example of this are, like, zero X bundles and then token sets where you can create an equivalent product on both of them, but we don't actually have a language by which to express their equivalent today or to prove it. You could say the same thing of dYdX option protocols versus we can go spin up one right now, maker and die versus a competitor, whatever. Basically, I think the coolest protocol that someone could build in DFI in the next ten years would be like, a language by which to express the equivalencies between different products. And then you can imagine something like, I forget the name, but the thing where you can do, like, flash lending on Ethereum today, where you can essentially do provable arbitrage and then we can all just throw money into a bank that's like, all right, we're only going to fund trades that over some time period have these risk parameters. I think that'd be super cool.
00:24:39.776 - 00:24:40.282, Speaker A: Cool.
00:24:40.416 - 00:24:56.162, Speaker C: Kane yeah, for us, I mean, we're live, right? So you can come and use synthetics exchange to buy some synthetic bitcoin or forex or gold or whatever. So, yeah, come and use the platform, give us feedback, come into discord, complain about stuff.
00:24:56.296 - 00:24:57.026, Speaker A: We will.
00:24:57.128 - 00:24:57.922, Speaker C: All the fun stuff.
00:24:57.976 - 00:25:22.680, Speaker D: Allison for us, we're hiring in New York and Hong Kong developers in DD, and a lot of what we're trying to do is really just think about ways to grow the pie. So we're sponsoring a prize around who's going to hack the project with open financial innovation using blockchain protocols. On the next thing that's going to get more ace locked up in Docs. In so curious to hear what all of your ideas are.
00:25:23.050 - 00:25:24.194, Speaker B: All right, thank the panelists.
00:25:24.242 - 00:25:24.900, Speaker A: Thank you guys very much.
