00:00:00.090 - 00:00:26.920, Speaker A: I've seen a number of projects doing kind of like verifiable credentials for learning specifically. Right. So you have some sort of an online academy or decentralized kind of learning program where people can present work that they've done and other people can come and validate those projects. And then the people who did the work receive an NFT in their wallet or a Poop style kind of proof of work or proof of knowledge. These projects really excite me because I think we you can build a decentralized education system.
