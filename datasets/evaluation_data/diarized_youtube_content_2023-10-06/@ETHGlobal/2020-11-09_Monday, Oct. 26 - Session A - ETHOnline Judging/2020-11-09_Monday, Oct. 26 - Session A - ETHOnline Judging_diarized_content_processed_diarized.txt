00:00:00.330 - 00:00:36.210, Speaker A: Hello. So welcome. Welcome to the Monday, the last day of judging for ETH Online. It's been an incredible month already. We've had 700 hackers from more than 65 countries and 19 time zones join the event. We had more than a thousand applications for this, making it our largest online hat fund ever by a large margin. We've had 175 projects so far submitted for the event, and we're going to see probably another 50 in total today from across all the different rooms.
00:00:36.210 - 00:01:10.642, Speaker A: Quick notes about the format we're using today. So, as all the hackers know, you have a demo video that you've submitted, and the max time for that video is four minutes. And then after that, you have four minutes for Q A with the judging panel. So the way this will work is when we start your video, I'll be running a timer, and I will send messages to the chat as that time ticks down. Once you're into the Q A, and then we'll wrap. At the end of eight minutes, we will be taking a break partway through. So, judges, you can let me know if you want to take a break at a certain point.
00:01:10.642 - 00:01:41.878, Speaker A: Otherwise I'll just pick an arbitrary point. Towards the middle of the session, we'll take a little rest for coffee refills. So criteria, the judges have just finished a briefing, and all of our judges are very experienced from our hackathon, so they know this very well. But the criteria that the judges will be looking at today cover five different domains. One is kind of the technical strength of your hack. Another is the originality. Is this a new idea that we're seeing? Another is practicality UIUX.
00:01:41.878 - 00:02:13.510, Speaker A: And finally, wow factor to kind of know is this really impressive, this really a special hack know there's something about it that's not covered by these other categories. So that's what the judges will be looking for today. I want to emphasize that this is not a competition. Of course, we have prizes, and there will be finalists. But at eight global events, we really want to emphasize always that people are here to learn. Not everyone is here to launch a company and launch a product. Sometimes hacking is just for fun or just to experiment with an idea.
00:02:13.510 - 00:03:44.330, Speaker A: So at the end of the day, we want you to get valuable feedback and support from the judges to have them help you understand what you can do next, whether it's working on this project or something else in the ethereum space. And our judges today who are joining us, we have Spencer Noon from DTCC, mintel from Consensus, and Joyce from Global Coin Research. So thank you, all three of you so much for being part of this today. I really appreciate you giving up your time to talk to all of our hackers and hear about what they've been working on for the last three weeks. Okay, so let's jump into our first demo so the first hack we're going to see is sorry, I'm pulling up the window, I believe it is Squad Chess and we've got Jesse and Ezra. I'll let you take it away and play your demo. Hello and welcome to our Ethanline Hackathon presentation for Squad Games, a network for user generated video game mods.
00:03:44.330 - 00:04:43.550, Speaker A: We think that games should be designed by their players and there are examples of this being powerful in the past we think support that. Our approach to building this is to borrow the innovation engine of YouTube and other internet products and apply it to games. So we're letting users contribute things, maps, modes, arts, any kind of mod and letting them earn when their contributions do well and letting players choose between sets of contributions when they play that define their experience of the game. There's three core pieces of this engine. One is that anyone can add a contribution. The second is that we're trying to align incentives so that creators and players are incentivized to create and use contributions they think are going to be popular and lastly, effective curation. So we want to use market data to help players find the ways they'll most enjoy playing.
00:04:43.550 - 00:05:38.858, Speaker A: For this hackathon we focused on a pattern we're calling a constant purchase price with dynamic backing. This works by letting people buy a license for a constant price but backing that license using a dynamic amount of an asset on a bonding curve. The reason that we did this was because having a constant price we think provides a good user experience. People want to pay the same thing for the same results but it also provides a nice incentive. Licenses can be sold, the value goes up with supply so there is an incentive to discover underused contributions and bring them to light. There are a few flows that are important. One is the user that can send the constant purchase price to a controller smart contract which will mint backing tokens lock those in an NFT license which it gives back to the user.
00:05:38.858 - 00:06:52.634, Speaker A: They use that to play the game. Another one is the contributor that is adding a new contribution and setting the fee they're going to get every time a user buys a license for that contribution. Now we'll go into a demo of Squad Chess. So in this demo I'm going to quickly on fast speed go through creating a new contribution for a format of chess, changing a few pieces and setting the purchase price and contributor fee and then we will see that created in the game and buy a license for it. And then we'll do a quick demo of a live game played against myself. Hopefully that went well. What we're looking at next for this project is a season zero experiment for Squad Chess which will be a competition and long term we do want to keep building this so trying to gather community and resources.
00:06:52.634 - 00:07:22.840, Speaker A: So please join us on discord if you're interested. Lastly, thank you for listening to our presentation. Thanks Osmo and Jesse, over to the judges for questions and comments. That demo went a little fast for me. Can you just describe quickly what you did there during the demo? Yeah, absolutely. So I'm allowed to talk now? Yes. Video off.
00:07:22.840 - 00:07:36.266, Speaker A: Sorry, I don't know what the rules are. Oh yeah, please open your videos. That'd be great. Okay. But of course, up to your own? Yeah, I'm happy to. I just wasn't sure whether maybe it was like you don't want to judge people on how they look or something. Yeah.
00:07:36.266 - 00:08:20.186, Speaker A: So what we did in the demo was create a new contribution. So in the case of chess, that means basically like a new starting board and starting position with whatever pieces you choose. So we created that, and that includes setting how much you want it to cost and how much of a fee the creator wants to charge. So submitted that, then I bought that contribution, which means buying a license to let you play, basically. And then I played a game against myself using that new format that I'd created. So you bought the license from who? From the system. It's an automated got it.
00:08:20.186 - 00:08:48.830, Speaker A: And that's the constant price. Right. So in this case, I think I chose ten of our token that we deployed just for this ten tokens to buy a license. What that does is I pay ten tokens to the controller contract. The controller is going to take those ten tokens, which is always ten, for that contribution, and buy whatever amount that buys out of a bonding curve. So that's going to change over time. It could be more, it could be fewer.
00:08:48.830 - 00:09:20.094, Speaker A: It's then going to use whatever amount it buys from the bonding curve to lock into an NFT. And that NFT is going to be given back to me and is my license. That's what the game is checking to give me permission to play using that format. Sorry, I'm probably a little slow. So what is the controller buying? Maybe I should I don't go back to the slide that you showed us. Yeah, I don't have the users and the controller. I don't know if I want to waste the time.
00:09:20.094 - 00:09:58.166, Speaker A: Maybe I could just get that part of the video. Yeah. Here. Okay, so I'll share this again and then we can look at it. Yeah, I think while you're doing that, there's a bonding curve factory that mints a new bonding curve for every contribution and that acts as an automated market maker for those tokens to get locked in the NFT license. Yeah. Cool.
00:09:58.166 - 00:10:31.380, Speaker A: Let's use examples guys, if you don't mind. I think that'll be really quick. Even the chess example, right? Like what's a mod? Yeah. So in the case with chess, it's a new starting position for chess. So whatever shape board and whatever pieces you want in whatever positions, and that's the position that people are going to start in could be kind of anything else. That's just what it is for chess, pretty simple. So you create a new one of those and you've basically created a new chess game, a new way of playing chess, and now people can buy a license that gives them permission to use it.
00:10:31.380 - 00:11:28.046, Speaker A: And the way that works is they pay whatever the price is. It's a constant price that goes into the controller. The controller is going to use that amount that they paid in to buy out of the bonding curve that's specific to that contribution. That's where it's not constant, because the amount of that bonding curve token you're going to get for that constant price depends on the supply of the bonding curve token. And whatever amount it gets back of the bonding curve token, it's going to lock into a license, which it gives back to you. And the effect that that has is, let's say that my ten die gets me a license that has five bonding curve tokens locked into it, and then a week from now, the bonding curve token price has gone up a lot because the supply has gone up. I can actually now redeem and sell the tokens in my license.
00:11:28.046 - 00:12:29.910, Speaker A: So I could basically burn the NFT, get back the bonding curve tokens, then sell those back to the curve to get back die. And I would get back more basically, if the contribution had become more popular, even though everybody's buying it for the same constant price. Hopefully that's a decent explanation. So basically it lets you have an effect where the purchaser is always paying the same price, but you're still getting some of the incentives of it being treated like an investment. So the way you thought about creating this game originally with chess was that instead of kind of starting off with the kind of the black versus white chess pieces in their original traditional places, you want to start it off with the pieces actually being set anywhere we want. And that's how you start the game with sure, yeah, chess is an arbitrary example. You could do this with any game, actually any kind of software.
00:12:29.910 - 00:13:07.778, Speaker A: The reason we chose to do this kind of thing at all is because we have seen in games, and I think we all have this experience like making up our own house rules to play basketball with our friends or something, that people like coming up with their own rules. And this is kind of how games get innovated and there's a lot of value created there and that value is kind of locked out of the existing video game industry and a lot of other things too. But we saw the opportunity to do something cool with video games. Great. Thanks, Ezra. And thanks, Jesse. That's a lot of time we have for Q A, so we'll have to move on to the next hack.
00:13:07.778 - 00:13:21.558, Speaker A: But thanks for your presentation. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay, our next presentation is from Fund, my musician.
00:13:21.558 - 00:14:03.950, Speaker A: I think we've got you on the call now so you can go ahead and share your demo. Okay. Hi everyone. My name is Son and I'm a full stack developer. I built this decentral app called Farmite Musicians where fans can donate tokens to their favorite musicians. So right now, many musicians are struggling to make money because of the pandemic. They do not have the budgets to promote their music or they doc marketing skills.
00:14:03.950 - 00:14:50.830, Speaker A: And fans do not know how to send money to their favorite position to support them. So the solution I came up with is to build a DAP app where fans can purchase ERC 20 called FFM which is like a token currency. And fans can support their favorite musicians by donating token. And musicians can upload their music for fans to see. And fans can sell this token for funds. So in the future I will work. I will create features where fans can earn this token by sharing the links to the musician's music or sign up for the newsletter.
00:14:50.830 - 00:16:22.570, Speaker A: And I will implement Gas Station network to cover the gas fees, especially when fans are donating tokens to the musicians. And musicians can use these tokens to promote their music on newsletter and also create a feature where fans can buy this token with Bitcoin, Dow or other cryptocurrency instead of using Ethereum. And the technology I use for this project is Public Gateway where I deploy my contract to the deposit button and my tokens fire ERC 220 standards. And on the front end I use React and I store the musicians data on Firebase and I use an Eddie to create smart contract. Now it's time for the demo. So here's the home page of the app. And let's say if you're a user and you want to buy tokens, you could click on this link and then it's your information and you could buy say 1000 tokens and then it costs three if and click on purchase and then you confirm and now you have 1000 FMM.
00:16:22.570 - 00:17:00.550, Speaker A: And now you can click on Musician to see a list of Musician. And let's say you want to support buy in. So you can click on this page and click on there will be the tag in the Musician and click on the tokens. Let's say you want to give him 100 tokens. You click on send and then confirm. And now you gave him 500 tokens. And let's say if you like his work, then you can click on like button and then it costs like one token and you click on Confirm.
00:17:00.550 - 00:17:29.060, Speaker A: Now has the likes and then the more likes he has, then we will put the music on the top page of this on the Nissan Musicians. You see he got put in the top. Before it was Steve Baldo. Now it's Brian Ogan, and that's it. Thank you for watching. See you next time. That's all I got.
00:17:29.060 - 00:18:18.242, Speaker A: Yeah, this is cool. I wanted to ask, why did you think of using Tokens instead of I guess in the US. You see a lot of platforms like Patreon that funds musicians without Tokens. What's the thought behind using can? Like maybe musicians, they can use Tokens to promote their music. So we will have a newsletter where we will put their music and then send email to all the bands that sign up on our newsletter. Yeah, maybe follow on Joyce's question. This is super cool.
00:18:18.242 - 00:19:43.482, Speaker A: Reminds me of a project that launched last week, Audience, which you should definitely but presumably also you had an FMM Token as opposed to just using straight like Bitcoin or Ethereum or Dai because you have some additional functionality that you plan to utilize with the Token. So what other features, such as the newsletter do you think can be enabled by the FMM Token? Our features. How do you combine the Token and the newsletter and help have the newsletter help promote the Token, I guess. Is that what you meant? Yeah, maybe like, you know, have any obviously there's a time limit with the project, but did you sort of look into maybe using NFTs for collectibles or loyalty? I was thinking about using the non fungible Token, but I didn't have time and I didn't have that much experience. But that's something I will do in the future. Cool. How long have you been building on Solidity? And just as an engineer, I already know it for like one month or about two months.
00:19:43.482 - 00:20:07.410, Speaker A: Yeah. That's cool. Welcome. Yeah, thank you. What was the most fun part about building this project? Just learning contracts and then deploy to the blockchain. That was pretty cool. I learned it during when I built this project, I learned how to deploy.
00:20:07.410 - 00:20:37.098, Speaker A: Got it. That's really cool. Why music? I guess. Why did you feel like this was a need in the industry? During the pandemic. There's not that much. There's like street performers. Usually they have people around to donate and then ever since the Pandemic hit, there's not much people outside.
00:20:37.098 - 00:21:19.354, Speaker A: So main musicians, they don't have any crowds or any fans to give money or to perform. It may be hard for them to make money. And I was trying to help them out. Maybe made this platform where fans can donate some finance or cryptocurrencies or money to them to support them. Yeah, that makes sense. Are you thinking about continuing with the project? Yeah, I'll try to make it better. Okay, well, thank you so much.
00:21:19.354 - 00:21:35.918, Speaker A: Thanks for being part of ETH online. It's awesome to see people who are relatively new to Solidity build something in only a few weeks. Thanks so much. Thanks for the demo. Nice job. Yeah, thank you. Okay, moving on to our next demo.
00:21:35.918 - 00:21:53.800, Speaker A: The next team up is RPC network. And I understand that. I think they're going to respond to questions in Mandarin. And Joyce, you're going to translate where possible. Min is here too. Min speaks Chinese. Great.
00:21:53.800 - 00:22:46.020, Speaker A: That's awesome. All right. Hello, RPC network. Please go ahead and play your demo for us. Am I supposed to translate that? No. Right, the demo? No, just like if you want me to give them instructions or translate anything that you're maybe, maybe. Go ahead.
00:22:46.020 - 00:23:38.100, Speaker A: Is it Eric? If you want to play your demo. What's his name? Eric. I have Eric ma looks like Erica demo. Yuma. What is the show? He said he thought you guys were the one demoing for him. So he's pulling it up now, I think. Okay.
00:23:38.100 - 00:24:49.962, Speaker A: Josh, do you happen to have the demo too? Or you're expecting them to demo? I can play it if he can't. Okay. Jacob, do you want to do it? Yeah, why not? Okay. Eric tamishana Georgia casual bonie jack shalaya bonnie it. Sorry, I feel like I don't have the audio driver installed. Of course it let me know you can hear this. Decentralized node service.
00:24:49.962 - 00:26:01.590, Speaker A: According to the DVP, two P to fund the node. This will reduce network node. And if you run the phone node with open RTC, you will get the rewards. Second, we will bring post consensus need to be introduced to detect whether the node is running. It will server DAP under room other than big chin. Okay, let's run node. First, I will run this commander data.
00:26:01.590 - 00:27:06.480, Speaker A: It will filter network ups nodes. It will use DBP to P funder nodes. Then it dial. This is my fundet node. Let me see. Respond order calibrate node. I will die node with deport APPSY point.
00:27:06.480 - 00:28:17.950, Speaker A: This is I find a node. URL arling chi arsoudia argu sandy and yoshi you. It let me wet a well, this time the nose is important. Okay. It's. It have not whether in it. Thank you.
00:28:17.950 - 00:29:13.170, Speaker A: Great. Thank you. So we'll turn over to the judges for questions and comments. No shankishba Ninjaga took a project. Infrared API should be a to him. Father the whole wash for your RPC area. Five joy the children.
00:29:13.170 - 00:30:37.252, Speaker A: So quick translation. I asked him why. What's the thought behind that project, the reason why he's building this project. He says consensus API is centralized and he wants to maintain a way to kind of distribute rewards and kind of enhance the distributed attributes, I guess, of the ecosystem. And he said that the east 2.0 beacon chain requires that it needs to be connected to the east 1.0 node.
00:30:37.252 - 00:34:25.250, Speaker A: So then this is a way to enable that folks get rewarded by using the RPC network. Should I speak in Mandarin or English? You should speak Mandarin. I mean, definitely please speak Mandarin so I know how to do the translation. Me das one mike sway swiss network dancia turning a function tahoe shipuyanda was Shrio donate Fuji and what do you call and shua duga january and sharp and change and you can be you hatesiani I asked oh double tune wash these PP where me to me how can I ask who their target clients are? And I think they said they were going after a similar market as Polka Dot, but with clients who preferred something more decentralized. Joyce did I get that largely right RPC network reward many target RPC your kay to you the fajo yeah ping tie doshi cho xian shan wish male tuang tu guang chi lama you a candidian drum without chan drum during jiang EMA so you sure you don't teacher don't be here and India don't kai don't be so young. I asked him whether he's wanting to see if there's a kind of need in the Asian market or the kind of the global market. But he's saying that generally a lot of centralized nodes don't really get rewards.
00:34:25.250 - 00:35:11.810, Speaker A: This is the way for for folks to participate in notes and make rewards. That is all the time we have for Q and A. Okay, thank you so much for being part of this online and for submitting your hack. Juju runtime ethereum. Yeshua. Shit. Belgian hama.
00:35:11.810 - 00:36:07.764, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks. Okay, bye bye. You okay? So the next project is Kotanipay. So, Steve, I think you're on the call. Ready? Please go ahead and play your demo for us. Steve.
00:36:07.764 - 00:37:06.100, Speaker A: There's supposed to be audio. I don't believe it's coming through. Is there audio with the video? No. Can we put the pre recorded right? Is there audio in the video? You might have to stop sharing and then make sure you click the button that says Share our screen audio. Okay. Can you press stop shafin? That says Share computer sound. You want to make sure that's checked and then we can hear the audio from your video.
00:37:06.100 - 00:38:39.582, Speaker A: A middleware technology connecting USSD applications to the blockchain. Over 770,000,000 Africans registered in mobile network services. 440,000,000 are connected to each, while blockchain applications are built with smartphone users in mind. USSP is the primary interface for feature phone users in the developing world. It has the following advantages there's no need for application installation, there's no need for Internet access, and it is simple to use. So what is Kotanipay? Kotanipay is a technology stack that utilizes USSC technology to enable blockchain protocols, dubs and blockchain fintech companies to integrate seamlessly to local payment channels, providing a reliable onram and offram service to the wide customer base. The current version of Protanypay is integrated to the seller blockchain.
00:38:39.582 - 00:39:28.830, Speaker A: It allows for seller to seller transfers, seller to local currency, withdrawals, local currency to seller deposits, with SMS notification, with URLs to view and chain transactions, and a quotani pay. DeFi network. The Kotani DeFi network promotes financial inclusion by giving users access to a range of financial services. It is a decentralized mobile money service owned by Kotanipay wallet users and agents. It provides several advantages, including one, a low cost of transactions as users move value between crypto and fiat currency. Two efficiency DeFi lending pools and under collateralized loaning companies in Africa can benefit from a frictionless interaction on our platform. Three interoperability to various local payment gateways, for example Safarica and Various.
00:39:28.830 - 00:40:19.498, Speaker A: The DeFi network has the following features one, an automated market maker algorithm that controls swaps on the liquidity pool. Pays reserves are exchanged for liquidity pools based on smart contracts. Two, synthetic representations of fiat currencies on the blockchain. Three over collateralization borrowing and lending. Four, an agency network to complete a funds transfer, a user dials Star four eight three, Star three five four hash to access the full USS by selecting option one. They then receive a prompt to enter the recipient's mobile number. Upon entering the amount and completing the transaction, they then receive a message with the details of the transaction.
00:40:19.498 - 00:40:51.478, Speaker A: To withdraw fund. The user dials Star four eight three, Star three five four hash to access the full US. They select option three and enter the amount withdraw. The transaction is completed within a matter of seconds. The main participants on the DeFi network are agents and users. One becomes an agent by depositing a pair of assets in given ratios into a pool. For example, 10,000 Kenya shillings and 10,000 CUSD.
00:40:51.478 - 00:41:28.070, Speaker A: In the Kenya Shillings CUSD pool, transaction fees charged and users utilizing this pool are distributed to liquidity providers based on their share of the pool. Each pool is a smart contract operated by users calling functions. Providing liquidity is called deposits in a pool contract automated market maker function. Users can swap their tokens for other tokens in the liquidity pool. Swapping tokens is called swap. On a pool contract, the user is charged a transaction fee during the swap. For USSD users using the feature phone menu, the experience is similar.
00:41:28.070 - 00:42:15.906, Speaker A: A user can buy BTC simply by choosing the Buy BTC option, but in the background, a swap is performed to exchange the assets provided by the user, for example, CUSD or Kenya Shillings in exchange for BTC. Kotanipay's automated market maker algorithm relies on mathematical formulas to set the price of a token. There are no buy or sell orders and traders don't need to find someone else to sell their coins to. Instead, a smart contract acts as a maker in an exchange transaction. DeFi platform enables the creation of onchain synthetic assets that track the value of assets in the real world. Current assets available are the synthetic fiat currency. Synthetic assets allow you to receive the benefit of holding an asset without actually holding it, while at the same time being able to transact on a blockchain with these assets.
00:42:15.906 - 00:43:00.710, Speaker A: Users and agents of Kotanipay who deposit the local currencies into pools automatically create synthetic versions of the same which are tradable on the blockchain across countries and jurisdictions. Agents on the Kotanipay DeFi network, in addition to commission on transaction amounts, also earn governance tokens. Governance tokens enable agents to approve any new markets in IDMAs, for example, USDC Gold. In future, the governance token will enable agents to perform more roles within the network, such as protocol changes needed for growth of the network. Great. Thanks Steve. Over to the judges for questions and comments.
00:43:00.710 - 00:43:44.594, Speaker A: I love the background music. The background music was definitely cool. And yeah, I like what you're trying to do here. So I've got a question Steve, which is how does custody work with your day? We looked to interface, like with a bank account. Anyone can become an agent by interfacing a bank API, which allows you to provide some fiat on their account. The rest will be carried through the Escrow smart contract on the side of crypto. Got it.
00:43:44.594 - 00:45:08.070, Speaker A: Can you explain that a little bit more on the crypto side? Basically we are working mostly with APIs that allow you to like if you send some funds into a bank account, an equivalent amount is credited on the crypto side which allows you to create a pool. We've borrowed much from what Uniswap has done of having different tokens as a pool and we are able to do swap and our focus is on the stable tokens instead of the whole crypto, except for the main two, which is ethereum and bitcoin because they have a bigger market range. Is there a lot of options for fiat on ramp and off ramp right now in where you are? You could tell me where you are. Actually that would be great. I'm from Kenya. We actually pay premium for almost close to between 6% to 10% depending on where you're buying of the current market of bitcoin and ethereum. So if you come here, you're paying like 5% more to get to get the token.
00:45:08.070 - 00:46:19.250, Speaker A: So so there is so there are a few options but then for fiat on ramp and off ramp. But you still always have to pay a premium for the cryptocurrencies when you buy them. Yes, you have to pay a premium and then it's not very easy to use. The biggest solution here is Mpesa, I don't know if you're familiar with it, which allows you to send a text and be able to credit someone. So we borrowed heavy from that idea, then wanted to take the strength of DeFi where anyone can provide large liquidity and become a part owner and then be able by providing that you earn a fee. So borrowing from that, we can able to create any merchant or a shop owner can become like an agency in that network and be able to provide a way for users to online and also the crypto ecosystem. Okay, well, thanks Steve and thanks Sam as well.
00:46:19.250 - 00:46:35.670, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, that was great. Cheers. Okay, moving on to the next demo. The next project up is Wrapped filecoin. So please go ahead and play your demo for us.
00:46:35.670 - 00:47:44.920, Speaker A: Hi, this is Nadzareno and we'll show you a quick demo of brapped filecoin. To start, we need to. Indicate the amount of filecoin we want to wrap. Then we need to specify an Ethereum address where we want to receive the brapped filecoin and filecoin address that I've created before using the wallet. So now we need to send 0.1 filecoin to this address. So we will use the filecoin wallet, specifying the amount and the private key of our wallet and we need to send 0.1
00:47:44.920 - 00:48:19.736, Speaker A: file coin to the custodial wallet and it succeed. So now it's wrapped. So we can see now the amount being updated 0.6. Now we can unwrap same amount 0.1 wrapped file coin. So we have currently 0.6 on this account and we need to specify the wallet.
00:48:19.736 - 00:48:52.572, Speaker A: We would like to receive the 0.1 file coin. So let's check again the balance. Yeah, it's updated. As you can see we wrapped before so 0.1 filecoin so we sent filecoin to the custodial wallet and the balance now is updated. Now we can unwrap 0.1
00:48:52.572 - 00:50:00.672, Speaker A: file coin and yeah, we need to connect to the wallets and then we need to burn 0.1 wrapped file coin. Confirm transaction confirmed on Coven as you can see, I burn 0.1 wrapped file coin and if there is an event that emit an event unwrapped with the address we want to receive the file coin. It the unwrapping process. Start with burning the brapped file coin and then the back end will send back from the custodial wallet 0.5 filecoin to our wallet but we can see that we burn successfully 0.1
00:50:00.672 - 00:50:55.730, Speaker A: wrapped file coin on the account. This is important because wrapped file coin is an LC 20 token, a stable coin on deposits on a filecoin custodial wallet. So we keep the ratio one to one of the amount stored in the custodial wallet and the total supply of wrapped file coin in Ethereum and this will keep the value of filecoin in Ethereum as well. As you can see, now it's updated and we successfully unwrapped 0.1 wrapped file coin. Great, thank you. Over to the judges for questions and comments.
00:50:55.730 - 00:52:05.680, Speaker A: Very cool. I mean, as a DeFi enthusiast, I think this is definitely needed. What was the biggest technical challenge that you guys had to overcome when you were building this? I think this one actually since we have been working from so many months with Ethereum, working now with a different protocol like filecoin was very challenging and hard for us. Also we had to set up our own node and trying to communicate with the blockchain with the filecoin blockchain through that node and setting all that, working together, asking to the network if the transaction is completed or not. Sending actual the file coins, that was our main biggest challenge, trying to operate with different blockchain and different protocol. Got it. Makes sense.
00:52:05.680 - 00:52:56.896, Speaker A: Where are you guys thinking about taking this next now that you have this potentially very large interest that many people could be pursuing? Yeah, we are currently on takian and next would be to fully audit the code base and include informal verification and launch mainnet as soon as possible. After that, we plan to release a new custodial version by leveraging on filecoin smart contract that currently are not available to developers. So it will take a while. That's why we went with a custodial pattern first. Hi, guys, nice to see you again. Great job. Question from me.
00:52:56.896 - 00:54:09.960, Speaker A: So I think before you move to something that's more noncustodial, I think obviously there's going to be some people who might be a little bit nervous about the custodial nature of the protocol. So what are steps that maybe you're thinking of undertaking to sort of engender trust and a brand in the community? And presumably, as Spencer indicated, I assume one of the primary applications of Rapfall coin is, you know, trust is absolutely paramount there too. Yeah, sure. In order to build trust, all the code is open source, including the back end. We will definitely look for custodial and it's a third party to keep track of the file coin. And also we'll have like an interface to show the history log of wrapping and unwrapping and keep the user updated about the custodial wallet balance. And of course, the code will be fully audited, including the back end and the smart contract.
00:54:09.960 - 00:54:55.060, Speaker A: And we are using as a tech stack IPFS, also textile three DB to keep track of the transaction on Falcon. So we kind of keep track of Falcon transaction locally. So to add an extra layer of security. And also if I can add something, we have been researching in some third parties that can prove that we actually held that deposit, like a proof of deposit that can be an intermediate solution before we reach the non custodial. Approach completed. Great. Cool.
00:54:55.060 - 00:55:06.920, Speaker A: Thank you guys. Thanks, Moshibo. Great project. Good to see you back. Thanks. Thanks. Okay, so the next hack we're going to see is extra PCHAIN.
00:55:06.920 - 00:55:43.102, Speaker A: Whenever you are ready to share your demo, please go ahead. Thanks very much, Josh. Let me share with audio. Here we go. Hi, and thanks for listening. Introducing Demystify, which is designed to help traders make better informed decisions. So what are the three pillars for better security? It's due diligence, auditing and insurance.
00:55:43.102 - 00:56:58.950, Speaker A: And Demystify covers the first two pillars, some well known facts about the amount that's been lost in crypto crimes, which has amounted to billions over the course of 2019 and 2020. So what are the current problems? Traders don't have better tools to make better decisions, which results in the loss of funds. Smart contracts haven't been audited, which results in the risk of security issues, and there are unreliable resources on social media that are biased. So the main ideas of Demystify were built on top of MetaMask, which is a reliable tool and is simple for integration for users. We have a library that's based on demonstrated attack vectors and provides informative feedback to the user. We use etherscan and Cryptoscamdb to check the contract addresses against the library. And we use other data sources, scraping data and monitoring price fluctuation.
00:56:58.950 - 00:58:10.190, Speaker A: So why are we different? Well, we're a plugin tool which is easy to use for users. We provide static analysis of smart contracts and we provide the DeFi community with education and safety. So what is our business model? We have feasibility because we have a team of experienced blockchain engineers and we have extensive experience. We have Viability because credible DeFi firms are likely to invest because they have an interest in users using their credible platforms. And we have Desirability because users can use Demystify at any time and it can be used repeatedly, which is likely because end users would utilize the tool every time they interact with a new smart contract. So we carried out a Twitter poll to see if users would use our tool and 80% said yes. And thank you very much for listening.
00:58:10.190 - 00:59:04.880, Speaker A: This is how the interface will look with the Snap plugin for MetaMask. So when you go to send some funds to an address, you will enter the address as per normal. You will then choose the amount that you want to send to the address. Then once you click on the next button, it will come up with some information that has been retrieved from the back end. In this instance, it's saying that there is something wrong being indicated by the smart contract address. We can now see it when sending to a contract address which is not malicious and not been flagged as harmful. You can see here, nice and clear, it tells you that you're safe to send your funds to that particular smart contract address.
00:59:04.880 - 00:59:48.094, Speaker A: How big is your team? About four of us working on this. Sorry, there are about four of us working on okay, awesome. Okay. And was all of the work done during the hackathon period? Yeah, got it. Yeah. There was quite a few things that we haven't finished that we would have liked to like. The list of wanted features is pretty long, but it's kind of building up starting from the start, like trying to decentralize it all.
00:59:48.094 - 01:00:29.798, Speaker A: So we're using Pocket Network for that to try and get off of infura and obviously smart contracts being decentralized as well. So there are a few hurdles along the way. The concept is pretty sound, I think, and it's just kind of making it into a nice package that you can use. A MetaMask. Yeah. For a newcomer coming to the space, I would totally recommend this to them just so that in case they get scammed that sounds like even makes the I mean, the warning sign needs to be bigger. It should be like a pop up glaring capital letters, but I think it's super useful.
01:00:29.798 - 01:00:45.876, Speaker A: It's a cool idea. Cool. Thank you. Something big red flashing would be nicer. Like some alarms going off in your speakers maybe. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
01:00:45.876 - 01:01:25.164, Speaker A: I definitely think this is really useful. I'm curious how you guys are ensuring that the addresses that you have tagged are expansive like correct and all of those things because the mechanism is obviously really helpful. So how do you guys ensure that? Yeah, it's a very good question. So we're concerned about someone flagging something perhaps that was a valid. So the data sources are from various areas. So scraping videos from YouTube is one, taking data from Twitter API is another. Also those two sources.
01:01:25.164 - 01:02:13.328, Speaker A: So ether scan and cryptoscamdb and also feedback from the people using it as well. So rather than basing it just on one source or that is then easy to be spoofed by someone. If they want to annoy their friend who's got a contract running, then it's sourced from a lot more places to kind of balance out the score. And also I should mention things like static analysis of the contracts themselves. So esyscan you can get the majority of contracts. There smart contracts, there either the bytecode or the source code for the contract itself. So performing static analysis on the code of the smart contract, referring that back to scans which have happened over the past six, nine months, there's a good library of those.
01:02:13.328 - 01:03:20.192, Speaker A: So even if it wasn't intentional by the developers and a lot of these clones, as we've seen, have been maybe unintentional weaknesses. But if we can say this has happened before, here's evidence of it happening. So rather than basing on kind of a whim or something, we're actually using sort of historical data to build up knowledge about the area. And what data sets do you wish you had that would make this more robust? What to make it more robuster? I didn't catch your first couple of words. What data sets or integration? Well, so at the moment we have an idea of using data sets like cryptoscan DB, which is quite a nice sort of resource. Also ether scan, I think I mentioned those sources before and generally just trying to get as many as possible. So I think one of the key ones is just looking at historical data like sort of saying, right, this has happened, people have lost their money there this is that section of bytecode from that smart contract.
01:03:20.192 - 01:04:03.476, Speaker A: Or this is kind of the function that has been indicated by things such as the what's it called as a competitions in there where you're trying to do a sneaky solidity function. And so any of these sources, we can actually demonstrably show where money has been lost and where people have lost their funds. What are the next steps now? Finish off the Snap, which is the plugin for MetaMask. Finish integrating it with Pocket as well. Had a few hiccups with that. And then keep building it, I guess make it more obvious when something isn't going right, I guess as you suggested. Yeah, I just keep going with it.
01:04:03.476 - 01:04:24.170, Speaker A: Have you spoken MetaMask team about it? Beg your pardon? Have you asked the MetaMask team? Not yet. I'll follow up. I think they would love to learn more about this. I think you're on the right track and that's exactly what Snaps is meant to do. So thank you for checking it out. Cool. Thanks very much.
01:04:24.170 - 01:04:43.576, Speaker A: Thanks, Tom. And team welcome. Thanks very much for your time. Thanks, everybody. Yeah. Okay, so we're going to move on to the next demo and after this one, we'll take our mid session break of about ten minutes. But the next team is Archie.
01:04:43.576 - 01:05:50.630, Speaker A: So as soon as you're on the call, please go ahead and play your demo for us. Thank. Manipal Institute of Technology was recently undergraduated. Hi, everyone. This is Archie and we've presented this for ETH Online 2020. What we are we are three students from Manipal Institute of Technology who have recently undergraduated. We have made a system in which we can directly give donations which will purchase products and go directly to the NGO, cutting out the middlemen in between.
01:05:50.630 - 01:06:20.238, Speaker A: This ensures that there are secure, automated and transparent transactions that go through which are using ERC 20 tokens. We're cutting out the middleman and we make sure that there's on chain verification that's been done. How it's built? It's built using a registration is done for users and NGO. Only. A document proof is required. For the NGO, the Ed address is generated on signing up. After that, users can deposit fiat currency into their account.
01:06:20.238 - 01:07:02.670, Speaker A: Feasible donations are possible by the user to an NGO and a progress bar is maintained to ensure that there is transparency. ERC 20 balance is maintained under hood and the contracts are deployed using Matix Mainnet API, the main homepage of our site parents. Several different NGOs have listed their services. So it can either be a bird service or it can be for poverty evaluation or it can be for education. Now, we're going to proceed with signing in from an NGO's point of view. So once we sign in, we have to provide the email address and a password. This email address is mapped to a unique Ethereum address which we will see in a minute.
01:07:02.670 - 01:07:35.420, Speaker A: As you can see, the unique Ethereum address has been generated for that email. Now you can see that this NGO has listed several products which you would like to list. Product one, product two, product three. With their cost and quantity, the NGO has the option to edit or add further products for listing. As you can see, it has been changed. Now we're going ahead with the donor's point of view. If we sign out, we can click from the donor's point of view and they also have to provide a unique email as well as a password which generates another unique Ethereum address linked to that email.
01:07:35.420 - 01:08:19.334, Speaker A: Now, the user also has the option to view these products, but can pay for them. A user can go ahead and add money into their wallet, which is minted currency for now, but we can integrate third party apps as well. Let's go ahead and add $202,000. You can monitor this transaction hash given we can go ahead and view the balance as it shows that it is 2000. Now we are going ahead and paying for a particular NGO if you donate let's go ahead and donate $50 and you can see that the goal has increased along with the transaction has generated. Okay. The goal has increased by 25%.
01:08:19.334 - 01:08:49.390, Speaker A: Now we are going ahead and donating for the entire amount that's there, which is the remainder, which is $150. It says a transaction hasn't been generated. Okay. And now this product will get shipped to the NGO with the tracking details. We can be found here after we integrate it with a vendor service. 100% has been generated. Now if you go ahead and see our balance, our balance has reduced to we can see the transaction hashes that have been mined on Matic Vigil as well, giving the events that have been emitted.
01:08:49.390 - 01:09:27.742, Speaker A: If you see the balance, the balance is 1800. 200 has been deducted. Now, going ahead to Matic, go to head to Matic and you can see that the events have been generated. We can see the transactions have gone through and future work include the future work include adding three third party apps like Amazon, Google, Pay, PAYT and PayPal. We can introduce an app based platform as well, and we can use image recognition techniques to see our products. Also, using an Ng approval can be added as well. That's from our side.
01:09:27.742 - 01:10:06.700, Speaker A: Thank you. Great. Thanks guys. Over to the judges for questions and comments. Thanks for this. What kind of prompt you guys to decide on building a donor platform? I guess? What kind of middlemen are you guys trying to cut out? So usually in India at least, people are really apprehensive donating to several NGOs because they feel that the middlemen, the NGOs will seep out the money for themselves and not actually benefit the target audience. So this will clear all apprehensions that the users might have.
01:10:06.700 - 01:11:22.210, Speaker A: So that's what we thought of when we were building it. Have you talked to NGOs about this project yet at all? Yeah, I was a part of an NGO and they wouldn't tell it face first, but once you get in touch with them, some of them start reviewing, as in it's a bit shady there. I see. What was the most challenging aspect that you guys worked through? Spencer said what was the most challenging aspect that you guys went through? Okay. I would say the most challenging prospect would be looking into Matic visuals documentation. So we had to rough it up in the first one week, two weeks, and then we had to make the contracts for it. So that took quite some time because the web based model was more or less we were all familiar with it, but writing the contracts took a good amount of time for us.
01:11:22.210 - 01:12:03.192, Speaker A: Have you guys been working or just kind of dabbling in the blockchain on the side? It's been four months, I would say, for all three of us since we delved into this field. That's very cool. This must be a lot of stuff that you have to learn. Yeah. It's interesting, though. Yeah. If you guys had more time, what would you build? We are thinking of making this product forward, like, the future works that we included.
01:12:03.192 - 01:12:39.528, Speaker A: We would like to work on that. Otherwise, we have some more ideas in the back of our head that we would like to give a shot. So that's our future work for now that we like to delve into. Yeah. It sounds like you're targeting it, like, a direct problem that you guys are very aware of, so I'd be really interested in kind of seeing the attraction there and just trying to explain to people the value of blockchain technology in that respect. Definitely look forward to that as well. Yeah.
01:12:39.528 - 01:13:06.512, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, well, no more questions then we'll wrap this Q A there. Thank you so much, Team Archie, for being part of ETH Online. Thank you so much. We would like to give a shout out to Sarup and Anamit, who helped us with build this project. They were like a mentor. Thank you.
01:13:06.512 - 01:13:25.960, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks. Good job. Okay, so we'll take our kind of a mid session break here. We'll come back in ten minutes, and the next team after the break will be Athlete Equity. So we'll see you back here in about ten. Okay? Thanks, Josh.
01:13:25.960 - 01:24:01.960, Speaker A: About ready to get started, judges, let me know when you're back. Hello. Hey there. Hello. Okay. All right, Robert, please go ahead and play your demo whenever you're ready. Got it.
01:24:01.960 - 01:24:54.170, Speaker A: Robbie Cleiges, Juan PA, and me, Kevin CampTO. So welcome to our presentation on Athlete Equity. Three different people on the team. Robbie, Cleggis, Juan, PA and me. Kevin CampTO. So quick overview who we are, what we want to do, the challenges we faced, and our next steps. So we built a liquidity pool on ethereum that exposes liquidity providers to athlete performance.
01:24:54.170 - 01:26:03.310, Speaker A: So what that means is we want to give different interested parties the opportunity to invest in athlete performance. Meaning that here, athlete tokens can be bought from the pool or minted. And when a player performs well, the weight of the token in the pool increases. So the framework we used ethereum contracts in the back end to build a liquidity pool. We have athlete API data that we can visualize on the front end, and there's a smart contract that is used to adjust the weights of the pool according to the stats. That's definitely the vision we had in mind, and let's dive quickly into what it looks like. So here you can see all the different game stats and the account and the liquidity pool.
01:26:03.310 - 01:26:56.738, Speaker A: So these stats show right here, LeBron James and the NBA Finals game data. So the points they won points per game for different teams. Here is the admin controls where you can start the season deposit tokens. And if you start the season without if you try to deposit tokens without starting the season, it won't allow you to. Here is the Liquidity pool where this would be where all of the Dai tokens can be seen. Diving into some challenges we faced and what our next steps should be. Programming side.
01:26:56.738 - 01:27:51.106, Speaker A: We struggled with the amount of developers that we had and so some of the features that we wanted to implement ended up having to be shelved or really put on the back burner. The next steps that we really see are continuing to build out this product. Ideally, we'd love to turn this into a fully fledged business where different players that want to invest in player tokens can do so. And that's really the end goal. Thank you for your time and awesome word of the Joints for questioning comments. Spencer, knowing your intersection of interest, I suspect you might have interest in this one. Yeah, this is cool.
01:27:51.106 - 01:29:01.930, Speaker A: I'm still kind of trying to wrap my head around it, but I love sports and I love DFI. What's the purpose of the pool exactly? Yeah, so each player token is some portion of the pool. The pool is made up of 100% of the player tokens, and then as an athlete performs well, it's waiting that player token in the pool would increase and then others would decrease. And the same thing for poor athlete performance. When a player performs poorly or under his or her rolling average of the last ten games or the whole season, that weight of that player would drop in the pool and the others would increase. Got it. So is it all the players in a league or whatever in that pool or just a defined set or subset of players in the pool? I'm trying to understand the composition, why we haven't fleshed out our listing policy completely yet, but that would be something that we would take into account, is ideally we'd like to have all the players that are a part of that league as part of the pool.
01:29:01.930 - 01:29:54.250, Speaker A: And does it need an opt in from the player or can you just basically mint it, given their stats? As long as we can bring the stats in, then we have the ability to mint the token. We're not completely sure about the legality or the regulation around offering some sort of token like that, so we'd appreciate any advice or suggestions on that side, but as long as the stats are able to communicate with the Oracle, then yeah, we're able to bring it in. Got it. And so as an end user, it's more about kind of like investing in these tokens. Would you? Yeah, yeah. As the end user, you can think of it like gambling or a fantasy sports game, like daily fantasy, but really it's an uncorrelated asset. So we'd like to see it in some sort of investment portfolio.
01:29:54.250 - 01:30:20.578, Speaker A: Yeah. Got it. Fluctuates with the performance of the athlete. Exactly. Is that how it works? Okay. Yeah, I really like it. I mean, a lot of times, the only way that you can kind of bet on an individual player's performance is over, like, a very short time frame, like DFS or something like that.
01:30:20.578 - 01:31:14.786, Speaker A: And then as you get longer, you have to kind of use the teams to bet maybe that the Lakers are going to win a championship. So I think this is a pretty cool hole in the market that you guys are going after. What challenges would you see that you'd need to overcome here to launch it? Yeah. So legal challenges and regulatory challenges are going to depend on jurisdiction. We've also had concerns about gas fees and when to enable withdrawals and allow people to sell their tokens into the pool, because each time that we are going to update the weight in the pool, it's going to cost some gas. So that's one concern we've had. Other than that, Kevin, you can add anything that you like, but I think most of the other challenges were just on the experience side.
01:31:14.786 - 01:32:06.260, Speaker A: We've only been working with Solidity for a couple of months, and that was really just kind of the extent of our capabilities. Yeah, quickly adding on to that. Can everyone hear me okay? Yeah, quickly adding on to that. Yeah. My personal background was in IoT, so jumping into Ethereum was really new for me. And though it was great and fun to learn, we definitely needed some more help on the programming end where we had some hurdles that we just couldn't quite get around. And in terms of validation for this market, we were able to find a US based company that isn't exactly in the niche we are in, but they're definitely in a similar enough space that we can see them as a sort of roadmap as to what's to follow or the direction we can go in.
01:32:06.260 - 01:32:44.820, Speaker A: How long have you guys been this face? I've been just looking at Altcoins and holding some bitcoin since, like, 2016. I think the rest of the talent team was pretty much in the last few months getting started with Ethereum, and then in the last couple of weeks, it's been working on the hackathon. Very cool. Yeah, very cool. Well, thanks Robert and Kevin and Juan from your team as well. Really cool project. Thanks for your demo.
01:32:44.820 - 01:33:03.430, Speaker A: Thanks, Jess. Yeah, good job. Thanks a lot. Okay, next up is Geofile. And, Geophile, I understand that you're going to play a video, but you're going to talk over the video. So please go ahead whenever you're ready and we'll get started. Yeah.
01:33:03.430 - 01:33:26.970, Speaker A: Any chance you can enable my video? You stopped me a couple of minutes ago. You should be able to reach it. Still nothing. Okay, great. Hey, everyone. Basically I have two options. I think it's better if I just walk you through the slides so that I can coordinate.
01:33:26.970 - 01:34:07.626, Speaker A: Anyways, I'm going to share my screen and let's take it from there. You should be able to see my screen, right? Yes, all good. Okay, thanks. So Geofile is focused on localized storage. But before I tell you more about localized storage and why it's so exciting, let me give you a fast introduction on how the current state of affairs are. So basically, most of the data that we are consuming today is coming from basically on any device. Either our phones or a desktop machine is going to these free companies.
01:34:07.626 - 01:35:10.640, Speaker A: And you wouldn't believe what percentage of actually requests are going to those data centers, but this is not necessarily a problem right now because those companies are incentivized to act as good actors and basically there is no reason for us to worry. But this is not something that we can actually plan for for the long term, and possibly in the long term, maybe in 50 years, that's going to change and we shouldn't really rely on this kind of storage. Now this was the entire premise behind decentralized storage. And the way that the decentralized storage differs from centralized storage is in the fact that basically all our files can be stored on multiple machines. And we can also split the files and store them on however machines we want with whatever redundancy we want. And we can also encrypt them there and we can do all sorts of things with that. But now that's not just good, it's also bad for a couple of reasons, because then we need to ask ourselves a question.
01:35:10.640 - 01:36:19.458, Speaker A: First of all, where is my data going to be sore? On which computer is my data going to live? Because this is not something that we don't care about. We would rather have our data on Azure rather than on some malicious guy computer. How can we be sure that our data is not going to go offline? How can we be sure that those miners are not going to go offline? And lastly, how can we actually be sure that we can retrieve that data? Maybe we have ten terabytes of data stored on a minor, but that minor has like a connection that is 15 megabytes and maybe has ten megabytes of upload. That's very bad because then it would take us like three days to actually retrieve the data. Now those are all problems that currently exist in the decentralized storage ecosystem. But on the other hand, we have a very big need for decentralized storage. Actually, you have so many initiatives in the European Union that are pushing citizens and companies that are residing in the European Union to store all the data in the European Union.
01:36:19.458 - 01:36:44.640, Speaker A: Something that probably you have heard about is. The case with Facebook, which is basically unable to keep some data in the European Union and not in the US. Because of the way they architected their systems. On the other side, they are also unable to do that from the governance standpoint because they are still headquartered in the US. And the US. Actually asked them to give some data to the government. They need to actually do that.
01:36:44.640 - 01:37:29.802, Speaker A: This is something that blockchain storage sold very well, and we have seen a lot of need coming from the pharmaceutical companies and in general, the health vertical in the European Union. Now, how Geofile works and what Geofile does. So basically what we do is we have a list of miners. We verify those miners. We make sure that those miners have good Internet connections. We make sure those miners went through a KYC, that we know who they are. We make sure that we know what gear those miners have that potentially in the future they can be retrieved in a successful way from the software side.
01:37:29.802 - 01:38:05.174, Speaker A: Basically what we have is we are talking to Powergate, which is underneath managing what data goes to Lotus, which is basically Filecoin and IPFS. And basically, depending on the use case of the final customer, it's either going to be hot storage or cold storage. Filecoin is cold storage in this case, and hot storage is going to go to IPFS. Now, I just want to interrupt to note that we're four minutes and 30 seconds in. So your video was supposed to be four minutes long. So if you can wrap it up in 30 seconds and then let's do Q and A. Okay? Yes.
01:38:05.174 - 01:38:33.990, Speaker A: So this is the view that the miner has. Basically, it just sets what data he want to store. And we focused on clients that have the need for localized data, or miners sorry, or clients that need to give ownership of the data to the final users. And these are the two companies that we have worked with, Fazembank. In our case, they wanted to unify the API with their customers into different branches. For example, in Austria or in Serbia. Or in Romania.
01:38:33.990 - 01:39:26.522, Speaker A: They want to be sure that they can use the same API. And IntelliSense Group, which is a health company in Switzerland, where basically what they want is they want to store symptoms on the blockchain and make sure that their users have ownership over those symptoms and that they can go to the doctors and basically share the data. Yeah. So I'm just going to keep this slide here and we can wrap up and go to questions. So is this a running company now? No, actually Geofile is not. But before that, we worked a lot on the Falcon infrastructure piece. We tried to actually make the infrastructure work, and we have the pieces that are necessary for the mining setup to actually be run somewhere.
01:39:26.522 - 01:40:07.690, Speaker A: For example, in our case, for Rifeheisen, we need a miner in Austria. First it's going to be our hardware. Then we are going to try to recruit miners that want to join the network. But first we need to make sure that that infrastructure works and that we provide a good service to the final user. In this case, Rafa is a bank. In the future, what we want is actually attract miners with tools for miners, like monitoring tools, analytics and stuff like that, so that when they use their tools, they can basically check that they want to be part of this network as well and we can send them storage deals. Thank you for the presentation.
01:40:07.690 - 01:40:59.338, Speaker A: Clearly I think you've stumbled on a market gap here for my benefit. Would you mind recapping what you built for the hackathon and what you that part wasn't super clear for me. Yeah, definitely. So what we built and I'm going to just play the demo now what we built is a platform for miners where they can log in, where we can verify them, and where basically we can make sure that the connection is working. And then we whitelist them once they have went through the verification. Basically when that happens, then we go to the clients and then we see where those miners should be part of a particular deal or not. In the case of bank, it needs to be in Austria, Romania and Serbia.
01:40:59.338 - 01:41:54.986, Speaker A: So most of the miners are not going to be part of that, but in the future, possibly those are going to be part of it. And yeah, we do normal things. We check that the connection works and things like that. Some of those can be done with the reputation system of filecoin, but it's not really complete and the reputation is fine to some degree, but you can't really be sure whether the connection is going to be good for a particular use case. For example, when you have large video files and things like that, how are you guys thinking about signing up miners with the development tools? So basically they have tools that allow them to mine more effectively. For example, what we are going to work on is an orchestrator for setups that have multiple nodes, for example. Yeah, because filecoin mining is very hard, you need to have different machines that are doing a particular operation.
01:41:54.986 - 01:42:34.394, Speaker A: For example, one machine with a lot of Ram, one machine with a lot of storage, and one machine with very fast CPU. And yeah, the problematic part right now is actually how do you orchestrate those operations between those miners and how do you make sure that this is optimal and you seal as many sectors as you can. Now, this is a very nice way to actually attracting them. We give those tools for free and then we ask them where they want to have more deals on their platform. If they are miners that actually filled a particular criteria, if they are great, if they are not. They just use. Great.
01:42:34.394 - 01:42:49.090, Speaker A: Okay, well we're out of time so we'll have to end the Q A there. But thank you for your presentation. Thank you so much. Thank you. This is cool. Yeah, thanks, bye. Okay, so next up we have Distributed Town.
01:42:49.090 - 01:43:46.982, Speaker A: Please play your demo whenever you're ready. Hello everyone, thank you for having us. 1 second. So hello everyone. This is Alex from Italy and the team lead of Distributed Town, a self organizing network based on a non speculative financial model that lets anyone organize in autonomous self sustainable communities where every member is rewarded based on the value of their contribution for the community itself. Now during these times we've seen the rise of remote work distributed teams and many attempts to communicate and interact with others in innovative ways. Unfortunately though the Dows, the decentralized autonomous organization, are still too complex and generalized for newcomers.
01:43:46.982 - 01:44:49.630, Speaker A: Also, they are too focused on financial rewards that don't incentivize people in long term relationships and are not based mutual support and a common goal. Distributed Town instead offers a solution based on a non speculative mutual credit system based on a mathematical proof not only we are building a more male to traffic distributed financial infrastructure for the future, but we let users join a community with just one step, literally just adding their email address. Thanks to our magic link integration, after registering new users can select the skills they are the best at and immediately receive credits for them. Hey there. This is Lorenzo, the smart contracts guy of the Distributed Town team. And I'm just going to take you to a quick walkthrough to the itonline MVP version of the contracts that power Distributed Town. The core of our protocol is the community contract which can be interacted with gasoline using gas session network.
01:44:49.630 - 01:45:39.114, Speaker A: Every community has a 96,000 cap token called Dito which can only be transferred from and to members of that community. When a user joins a community, he gets a certain amount of dito and when he leaves, he has to return them. I'm Elena and I'm working on the back end of chain data management of Distributed down project. Our technical stack is Node JS and textiles trade DP and mailbox. We use trade for a database. We have a trade for community and this way we store the community data privately and we also use mailbox for intercommunication between the communities when needed. Here on the left you can see the functionality that we already have implemented.
01:45:39.114 - 01:46:33.470, Speaker A: It's a simple postmark collection. We can list communities, get community details, get the skills tree so that the user can pick skills creating and joining user and join community, create, get and accept kids and listing some user data. Also we have the create community. But wait, we said it's a mutual credit system. So where are the money actually coming from? Well, once a member, a user could then deposit die or Usdcv two using the gasless ERC 3009 transfer with authorization function and lend die to ave to accrue interest on it. So as a final step, one of the main issues that we found is related to personal mobility. So we created a universal login on the top of our distributed town network.
01:46:33.470 - 01:47:20.820, Speaker A: It is called Skill Wallet and you can easily access it directly from your user profile, visualizing all your past activities and your current credit amount. Once you access your Skill Wallet, you can immediately log in to any other community in the network. Plus, in the future, you will be able to participate to events or join hackathon just like this one by simply scanning a unique QR code that lets you in the new community in a few seconds. So thank you for having us. This tripute town is creating the foundation for the future of collaborative economics in a more open and competitive world based on meritocracy and mutual support. Join us and help us build the local community of the citizens of the world. Thank you very much.
01:47:20.820 - 01:48:30.406, Speaker A: All right, I'm back. Thank you over to the judges for questions and comments. This is super interesting guys. Can you talk about the motivations that you had for building such a project? I'm curious if there was something in real life that you had maybe encountered that made you want to build for it? Well, I mean, the simplest answer would be that basically in ten years of blockchain, we've tried to build better money. While I think what we are trying to do instead is to build a better system that is based on value. So basically what we are trying to do is to allow anyone to manage their own tasks, their own community, their own accounts in a measurable way and focus on the actual goal, on actual personal contribution, innovation and so on, rather than speculation. So that's mostly like that.
01:48:30.406 - 01:49:36.700, Speaker A: And also if you see the Skill Wallet in perspective would be a nice way to move from a place to the other or travel the world potentially and contribute to anywhere you go without the need for passports, resumes, bank accounts and this kind of stuff. So mostly it's like more open world and a more customizable life experience. Hey guys, this is really cool and I like the presentation, how you guys distributed the work and it was very thoroughly and well explained where each of you kind of spoke. It's probably the most comprehensive presentation I've seen today. So good job to you guys. My question is kind of what communities would you approach this product with to kind of test out or if you have tested out with anyone using it kind of building that community like that? Yeah, well, first of all, we started working on this and we completed most of the things they showed during this hackathon. So it's very young and we had a lot of work.
01:49:36.700 - 01:50:29.262, Speaker A: But anyway, we discussed already with for example, Gitcoin, because let's say since we built this protocol called Proof of contribution, we are able to eliminate any sort of sibil attack or pull manipulation from the Clr model of quadratic funding from Gitcoin. So we empower, let's say, this approach they have and we allow, for example, any hacker to join a new Akaton or a new bounty and so on, with immediate personal identification. Also, we thought about other two use cases that already exist. Currently we have three categories. So the first one is of course, Blockchain and DLT. The second one is Art and events. So for example, if you want to organize an art event, or if you want to organize a performance or a music event and so on, you can immediately do it.
01:50:29.262 - 01:51:38.046, Speaker A: And the third one is local communities. So for example, a couple of years ago I was discussing with one of the biggest waste and energy renewal companies in Finland and it's very interesting for them, like the possibility to do that in local condos or in small neighborhoods and so on. So it is a good way, for example, for condos to manage their building, their resources and this kind of stuff. Cool, thanks. This is super interesting. One quick question for me. Can you talk a little bit more about the mutual credit system that you're proposing and how you expect to develop it further? What do you mean develop it further? As in how do you think of sort of work? Exactly? As you add more members and you have more communities as well, how do you think this will scale? Okay, so basically, as Lorenzo showed in the demo, every community has a cap of 96,000 Datu credits in their vault.
01:51:38.046 - 01:52:55.938, Speaker A: And every time a member joins, they receive 2000 base amount of Dito credits plus all the skills that they listed before being able to use their credits. For example, creating a gig for someone else or creating a new project or creating a new community and so on, they need to validate their skills. So basically, our governance model saves one step and we use game theory basically to avoid auditing pools or validation pools and this kind of stuff, which will delay a lot in the real world. And every time there is, let's say, limited variety of skills within one community, what we call the Scarcity score activates and sends a signal to other communities that, for example, a specific skill is needed. So if you receive this signal, basically you have the possibility to move from your community A to a community B and your tokens get locked in community A and unlocked in community B after they scan and validate your QR code, your skill wallet. So basically, we have no problem in scaling and every community has an account ledger that is fixed. So our mutual credit is based on an actual proof of a contribution.
01:52:55.938 - 01:53:20.340, Speaker A: And we it doesn't really matter for us whether this token has value or not because it has fixed value within our network and no interest in the exchange, trading and this kind of stuff. Great. Okay, thanks so much, Alex, and the whole team. Great presentation. Thanks for being part of the hackathon. Thank you. Thank you, guys.
01:53:20.340 - 01:53:41.100, Speaker A: Yeah, and thank you to my team as well. Unfortunately, I took all the stage, but they've been great and I just wanted to thank them. All right, thank you all. Good job, team. Thanks. Okay, the next project we're going to see is called Split. So, the Split team, please share your demo as soon as you're ready.
01:53:41.100 - 01:54:26.962, Speaker A: Hi, everyone, I'm James Simpson, and today I'm going to help introduce Split. You can find us on Split Finance. Tokens on Ethereum represent several properties, capital yield and all government's rights. Split takes ERC 20 tokens that bundle together several of these components and splits each component into its own token with the aim of enhancing capital efficiency. In this hack, we've built a way to split compounds LP token or C tokens. I've been hacking on this with Francesco Ogoski, Fabio Berger, Richard Galvin and David Sun. For those who may not be familiar, compound is a lending protocol.
01:54:26.962 - 01:55:30.986, Speaker A: The C token is given to users who supply assets to the protocol, and it represents both the holders rights to the capital supplied and to the interest generated on those assets on a perpetual basis. The core splitsmart contracts receive and custody the C token and in this example, bat, and then mint its capital component as well as its forward income or yielding component into separate fungible tokens that can be traded or used as collateral across DeFi. Francesco will now demo how the split product works. Thanks, James. This is Split Finance adapt that lets you interact with the split smart contracts. Split currently supports splitting, combining and managing compound C tokens and their split parts. Let's see what happens when I split 100 CBAT into the Split vault.
01:55:30.986 - 01:56:23.520, Speaker A: And in return, I received two separate ERC 20 tokens, Ccbat and Ycbat. I can combine those split tokens together on the combined page. I'm going to use my entire split token balance for this transaction, meaning on my CZ bet and on my YC bet. And as you can see, it means I will get back 100 CBAT. As you can see, I get 100 CBAT back and I've returned my CC bat and my YC bat. Finally, on the manage page, I can see my split token balances and most importantly, withdraw yield from my yield tokens. It looks like I have some seed to withdraw, so let's do that.
01:56:23.520 - 01:57:13.070, Speaker A: As you can see, I withdrew my C E denominated yield and I still have my YC tokens. If I were to transfer my tokens to someone else, for example, this withdrawal would happen automatically. That's it. That's the demo passing it on to Richard, who will talk about the potential of Split. Split provides market neutral yield assets such as split seed IOC where the holder is buying and ongoing and accruing income stream. Unique income flow opportunities can be created like splitting AMM tokens and providing access to low volatility, high yielding fee income. Removing the yield component from Ammlp tokens is likely to allow investors to buy the capital component at a reduced cost, providing enhanced price leverage.
01:57:13.070 - 01:57:34.542, Speaker A: Split could be applied to any ERC 20 token. There's multiple attributes. Like, for example, Kyber networks or yoon. These could be split into their three core components yield, governance and capital. Allowing users to sell or purchase rights for governance. For example, Split is a novel protocol and concept for DeFi. The protocol enhances the ability of users to choose risk reward profiles.
01:57:34.542 - 01:58:06.014, Speaker A: Tokens produced by Split offer unique income and price appreciation opportunities. These tokens can be used on Split's platform, but also across the board of DeFi ecosystem. Hi, everyone. I'm James Simpson. Hey guys. Hey everyone, it this is very cool and I think it's very well presented. There it is.
01:58:06.014 - 01:58:49.610, Speaker A: Yes. Hey guys, can you hear me okay? Yeah, we can hear you. Yeah, I can hear you. Okay, so I guess what tokens would you start off with as my first question in the demo, we started off with all compound tokens, all C tokens. So maybe it wasn't explained that much in the demo, but you split the compound tokens into only two parts capital and yield. The capital portion is kind of like residue and then the yield component token is a bit more interesting because you saw that there was about 20 YCE. That basically means the yield on 20 ETH in compound.
01:58:49.610 - 01:59:46.074, Speaker A: And so you can constantly withdraw that yield. And it's kind of this fungible token that gives you right to the continuous yield that comes from those C tokens. And then we made some more examples at the end, which is you could split governance tokens, you could split wifey, you could split a whole bunch of other things. This was obviously a money market compound. But if you think about potentially uniswap LP tokens, everyone complains about impermanent loss. You could split an LP token to a capital and yield component and then there's kind of a zero downside yielding component that people could either sell off if they just wanted the kind of more directional trading opportunity with the capital component, or people could buy if they just wanted that fee income without the capital exposure. Guys, this is really dope.
01:59:46.074 - 02:00:39.150, Speaker A: I love it. I want to use it myself. Are there any trust kind of assumptions or additional things that users have to worry about in terms of getting their funds stolen? Know, just making sure that everything works properly? No, no tax. Yeah, maybe james, you can take that. Think this is obviously just a hack and it's just compound at the moment. But if you kind of take a broader picture and think about this with integrating protocol tokens, there is a world where this would be built in quite an integration heavy way. So if you're talking about kind of trust in that sense, perhaps that is something to consider from an architectural perspective.
02:00:39.150 - 02:01:20.022, Speaker A: Francesco, I think we're struggling on the topic of trustless, but it is trustless. So it just uses the C token price feed. So it's totally DeFi native, so to speak. If that's what you need, there is no trust. Yeah, I think that answers it. I guess another way of phrasing my question would be when someone splits their tokens, are they trusting you guys or someone else? That beyond what compound C tokens already make them trust. I think they just trust the split smart contracts, right? That's it.
02:01:20.022 - 02:01:50.118, Speaker A: Right. So there are assumptions made that the biggest assumption is that the tokens in equal the tokens out. So you may have noticed that you have no choice in how many splits to make. So you have to split in equal amounts and you can only split the full set. You can't be like, I 100 capital, and then forget the yield and there are a whole bunch of assumptions that build off of that. And so you need to trust the smart contracts. And guys, this is super cool.
02:01:50.118 - 02:02:42.994, Speaker A: How do you sort of see this trading? I mean, if you kind of have one unified token and one token, like three split tokens, do you think they'll sort of trade bigger than the sum of the whole? Yeah, that's a key assumption that this is kind of a pretty big capital inefficiency in traditional markets as well as crypto. The fact that if I just want yield or I just want capital or I just want governance rights, you can't do that. You need to get the whole token or share or nothing at all. So we think that there will be opportunities for the sum of the parts to be trade more than the whole. For example, if there's a particular activist opportunity, people will pay a premium for that portion. It'll still be a discount to the whole. Likewise, on the yield and capital side, we think it'll also be a new way for you to sell your token.
02:02:42.994 - 02:03:07.374, Speaker A: So you can either choose to sell it and sell the whole thing or split it and then sell the parts. And I think in a future iteration we would make that experience very seamless such that it is like splitting and then selling is like using uniswap. And so there are some really easy Arbitrage loops to implement. Great. Okay, thanks so much guys. Presentation. Thank you.
02:03:07.374 - 02:03:38.138, Speaker A: Thanks guys. See ya. Okay, so next up we have the Esports results, oracle team. So please go ahead and oh, actually I think Jacob's going to play your video for you. So let's jump right in. So basically what we set out to build was a Oracle connector using chainlink to report the outcome of a Esports match. We ended up using the Battlenet APIs for StarCraft Two.
02:03:38.138 - 02:04:53.666, Speaker A: So our first challenge was to connect to the APIs and pull data that we thought was usable to feed to the smart contracts. It took a little while, but we got the API connected and authorized using the Battlenet OAuth app and we were able to feed match results back to a contract on the covan testnet. This is really just the start of what could be built into a more robust reporting system for esports. Ideally we'd like to integrate this with other projects and or create a better front end for others to use this and self report their match data. We'd also like to develop this into an interest bearing pool like pool together where users could deposit funds and pool them to generate interest. The interest could then be awarded as a prize based on the outcome of the match. There are a few different prize strategies that we started to consider using pool together, but we did not get that far.
02:04:53.666 - 02:05:43.294, Speaker A: So that's our hack can't seem to hear you, Chris. Still can't hear you like this. No. Yeah. Okay, judges headphones. So yeah, basically we had a larger idea that we're hoping to build over time, which is basically an esports betting platform that's a no loss lottery. So interest bearing pools with an Oracle feeding out the results of the match.
02:05:43.294 - 02:06:56.040, Speaker A: So what we focused on right now was just building that Oracle connector with chainlink, trying to get the match results through and on Chain going from there. Basically we would like to create some pool together pools. We're not quite sure, there are a few different ways that we've thought about structuring the prize strategy for pool together. Whether that's just based on a single account and their wins and losses, whether it's comparing different accounts in specific matches, whether there's people that want to come in and contribute their match data. And again we started also with just StarCraft Two. We explored also StarCraft One APIs as well as Rocket League, so some of the major competitive esports games and ideally we would develop this into connecting into some pools that would have payouts associated with them. So esports gambling on chain is the overall arching concept and this is just the first Oracle bit for the project.
02:06:56.040 - 02:08:15.086, Speaker A: I have a question, I just have a quick question. Are there platforms that are already doing that kind of like esports gambling? There are a few that have started and also NFTs. So giving out NFTs for gaming and esports participation, which is another thing that we toyed with the idea but hadn't gone down that rabbit hole yet. But there are a few, one that we noticed that's using traditional finance like Mastercard and Visa is called G Loot. So it's using NFTs and I believe some payouts, just USD and CAD type payouts using traditional credit card providers. I'm not aware of all that many, although I did see a couple of different hacks in this hackathon that were doing different Esports, either results or pooling for this kind of purpose, but I haven't seen any production ready yet. Gotcha.
02:08:15.086 - 02:09:04.414, Speaker A: So just a quick question. Follow up on that. How far along are you with the Oracle building? So we have been able to get results and publish them on chain on the covan testnet. Our other team member in our does more of the smart contract coding, so I don't have the full details of it, but his idea was that instead of running our own Oracle, we were going to use one of the Oracle providers. Sorry, I'm trying to remember what they're called, but basically one of the Oracle nodes would host the connector and push the results on chain. So basically we're forwarding results to an Oracle node and they're pushing those results on chain. Gotcha.
02:09:04.414 - 02:10:02.022, Speaker A: Cool, thanks. What was maybe the hardest tactical challenge that you guys had to overcome with this one? So the biggest thing that well, took us the longest time was actually interacting and pulling the data from the Battlenet APIs. Actually the interactions with the Oracles and feeding the data back was actually the easier part of this hack. So yeah, it was a little bit strange in that our blockers weren't exactly Ethereum or smart contract based, they were more traditional web and API based. Just trying to make those calls come return values that we're expecting and can format into basically data that we would feed on chain. Got it. It sounds like there'll be interest.
02:10:02.022 - 02:10:40.002, Speaker A: Go ahead. Sorry. No worries. Is there a reason why you guys chose Esports? Is there a backstory there? Yeah, I mean, both Anar and I have we're both gamers. We've been involved in StarCraft for a while. Neither of us are like professional gamers, although we have seen players take their play to higher levels. And we also just think that with the explosion of platforms like Twitch and YouTube gaming and all those kinds of things, we think there's an audience and a road for onboarding more people to crypto by using this.
02:10:40.002 - 02:11:19.310, Speaker A: One of the things that I like pushing in the crypto space is low risk, basically gaming experimentation where, yeah, people aren't putting in millions of dollars necessarily. And we can kind of experiment with where the pressure points and issues for the systems as they're designed in their early forms and then iterating from there be really great for niece especially. So great job. Thank you. Great. Okay. Well, thanks, Chris.
02:11:19.310 - 02:12:01.798, Speaker A: Great presentation. Okay, so we've got three teams left and the next team up is Symphony Gluing Together ETH Tooling. So please start your presentation. Hi there and thank you for letting us introduce our project. I'm here to present the Symphony project. The problem today is that when doing an Ethereum project, the work doesn't just go into writing smart contracts and a front end to interact with that back end, you have to facilitate. Setting up the development node, a staging node and connecting to a production node.
02:12:01.798 - 02:12:43.370, Speaker A: You have to handle the deployment of your Smart Contracts in each of these environments. You have to let your front end code be aware of your continuous development of Smart Contracts in all of these different environments. You have to handle advanced upgrade patterns of your Smart Contracts. You have to support multiple wallets like MetaMask and Wallet Connect and so on. And you should need to do testing of both your Smart Contracts and your front ends in all of these environments. Our goal is to make this experience easier for all developers, especially new developers coming into Ethereum. You should be able to use your time on developing actual Smart Contracts and your front end instead of setting up tooling and connecting all the different stuff.
02:12:43.370 - 02:13:21.686, Speaker A: Developers coming from Java and C Sharp are used to create statically typed libraries and we wish to bring their expectation of this into the DAP development process. So you get statically typed contracts right in your IDE. The Web Three space has already created great tools for this to solve these different challenges. That Ethers Web Three modal type, chain builder and so on. But we need some glue kind of to just fix it out of the box. Our plugins pushes these tools one step forward towards greatness by making all the Smart Contracts code instantly available in your IDE. As Steve Jobs would have said it, it just works.
02:13:21.686 - 02:14:21.030, Speaker A: So first we need to open up the Symphony tutorial that we've made and we'll start off by creating a new builder project. When that is done we'll install the Symphony plugins and the dependencies. Now we generate the front end and when that is done, I'll open up Vs code and copy and paste Smart contract called the Ballot Example into this project. Create the file and paste it in and as you can see, I can now right away use that contract within react project and it's completely statically typed and this isn't in any way sped up. So I can just say Ballot factory deploy and I can see that I need a bytes list. So I use ethers utils format bytes 32 to string. And I'll create two proposals.
02:14:21.030 - 02:15:01.014, Speaker A: Prop one and prop two. Just copy and paste this here and then I'll await my Ballot deployed to see that it's deployed. And then I'll console log out that it's completed. And now we'll test this right away. Click confirm, bam. Deployed pretty fast. So now I'll add in a new function.
02:15:01.014 - 02:15:55.380, Speaker A: I'll copy and paste in there the Give Right to Vote function into the solidity contract. So I've extended it and then I say await my Ballot, giveritovote it's there right away and it helps me to fill in the correct parameters. I await the transaction and I console log out the receipt and I'll go over here and I'll try it again and I'll deploy the contracts and I will run the transaction and there's the receipt. Hello. So Robin thank you. Robin, Julm and Henrik here. Two from Norway, one from Germany.
02:15:55.380 - 02:16:40.080, Speaker A: Did you see what happened there? Yeah, I can just tell you what basically or practically happened. We created a Biddler project which is a tool for creating smart contracts and compiling solid device. We included our react plugin with other Biddler plugins. Then we started our runtime and so it compiles and generates code and interfaces for our front end. Then we just copy pasted random solidity contract in. Then this runtime takes processing. It builders will create a fast list and the code generation is also very fast.
02:16:40.080 - 02:17:12.750, Speaker A: So it's almost immediately available in your IDE in front of them because it's statically code generated. And if we set up deployment, that is also taken care of. And we both have an instance and a factory. So you have both possibilities to let users deploy it or deploy it yourself in the backend. And you can also use providers and both providers. So yeah, changes are reflected immediately. So if you change the contract, it's immediately reflected and I do host reloaded into the front end.
02:17:12.750 - 02:17:48.296, Speaker A: Ready for a QA? This looks great. It looks really useful. And I'm just curious, are you guys smart contract developers? And this is why you realize that this is such a big problem while building stuff. All the yeah, we are creating projects for right now. It's the Norwegian Business Registry and Property in Norway. It's the biggest property manager and patent office in Norway. So yeah, we're creating this smart contract project and it's not in production yet, but we are trying to get it there.
02:17:48.296 - 02:18:47.884, Speaker A: So yeah, we're definitely seeing the need for this and we use the hackathon for two credits. This is super cool. If you guys had more time, how would you improve your submission? We definitely want to put up more configuration for more providers or just put in default configurations for more providers. So you have both the web tree model which practically lets the front end connect to anything and the back end can also connect to anything. So use those. There's many things there. But also we also wanted to actually reach out to the textile sponsor and because we now have this red in the front end and we also see the need for, for example, saving some documents to a centralized storage or somewhere where someone keeps it.
02:18:47.884 - 02:19:48.770, Speaker A: So creating patterns for this so they both can for example create a hash in a smart contract and then upload it in some centralized storage or some decentralized. And Biddler also came just the day after the deadline. Biddler upgraded to hard hat. So we are writing the Hard Hat upgrade for this plugin already and just getting people to use it because we probably have a lot of bugs and many edge cases. We have many places we want to take it and we probably use it a lot. This is fantastic. And could you share how you're thinking about distributing this to more developers, getting more people to use it? Yeah.
02:19:48.770 - 02:20:35.630, Speaker A: So we see that when we are working on our projects, those developers we are talking to don't have any experience with Ethereum, and it's very much to set into. And I have to explain all this tooling that's connected and wired up and how it's all working, and if we could just make that simpler so they can join the project and take responsibility for the code and for the solution. That's what we need. Actually, we hope that someone will use it after seeing this video because it's actually up and working. So anybody can just download it now and try it out, and it's, of course, open source and free and everything. Amen to that. Great work, guys.
02:20:35.630 - 02:20:45.152, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely tweet it, and then we'll retweet you guys. Thanks. Yeah, very cool. Good job. All right. Thanks, guys. Thanks.
02:20:45.152 - 02:21:22.440, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay, so we got two teams left, and the next one up is Dpay. So, Sebastian, please go ahead and play your demo. Hi, everybody. I'm Sebastian from dpay. I'm going to present to you a decentralized payment processing solution that allows developers to easily offer payments to their users. But first, let me take you on a quick journey.
02:21:22.440 - 02:22:15.656, Speaker A: Imagine you are at a very remote location far away from home. You want to pay for a bottle of water in a grocery store, but the cashier asks you for one. 3 million Laoskip. You don't have any of the currency, but the cashier tells you that there is a currency exchange right next door. Unfortunately, nobody at the currency exchange speaks any English. You'll leave without the bottle of water. This little journey represents how most payments in the decentralized Web feel like you want to pay for something, you get sent to an exchange, and then you might or might not return to pay for the initially offered service or product.
02:22:15.656 - 02:23:19.340, Speaker A: I'm glad we were able to raise this experience to a new level. We've built an easy to implement, easy to use payment solution, and I'm going to explain to you in detail how that's working. If you want to receive payments in the decentralized web, you can now use the Dpay payment widget. You configure what payment you would like to receive for your service or product. You then place the payment button, and now, when your users click that button, they will see an easy to use and state of the art payment dialog. In the moment the dialog opens, dpay scans the user's wallet for all assets of value, detects liquidity pools that would allow exchanging the asset to what the seller wants, rates the potential routes, and selects the most efficient route for the user. In this example, it offers to pay in uni tokens.
02:23:19.340 - 02:24:15.810, Speaker A: The seller requested ten compound tokens, but because the user does not have any compound tokens, nor enough Ether. Dpay suggests to use uni tokens as the means of payment, swapping it via uniswap to compound and sending the requested compound to the seller all in one transaction. If the seller asks for a token the user actually has in his wallet, dpay is going to suggest to transfer that token directly as it would be the most efficient route. But the user does not have to stick to the preselected route. Maybe I want to hang on to my die and my Ether so I can just select another token as a means of payment. Hey, finally I can get rid of my kick token. Awesome.
02:24:15.810 - 02:24:55.390, Speaker A: Okay, now let's pay. Wait a little. And done. That was simple. And there is so much more like the wallet connect process or the Wallet installation process, the token approval process, a link to compare swap prices, gas estimates and network fee configuration. And two more things token offerings and token swaps. We would love to see you start using Dpay reach out and we're going to help you implement it.
02:24:55.390 - 02:25:24.900, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Great. Thanks, Sebastian. Over to the judges for comments and questions. Hi Sebastian, did you build this on your own? Yes. Oh wow. It seems very useful.
02:25:24.900 - 02:26:45.088, Speaker A: So do we think I guess how would you roll it out and kind of have start getting folks to use it? Well, getting in contact with people. Like if you get started in the scene you have connections to people that already have built the apps and they kind of require certain payments. And I think the very first step is just like to contact them and ask them, hey, look, this is something that is going to improve your payment system for your users. So how about you just start using it in that way? You're also going to improve the product on its own, like with the first ten users or platforms using the payment, you're going to just improve it and scale that way. Sebastian, this is pretty cool. Can users set rules? Like for example, I don't want to touch these tokens? Actually, during implementation it was like an idea to somehow store configuration of particular users so that the widget always going to use certain presettings for payments just to make it even more convenient. Because convenience is kind of what we're going for here.
02:26:45.088 - 02:28:09.972, Speaker A: Yes, it do you guys charge a fee? No. For direct transfers. There's no fee, there's a discussion. Or there's the idea that because of the way swaps are calculated and the fact that you see a certain payment price in it once and you always have this up to 1% slippage which is also maximum. The idea is to potentially keep the diff that comes with a swap and use that in order to have to fund for the development of the protocol. Sorry, last question from me. Do you need to give like an infinite approval to use any tokens in your account? How does that work from a user experience perspective? And also, is there a trust assumption there that you could spend someone's funds? You need to approve every single token, but we are going for only needing to approve every token once because we want to support multiple exchanges.
02:28:09.972 - 02:29:35.524, Speaker A: And during the hackathon, Uniswap and Moon swap have been implemented and we are going for single token approval because that's like a technical boundary that you can't break in Ethereum One at least, but we try to go for one single approval per token, but then we can use it to pipe it through any exchange. This is super cool. Sebastian, I think you mentioned it, you're framing it as payments, but in terms of sort of like do you see any other applications for this? I see something along the lines of, say, Gitcoin grants where you're almost like donating your spare change, right? To some extent. That idea actually came up during implementation too. I talked about the configuration part and an idea has been pitched in the discord which was configuring to send the difference as a contribution to NGOs. So that could easily be implemented too, storing it as part of the user configuration and have the smart contract send those small amounts as a contribution. Interesting.
02:29:35.524 - 02:29:45.850, Speaker A: Yeah. Loads more of that to come, I'm sure. Thank you for this. Thank you. Thanks, Sebastian. Thanks, Sebastian. Okay.
02:29:45.850 - 02:30:14.210, Speaker A: Okay. Thanks very much. We're going to move on to the next presentation, which is Accept ETH. So Dawson, please go ahead and play your demo when you're ready. Hello, my name is Dawson and I'm the sole developer on Accept ETH. Accept ETH is a website for accepting crypto payments. When you come to Accept, you can create a UI like this for any wallet address.
02:30:14.210 - 02:30:43.300, Speaker A: We support Ethereum and several other cryptocurrencies and it's simple to set up. And as quick as 60 seconds, let me give you a demo here and tell you how I was inspired to build this. GiveWell is a charity platform that aggregates and recommends the highest impact charities out there in the world. They accept donations via cryptocurrency, but unfortunately they've just pasted their wallet addresses here. The issue with this is that it's right for mistake. As you can see here, I've tried to copy already. I've left off one letter.
02:30:43.300 - 02:31:15.500, Speaker A: I could do that just as easily here and accidentally forget a letter at the beginning. In addition to copy paste issues, which of course you can work around if you're extremely careful, this is very difficult to pay to from a mobile wallet. There is no QR code for this except ETH. Fixes this issue. Let me show you how I'm going to go in as if I was GiveWell, trying to replace this component on my website. What you want to do is copy your addresses. Let's start from the top again.
02:31:15.500 - 02:32:01.788, Speaker A: Accept. Let's try to build one. Whoops. This was left over from our previous attempt so when you land here, you're able to add cryptocurrencies, paste them in already. You can see we've created this URL which will take users to the portal to pay this address. But we're going to continue here and add the rest of the addresses. What we've done here is we've URL encoded each and every one of these wallet addresses into an Accept ETH URL.
02:32:01.788 - 02:32:33.244, Speaker A: And what this Accept ETH URL does is it allows you to then get paid to any of those wallets. As you can see here, this text input is easily copyable so that there's no issues. Every part of it is copied. In addition, you can easily pay to this from a mobile wallet by just scanning this QR code up here in the URL. You'll see, every wallet is URL encoded, which means it's stateless. Nowhere is there a database that saves your information. Your wallet addresses are not associated with one another, and your wallet addresses are not associated with your IP address.
02:32:33.244 - 02:33:09.210, Speaker A: Everything goes through the URL. The last feature I'd like to show off is the ability to then validate an address. Let's go see if this Ethereum address is legit or not. Looks like it is. With all these transactions, I can assume I didn't leave off a letter or mess up at all here so I could copy it and go pay for my wallet that's Accept ETH. Next steps are I'd like to be adopted by a platform like GiveWell to replace their UI component here. In addition, after this, I'd like to be able to accept any ERC, any token, and auto convert it to ETH or Die, depending upon what the nonprofit is interested in.
02:33:09.210 - 02:33:40.580, Speaker A: They're not well aware of things like uniswap, so being able to auto swap on their behalf before it ever reaches their wallet would really allow them to accept more funds. And the more funds, the more people get helped with charities like this. Thanks for listening. If you're interested in seeing more about this, go to Accept on Accepte.com. There's a nice description, tells you how you use it and lets you go ahead right at it for free. Thank you for your time. Hi, folks.
02:33:40.580 - 02:34:23.090, Speaker A: Hey, Dawson. This is really cool. I think it's super useful and helpful for folks like you mentioned, the nonprofits and just individuals who want to kind of welcome cryptocurrency payments on their website, but makes it a lot more easy for them through the QR code and through what you've built, I guess. Have you built this all during the hackathon? Yes, I implemented it across the two to three week period. I got started a little bit late and that's why I wanted to mention for sure the things that I hope to incorporate one day, but I wasn't yet able to. Very cool. Yeah, I totally use it.
02:34:23.090 - 02:35:38.440, Speaker A: Thank you. And are there any other sort of Dabs or companies, especially in web two, that you think this might be useful for, aside from nonprofits? I think it's something that when you see this, you're like, why isn't this built already? Why aren't people doing this? Because we do see it as a common issue for a lot of people. Very good question, and I was surprised by the answer to this question as well, which is that there are similar solutions for this on a centralized basis. So Coinbase, for instance, has a product that's to support wallets, you have with them to accept commerce payments. That's called coinbase commerce. I do think that the product, as you've seen here, is especially useful for NGOs or donations. It would need to have some type of validation process in order to be useful for a corporation in that at the moment, it is a way to display your addresses, but it's not a way to query the blockchain for any updates to those addresses.
02:35:38.440 - 02:36:33.400, Speaker A: So I think with those additional features, it would be very useful for what you've just mentioned. And yeah, I actually had a pretty bad experience during the process after I started this project, paying with crypto on a site that used something like this. It was like on overstock.com, it takes three days for the crypto to become USD on overstock, which is crazy because the crypto payment took an hour or less. How long have you been hacking on blockchains for? I've kind of felt like a poser in the blockchain scene since 2014. So I've always been a web person, and in 2014, I made a bunch of really minimal trading scripts with JavaScript. And so the reason I always felt like a poser is because I never understood protocol stuff.
02:36:33.400 - 02:37:17.050, Speaker A: To this day, I get imposter syndrome quite a bit when I start into hackathons like this, for instance. So I really focused on the areas that I know I have a skill set in, which is dynamic web apps, react projects. And I think that there luckily is a gap there to be filled of folks who are really into protocol design or really into implementation of smart contracts, but don't necessarily have the interest or drive to build out UIs and good user experiences. Yeah, that's well said, and I totally agree. I think we all kind of suffer from imposter syndrome in different ways. Right. So if you want to get into the protocol stuff, feel free too, but you did a great job.
02:37:17.050 - 02:37:40.770, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, it's very clean. It's very easy to use. I think it's just really nice to see more interfaces that could bridge the non crypto folks with the crypto market. And generally what we see in the space is that people who are too deep in the space and really aren't trying to bring in new people, and that's what we need also. So this is great. Thank you for the support.
02:37:40.770 - 02:37:56.470, Speaker A: Yeah, keep building. I will. Awesome job. Awesome. All right. Thanks, Austin. Okay, so we've actually got one more project who needs to be moved into our room.
02:37:56.470 - 02:38:34.416, Speaker A: And judges, I've been asked to ask you to please save and then refresh your judging interface, because this last team is going to appear in your list to record auto saves is what I remember. Okay, Jacob, maybe you can clarify. No one really knows. I would just refresh and see what happens. Oh, no. All right, well, that means we can blame you if it doesn't work. All right, put it on me.
02:38:34.416 - 02:38:52.416, Speaker A: The guy who didn't write the code. That's fine. Yeah, that's how this works. Speaking of writing code, wallet Wizard, Sam, please take it away. And I think we're going to play your video. Jacob, do you mind pulling that up? Oh, all right. Sorry.
02:38:52.416 - 02:39:09.950, Speaker A: I didn't notice that everybody on the judge side did a job for you guys. All right. I haven't refreshed yet. Has people refreshed? Who wants to refresh first? Oh, no one's refreshing. I'll refresh. I'll refresh. Here we go.
02:39:09.950 - 02:39:33.010, Speaker A: Suspense Project. Name. Yeah, hold on. Wallet wizard. Got you. My page isn't loading. I don't know what's going on.
02:39:33.010 - 02:39:41.460, Speaker A: That's also normal. Oh, I found it. Wallet wizard. Excellent. And your scores are there. Okay. Following.
02:39:41.460 - 02:40:29.910, Speaker A: All right, when everybody's ready, let me know. Yeah, you go ahead. We're just refreshing the background. All right. My partner, Ryan Cordell. We spend a lot of our time contributing to Ethereum.org, and one of the things we think about most is just how can we improve user onboarding to know? It's a lot of new tech, a lot of new tools to learn, and it can be incredibly intimidating, particularly with main net gas prices this year to be downloading a wallet, to be receiving ETH, to be sending ETH, playing with DApps for the first time with real value.
02:40:29.910 - 02:41:31.720, Speaker A: So with this project, we're hoping to create kind of an interactive tutorial to demonstrate just what it's like interacting with the Ethereum network. So here the user can land on our homepage immediately, get started, and get taken through this wizard like tutorial experience where they can see a wallet getting created. They can learn what exactly that is. They can see the address we just generated for them. They can even receive some ETH. Here we're using the Gorely testnet and shout out to Raul Jordan of the Prismatic team for helping us set up a faucet, but we actually send the user right in our site, some testnet ETH. You can see we got a little captcha just to protect ourselves from spamming the testnet, but then the user can see their recent activity.
02:41:31.720 - 02:42:41.170, Speaker A: They can verify on a real live website that this was propagated to the network, that it's a confirmed transaction at some point. And this is really where we're at in terms of the flow, but where we'd like to go with this is really just continuing to provide more tangible experiences for someone to interact with the network, actually sending funds and transactions to other users. Potentially swapping tokens or interacting with DApps on a testnet just so again, they can get a feel of what it's going to be like in the real main net experience. So a little way to get them familiar with the technology and then send them along their way to actually download a real live secure wallet and to get up and running. So, yeah, would love to hear feedback you guys have and hopefully someday soon you'll see this type of experience right. On Ethereum.org. All right, thanks.
02:42:41.170 - 02:43:45.164, Speaker A: All right over to judges for questions and comments. Hey, Sam. This is cool. I wanted to ask kind of how are you thinking about bringing it to the folks that you're targeting? How do we think about bringing it to you know, it sounds know this is a great portal for folks who are interested in learning about cryptocurrency and you're walking them through with this kind of detail of a very nice UI guide interface, I guess. How are you thinking about getting traction, if you thought that at all? Yeah, well, I am in the fortunate position of working at the Ethereum Foundation on Ethereum.org. So one of the few privileges of that is like, if I build it, they will come. People just kind of show up to the website already.
02:43:45.164 - 02:44:02.000, Speaker A: Exactly. Marketing is like the one piece we don't really need to worry about. This is an unfair advantage for you for the hackathon. It is, yeah. Distribution is a key advantage for us. Yeah. Got you.
02:44:02.000 - 02:44:35.356, Speaker A: That's cool. Good to meet you. Yeah, for sure. But I think just to start in terms of getting it to people, we have a find a wallet and compare wallets experience on the website. So it's really, I guess, aiming to be like a lower barrier or a lower friction point to just test something out. And for a lot of people who come to the site who don't even know what a wallet is yet right. To kind of give that tangible experience for them.
02:44:35.356 - 02:44:55.888, Speaker A: So adding it across the website and on those wallet centric pages, probably. I think what is saying is that she wants to start a TikTok account with this. Really? Oh, okay, cool. That's not a bad idea at all. That's another good option. Yes. Cool.
02:44:55.888 - 02:46:28.752, Speaker A: Get on it. Yes. And what other kind of user journeys would you sort of feature with this? Which other applications? What do you think is important in Ethereum to highlight today? Well, with context of how Ethereum.org exists today and what we've seen is a lot of user journeys are focused around finding a wallet, downloading that, getting ETH, receiving ETH, buying ETH, and then DApps what are DApps? What are example DApps? What can I play around with and test just to learn about? I mean, most people just don't come with context on the use cases that Ethereum is good for. So for us, it's been a lot of thinking about just how can we make testnets more accessible and how can we make them actually useful? Particularly for onboarding as a place where people can risk free. See some of the amazing things that are built and particularly the stuff that I think is interactive to a degree so they can see, hey, this is like a bustling peer to peer network with all this activity. Like, we've done work elsewhere with Ethereum Studio, for instance, which is a developer IDE to build DApps, and it's pretty boring just to build an app that only interacts with itself.
02:46:28.752 - 02:47:30.756, Speaker A: So finding ways that we can have users even interact and communicate with each other is something we'd be hopeful to do, where you send some testnet ETH to this other user and they can draw you some art or issue an NFT. But yeah, we're hoping to kind of eventually add some gamification elements for it to say. Okay, maybe read this article around how to protect your private keys, and then we can issue this PO app to give you a badge of honor for learning about this stuff, a way to kind of push them through the journey in that learning experience. Super cool. Look forward to seeing it more built. Okay, well, if there's no more questions, then I think that's it. And that's it for this judging session as well.
02:47:30.756 - 02:47:46.710, Speaker A: Thanks so much, Sam. Yeah, thanks to judges for pushing through. I'm sure the last one's never easy, but yeah. Thanks for your time. Thanks, Sam. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
02:47:46.710 - 02:48:12.124, Speaker A: Thank you to everyone that presented today that's still on the call and anyone watching this later. Really appreciate all the work you put into all your projects and love to finally see the work product. And thank you to our judges who took so much time on your day. Really appreciate it. I believe Kartik will follow up by email or in chat if there's anything else that we need for you, from you, or any other questions that you have. So thanks so much. Thank you guys.
02:48:12.124 - 02:48:15.530, Speaker A: Awesome job. Thanks, Josh. Thanks, Jacob. Have a great day.
