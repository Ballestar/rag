00:00:05.850 - 00:00:18.400, Speaker A: I feel like Chess already has a whole pitch prepared for this thing. But I'll just ask you the closing sort of piece of it. How can people get involved, what's the next takeaway? And just everything around it.
00:00:18.850 - 00:00:53.310, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Kazik, this is great. I do want to shout out a bunch of our grants members. Imran has done an amazing job, especially coordinating with events besides reviewing grant applications. I'm going to miss out on some people, but yeah, Nick from Gauntlet has done a terrific job. Alex, a bunch of others from the grand staff, so we definitely want to shout out to them. We're forming the developers now. Carbon Page from our team is leading that.
00:00:53.310 - 00:01:54.754, Speaker B: And so if anyone has an interest in basically being part of a small group that's actually working directly for Aavedao and being involved in core development, it's a really cool opportunity. It's, I think, probably the only opportunity among the large DeFi protocols where you can directly work for the Dao and be part of something quite unique. So would recommend applying there? It should be on the Avigrants.org website. I'd say in terms of applying for a grant, we just accept things rolling and so if you have anything that you think could improve the Avi ecosystem, Avi users, the community, feel free to apply. The application is short, should be like 15 minutes, and if you have any questions, just reach out to me or DM the Avi grants Twitter account or something. But yeah, I think that should cover it.
00:01:54.754 - 00:02:53.810, Speaker B: I also want to thank, I guess, the projects that have applied and built things. It definitely is quite inspiring and energizing. The Avi community is really there's a lot of experimentation and openness, I think, of the culture. So definitely want to continue to support those projects and new ones as well. And we'll try to build our process out such that folks who have done a good job in these first rounds of grants get some way that they can be involved in the ecosystem and continue to have their sort of reputation carried within. The people can just reach out on Avi grant's, Twitter or DM me at hello. Shreyas.
00:02:54.790 - 00:03:13.340, Speaker A: Amazing. I also want to make sure that I get to thank you because you have a shout out to everybody, but you're also a big part of that whole process and ecosystem. So thanks for kind of helping out with everything and thanks for an amazing set of talks today and talking about all the insights from Structuring, the Ave grants and everything that's next.
00:03:13.790 - 00:03:17.210, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. Really had a great time. Thanks everyone. Amazing.
00:03:17.280 - 00:03:53.202, Speaker A: Well, thanks everybody for watching in. And I want to give also a really big special shout out to Bill Zero X for just really being super amazing on the chat here, just giving all the additional context from all the things that we're talking about on chat. So Bill, keep doing that. And also, everybody sign up for the Avenues substac. So with that, I want to close this off today, and we'll all see you on discord with the rest of the hackathon. For those of you who are interested in Governance and Dows, we'll see you tomorrow again at 12:00 p.m.. Eastern on Equivalent TV for the Governance and Dow Summit.
00:03:53.202 - 00:03:59.060, Speaker A: So happy, happy hacking everybody and enjoy some lo fi beats. In the meantime, take care.
