00:00:00.090 - 00:00:20.686, Speaker A: Everybody. Thanks for joining. Today's workshop is with G from Circle, and the workshop is how to build a modern payments experience for your NFT marketplace. And with that, I will pass. Thanks for joining. Today's workshop is with G from Circle. Sorry about that.
00:00:20.686 - 00:00:26.630, Speaker A: There was a bit of like an echo there. But yeah, let me pass it over to G and he'll take over the workshop.
00:00:28.490 - 00:00:30.200, Speaker B: Cool, thank you.
00:00:31.370 - 00:00:37.240, Speaker C: I'm guessing everyone can hear me fine. Quick nod? I think so. Okay.
00:00:38.330 - 00:00:42.506, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. I hope you're all having a great day so far. I know it's been an early set.
00:00:42.528 - 00:00:45.100, Speaker C: Of workshops for people on the west coast like me.
00:00:45.550 - 00:00:47.446, Speaker B: My name is Ji Chuang, and I'm.
00:00:47.478 - 00:00:49.210, Speaker C: A product manager at Circle.
00:00:49.950 - 00:00:53.566, Speaker B: I oversee the development of our APIs, and today I'm going to walk you.
00:00:53.588 - 00:01:01.630, Speaker C: Through how you can leverage our services and build a modern payments experience for your NFT product or marketplace.
00:01:02.770 - 00:01:10.974, Speaker B: So I'm sure with the audience we have here today, we've all seen and witnessed over the last several months NFTs really going mainstream.
00:01:11.102 - 00:01:13.374, Speaker C: We've seen NBA TOPSHOT get a tremendous.
00:01:13.422 - 00:01:14.734, Speaker B: Amount of media attention.
00:01:14.862 - 00:01:26.040, Speaker C: We've seen well known artists and musicians put out great NFT content. We've also seen large companies, celebrities and athletes respond very quickly to the recent surge in interest.
00:01:26.650 - 00:01:30.890, Speaker B: I think it was just yesterday I saw news about Charmin, the toilet paper.
00:01:30.960 - 00:01:35.162, Speaker C: Company had toilet paper themed NFT art.
00:01:35.296 - 00:01:44.586, Speaker B: I think they called it NFTP. But I think luckily, I saw that the proceeds are primarily benefiting charity. So I see that as a good.
00:01:44.768 - 00:01:47.920, Speaker C: Know building interest, but benefiting people in need.
00:01:48.610 - 00:01:52.766, Speaker B: So, I mean, while some people are treating this as like a marketing opportunity.
00:01:52.868 - 00:01:54.286, Speaker C: And perhaps they're trying to make a.
00:01:54.308 - 00:01:56.994, Speaker B: Quick buck, I think a lot of.
00:01:57.032 - 00:02:02.466, Speaker C: Others, including most of you here, see the longer term value around NFTs and.
00:02:02.488 - 00:02:03.954, Speaker B: Are looking to build a product or.
00:02:03.992 - 00:02:11.174, Speaker C: Service with long term value. And at Circle, we think that part of that long term success comes with having a very seamless user experience and.
00:02:11.212 - 00:02:17.814, Speaker B: In our particular case, around payments. So my goal today here is to.
00:02:17.852 - 00:02:24.602, Speaker C: Hopefully nudge you toward letting us join you along for that ride. So first, a little bit of intro.
00:02:24.656 - 00:02:26.026, Speaker B: About Circle and what we do.
00:02:26.128 - 00:02:28.090, Speaker C: You probably know about USDC.
00:02:28.510 - 00:02:35.930, Speaker B: It's the world's leading, fully reserved, regulated stablecoin. Along with Coinbase, circle is a founding.
00:02:36.010 - 00:02:42.750, Speaker C: Member of the center consortium, and we developed and launched USDC in 2018.
00:02:43.090 - 00:02:46.414, Speaker B: We've seen, similar to NFT's, tremendous growth.
00:02:46.462 - 00:02:47.650, Speaker C: Over the last year.
00:02:47.800 - 00:02:49.314, Speaker B: And as of this morning, we find.
00:02:49.352 - 00:02:52.930, Speaker C: Ourselves approaching close to 10 billion USDC in circulation.
00:02:53.750 - 00:02:57.634, Speaker B: Another thing we do, and kind of the focus of the talk today, is.
00:02:57.672 - 00:02:59.666, Speaker C: That we also help companies leverage USDC.
00:02:59.698 - 00:03:01.494, Speaker B: And Blockchains in general to create really.
00:03:01.532 - 00:03:05.670, Speaker C: Flexible and powerful payment solutions for their online businesses.
00:03:06.090 - 00:03:07.446, Speaker B: So as you'll see through the rest.
00:03:07.468 - 00:03:13.450, Speaker C: Of this talk, we help companies bridge the on chain ecosystem with traditional banking.
00:03:14.830 - 00:03:18.346, Speaker B: Giving your company and your customers a.
00:03:18.368 - 00:03:21.330, Speaker C: Lot of flexibility when it comes to how they want to transact.
00:03:21.510 - 00:03:23.834, Speaker B: A great example that showcases our APIs.
00:03:23.882 - 00:03:34.078, Speaker C: At work is Dapper Labs, and recently they're a very successful product, NBA TOPSHOT. So if you guys are like me, you've probably made countless attempts waiting in.
00:03:34.084 - 00:03:40.034, Speaker B: Line for NBA TOPSHOT pack drops. I believe there's one in 2 hours. Hopefully you've made it through a few.
00:03:40.072 - 00:04:00.394, Speaker C: Times, and if you have, you've likely gone through their Circle powered checkout process. So if you've ever used a credit or debit card to buy an NBA TOPSHOT pack or moment, if you've ever used your credit card or debit card to top up your Dapper wallet balance, then you've used Circle's APIs indirectly. So using our APIs, dapper Labs has.
00:04:00.432 - 00:04:03.754, Speaker B: Built their entire checkout flow on top.
00:04:03.792 - 00:04:14.320, Speaker C: Of crypto native infrastructure. Customers'card payments settle to them as USDC, which allows Dapper to use those funds in very, very flexible ways.
00:04:15.890 - 00:04:22.318, Speaker B: Before getting into a few sample flows of our API, I think it'd be helpful to introduce the API at a.
00:04:22.324 - 00:04:28.180, Speaker C: High level and explain why I think it fits very naturally into NFT products both today and into the future.
00:04:29.670 - 00:04:34.814, Speaker B: So if you're participating in this hackathon, your end product is likely an NFT.
00:04:34.942 - 00:04:37.506, Speaker C: Or an NFT type of product or marketplace.
00:04:37.618 - 00:04:39.526, Speaker B: That token is, of course, native to.
00:04:39.548 - 00:04:50.986, Speaker C: The blockchain, and so it inherits all of the benefits of being on chain that we're all familiar with in the ideal future world we all hope to see sooner rather than later.
00:04:51.088 - 00:04:56.074, Speaker B: Payments, hopefully are all fully crypto native, too. We're not quite there today, but even.
00:04:56.112 - 00:05:07.040, Speaker C: Today, for your customers who already do hold USDC and are kind of crypto savvy, circle's APIs allow you to process on chain payments and payouts that settle within minutes.
00:05:07.410 - 00:05:09.514, Speaker B: Payments are, as we all know, irreversible.
00:05:09.562 - 00:05:15.650, Speaker C: Once sent, so there's no such thing as chargeback risk. And that perfectly mirrors how you would.
00:05:15.720 - 00:05:31.254, Speaker B: Transfer NFTs as well once you send it. Once someone receives can't, you can't get it back. And lastly, because our payments are denominated in USD through USDC, you can combine the benefits of all this powerful on.
00:05:31.292 - 00:05:41.238, Speaker C: Chain payment infrastructure with a consumer friendly way to price things. Marketplaces do price ETH. Do price things in ETH sometimes, and.
00:05:41.244 - 00:05:44.230, Speaker B: I think that works really well for certain crypto savvy audiences.
00:05:44.310 - 00:05:48.294, Speaker C: But for a mass market product like NBA TOPSHOT, for example, I think USD.
00:05:48.342 - 00:05:49.754, Speaker B: Pricing is going to be much more.
00:05:49.792 - 00:05:58.030, Speaker C: Widely understood both by buyers and sellers. So before we reach a future state.
00:05:58.180 - 00:06:02.926, Speaker B: Where everyone has USDC, everyone has ethereum wallets, we need to make sure that.
00:06:02.948 - 00:06:13.662, Speaker C: We play nice with existing rails as well. So along with on chain USDC payments, circle also supports a variety of traditional payment methods like credit and debit cards.
00:06:13.806 - 00:06:18.440, Speaker B: ACH transfers, and wire payments, with more coming soon.
00:06:18.970 - 00:06:26.210, Speaker C: So with a single integration with our APIs, you can serve both your crypto savvy users as well as mainstream audiences.
00:06:26.370 - 00:06:28.038, Speaker B: And we think that providing this type.
00:06:28.044 - 00:06:37.658, Speaker C: Of optionality for your users is very subtle, but is a super important part of a great user experience that we talked about earlier. So we're going to jump in a.
00:06:37.664 - 00:06:40.410, Speaker B: Little bit to circle APIs.
00:06:41.330 - 00:06:46.842, Speaker C: So first, along with a few other resources we have in the APIs, payments.
00:06:46.906 - 00:06:49.166, Speaker B: Payouts and wallets are sort of the.
00:06:49.188 - 00:07:02.850, Speaker C: Core building blocks of the API. Payments are what we call the incoming transactions you'll see either from your users and buyers or from your own deposits, from your own funding sources.
00:07:03.350 - 00:07:05.186, Speaker B: Payouts are when you send funds off.
00:07:05.208 - 00:07:15.160, Speaker C: The Circle platform so that's when you pay out sellers or vendors or when you wish to withdraw your own earnings, your own money. Wallets, finally, are a core part of.
00:07:15.610 - 00:07:20.394, Speaker B: A subset of our APIs called digital dollar accounts. And what they allow you to do.
00:07:20.512 - 00:07:23.738, Speaker C: Is build out a digital wallet infrastructure for your business.
00:07:23.904 - 00:07:25.866, Speaker B: And we'll touch on that more in.
00:07:25.888 - 00:07:29.626, Speaker C: A couple of minutes. So we can start off with a.
00:07:29.648 - 00:07:32.958, Speaker B: Really simple payments flow here, where a.
00:07:32.964 - 00:07:41.200, Speaker C: Buyer purchases a product with their credit card, and at a later time, the seller withdraws that USD that USDC to their bank account.
00:07:44.230 - 00:07:57.666, Speaker B: So jumping into the API implementation, I've sort of kind of redacted some of the requests and responses just for brevity here. But creating a card is super simple. You make a request to our cards.
00:07:57.698 - 00:08:00.102, Speaker C: Endpoint, you pass in encrypted card number.
00:08:00.156 - 00:08:04.854, Speaker B: Details, and what you get back is essentially a resource, an ID that points.
00:08:04.892 - 00:08:11.210, Speaker C: To that Visa card. In this instance, using that Safe card.
00:08:11.360 - 00:08:17.098, Speaker B: Making a payment is also super easy. You pass in the ID of the.
00:08:17.104 - 00:08:21.338, Speaker C: Card that you just created. You pass in the amount, in this case, $50.
00:08:21.424 - 00:08:24.030, Speaker B: What you get back is a payment.
00:08:24.100 - 00:08:27.790, Speaker C: Object with an ID. The status initially is pending.
00:08:28.450 - 00:08:31.278, Speaker B: What we need to do is reach out to the bank, reach out to.
00:08:31.284 - 00:08:37.410, Speaker C: The card network, make sure the credit card is good, make sure there are sufficient funds and everything.
00:08:37.560 - 00:08:39.060, Speaker B: But within a few minutes.
00:08:40.790 - 00:08:42.030, Speaker C: You'Ll typically.
00:08:42.110 - 00:08:45.234, Speaker B: See through webhooks that we have set.
00:08:45.272 - 00:08:47.874, Speaker C: Up that a payment has been confirmed.
00:08:47.922 - 00:08:54.134, Speaker B: So you'll receive a payment confirmation to a webhook notifications URL that you set up with us.
00:08:54.172 - 00:09:00.694, Speaker C: We'll ping you whenever a payment reaches or changes state. So in this case, you'll see that the status is confirmed.
00:09:00.742 - 00:09:03.338, Speaker B: What that means, and that typically happens.
00:09:03.504 - 00:09:07.562, Speaker C: Soon after payment, is that the card is good, the funds are good.
00:09:07.696 - 00:09:09.478, Speaker B: It doesn't quite mean that we've settled.
00:09:09.574 - 00:09:13.486, Speaker C: The money with you yet, but it's going to succeed. And so at that point, you have.
00:09:13.508 - 00:09:15.786, Speaker B: Confidence that you can release the NFT item.
00:09:15.818 - 00:09:16.958, Speaker C: You can process the payment.
00:09:17.044 - 00:09:26.546, Speaker B: You can credit your user's balance. A couple of days later, I believe it's maybe three or four business days later, you'll see a separate event coming.
00:09:26.568 - 00:09:29.422, Speaker C: Through Webhooks that says that payment has settled.
00:09:29.486 - 00:09:31.954, Speaker B: Settlement means that not only was the.
00:09:31.992 - 00:09:39.046, Speaker C: Card charged successful, but you've now been credited that amount of USD, along with.
00:09:39.068 - 00:09:40.454, Speaker B: All the other payments that happened that.
00:09:40.492 - 00:09:42.440, Speaker C: Day into your Circle account.
00:09:44.250 - 00:09:48.454, Speaker B: So once settlement happens or either, I mean, even before settlement happens, at any.
00:09:48.492 - 00:09:54.700, Speaker C: Point, you can check the balance of your account. In this case, if we remember, the previous charge was for $50.
00:09:55.310 - 00:09:57.126, Speaker B: After you receive settlement and you query.
00:09:57.158 - 00:09:58.506, Speaker C: Your balance, you may see that you.
00:09:58.528 - 00:10:02.902, Speaker B: Now have $50 available, let's say yesterday.
00:10:02.966 - 00:10:14.026, Speaker C: Or the day before you had another charge come in for $20 that hasn't quite settled yet. You'll also be able to see the amount that's currently unsettled. So any amount that's available here is.
00:10:14.068 - 00:10:17.806, Speaker B: Something that you can withdraw through fiat.
00:10:17.838 - 00:10:27.942, Speaker C: Rails, on chain, et cetera. So once you have those $50, let's say you want to pay out to a bank account. I kind of skipped over one step.
00:10:27.996 - 00:10:30.438, Speaker B: Here, which is creation and linking of.
00:10:30.444 - 00:10:33.000, Speaker C: A bank account, in this case, an ACH account.
00:10:33.450 - 00:10:39.030, Speaker B: So we have an integration with plaid, as some of you might be familiar with their services.
00:10:39.100 - 00:10:47.734, Speaker C: It allows you to take a user's bank account information with them, authenticating with their financial institution.
00:10:47.782 - 00:10:51.046, Speaker B: Let's say it's chase or wells fargo or bank of america.
00:10:51.078 - 00:11:01.790, Speaker C: It's all done in a very secure way where neither you nor us have to touch their bank credentials. They log in through plaid. Typically, there's a two factor, two step.
00:11:01.860 - 00:11:09.346, Speaker B: Authentication process, and we get a token. You get a token that allows us to fetch their bank account and routing information.
00:11:09.528 - 00:11:30.230, Speaker C: And with that information, we can validate that the bank account is correct, that it's owned by the right person, and then we can start to make payments and payouts from that account. So here I'm assuming that's all been done already. You have an ACH account that's linked. You provide the wallet that you had $50 on. Here I miswrote 300.
00:11:30.300 - 00:11:33.018, Speaker B: You probably don't have 300 based on the example that we have.
00:11:33.104 - 00:11:37.754, Speaker C: But if you were to withdraw $50 right now to that bank account, you.
00:11:37.792 - 00:11:42.678, Speaker B: Would see a created payout object below.
00:11:42.784 - 00:11:46.778, Speaker C: That status is pending for ACH payouts.
00:11:46.794 - 00:11:48.974, Speaker B: On our side, it's typically the fact.
00:11:49.012 - 00:12:08.214, Speaker C: That you'll see funds available in your bank account as soon as the next business day. Similar to payments, you'll get a webhook notification when that status of that payout moves to completed. So if some of your sellers or.
00:12:08.252 - 00:12:14.374, Speaker B: Yourself don't necessarily want to pay out to a bank account, another option is.
00:12:14.412 - 00:12:24.058, Speaker C: To pay out on chain. So in this case, instead of a destination being an ACH account, it's a blockchain type of destination you pass in your ethereum address.
00:12:24.224 - 00:12:27.818, Speaker B: You specify the chain. You specify the chain because USDC is.
00:12:27.824 - 00:12:31.982, Speaker C: Supported on a handful, I think, four different chains at the moment.
00:12:32.116 - 00:12:33.486, Speaker B: So you specify the chain and the.
00:12:33.508 - 00:12:38.698, Speaker C: Address, and then you specify the amount. It deducts that amount from your wallet.
00:12:38.874 - 00:12:41.966, Speaker B: And similarly you receive a payout object.
00:12:42.148 - 00:12:45.140, Speaker C: That Payout object looks slightly different from.
00:12:45.910 - 00:12:47.650, Speaker B: A regular payout to a bank account.
00:12:47.720 - 00:12:49.054, Speaker C: In that it has a transaction.
00:12:49.102 - 00:12:56.526, Speaker B: Hash you can check that on Ether scan. Similarly, the status is pending. After, I think maybe twelve or so.
00:12:56.568 - 00:13:02.198, Speaker C: Block confirmations, that status will flip to complete. You can monitor the transaction, hash, you.
00:13:02.204 - 00:13:06.102, Speaker B: Can set up webhooks. Either way, you'll be notified when the.
00:13:06.156 - 00:13:15.046, Speaker C: Payment has been received, the payout has been received. So that's a simple flow from one buyer to one seller.
00:13:15.158 - 00:13:17.706, Speaker B: They paid with their credit card, the.
00:13:17.728 - 00:13:21.310, Speaker C: Seller withdrew through their bank account or through USDC.
00:13:21.970 - 00:13:27.518, Speaker B: From there you can build out additional functionality. And I talked about the wallets and.
00:13:27.524 - 00:13:44.322, Speaker C: The digital dollar accounts a little bit earlier. So what that product does is digital dollar accounts handle your wallet infrastructure. You can create wallets for all your users, whether your user is a buyer or your user is a seller. Essentially you create a wallet, you attribute it to them.
00:13:44.456 - 00:13:47.410, Speaker B: What we've seen, and I'll touch on this in a little bit, is that.
00:13:47.480 - 00:13:54.886, Speaker C: Giving users balances, as opposed to just using saved cards improves the stickiness. Once they have a balance, they feel.
00:13:54.908 - 00:13:55.846, Speaker B: Like they need to use it, and.
00:13:55.868 - 00:13:57.400, Speaker C: Then they stay on the site longer.
00:13:58.010 - 00:14:01.770, Speaker B: Topping up a balance is as simple as making any sort of payment.
00:14:01.840 - 00:14:04.118, Speaker C: They can use their card or bank.
00:14:04.214 - 00:14:09.466, Speaker B: Or directly send in USDC if they have it. What we've also seen is that when.
00:14:09.488 - 00:14:10.618, Speaker C: You have a payment flow, when you.
00:14:10.624 - 00:14:20.846, Speaker B: Have a checkout flow that doesn't ask someone for their credit card, or doesn't ask someone for their CVV, or doesn't ask someone to authorize an ACH payment, you can get to a really simple.
00:14:20.948 - 00:14:22.750, Speaker C: One click checkout solution.
00:14:25.490 - 00:14:30.740, Speaker B: I think the funny thing I was interested in last night was like, I was writing this up and then I was like, oh.
00:14:31.270 - 00:14:36.006, Speaker C: Wallets and balances can make your app super sticky because people carry value with.
00:14:36.028 - 00:14:37.640, Speaker B: Them at the same time.
00:14:38.730 - 00:14:40.914, Speaker C: It makes your checkout flow super smooth.
00:14:40.962 - 00:14:42.514, Speaker B: They don't have to enter payment details.
00:14:42.562 - 00:14:55.686, Speaker C: They see their balance one click checkout. So we can walk through a little bit how you would do that. The wallets endpoint very similar in ease of use to our payments.
00:14:55.718 - 00:14:58.726, Speaker B: Payouts and bank accounts endpoints.
00:14:58.918 - 00:15:01.722, Speaker C: You just create a bank account. You create a wallet here.
00:15:01.856 - 00:15:03.914, Speaker B: You specify a description for it that's.
00:15:03.962 - 00:15:10.926, Speaker C: Just for internal purposes. We return a wallet ID here with a balance initially set to zero.
00:15:11.108 - 00:15:12.586, Speaker B: So now you can take this wallet.
00:15:12.618 - 00:15:16.446, Speaker C: ID 43400, or whatever it is, attribute.
00:15:16.478 - 00:15:18.002, Speaker B: It to a user on your side.
00:15:18.056 - 00:15:29.474, Speaker C: Whether it's a buyer, whether it's a seller or someone else. That's now just kind of an object that can store value to receive funds.
00:15:29.522 - 00:15:34.258, Speaker B: Let's say in this case, one of your customers has existing USDC on Ethereum.
00:15:34.434 - 00:15:40.634, Speaker C: You can request a deposit address. So you pass in the wallet ID. You ask for an address, and we.
00:15:40.672 - 00:15:45.002, Speaker B: Return you an ethereum address that will.
00:15:45.056 - 00:15:53.834, Speaker C: Credit this wallet when USDC is received. Since this is sort of a push payment where your end user, your buyer.
00:15:53.882 - 00:15:57.902, Speaker B: Your seller, is initiating an ERC 20.
00:15:57.956 - 00:15:59.294, Speaker C: Send on their side.
00:15:59.492 - 00:16:04.674, Speaker B: Similarly, we will give you webhook notifications whenever a wallet that you own has.
00:16:04.712 - 00:16:19.366, Speaker C: Received USDC and it's been confirmed. So now in this case, you imagine you've created a wallet for a buyer. They've funded that wallet with USDC. So now they have a balance on.
00:16:19.388 - 00:16:23.494, Speaker B: Your site, transferring their payment, transferring their.
00:16:23.612 - 00:16:30.370, Speaker C: Balance, part of their balance to another user. In this case, a seller is also very fast and very instant.
00:16:30.450 - 00:16:31.722, Speaker B: So all you need to do is.
00:16:31.776 - 00:16:45.726, Speaker C: Specify the source and the destination. In this case, the source might be your buyer and your destination might be your seller. So you pass in those two objects, you pass in an amount. And unlike the credit card and the.
00:16:45.748 - 00:16:50.000, Speaker B: ACH payments that go through pending for a couple of days before they're final.
00:16:50.610 - 00:16:58.514, Speaker C: Transfers from wallets to wallets are instant. So from there, you can sort of.
00:16:58.552 - 00:17:03.906, Speaker B: Imagine how you could build out a much more complex marketplace product.
00:17:04.088 - 00:17:09.378, Speaker C: You can have many buyers with stored value in their balances.
00:17:09.554 - 00:17:13.030, Speaker B: Paying through any fiat or crypto means.
00:17:13.100 - 00:17:16.550, Speaker C: That they need they can transact with any seller.
00:17:17.050 - 00:17:22.490, Speaker B: And those sellers can similarly be paid out in crypto, be paid out in fiat.
00:17:22.830 - 00:17:55.262, Speaker C: However, they need things to happen. A very great example here again, is with Dapper Labs. So beyond the initial sale of a crypto kitty or a TOPSHOT pack, buyers and sellers can also connect on their marketplace to transact in a more peer to peer fashion. So buyers can buy from any seller. And additionally, they have choice when it comes to their payment method. For the sellers on TOPSHOT marketplace, for example, they can keep their funds on Dapper. Maybe they're a buyer as well.
00:17:55.416 - 00:17:57.058, Speaker B: Or they can also withdraw their funds.
00:17:57.074 - 00:17:59.714, Speaker C: On chain or to an external USDC.
00:17:59.762 - 00:18:08.698, Speaker B: Wallet or to their bank account. So hopefully that has given you a.
00:18:08.704 - 00:18:14.570, Speaker C: Good overview of our APIs. So as you're thinking about building out.
00:18:14.640 - 00:18:22.702, Speaker B: Your NFT product or marketplace over this weekend, over the next several months, and as you think about needing to create.
00:18:22.756 - 00:18:25.134, Speaker C: A flexible payments experience for your customers.
00:18:25.252 - 00:18:32.334, Speaker B: Hopefully you think of us. We'll help you bridge the crypto and fiat worlds. We'll help you give your buyers and.
00:18:32.372 - 00:18:40.114, Speaker C: Sellers choice, and we'll also handle your wallets infrastructure for all parties involved. Hopefully this frees you up to really.
00:18:40.152 - 00:18:43.758, Speaker B: Focus on building out the rest of your experience and creating that long term.
00:18:43.774 - 00:18:45.220, Speaker C: Value that we talked about.
00:18:46.630 - 00:18:48.600, Speaker B: So thanks for watching.
00:18:49.130 - 00:18:59.666, Speaker C: I hope you all learned a little bit about our circle APIs. If you're building something this weekend, visit our sandbox link above and get access to API keys. You can start your integration today.
00:18:59.788 - 00:19:11.798, Speaker B: If you've got questions, we've got API references and guides at developer Circle or you can find me and other members of our team at the hashtag pound.
00:19:11.814 - 00:19:18.798, Speaker C: Sign sponsor Circle channel on the ETHGlobal Discord server. And lastly, you know, just personally I.
00:19:18.804 - 00:19:20.846, Speaker B: Think this is a super interesting space.
00:19:20.948 - 00:19:22.400, Speaker C: I think it's super early.
00:19:23.170 - 00:19:24.914, Speaker B: What we're seeing today is really just.
00:19:24.952 - 00:19:28.082, Speaker C: A glimpse of what NFTs could become over the next several years.
00:19:28.216 - 00:19:29.426, Speaker B: And I wish you all the best.
00:19:29.448 - 00:19:32.180, Speaker C: Of luck during the hackathon this weekend. Thanks.
00:19:36.010 - 00:19:53.610, Speaker A: Thanks so much. G, that was really great. Yeah, incredible presentation. I see there's one or two questions in the chat. I can read the first one out, which is, is Circle like a stripe for crypto?
00:19:56.510 - 00:19:57.722, Speaker C: You could say that.
00:19:57.856 - 00:20:00.874, Speaker B: I think we similarly try to make.
00:20:01.072 - 00:20:03.326, Speaker C: Payments super simple for your company.
00:20:03.508 - 00:20:07.498, Speaker B: We definitely have a focus on being crypto native.
00:20:07.674 - 00:20:09.902, Speaker C: That's the direction we see things going.
00:20:10.036 - 00:20:11.806, Speaker B: And so we're always going to be.
00:20:11.908 - 00:20:13.940, Speaker C: Moving very quickly on that front.
00:20:14.310 - 00:20:16.946, Speaker B: Additionally, and I think stripe may as.
00:20:16.968 - 00:20:23.842, Speaker C: Well, we have a lot of treasury products live and in the works where.
00:20:23.976 - 00:20:26.066, Speaker B: You can store your USDC, you can.
00:20:26.088 - 00:20:27.686, Speaker C: Make good use of it as well.
00:20:27.708 - 00:20:31.894, Speaker B: So I think there's definitely similarities, but we have a really strong focus on.
00:20:32.092 - 00:20:36.070, Speaker C: Supporting companies that are building products or services on chain.
00:20:38.170 - 00:20:48.042, Speaker A: Great. And the next question is from Isaac. I'm not sure if you want to unmute yourself and ask the question live, otherwise I can also read that out.
00:20:48.176 - 00:20:54.110, Speaker D: Sure. Can the user wallets that Circle generates be used to interact with any arbitrary smart contract?
00:21:00.060 - 00:21:04.716, Speaker C: The wallets that you create for Circle accounts are not they're on chain in.
00:21:04.738 - 00:21:06.376, Speaker B: The sense that you can create deposit.
00:21:06.408 - 00:21:17.356, Speaker C: Addresses for them and they understand ERC 20 send. But the address or the wallet itself is not necessarily a smart contract that.
00:21:17.378 - 00:21:26.064, Speaker B: Will naturally plug into other functionality. So over time, as we need to.
00:21:26.102 - 00:21:35.428, Speaker C: Interact with other protocols, let's say we'll certainly add functionality on top of the wallet, but the wallet itself is kind.
00:21:35.434 - 00:21:39.924, Speaker B: Of like you can think of it as a centralized wallet, but we'll add.
00:21:39.962 - 00:21:41.652, Speaker C: Functionality on top of it over time.
00:21:41.706 - 00:21:43.924, Speaker B: So I don't see too many things.
00:21:43.962 - 00:21:45.252, Speaker C: That wouldn't be possible.
00:21:45.386 - 00:21:53.370, Speaker D: I guess the root of my question is like today, if I generated a user account, could I and someone buys an ERC 721, can I send that to their Circle wallet address?
00:21:59.820 - 00:22:02.956, Speaker C: Like, I think you could send it.
00:22:02.978 - 00:22:08.912, Speaker B: I'll have to check with our engineering team and if you hop into the Discord server, I can make sure I get a good answer for you.
00:22:08.966 - 00:22:18.608, Speaker C: I don't believe today that the contracts that we deploy for your deposit address will properly be able to handle non ERC 20.
00:22:18.694 - 00:22:25.572, Speaker B: So it might be the case that it's there, but it's stuck. So I can try to find someone on our team to really make sure.
00:22:25.626 - 00:22:28.390, Speaker C: You get the answer to that. Okay, thanks.
00:22:31.820 - 00:22:41.000, Speaker A: Cool. And then there's a question that came in from YouTube, which is, can I exchange a token for USDC or die?
00:22:44.860 - 00:22:49.800, Speaker C: The Circle wallets and their deposit addresses.
00:22:53.160 - 00:23:01.620, Speaker B: Only today. Understand. And they can all receive any ERC 20 token. I want to make sure I don't.
00:23:01.700 - 00:23:04.328, Speaker C: Say that you can or should send.
00:23:04.494 - 00:23:07.370, Speaker B: Any other unsupported ERC 20 token today.
00:23:08.620 - 00:23:10.120, Speaker C: But it is built in a general.
00:23:10.190 - 00:23:19.816, Speaker B: Way where it receives ERC 20 tokens. And so over time, as we find the need to support any assets beyond.
00:23:19.928 - 00:23:33.200, Speaker C: USDC, we certainly have that capability. But today our product isn't meant to kind of receive and honor and represent back to you tokens other than USDC.
00:23:37.160 - 00:23:47.060, Speaker A: Okay, cool. If anybody else has a question, feel free to unmute yourself and ask live or drop a question if you're a bit shy.
00:23:47.480 - 00:24:15.100, Speaker E: Yeah, I have a question. I just want to start off saying Circle seems like an amazing product, so super cool to learn more about it. One question I had is, I know crypto payments are like, once you send it, you can't get your money back. So what if you like I'm kind of curious to know, in this fiat and crypto dynamic, what if somebody disputes their credit card statement? Who takes a liability?
00:24:15.180 - 00:24:15.810, Speaker A: There?
00:24:19.860 - 00:24:40.744, Speaker B: Ultimately the merchant, which is our customer in this case. So we do experience chargebacks after the fact after four business days, after USDC has been minted. And it's ultimately our customers responsibility to.
00:24:40.942 - 00:24:47.690, Speaker C: Have funds to handle chargebacks in the cases we've seen, because of the vetting we do on our customers.
00:24:49.500 - 00:25:00.396, Speaker B: We generally onboard companies with strong business use cases. And there is the possibility that we.
00:25:00.418 - 00:25:03.230, Speaker C: Need to take USDC back.
00:25:04.880 - 00:25:06.364, Speaker B: You're right that we can't do that.
00:25:06.402 - 00:25:09.696, Speaker C: On an on chain fashion, but the.
00:25:09.798 - 00:25:12.336, Speaker B: USDC that settles with our customers in.
00:25:12.358 - 00:25:16.144, Speaker C: Their Circle accounts, it is backed by.
00:25:16.182 - 00:25:25.924, Speaker B: USDC that's on chain, but we can. And we do need to be able to kind of take that back, and then we burn the USDC that was.
00:25:25.962 - 00:25:29.610, Speaker C: Backing that, if that answers your question.
00:25:31.660 - 00:25:32.970, Speaker E: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:25:36.700 - 00:25:53.870, Speaker A: Cool. And then another question from YouTube is, do you expect to support other stable coins at any point, such as USDT, UST. Et cetera, or will things stay with USDC as you are involved with the development of it?
00:25:56.820 - 00:26:13.040, Speaker B: I wouldn't know. Never say never. But I think our focus is definitely on building out the USDC ecosystem. We have strong reasons to think that the way we're implementing stablecoins is a very long term strategic approach.
00:26:13.200 - 00:26:20.600, Speaker C: As for other stable coins outside of USD, I think certainly so whether it's.
00:26:21.020 - 00:26:24.264, Speaker B: Euro, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar, any other.
00:26:24.382 - 00:26:26.650, Speaker C: Large market, not necessarily large market, but.
00:26:27.580 - 00:26:30.100, Speaker B: Any global currency that's a stable coin.
00:26:30.260 - 00:26:36.830, Speaker C: I could see that happening over time. As for other USD denominated currencies, I'm not as sure.
00:26:41.840 - 00:26:47.010, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks so much, G. If there are no other questions.
00:26:49.380 - 00:27:15.960, Speaker E: Can I ask one more? I guess one thing I was also curious about was if I create a Circle account. Do I have to sign up as a so like in this NFT hack? I'm like going to be just hacking solo. So I was just wondering how that would work. Especially I know with using Braintree you usually have to put in your company's tax statements or whatever. So just curious how that would work.
00:27:16.030 - 00:27:16.360, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:16.430 - 00:27:29.340, Speaker B: So ultimately, if you want to go live, struggle is not really meant for personal use. It's not kind of like a retail commercial product.
00:27:29.410 - 00:27:30.030, Speaker C: That.
00:27:32.640 - 00:27:39.212, Speaker B: What you can do and what everyone should do this weekend is use our sandbox. So if you go to my sandbox.
00:27:39.276 - 00:27:41.170, Speaker C: Circle, you can sign up.
00:27:42.180 - 00:27:48.132, Speaker B: It may or may not say business name, but those are not fields that we need to kind of run through.
00:27:48.186 - 00:27:52.352, Speaker C: For the typical flow when we're onboarding.
00:27:52.416 - 00:28:05.384, Speaker B: Like a production customer. So if you go through sandbox and you operate in the sandbox environment, it's completely self serve. You can get APIs keys within minutes and you can start hacking as you.
00:28:05.422 - 00:28:08.136, Speaker C: Approach wanting to go live.
00:28:08.318 - 00:28:14.600, Speaker B: I think that's when you reach out and then we'll work with you to get you onboarded properly.
00:28:21.530 - 00:28:47.790, Speaker A: Cool, thanks G. Are there any more questions from anybody on the call? I'll just double check YouTube, no questions there. Cool. Yeah. As G mentioned, you can always reach them in the sponsor Circle channel in discord if you have any other questions. And thanks so much, G, for the great presentation and thanks everybody for joining.
00:28:48.930 - 00:28:49.420, Speaker B: Thank you.
