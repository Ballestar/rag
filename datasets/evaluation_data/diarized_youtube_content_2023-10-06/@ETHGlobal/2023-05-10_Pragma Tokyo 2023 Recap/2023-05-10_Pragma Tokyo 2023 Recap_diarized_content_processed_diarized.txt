00:00:12.170 - 00:00:24.750, Speaker A: Good morning everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global and welcome to Pragma. This is a conference.
00:00:27.130 - 00:00:30.710, Speaker B: I'm still trying to figure out different communities.
00:00:31.210 - 00:00:36.246, Speaker C: I do notice some difference in culture, but the best thing is that we.
00:00:36.268 - 00:00:38.040, Speaker B: Are all aligned on tech.
00:00:40.750 - 00:01:09.010, Speaker D: I think Japanese people are quite familiar with technology and also content like NFT. It's quite good fit in terms of culture. Japan is based on the creator economy. So I think East Global can host more events like Pragma or Hackathon. So various kinds of events are, I think, helpful to create more like a wider community base in Japan.
00:01:10.230 - 00:01:39.260, Speaker E: This culture of open learning happening in Ethereum. At Hackathon there are mentors and experts, like obvious mentors and speakers like East Global provides. But at the same time, even hackers can be like there are newer hackers who are getting into Web Three now, but the ones that are more experienced, who've been to Hackathons, Ethereum hackathons many times, they can learn from each other.
00:01:40.990 - 00:02:01.780, Speaker F: So the things you think are safe may not be safe. That's the big thing to rethink, right? Not just banks, but governments in that event, in the event that the government is counterparty risk. The people who are best positioned in the world to deal with that are folks like yourself, where it is cryptographic, private keys that are actually property.
00:02:04.150 - 00:02:21.558, Speaker G: I love Japan. It's my 7th trip to Japan. I spent a lot of time here as an entrepreneur. I've had investors from Japan before. The culture is great, the food is great. I find the hacker community fantastic as well. Some great questions today from hackers coming up to me and asking for ideas of what they should hack on for airstack.
00:02:21.558 - 00:02:23.050, Speaker G: Nothing but positives.
00:02:23.630 - 00:02:26.570, Speaker C: So the best icebreaker is just asking.
00:02:26.640 - 00:02:34.286, Speaker B: People what they're working on and that basically makes sure that we understand what sort of things excite us.
00:02:34.468 - 00:02:41.200, Speaker H: A lot of builders building super exciting projects here. The developer community is really strong in Japan and I think it's growing a lot.
00:02:51.090 - 00:02:57.490, Speaker D: I think Tokyo will be the top crypto and Web Three city in the world in Asia.
