00:00:01.370 - 00:00:06.720, Speaker A: We will have an opportunity to take some questions after this and we'll come to you after that.
00:00:10.530 - 00:00:33.442, Speaker B: Great. Well, hi everyone. I just wanted to thank Ethgobal first for inviting me to have this conversation with Vitalik. This is an honor to be at ETH Waterloo. So yeah, let's get started. So it's been two years since the first ETH Waterloo. At the time, crypto was approaching the peak of a bubble which later burst.
00:00:33.442 - 00:01:03.070, Speaker B: Ethereum had really a front row seat in this roller coaster and it's come a long way since then. First, everyone can hear me, right? Yeah. Okay. So going back to that time in 2017, it seemed like ICOs were probably the main use case for Ethereum. Obviously regulators came and cracked down on that market. Are you disappointed that happened? Or maybe relieved?
00:01:03.510 - 00:02:27.754, Speaker C: I guess there is two ways to interpret that question. One is am I happy that the amount of attention on ICOs has decreased in general? And the other is am I happy with the way in which the regulatory crackdown proceeded? I'm definitely more positive on the first than the second. One negative consequence of, say, the way that the regulatory crackdown proceeded, for example, is that it gave people the idea that doing an ICO is not okay, but doing a private sale and launching a VC coin and getting a bunch of rich people in the ground floor and then doing some work for one and a half years and then launching a shitcoin and having retail investors buy the shitcoin at 100 X. Higher valuation is illegal. And so people do the second thing instead of the first and it's quite possibly even more exploitative. So this is one example of a thing I'm not happy about, but the fact that kind of ICOs in that particular format in general are much less of a focus now is definitely something that makes me super happy. Basically, I think first of all, it's like ICO is the mechanism are even though they're theoretically for launching decentralized projects and they're accepting decentralized cryptocurrencies, they're really kind of out of touch with the spirit of what blockchains are about.
00:02:27.754 - 00:03:10.066, Speaker C: Blockchains are among other things, they're about decentralization and trust minimization. And an ICO basically says, hi, I am a centralized king. You should give me $100 million because you trust me and I will build this crypto project and I will make it great. So it is philosophically, it's not kind of aligned at all. And you might remember at the beginning of 2018 I released this post like introducing Daicos. This was this idea that instead of raising into directly into the creator's wallet, you would raise into a smart contract that would release the funds over time. And then more recently there was this post on ETH research called Public Interest Projects.
00:03:10.066 - 00:03:55.814, Speaker C: And then there's RDAI, which as far as I can understand is basically the same thing that also does another spin on that. So kind of contribute money over time and use kind of smart contracts instead of contributing money all at once. And I think trying to use the tools that the crypto space provides us to try to solve the real incentive problems within the crypto space is something that's kind of much more in line with where my own values are. And I'm definitely happy that there is more people kind of thinking about that and there is less people doing the hey, guys, I'm a centralized king, give me $100 million and trust me sort of thing. And I hope we continue not seeing much of the first and we see more of the second, right?
00:03:55.932 - 00:04:28.900, Speaker B: Yeah. So maybe the space can mature into realizing crowdfunding is not a bad thing on Ethereum. It just needs to be more aligned with kind of the ethos of the network. Great. And also, going back to that time, you were very vocal about how there wasn't much actual value being created to justify the super high valuations with east now below $200, bitcoin below 10,000, and the whole space at around 240,000,000,000. Do you think that's still the case?
00:04:30.870 - 00:05:21.234, Speaker C: I definitely think that the amount of concrete value produced by the space has really improved a lot over the last two years. Two years ago, I think people's expectations were definitely getting far ahead of the reality. And now, on the one hand, the hype is lower, but on the other hands, the reality is better. And I think that's good on both fronts. And I think we've made a lot of progress. And there's a lot of things that have been and are being built over those last two years, like whether we talk about scalability improvements, user interface improvements, and if progress toward proof of stake progress on all of these D five fronts progress on these other applications. And then I think this space is considerably closer to creating a lot of real value now.
00:05:21.234 - 00:05:26.150, Speaker C: And I'm looking forward to when it starts doing that on a much larger scale.
00:05:27.050 - 00:05:35.560, Speaker B: Would you go as far to say that maybe the space or just ETH specifically is undervalued at this point?
00:05:36.410 - 00:05:37.990, Speaker C: No comment.
00:05:40.170 - 00:06:24.310, Speaker B: Boo. Okay. All right. Okay, so obviously I'll argue that in the past two years, much of this value has been created by DeFi decentralized finance or open finance. It's these group of financial services that are being created on top of Ethereum. And some people have argued that Ethereum would be successful even if it's just kind of a financial chain. What's your view on that? Is DeFi maybe kind of the last wave of Ethereum applications?
00:06:25.450 - 00:07:36.030, Speaker C: I definitely hope not, because in terms of what I, as a person, care about, I would definitely be sad if kind of finance was the end of it, though. At the same time, Ethereum is an ecosystem, and I'm supposed to be not the dictator. So if it doesn't perfectly reflect my values, then I'm not supposed to be allowed to complain. But there's definitely a lot of value that can come out of creating decentralized, open financial systems and doing a kind of really good job of making not just payments, but also different financial tools like insurance, smart contracts, and kind of this whole suite of things available to the entire world. And it definitely seems like Ethereum has been making a lot of headway there. And I also see why finance has been the kind of initial application that people focus on. It's both one that brings money in money in the short term and it's also one where finance is the one sector where existing centralized solutions are the most terrible.
00:07:36.030 - 00:08:38.642, Speaker C: Sending emails from country to country is trivial, but sending money from country to country is still something that takes a significant amount of effort. Whereas if you just do it over a cryptocurrency, I give you an address over any of these messengers and then you send money and it's done and it's much simpler. I see the value behind the DeFi wave and I'm happy to see a lot of people building all of these things. I'm obviously wants to kind of repeat my caveat about guys remember that these smart contracts might have bugs and guys remember that half of these things are running with oracles that fall far short of my and probably your standards of what constitutes adequate decentralization. And we need to kind of work harder and keep improving, but kind of assuming that gets solved over time. I definitely think it's great. And going beyond finance, I definitely think there's a lot of things that other things that blockchains can do.
00:08:38.642 - 00:10:09.630, Speaker C: Like I view blockchains more generally as being this kind of economic substrate for mechanism design. And that includes lots of things. It includes incentives, it includes storing information, it includes keeping track of public keys like data that users have published, things like ENS, things like just using Ethereum as an identity layer. I saw there are some recent projects doing the whole kind of sign in with Ethereum thing and that's actually something that I think is like it's not like super $50 million Glamorous. But the reason I'm interested in it is because, first of all, who here has been SIM swapped a bunch of people, right? And so a common kind of belief that people have in the back of their minds is that decentralized systems are generally useful in contexts that require censorship, resistance or evading powerful governments and these things because centralized systems are generally more efficient and better for normal people's use cases. But in reality, the whole cell phone SIM swapping thing and just generally identity is a great example of why that's not the case. So basically just any rando can go and just socially engineer one of these telephone companies and get them to just turn over control of your account.
00:10:09.630 - 00:10:48.774, Speaker C: And anything that you and we have started over the last ten years have creeped into using cell phone numbers as decentralized identity system. And so if you capture someone's cell phone, then you capture their identity. You can capture pretty much any online accounts where they use their phone number as a backup. And it's all very terrible. I just want to finish the case for decentralizing the thing. Right, so another one of the things that I've been actively pushing for, I've said this at pretty much every conference, is smart contract wallets. So things like social key recovery, multisigs, going beyond kind of one key being the thing that defines your ownership of assets.
00:10:48.774 - 00:11:28.700, Speaker C: And my theory is that these kinds of techniques have to exist in a decentralized cryptocurrency land because this is this kind of hostile trial by fire environment where there's huge incentives to steal people's money. There's huge losses if your money gets stolen, huge losses if your money gets lost. And so if we make solutions that are good enough for this environment, then we can also kind of export these solutions and make them useful just as accounts for logging into other things. And now we have kind of crypto based account management as a base layer and you start building things on top of that. And now you've started kind of recreating more of the stack on a decentralized base. I've talked for enough.
00:11:29.950 - 00:11:40.410, Speaker B: So I guess do you think kind of the next wave of ethereum innovation or applications will be kind of identity linked to privacy applications?
00:11:41.070 - 00:11:44.682, Speaker C: I don't think there will be one next dominating wave. I think it'll be many waves.
00:11:44.746 - 00:12:11.080, Speaker B: Right, okay. And then wanted to touch on something else you mentioned at a conference, which is this question of whether ETH is money. You said ETH is money if the community wants it to be. So what's your opinion on that? Do you want ETH to be money? And if you do, how good do you think ETH is at being money?
00:12:12.890 - 00:12:53.042, Speaker C: So in Yudkowski and rationalist culture, which is my religion, there is this kind of thing that you're supposed to do, which is kind of taboo, in your words. Right. So when people have a disagreement about whether or not X is a Y, it seems intractable. Try to figure out your disagreement without using the word Y. Right. Because chances are a lot of the time what happens is that people don't actually disagree on substance, they just have different ideas on what this word is. And money is this funny word that lots of people have different meanings for.
00:12:53.042 - 00:13:48.280, Speaker C: So like, okay, who here thinks that money and currency are synonyms? Who here thinks that money and currency are not synonyms? Okay, I saw hands raised for both, so we can't even agree on that. Right? So clearly the is ETH money? Question me very well. Not even points to any kind of substantive disagreement. So what can ETH be used for? And can ETH be used as a way of holding value and sending that value between I mean, the Ethereum Foundation has even used ETH that way internally for years. Can ETH be used as a unit of value within smart contracts? Yes. Can ETH be used as a way for paying of paying for transaction fees? Yes. Is ETH something that I recommend as a replacement for US dollars next year or even ten years from now? Probably no.
00:13:48.280 - 00:13:55.240, Speaker C: So it depends on kind of what your objective is here. Makes sense.
00:13:56.170 - 00:14:19.754, Speaker B: Okay, and then going to another topic to developer experience. Two years ago it was a lot harder to build something on Ethereum over a weekend like all of these people here are going to do in the next two days. How do you think developer experience compares this year with 2017?
00:14:19.882 - 00:15:05.210, Speaker C: I definitely think a lot of things have gotten better. First of all, just a lot of the different tools that people have been using have improved more and more over time on development environments. Even just the ability to access the blockchain and run a full Node efficiently has gotten better. Documentation has gotten better, compilers have gotten better. Things that you can integrate with Uniswap now exists and lots of applications plug into Uniswap ENS is substantially more mature. Formal verification infrastructure is another big one that's made significant strides. Zero knowledge proof infrastructure.
00:15:05.210 - 00:15:20.050, Speaker C: So there's definitely a lot of infrastructure that exists now and a lot of things that have gotten easier now that were not there in 2017. And also just kind of knowledge inside people's heads in the community. And I definitely think there's been a lot of progress.
00:15:20.470 - 00:15:24.210, Speaker B: So what do you think is missing? What are the big pieces?
00:15:24.790 - 00:16:20.822, Speaker C: What are the big pieces? So this is the sort of question that where my answers have been kind of the same for about five years. And we have been making a lot of progress though, right? So one is scalability transactions are too expensive and now the new cool thing is roll ups apparently. And then of course the short term new cool thing and the medium term cool thing is Sharding and those have made huge progress. Another one is just like latency of transactions and this is just for user experience reasons. Like when I send a transaction it should be included on chain and get a confirmation within. Ideally Bitcoin was like ten minutes to an hour, then Ethereum got that down to a couple of minutes, but block time is 12 seconds. But because of fee markets weirdness, most of the time people set their fees low and they often have to wait longer.
00:16:20.822 - 00:17:03.742, Speaker C: And I'm hoping like EIP 1559 can fix that and get most transactions included in the next block. Proof of stake just kind of providing more consistent block times. Also with the way that LMD Ghost provides basically 100 confirmations in parallel. So with E 2.0 we get more confirmations sooner that'll solve some more UX issues. Privacy, ZK Snark based stuff needs to continue to get better. I think we just need more incremental improvements on things like proving time, for example, so that signing a transaction or generating a zero knowledge proof can be just a little bit faster.
00:17:03.742 - 00:17:25.580, Speaker C: Also better developer tools for privacy preserving anything security and kind of more user friendly form of verification infrastructure is always good. So all of those things put together, it's really kind of a bunch of these incremental slogs where if we make a lot of progress on each of them, I think we'll do a great job.
00:17:26.670 - 00:17:55.800, Speaker B: Okay. And then speaking of things missing, I think going back to ETH Waterloo 2017, some people back then maybe would have expected that Serenity would have launched by now. What do you say to those critics who criticize Ethereum for not having launched ETH 2.0 yet, considering some bitcoiners use that as an excuse to say it is a scam and so on?
00:17:57.530 - 00:18:48.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess first of all, yes, I definitely was over optimistic about the timing of East Two at the same time. The thing I've said is that the properties that East Two has continue to get better and better and every time we make an action that looks like, oh, we're going back to the drawing board, every time that happens it looks less and less drawing boardy. So the most recent thing, the switch from 1024 shards with cross linking every epoch to 64 shards with cross linking every slot. Substantial reorganization of how sharding works, but it doesn't really slow down development. It's a really substantial simplification. It enabled a bunch of things that we thought we would not be able to have before and we've continued to have all of these improvements of that type. And so the E 2.0
00:18:48.774 - 00:19:32.402, Speaker C: final product that it's looking like we'll see is definitely much better than the E 2.0 that I was saying four years ago we would have two years from then. There is the bad, but also the good in general. Proof of stake has testnets saying we're going to get to much larger public testnets, we'll get to cross client testnets, we're going to get to launch of phase zero. And at some point I think the critics are just going to have to kind of face reality and they're like, look guys, there is a proof of stake chain. It's running and the thing is not a scam. It'll definitely make me very happy to see that day.
00:19:32.402 - 00:19:38.470, Speaker C: And who knows, maybe five years from now even Bitcoin will be looking at proof of stake a little more favorably.
00:19:40.650 - 00:19:53.878, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's an interesting point. I don't know if you want to expand more on that. It's a little bit off topic, but yeah, considering kind of Bitcoin switching to proof of stake, I think I don't know. It's an interesting notion.
00:19:54.054 - 00:21:01.022, Speaker C: Oh, yes, I love these. Okay, so yay, I go into Joyful heretic mode. So I guess the challenge is, right, that there's this kind of looming elephant in the room over a lot of different cryptocurrencies that kind of committed to a capped Issuance schedule. And they really committed to this idea that issuance is evil and we must have a hard cap and because a hard cap is the Austrian way and we must take a strong stance that we are not like those hyperinflationist fiat gold bugs. But the problem is that you need to pay miners for security. And the story has always been, well, we'll use transaction fees for this, right? But if you look at reality right so right now in Bitcoin, for example, last time I checked, it was about the daily block reward was about $7 million. The daily transaction fees are about 140,000.
00:21:01.022 - 00:21:55.310, Speaker C: That's about a factor of 50 difference. In Ethereum, the block reward is about two E and the transaction fees are about somewhere between 0.3 and 0.2 E, depending on which day it is and whether or not some Fairwin or some other crazy application is burning a million dollars in fees because of bad mechanics or whatever. But in general, there seems to be this kind of about factor of 50 difference between issuance and fees. And it's not at all clear that fees are going to be able to kind of basically it's not at all clear that blockchains are going to continue to be secure when Issuance is 50 times or lower or when the amount going to security providers or miners or stakers is 50 times or lower than it is now. And I do think that proof of stake does better than proof of work with lower security budgets.
00:21:55.310 - 00:23:13.366, Speaker C: But even with proof of stake, I'm not confident that Ethereum proof of stake with zero issuance is something that it is guaranteed to be able to survive, for example, which is why even past proof of stake, we're decreasing the issuance heavily, but there is still some Issuance. One of the common replies to this, of course, is like, oh, cryptocurrencies are obviously going to be 100 times bigger in ten years and that'll cancel things out. But number one, you're not allowed to make crazy, super optimistic assumptions if you're going to argue about the security of a system that protects people's life savings. And number two, that's not even a correct argument because if a system gets 50 times bigger, then sure, the security budget becomes 50 times bigger, but the size of the attackers who care about breaking it becomes 50 times bigger. So I think the relative actually matters more than the absolute. And that's an area where kind of the people that focus on the absolute being canceled out by growth of the ecosystem are just wrong. My view on I think proof of stake is important and it doesn't even have to be full proof of stake.
00:23:13.366 - 00:24:33.186, Speaker C: It could even be hybrid. Proof of stake is a good way of just getting more security with much lower rewards and issuance which I think is important, especially for if people kind of value these things, like having low Issuance or potentially even zero Issuance and so forth. But then also my own views on monetary policy. For example, this is the question where people ask why doesn't Ethereum do a hard cap? Or why doesn't, like, commit to a specific schedule or something like this? And I remember there was a panel at Edcon on the opposite side of the world in Sydney six months ago where this was this kind of controversial issues panel at the conference. And I asked a bunch of Ethereum community members, do you guys support a hard cap? And the answer I got was universally no. And the reason why is basically because people seem to appreciate a more kind of pragmatic approach and one that basically says that instead of optimizing for predictability of issuance, we're going to optimize for predictability of security because the platform surviving is the most important thing. And if the platform doesn't survive, we're all screwed anyway.
00:24:33.186 - 00:25:20.834, Speaker C: So predictability of security is really important. And the problem is that we don't know the ratio of security to Issuance ahead of time. That's just a variable that the real world has, and we might learn things about it five or ten or 20 years from now. So if we have to choose between stabilizing Issuance and stabilizing security and we want to stabilize security, that does mean that there's going to be kind of less certainty on Issuance than some people would like. But I think that's something that to a lot of Bitcoin people, for example, is anathema. But a lot of Ethereum people I've talked to, I can just seem fine with it really interesting.
00:25:20.952 - 00:25:31.494, Speaker B: Okay, so maybe Ethereum will prove to be a good example of proof of stake for Bitcoiners to look at and see how it works. Maybe they'll copy it down the I.
00:25:31.532 - 00:25:54.240, Speaker C: Mean, it's not just about Bitcoin to be like, I hope Litecoin adopts proof of stake as mean. I hope Bitcoin cash adopts proof of mean. I hope Bitcoin Sazoshi's vision adopts proof of mean. I think the thing is a scam, but I think Scams running proof of stake is still less environmentally harmful than Scams running proof of work. Harm reduction is supposed to be the mature attitude to have. So like, whatever.
00:26:01.490 - 00:26:18.550, Speaker B: Okay. And then I think, yeah, wrapping up and just looking forward. Once Ethereum is running with this better proof of stake and sharding and it's more scalable, what do you think it can achieve in the next decade?
00:26:21.690 - 00:27:41.690, Speaker C: I still think there's a lot of unknowns decentralized finance is kind of the lowest risk thing, which is a funny thing to say because the crypto sector as a whole is still kind of much higher risk than some people often give it credit for. But it is just creating an open kind of global financial system that people can access to. People can have savings in people can engage in contracts, get things like insurance, just get kind of services that are difficult for them to get using kind of traditional centralized tools. I think even that is I very much hope that's not the only thing Ethereum does. But even that is something that's very valuable all by itself. But in general, and I think in very vague terms, the vision is this idea that you can use crypto economic and decentralized systems to create kind of credibly neutral kind of social institutions and mechanisms. And this can create platforms that more people can trust and more people feel comfortable trusting, can kind of reach across barriers more easily.
00:27:41.770 - 00:27:43.150, Speaker B: You mean like dows?
00:27:43.490 - 00:28:42.980, Speaker C: So Dos are one example of this, right? I'm interested in Dows in the long term. I definitely think that present day Dow technology I agree with Vlad's opinion here that present day Dows are not super interesting. What Dows could be is super interesting and I really want to see kind of that gap being filled. I think in general there's this whole branch of kind of economic research into how do we do things like funding public goods. For example, I've been a big kind of evangelist for quadratic funding and people might have seen my recent blog post where I kind of described Gitcoin's recent quadratic funding round as a way of kind of detecting and funding public goods for the Ethereum ecosystem. Governance of kind of common shared resources, even things like Oracles, like all of these problems DAOs are one valuable thing. Financial protocol is obviously another valuable thing.
00:28:42.980 - 00:30:00.720, Speaker C: The space of kind of combining together kind of crypto components with kind of internet and social media platforms I think is kind of an interesting thing. PPAs, for example, like I've talked about a few times, if you look at things like Steemit for example, this is something that it's theoretically part of EOS land. So we're kind of theoretically supposed to not consider it legitimate. But they've done a decent job at creating this kind of crypto incentivized platform for content generation and at least getting it actively used by a user base of some size. And I think the mechanism design can be improved by a lot, but I think things like that and trying to kind of solve problems with just present day systems in a lot of cases that kind of incorporate elements of using blockchains as a base layer incorporate elements of mechanism design, but mechanism design done well and not just slapping payments on top of everything and whatever without thinking through the consequences. There's a lot of good things that can happen. I mean, prediction markets is another kind of big category of things that I find interesting too.
00:30:01.890 - 00:30:18.420, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's a broad range of things that Ethereum can disrupt probably. Okay, and then just quickly to wrap up, if there's one thing you could tell vitalik sitting in Ethwater Loot 2017, what would it be?
00:30:22.070 - 00:31:35.594, Speaker C: I mean, I mean, the realistic and boring answer will be crypto prices will go down, sell and buy later. But this is how economists answer these type travel questions, right? Like, provide a bit STRIG of what the stocks will do and then you can do really well and then hopefully use the earnings for good. But otherwise, I don't know. I want to think about kind of non lame answers to this question. The other kind of lame answer is just like, here's all the bad e two ideas, like, skip straight past them and go to the good ones. Other thing in terms of things where I could have done better if I had kind of better models of the crypto space back then? Hmm, I don't know. I mean, I think there was like I don't think there's a single big thing.
00:31:35.594 - 00:31:44.590, Speaker C: I think there are just kind of a lot of little decisions about things that we could have focused on earlier that we didn't focus on earlier.
00:31:47.170 - 00:31:51.360, Speaker B: Okay. But I guess, yeah, short selling is a great answer.
00:31:53.990 - 00:31:54.980, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:31:55.750 - 00:31:59.714, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I think we ran out of time. It was so interesting.
00:31:59.832 - 00:32:01.460, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Thank you.
00:32:09.470 - 00:32:16.940, Speaker A: We'll actually do three questions from the audience, and if you have a question, raise your hand. We'll come to you and we'll just pass you the mic.
00:32:22.030 - 00:32:23.946, Speaker C: Am I picking you? Give you a pick?
00:32:23.968 - 00:32:24.540, Speaker A: Pick.
00:32:25.730 - 00:32:28.000, Speaker C: Okay, let me run one SEC.
00:32:32.930 - 00:32:48.390, Speaker A: Thanks. Vitala, quick question for you and that's around immutability. You posted on this on Twitter a few weeks back, I guess. What's your thoughts based on the feedback you got from the community on immutability and what would happen if there was a massive attack on ethereum, rolling back, so on and so forth?
00:32:48.890 - 00:34:26.550, Speaker C: What's the feedback I got from the community on immutability issues? I think the thing that I underestimated is that it's not clear that kind of we're on the same page in terms of the framing of the issue. So one framing of the issue, and the one that I kind of had it from the beginning is like, okay, there exists if there exists some hack that we could use a state intervention fork to reverse and get money back from a hacker or stop a bug or do some other thing, then on the one hand there's good consequences, which are that people get their money back. Yay. On the other hand, there's a bad consequence, which is and it's kind of a fixed size bad consequence, which is we kind of erode the immutability principle more and you have to kind of weigh the costs and the benefits, and there's some number at which the benefits become greater than the costs. But it seems like there is kind of a lot of different variables at stake. So things that I probably wasn't thinking about enough are one is the number of people affected and what kinds of behaviors were they participating in? Were they participating. In things where they realistically should have expected danger? Or was this something that was advertised as kind of the wallet that people should use and also just measuring kind of the harm not just by looking at the amount of money stolen but the number of people affected.
00:34:26.550 - 00:35:58.690, Speaker C: Another thing is how disruptive would the intervention actually need to be and how many people would be harmed by disruptive intervention? Is there some way of compensating them? So there's a lot of these kind of other kind of complicated factors. If we look at kind of arguments against doing an intervention it's not just about kind of breaking the principle or weakening the principle. It's also about other things like just disrupting activity of the blockchain, like how much activity would be disrupted in these other things. So that was one thing. Another thing is that a lot of people don't have I think kind of either individually queer or kind of collectively queer mental models of what principles as a thing are in what ways principles as a thing are valuable. So I made this tweet where I basically asked do you think it's possible for a principal to literally have infinite weight? So it's never okay to give up that principle under absolutely any circumstance. And to me the answer is obviously no, principal hasn't literally infinite weight.
00:35:58.690 - 00:37:07.110, Speaker C: If there was an alien invasion coming and the only way we could stop the alien invasion was by making it illegal to criticize blue eyed people, then I love freedom of speech. But if breaking freedom of speech would stop an alien invasion then sure, I'd totally do it. And I have similar positions with respect to kind of pretty much every principle including blockchain immutability. So kind of my model of this was like this principle is really important but it's not infinitely important. But first of all, there's people who sort of say that it's infinitely important but I'm not sure that kind of under reflection they would actually hold on to this opinion. There's also kind of like bitcoin ethereum cultural divides a big stint of this because every time you make a Twitter poll there's always people from these other communities that kind of step in to show their opinions. I don't know, it's complicated.
00:37:07.110 - 00:37:41.780, Speaker C: I'm definitely of the school of thought that says it's good to discuss it more and not of the school of thought that says that the fact that we're even willing to discuss it shows that the ethereum community does not value immutability and therefore we're the shitcoin. I think that school of thought is terrible and we should not listen to it at all. Yeah, I'm pro discussing things and holding to principles for reasons that we've kind of properly reflected on. Okay, we'll do one more question.
00:37:43.670 - 00:38:17.200, Speaker A: Thanks. Going back to the question about Dows. So you're talking about the gap between where we could be with the functionality of and the output of them versus where we are now obviously when we did the first experiment it was really like okay let's just do the dao and then we all put money into it. Now looking at some of the more experimentation on the Molok side with sort of Moloch dao itself and now marketing dao that just launched MetaCartel a lot of the others it's this more like slow iterative process. What do you sort of think about the difference in large dao structure and fixing things like that versus the small dow structure and fixing things like that?
00:38:18.050 - 00:38:20.686, Speaker C: The differences between large dow structure and.
00:38:20.708 - 00:38:27.986, Speaker A: Small dow structure and the value in terms of solving these problems. Right? So initially we started with a huge one, and now we're doing this more.
00:38:28.008 - 00:40:14.820, Speaker C: Iterative small. DAOs are definitely more like one of the reasons why Moloch dao is more tractable is because it's made up of people who kind of largely know each other and who are kind of trusted to not do nasty things, like automatically vote for whoever pays them the most money. I think if you kind of do dows in contexts where kind of some level of social trust already exists, then the problem is more tractable. Whereas if you do it in context where social trust doesn't exist or where people aren't even on the same page in terms of what okay conduct is and what okay conduct isn't, then the problem becomes more difficult. We saw this with EOS for example, right? Like with EOS the whole thing quickly collapsed into people bribing each other to vote for each other and creating this sort of plutocratic cartel where you have a fairly small number of people just help vote for each other and pay each other the B block producers. And at the beginning I saw a lot of people arguing that hey, buying people's votes is not illegitimate behavior because isn't this the free market and aren't we about building a free market system? And when you have a system where people don't even this kind of layer of shared moral expectations isn't even there at the beginning then you're relying on kind of just the raw economics in a much stronger way than you normally are and so the problem is more difficult. So in some ways I'm happy that kind of the simpler cases are being tried first and then we can kind of expand the scale more and more over time.
00:40:14.820 - 00:40:51.560, Speaker C: One of the reasons I'm not in favor of on chain governance at all for example is because it's basically saying that hey let's make a dow and let's start with a really big dow and oh by the way we're going to make the dow be so systemically important that we give it control of layer one. It's basically kind of combining all of the kind of ways of doing irresponsible dow developments together whereas this sort of start small and develop and have lots of little experiments approach I think is going to be sort of more fruitful over the long term. Okay. Thank you so much, guys. Thank.
