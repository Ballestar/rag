00:00:05.930 - 00:00:21.360, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Welcome, everybody. Welcome to day two of judging. We're really excited to see all of your hackathon projects today. My name is Josh. I'm part of the Eg Global team, and I'll be your MC for this morning or afternoon or evening, depending where you are.
00:00:21.360 - 00:00:42.490, Speaker A: So hope sorry. Let's back up there. This has been our biggest online hackathon ever. So we've had 700 hackers stake and participate. We had more than 1000 applications. We have hackers from 65 countries and 19 time zones. It's been absolutely massive.
00:00:42.490 - 00:01:26.674, Speaker A: So we're having multiple rooms all in parallel, all weekend to get through the judging. We've got 175 projects at the hackathon, and we can't wait to see all of them. The judging session yesterday was awesome, and I expect today to be great as well. So, quick note on the format how this is going to work is each team has up to four minutes for their video demo and then four minutes for questions. So the way this will work is, when you begin your demo, we will start a timer for eight minutes. And then when you have three minutes left and two minutes left, there will be messages in the chat notifying you of that. And so you can have up to four minutes of discussion and Q and A with the judges.
00:01:26.674 - 00:02:17.160, Speaker A: We will do a break partway through. It's kind of up to the judges so we can chat about that in the chat about an appropriate time to take a quick break. Quick note on the criteria for judging. So the judge is going to evaluate your projects on five factors technicality, originality, practicality, UI, and UX, and then wow factor. They've just had a training session with Kartik, who runs Judging Meet Global and have a metric to use to evaluate your projects on this basis. As one really important note ETH global events are not meant to be a competition. Of course there are bounties and prizes, but really, we want this to be an experience, to learn.
00:02:17.160 - 00:02:56.002, Speaker A: Not everyone is necessarily trying to launch a company with their hack. Sometimes it's just about experimentation, about learning, about trying to get feedback and meet people and collaborate. So no matter what your purpose is, what your goal is for the hackathon, the judges here today are here to help you further that purpose. And sorry, these slides are like, a bit doing the hard work today. We have three amazing judges. We have Tamlin from Vega Protocol, mariano, who's just some guy who talks about DeFi a lot, and Christina from UNICEF Innovate. Welcome to the chat.
00:02:56.002 - 00:03:17.482, Speaker A: Thank you so much for volunteering your Sunday to help these teams, and I'm really looking forward to getting started. All right, so let's jump into the first demo. Let's get Joseph onto the call. And then, Joseph, I will let you share your screen and share your demo. Cool.
00:03:17.536 - 00:03:19.020, Speaker B: Give me 1 second here.
00:03:25.890 - 00:03:32.062, Speaker A: All right, are we good? Yeah. All good.
00:03:32.196 - 00:04:14.892, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Joe Gonzalez, the founder of Huddlen, and I'm presenting the Huddlen service for the ETH online hackathon. So what is hudalin? Hudalin is comprised of two components the client app and the actual service API. The client focuses on short form media with the built in wall to connect to the service. The service is a set of blockchain contracts that focus on providing social features and is open for all DApps to utilize and provides a set of standardized features. The Huddling service will provide many different features, including services for NFT DeFi and content licensing. The hack for this hackathon was to implement one feature, the staked content feature. And here are the steps of the feature.
00:04:14.892 - 00:04:57.730, Speaker C: The creator creates content and provides it to the contract. Then there's a round for stakers to purchase a stake in that content and they're charged a fee that goes to the creator. Next, the tipping round begins and all the tips go to the tipping pool. And at any time, a staker can close their stake and withdraw from the tipping pool according to their proportion of stake compared to other stakers, a percentage of ownership. To accomplish this hack, I used Biconomy for gasless transactions and the matic chain because of the speed of confirmations and small gas fees. Here is a simple demo that is ran on the client side. The user logs into our platform.
00:05:01.540 - 00:05:01.952, Speaker A: And.
00:05:02.006 - 00:05:03.970, Speaker C: Starts creating a video.
00:05:10.630 - 00:05:12.778, Speaker A: And it's a.
00:05:12.784 - 00:05:57.220, Speaker C: Little bit of video editing. Here you can see the Monetization section for the options that will contact the contract and set up our object. Next, the user is publishing to the contract and to our platform. Now it is complete and that is step one. Step two, another user logs in and sees the content that they want to stake on. They see the content here on the screen. They hit the little gold button, which brings up the menu that you see now and the different presets for the amount that they want to stake.
00:05:57.220 - 00:06:44.192, Speaker C: This user is going to stake 0.1 matic and it's already done. Next, another user is also going to stake some Maddox as well. They see the content, they select the button, bring up the menus, but this user is going to stake 00:25 Maddox. So they have a larger stake of the tipping pool. The next step, someone is going to add a tip to the tipping pool on this content. They're going to add ten matic.
00:06:44.192 - 00:07:23.920, Speaker C: So now there is ten matic in the tipping pool that will be split amongst the stakers. Next, one of the stakers wants to close their stake and claim their percentage of the tips in the tipping pool. As you can see, there's a graph there of how much they're allotted. A little bug there, but the transaction went through in the last step. The creator can also withdraw their earnings. I didn't get a chance to implement that on the client side, but it is available on the contract and the contract is fully done and ready on the Matic Mumbai network. And that's my hack for the ETH online hackathon.
00:07:23.920 - 00:07:26.550, Speaker C: And here's some contact information. Thank you.
00:07:28.920 - 00:07:29.380, Speaker D: Great.
00:07:29.450 - 00:07:35.690, Speaker A: Thanks, Joseph. Over to the judges for questions and comments. Cool.
00:07:38.860 - 00:07:48.090, Speaker E: Hi. Let me begin. That is pretty impressive. You did this as a solo team.
00:07:49.260 - 00:08:01.890, Speaker B: Yeah, this is just myself, but you should know that the client itself is something that I've been working on for the past year and a half, and it does have an MVP. This is an LLC already.
00:08:03.460 - 00:08:23.990, Speaker E: Okay. Yeah, the client did look, like, extremely polished. So this would be I would almost refer it to Farming Likes for content. Right. How do you envision the economy to work?
00:08:24.600 - 00:09:18.810, Speaker B: So the really cool thing is that I'm trying to implement this as a service for many DApps to be able to use and plug into, which means this whole staking feature is actually just one feature where users can choose to enable this for their content to basically act like I kind of describe it to people. Like, you have a company, you're buying stock in a company, and that stock gives you some ownership of that company content. So that's like just one feature of it. I had it on one of the other slides is that I want to also implement a feature to utilize the new DeFi protocols, but with content instead, where people can stake NFTs and pass those around and basically add another feature to the service. So this would just be one feature provided to the DApps that want to utilize the service.
00:09:20.940 - 00:09:23.610, Speaker D: And who would be paying gas in this situation.
00:09:24.780 - 00:09:58.230, Speaker B: So, for the Create post, we're using Iconomy right now. So it basically lowers the borders, removes a bunch of the friction for new users so they can jump right in and start monetizing their content without any matic at all. So a fresh new wallet can come in, start and start receiving tips. And then from there, once they receive tips, then obviously their function calls would use gas. But yeah, you totally do not need any gas to jump right in and start using it.
00:10:00.040 - 00:10:13.530, Speaker D: Awesome. And as you're thinking about this from the example that you presented of the content creator, in this case the video of the Doc, what would be the model for the actual content creator to generate income if others are staking on it?
00:10:16.060 - 00:10:54.550, Speaker B: Actually, it might be better if I move the slide around a little bit. So one of the steps is when they stake content, the person staking the content actually has to pay a fee to the creator. So right now, the fee is just an arbitrary number, but it may be a dynamic number later in the future based on demand. But right now it's just like a static I think I have it set to like 10%. So if they want to stake $20 worth of Maddox 10% of that has to go directly to the owner, and then that is how the owner gets their income, and they can get it in a separate pool, and they can do that payout immediately, at any time.
00:10:57.740 - 00:11:04.330, Speaker D: And what's the sort of governance behind even that choice of the 20% does that get?
00:11:08.540 - 00:11:37.270, Speaker B: The 20% is really just an arbitrary number in the actual production use. What I would actually want to do is base it off of the demand for the content and make it a dynamic number that's constantly changing and probably also base some of those variables in that equation based off of the block time. So how long it's been running, how many users have staked over a certain block time, stuff like that.
00:11:39.160 - 00:11:42.788, Speaker D: Great. This is really impressive, by the way.
00:11:42.954 - 00:12:01.390, Speaker B: Thank you very much. We actually launched an MVP of something very similar to this back in March, and then Ethereum hit with DeFi and basically knocked our MVP down. And it's unusable right now, so that's why this whole hack was really high precedence for us.
00:12:02.800 - 00:12:14.368, Speaker A: Okay. Well, thanks, Joseph. That's all the time we got for Q A. Thank you for being part of ETH Online, and great job. Thank you. Hey. So next up is Tokenize Music.
00:12:14.368 - 00:12:19.330, Speaker A: Ben, I think we have you on the call already, so I'll let you go ahead and play your demo.
00:12:21.220 - 00:13:08.180, Speaker F: All right. Hello, everyone. The title of my hack is Tokenized Music. Just a little bit about me. My name is Benjamin Beatty. I'm a DevOps engineer, and I started getting involved with Ethereum and cryptocurrency a little over two months ago. So the goal of my hack was just to get introduced to Ethereum blockchain development, and my idea was to create a program that accepts an MP3 file as input and then converts it into an NFT.
00:13:08.180 - 00:14:07.290, Speaker F: Why would you want to do this? I don't know, but it seemed like something I could do, so I went for it. Phase one, as you might imagine, was just learning. I got my developer environment set up. I chose Python and Brownie because that was what I was most familiar with and can't do anything with Ethereum unless you know solidity. So I read up on the documentation and did a bunch of tutorials for that. Phase two was all about NFTs. I looked up the specification, followed some tutorials on how to set one up, and found the Open Zeppelin contract, which I used as a base, managed to create a skeleton project that deployed a basic NFT token, and I interacted with it a little bit on the blockchain and gained a greater understanding of that.
00:14:07.290 - 00:14:57.992, Speaker F: And then phase three, I created this presentation. So I did not get very far. That was all I accomplished these past few weeks. So I don't really have a demo to show, but in lieu of that, I'd like to share some of my takeaways. So the first major thing is I gained a greater understanding of DApps and Ethereum. This was an excellent experience and I learned a lot. And then more than that, I got exposure to this great community, a lot of the projects going on and a lot of resources I could use to go further and learn more and gain a greater understanding of what's possible.
00:14:57.992 - 00:15:10.860, Speaker F: So thank you so much. Thank you to everyone who helped make this event possible for this amazing opportunity. And thank you all for listening to my presentation.
00:15:19.300 - 00:15:53.390, Speaker E: This is very interesting. Let me jump right in as a dev. So what would you say was the part where you what was the most difficult? Because you did pretty much everything right. You started reading about things, reading about how DApps works, how Web three open Zeppelin and then started development. Where did you say was the part where you said, okay, this is as far as I could go in this three weeks?
00:15:55.360 - 00:16:39.850, Speaker F: Well, I think that the stopping point for me was trying to understand how I would do the actual idea I had, which was put the MP3 in a token to me that was sort of like, okay, now I need to understand how the entire blockchain would work with that. And to me that was a little nebulous at that moment. It was like, I don't really know what's going on here. So that's kind of where a big wall was.
00:16:41.600 - 00:17:04.130, Speaker E: And would you say maybe, did you ask any mentors when you got to that point? Did you say, well now I'm really stumped or do you think with a little bit more time you could have figured it out? Was this mostly a tech thing or a project idea thing?
00:17:05.400 - 00:18:02.790, Speaker F: I think I could have figured it out with more time. I mean, part of the obstacle for me too was I somewhat over committed with trying to do ETH online. So I had other things going on that took me away from doing just this that played a role. But I don't think there was ever a point where I was like, this is too much, I can't do it. It was just I needed to read more. I thought the solidity documentation was really good and kind of like you said, there were tons of people, like asking questions on the discord and things like that. So I think I could have gotten answers if I needed them.
00:18:04.120 - 00:18:30.830, Speaker D: So I guess I'll just jump in there and I guess building on that, given that this was your kind of first experience learning in this area, what was the most exciting thing to you through this process? And what's the one thing that you could have used to kind of accelerate your learning? Just I think for us judges that also helps us as new folks are coming into the community, how we can best support people with learning resources or mentor or things like that. What would be the one thing you would be looking for.
00:18:32.000 - 00:19:09.850, Speaker F: So the thing I was most excited about was just in crypto in general was decentralized finance. I thought that was super cool, but I didn't understand enough to really want to pursue something like that for this hack. And then the thing that was most helpful for me were just these tutorials I found on the internet for setting up a development environment and making a basic token and just laying the groundwork for things like that. I thought that was extremely helpful. So I think tutorials are the way to go with that stuff.
00:19:13.130 - 00:19:22.350, Speaker D: Awesome, thank you. Oh, sorry.
00:19:22.800 - 00:19:24.620, Speaker E: Oh, no, please, go ahead.
00:19:24.770 - 00:19:26.380, Speaker D: No. Go for it, Marilyn.
00:19:28.180 - 00:19:45.750, Speaker E: I was just going to say so after this, do you still plan to do more development on Ethereum? Do you plan to learn more about DeFi or did this pique your interest?
00:19:46.760 - 00:20:04.590, Speaker F: It definitely piques my interest. I do want to pursue further. I don't know what the rate on that is going to look like exactly, but I think for now I just want to learn more and try and become more familiar with it.
00:20:07.440 - 00:20:09.630, Speaker E: Great, well, welcome to the community.
00:20:10.240 - 00:20:11.230, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:20:14.080 - 00:20:29.860, Speaker D: I was going to ask, just out of curiosity, Ben, if you'd heard or seen anyone else do something similar to what you've been trying to do, because I'm quite interested in the applications and decentralized finance of NFTs. So I think there's a lot you could build on with the knowledge that you gained today.
00:20:29.930 - 00:20:31.344, Speaker A: And I was just curious if you've.
00:20:31.392 - 00:20:34.148, Speaker D: Heard of anything in your travel.
00:20:34.314 - 00:21:03.580, Speaker F: The closest thing I saw was Audius, which is this platform for content creators to upload music and basically receive revenue for people who download it. But that wasn't exactly what I was trying to do. I didn't see anything that was in the exact same vein.
00:21:04.800 - 00:21:05.790, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:21:07.760 - 00:21:27.204, Speaker A: Great. Thanks, Ben. It's always great to see projects that even though you didn't finish, even though you were relatively new to know, you still submitted, you still got on the call with the judges. It's really positive to see. So we hope you come back for the next hackathon and if you ever need learning resources, we are happy to help direct you to stuff.
00:21:27.402 - 00:21:29.268, Speaker F: All right, thank you all so much.
00:21:29.434 - 00:21:41.850, Speaker A: Thanks, man. Okay, next up, our next team is Supply Chain Hub, and I will let this team take it away and play your demo.
00:21:47.650 - 00:22:26.084, Speaker G: Okay, so this is supply chain hub. So this is the main page. You have to connect using MetaMask all for login. The owner who is creating the supply chain will have to enter his details now organization name, his name and his address. He will now have to enter the product details of the product that he wants to create a supply chain for. So here we are creating a supply chain for N 95 Mask, and we can add the property. He can also modify the properties here.
00:22:26.084 - 00:23:13.430, Speaker G: He will have an option of customizing the supply chain as he wants. He can now create a supply chain according to the number of members in it. For example, how many roles he has, what will be the names of the roles. Here we have created a sample supply chain that contains four roles of manufacturer, distributor, manufacturer, dealer, distributor and the retailer. These will be the functions that will be available for each role. Then a smart contract will be automatically generated using a Python script which can be compiled and deployed on the matic network. So the smart contract has been deployed and it's ready for use.
00:23:13.430 - 00:23:57.188, Speaker G: These are the contract hashes and transaction hash. We have created a chat app using ceramic so that the members of the supply chain can interact with each other. So here this is a sample of how the chat will work. It's very similar and has a user friendly interface just like WhatsApp or any other messaging app. And it's protected by ceramic and blockchain so they can chat with each other and fix prices. This is the Android app which will be used by everyone. That was the login page which will come back later.
00:23:57.188 - 00:24:35.010, Speaker G: Here the user will have to add the address and then he can add the user of the next row. Example the manufacturer can add a dealer, the dealer can add the distributor and so on. So once the manufacturer has added a dealer, the dealer can log in. So owner has to add owner can add everyone. So owner has now added the manufacturer and the manufacturer is logged in. He will fill up his details and set up a profile with the longitude and latitude of his factory or the offices and so on. And then he will create lots of the products.
00:24:35.010 - 00:25:17.390, Speaker G: He will have to give the product ID, the lot ID and according to what he selected for the supply chain. The owner has selected for the supply chain in the beginning. So here the Lot ID is batch win and the product ID is as given. And now the product can be tracked. So we'll now directly show you how the product will be tracked by a customer. So a customer can scan the product barcode and then he will get the detailed information of the path the product has gone through, for example, through the owner, manufacturer, dealer and retailer. There will also be a link provided for the offices of each member of the supply chain through which the product has traveled through.
00:25:17.390 - 00:25:38.960, Speaker G: So this product brings 100% transparency of the user of where the product was and we have completely built it and deployed it on matic chain. Thank you. So we are open to questions right now.
00:25:40.290 - 00:26:03.286, Speaker D: Great, thank you so much for the demo. Obviously relevant in the times that we live right now to be cognizant of supply chains. Wondering at the very beginning of the demo you showed the contracts that are essentially preloaded in that you just click deploy? Can those be modified in that screen or does it need to stay as this? They can be.
00:26:03.388 - 00:26:39.540, Speaker G: Those contracts can be modified and they are not pre stored. They'll be generated according to what the user wants, for example, the product properties or the type of supply chain he has selected. For example, if the product wants to be tracked through the lot ID, the product ID or using both, this will mainly affect the gas fees or the transaction to be saved. And that's the main reason it can be auto generated. We customize it, the user or the owner, while creating the supply chain, can make it according to his or her needs of the product.
00:26:41.190 - 00:26:42.930, Speaker D: Great, thanks for clarifying.
00:26:47.030 - 00:27:15.580, Speaker E: So this looks very complete for a project. I see that it does a lot of things, but is there something that you wish you could have added in addition? I'm not saying that I know it has a lot of things already in it, but was there anything that you missed? You had more time?
00:27:16.210 - 00:27:54.940, Speaker G: Yeah, one thing we were trying was to integrate the Opengsn for cashless transactions. So that whatever the fees right now, the fees while entering the product details, while registering a user, the fees of the gas fees are paid by the user. But in supply chain the owner wants to track the products. It's more likely that the owner should pay the fee. One thing we are trying was to integrate Opengsn. It allows a single paymaster to pay all the fees for the transactions. So if we had more time, we would surely implement this.
00:28:03.220 - 00:28:15.284, Speaker D: I had a question in terms of maybe your vision for this, how would you see it interact with, say, payments along the supply chain? Unless I've misunderstood and you have built.
00:28:15.322 - 00:28:19.044, Speaker G: That in apology, can you repeat your question, please?
00:28:19.242 - 00:28:30.776, Speaker D: Do you envision do you see the potential to work with enabling payments along the supply chain for invoices among the.
00:28:30.798 - 00:28:32.208, Speaker G: Members of the supply chain?
00:28:32.324 - 00:28:32.990, Speaker D: Correct.
00:28:33.760 - 00:29:12.040, Speaker G: Yeah, that feature is already there. The members of the supply chain can pay each other through their wallet directly. So they will get the IDs in the chat, as we have shown, so they can interact in the chat and then from there they can pay whatever the amount that is discussed to the members. They'll get the list of all the members in the supply chain in the chat window, just like you get in WhatsApp you get all the recent messages, you get all the members or whoever. You have a number here. The members listed will be the members of the supply chain. Of that supply chain.
00:29:13.580 - 00:29:13.944, Speaker A: Cool.
00:29:13.982 - 00:29:14.392, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:29:14.446 - 00:29:16.520, Speaker G: That feature has already been implemented.
00:29:17.180 - 00:29:25.260, Speaker D: Who would you say is your main audience for this application? Would it be the members in the supply chain or is it the end consumer?
00:29:26.640 - 00:29:56.710, Speaker G: The supply chain has been made such that it can be used for both purposes. Yes, we are tracking it for the customer also from the customer's point of view to get information about where the product has traveled. But even the owner or the manufacturer can check if where his product has currently reached. So this you can view from both angles. So any member in or outside supply chain can track the product if he adds the product ID and the lot ID.
00:29:57.960 - 00:29:58.950, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:30:01.720 - 00:30:08.010, Speaker A: Okay, thank you so much, supply chain hub. Appreciate you being part of Ethelon Online and great work.
00:30:08.940 - 00:30:09.544, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:30:09.582 - 00:31:16.962, Speaker A: Okay, so we're going to move on to the next project, which is Decentralized Office so Benjamin, if you are on the call, we're going to promote you shortly. And once you're on, please go ahead and play your demoffice. Oh, there we go. Great. Lots of features in the decentralized app. User can save money by contributing and the whole big large fund contributed is automatically saved in DeFi protocol and issues that will end higher income. There is also image storage API for developers.
00:31:16.962 - 00:32:23.410, Speaker A: You can easily use the API for your image and files and store in IPFS. There are a lot of problem by which this project is highly required. So we use artificial intelligence to dictate the protocol that give higher income and then invest user fund automatically in that DeFi protocol and the user will end higher income. There is also a marketplace where user can do buying and selling of items in the app. This is how the credit union work. Users contribute fund into the contract and the contract automatically take the fund and invest in these lending protocols and user with M fund. This is based on the SSU as known in Africa.
00:32:23.410 - 00:33:23.220, Speaker A: User can also have personal savings. By December we'll be building the mobile and Android app ogo have already implemented and start using our API from the portal. If you check the website, you will see Ogo already have used our API project demo is in this location. Here we can see the marketplace. User can buy and sell products. Let me see one. It can save your ship to the system and go see.
00:33:23.220 - 00:34:20.840, Speaker A: So the ship comes in here. Let me quickly go to the credit union. User can contribute and make withdrawal to DeFi protocol here. Can contribute in ongoing, can decide to save as individual. Let's say you want to say zero point 58 contributes and it's been saved. Okay. So this transaction can be viewed on the blockchain.
00:34:20.840 - 00:34:45.140, Speaker A: User can also decide to make withdrawal. A lot of features in this system. Thank you very much for watching Office. Lots of great. Thanks, Benjamin. I'll pass it over to the judges for questions and comments.
00:34:50.870 - 00:35:04.440, Speaker D: Great. So thank you so much for the demo. Hoping that you can explain a little bit more the connection between the aggregated DeFi protocol and the marketplace that you showed us.
00:35:06.510 - 00:35:38.510, Speaker A: Okay. The product itself is decentralized office. So It gives you access. You have an office that you can do a lot of things. So user have ability to take fund in the DeFi protocols and end. So it has a lot of features because we are making a decentralized office, we do a lot of things there. So you can actually sell your products in the ethereum blockchain and also buy products that is in the ethereum blockchain.
00:35:38.510 - 00:36:04.140, Speaker A: So there is also other features like decentralized image storage which then developers can use as content delivery network for their images and files for their software. Which of course I show you an example of an ecommerce site in our location locally. Here I introduced my project to them and they saw it is useful and they already started using it right now.
00:36:07.730 - 00:36:18.190, Speaker D: That makes sense. Thank you. Did you have a chance to use Ave compound or Uma yet? Were you hoping?
00:36:19.250 - 00:36:56.118, Speaker A: Yeah, I made use of compound protocol. Ave protocol online. The product is online. You can see the office link you can stake is on testnet. So when you make contributes is sent to the blockchain which is COVID testnet. Compound protocol is already being used and other protocols also I implemented them. The one on the test on the life is on compound protocol.
00:36:56.118 - 00:37:04.350, Speaker A: So if you do a test on compound protocol you can view it on the blockchain covan blockchain testnet.
00:37:08.130 - 00:37:22.770, Speaker E: Can I ask what stack did you use to create the front end and did you use custom smart contracts for the yield aggregation?
00:37:25.110 - 00:37:58.590, Speaker A: Yeah, I used Express JS, which is Node JS the most popular. I also use the bootstrap and all that to create the front end. There is a twink framework which is a template engine that is a template edging for Express JS.
00:38:04.150 - 00:38:06.754, Speaker E: Cool, perfect. Thank you.
00:38:06.952 - 00:38:12.100, Speaker D: What is the next thing you'd like to do in this project?
00:38:15.690 - 00:38:39.630, Speaker A: The way you see the project, I still have to improve on it. Right now I'm working on security to make sure that everything goes well. The user will not lose fund when they use the system. So right now I'm researching on the security of the system to see if everything is perfect. I can launch it on the main network.
00:38:45.890 - 00:38:46.542, Speaker E: Great.
00:38:46.676 - 00:39:10.200, Speaker A: Okay, thank you so much Benjamin. Really appreciate you being part of the hackathon and great work and we're going to move on to the next project. Thanks. Okay, so the next hack we're going to see is Para or Para ETH. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it the right way. So Holly, I think you on the call. Please play your demo when you're ready.
00:39:16.590 - 00:39:18.460, Speaker D: Hi, can you see?
00:39:19.550 - 00:39:20.540, Speaker A: All good.
00:39:21.070 - 00:39:37.214, Speaker D: All right. Welcome to Paris. First a little bit about me. My name is Holly. I work as a blockchain developer at the Sandbox. My Twitter handle is Ha Atkinson. If anyone wants to check out what I do.
00:39:37.214 - 00:40:28.880, Speaker D: Paris anyway is a very simple front end dev tool really that I really would have benefited from a few. Weeks ago when I was building on top of the Uniswap V Two token factory. It's a tool that can be used to search for and create token pairs on Uniswap V Two, as well as checking out the latest pairs using the existing Uniswap V Two subgraph. So, a bit of a demo. It's made with Create ETH app. So it has a react front end, and it's deployed to pair ETH using IPFS and ENS. So I'm going to just go to Uniswap now and grab the token contract addresses for sand and ETH and just drop those in here.
00:40:28.880 - 00:41:10.640, Speaker D: And what we should get is the correct pair address. So zero x three DD. Yeah, looks about right. So this is for when, you know two token addresses for existing tokens, and you want to know what the pair contract address actually is. It may or may not be showing on the Uniswap webpage. For instance, now with MetaMask as well, this actually works across various networks. I'm on main net at the moment, but this will also work on Rinkbee, Gurley, you name it.
00:41:10.640 - 00:41:52.940, Speaker D: The second feature that I want to show you is the ability to actually create a new pair contract if one doesn't exist. So let's just grab some addresses again. And I'm going to go for this bit, I'm going to go onto a test network and just change accounts. Okay, so let's drop in some fake addresses. That one exists. This one does not exist. So for this, yes, we would actually like to create the pair contract here.
00:41:52.940 - 00:42:20.910, Speaker D: And I'm going to click confirm. Fantastic. So we have now our new pair contract address on screen here. Finally, the additional feature that I would like to add is the ability to search for all matching pair contracts with just one token address. And that's something I'm working on at the moment. So watch this. Spade.
00:42:23.120 - 00:42:23.870, Speaker A: You.
00:42:34.280 - 00:42:59.276, Speaker D: Hey, Holly. Hey. Well done. I think this is really great. I really love that this came out of a problem that you had, you were trying to solve. I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but what sort of was your tech that you used sort of to build out this? Basically the full tech stack, really. I mean, I realize you've built this on Ethereum, but the front end and so forth? Sure.
00:42:59.276 - 00:43:51.432, Speaker D: So there's some open source software that I used to create quite a dynamic front end. There's Create ETH app, which is a react front end, but it also includes an example graph. And I was able to expand on the scripts in there with JavaScript. So I added in the functionality for talking to the Uniswap contract factory. And I also added in or check well, changed essentially the functionality in there to use the existing Uniswap V Two subgraph as opposed to build a new subgraph of my own. Thank you. I'm curious.
00:43:51.432 - 00:44:53.724, Speaker D: I know you mentioned that the search functionality would be the next thing that you would add. I'm wondering if there's anything else that you would add or any type of integrations that you would want to kind of add to your project. I would definitely want to see how I can integrate this more with what I do for my actual job. Because at the Sandbox we have a number of different tokens. We have ERC 20s, ERC 70 ones, and we have recently launched our version of liquidity mining and there will be various iterations on that sort of, I guess, train of thought. So for me as well, there's definitely a learning curve there in terms of learning more about the token functionality and how that can benefit from more of a DeFi angle. So that's a bit high level because I haven't got any specific integrations in mind as such in terms of specific token functionality.
00:44:53.724 - 00:45:28.430, Speaker D: But that's definitely the direction I'd like to go in in terms of learning, as I haven't been a dev for that long, actually. Perfect. And I guess just a quick follow up to that is how much time do you anticipate that this tool will now save you now that you have it? It really depends how good someone's JavaScript skills are, I guess, in terms of writing the scripts, but probably a couple of hours. I just hope someone finds it useful, really, someone out there. Thank you.
00:45:31.060 - 00:46:13.516, Speaker E: And just expanding on that right now there's a lot of uniswap dashboards that are becoming really popular, but then maybe one doesn't have what another does. And do you think that with this, what you built, that you could continue adding maybe new features that surface new information about this token pairs? Because now that you can read them and you can access the subgraph, you can start showing more and more information on them, right?
00:46:13.698 - 00:46:24.930, Speaker D: Absolutely. There's so much information there that could be shown and so many ways of adding more routes to the front end. I kept it simple for this because of time constraints, but absolutely.
00:46:28.820 - 00:46:29.328, Speaker A: Cool.
00:46:29.414 - 00:46:48.128, Speaker E: Excellent. I don't have any more questions there. How did you find working with the subgraph? Was it easy to get into? You need to read about that.
00:46:48.314 - 00:47:40.410, Speaker D: I needed to do a lot of reading. It was my first time using the graph at all and it was easy to make the Http requests. It was less easy to figure out how to write and integrate the GQL query, especially the one I'm working on at the moment where you need to send params and create ETH app is actually using Apollo client. So there's a number of different tools there that I've had to do a lot of learning on to make sure they can work properly. And I think that the docs on making nested queries with GQL could do with a few more examples to be honest. But generally using the subgraph has been really.
00:47:43.260 - 00:47:49.864, Speaker A: Great. Awesome. Thanks Holly. Really appreciate you being part of the event. Great job.
00:47:50.062 - 00:47:51.150, Speaker D: Cheers, everyone.
00:47:51.920 - 00:48:17.556, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so next up is Coinosis, and I'm actually going to play your video for you as I understand how this is going to work. So let me do that and then we'll jump into Q and A as normal. Perfect. Thank you. Follow my own instructions. I forgot the Share audio button there.
00:48:17.556 - 00:48:39.390, Speaker A: Wenosis works.
00:48:40.000 - 00:49:13.944, Speaker H: First, I have created an event that is called Demo for ETH Online. So I'm going to be with my colleague Juan. We're side chain of Xdive, which is the production chain that we're using, has been super useful. So I'm just signing my transaction. I'm going to deposit two Xdai, well, in this case, SPOA. And Juan is going to do the same. When the event starts, it's going to be in three minutes.
00:49:13.944 - 00:50:09.472, Speaker H: We're going to be able to join a call and we're not going to have a class or a lesson, but it's just thinking, or we have developed this thinking on an educational environment. So here I can join the call that money is going to be distributed among Juan and I, according to the collapse that each one of us have received opportunity for us to show the work we had been doing with Emilio Silva too. He's part of the team. He was the main developer, or he's still the main developer. And Juan and I were more on the educational part, thinking how to use this platform as a way to improve the learning system. Hey, this is me. I'm Juan from Colombia.
00:50:09.472 - 00:50:53.744, Speaker H: And yeah, in a minute you are going to see Juan that is joining from Berlin. He's also Colombian, but he has been living there for a while. And we are going to show you how to send some claps and reward people for their knowledge. They are staking some money and if they do well, they're going to get money according to the recognition of the group, to receive some feedback from the awesome mentors that we have had through this hackathon. So, just to be clear, this was a development that Emilio and I had been doing for the last four months. And Juan is helping us on the educational part. He has some knowledge on educational experience.
00:50:53.744 - 00:51:11.568, Speaker H: So that was the team, emilio, Juan and another Juan. I'm juan. David. As you can see on the screen, we are in the step two of our methodology. Juan has joined to this call and we're going to explain how the claps works. And he is also going to introduce himself.
00:51:11.664 - 00:51:26.796, Speaker G: My name is Juan teammate from Juan David in our project, and I'm going to show you how it works. The lab rewards. We are both very passionate about education.
00:51:26.898 - 00:51:30.908, Speaker A: And academic tools, and we want to.
00:51:30.914 - 00:51:55.840, Speaker G: Implement purposes and we have this way of showing application for each other. We are part of the group. We can lapse here and like a way we see it like a way of tokenized participation.
00:51:57.160 - 00:52:24.744, Speaker H: As you can see, I'm recording my screen. I have sent to Juan 23 claps and he has sent me five claps. So let's round up this number to 25. So let's imagine that at the end, that's going to be the result. 25 claps for Juan, who has been working in the education ecosystem longer than me. So he was explaining something to me. And at the end, five out of 25 is something like one fifth of the stake.
00:52:24.744 - 00:52:55.350, Speaker H: That in this case is four X die. So that is going to be one fifth of the reward is going to be back to me, and four out of five of those units are going to be back. As Juan mentioned, this is a way to tokenize our knowledge. Sorry for the audi quality, but I guess you understand the concept.
00:52:56.890 - 00:53:09.020, Speaker E: Yeah. Hey, Juan. That was interesting. So you showed a call between two people and both of them had to stake. Right? You mentioned that this.
