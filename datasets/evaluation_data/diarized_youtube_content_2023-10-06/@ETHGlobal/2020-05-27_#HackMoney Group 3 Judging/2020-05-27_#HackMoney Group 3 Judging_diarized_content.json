        "text": "Hello everybody. Welcome to Hack money DeFi hackathon judging day three. I am Kartik, one of the co founders of ETH Global, and we are on our third day of judging our amazing submissions for the DeFi hackathon that we've done for the past five weeks. So for those of you who don't know from the live stream, hack Money was a hackathon organized by ETH Global. And over the past four weeks we had a little bit over 350 hackers from 40 different countries and 15 different time zones compete and work on a lot of projects in the space of DFI and Ethereum. We had amazing people from all these countries. We had over 40 mentors who were available and helped out our hackers with anything technical, product and even market related help requests and an amazing set of sponsors that made all this possible by dedicating their time and resources. Into making sure that the teams who wanted to build on top of their platforms were successful and got the help they need to actually take composability in this space to the next level. And let me say this one more time. We had over 350 hackers, spent four weeks on hacking towards amazing projects in this space. And as of Sunday night, when submissions ended, we had 118 D Five projects that came out of this event. And this is the entire week we're taking to make sure that we review them and they get to talk to the judges and everybody else about what they've done. And the third day of this is about making sure that we get to see the top projects for today. So I want to quickly walk over the logistics of how the next 2 hours are going to work. We have 14 teams today and each team will get four minutes for a demo and three minutes for questions. So seven minutes in total per team. And just to make sure that we're minimizing any AV difficulties, we've pre recorded the demos for all the teams and we'll be playing those videos directly as the teams go live. And as a quick overview of how this event and the teams were set up. The rules for this whole event were simple. A team could have a maximum of five members. They were sold out to work individually if they wanted to, and a few of them did. And the only kind of main criteria was that they must incorporate D Five primitives in their hacks. And then of course, because the event started on the 24 April, all code that was submitted for the hackathon must have been written over the course of the hackathon itself. So everything you're going to see today will be the result of what was done over the course of four weeks. And in terms of kind of how judging will work, our judges will be rating and scoring these teams on these five categories, which would be the technicality and the originality and the practicality of a project and also the design and the UX of their submission. And a general catch all for any outliers that we call wow Factor. And just to remind everybody on the live stream that this is not a competition. The teams are here to learn and build, the hackers are really here to share their excitement and the judges are here to primarily give their feedback. Not everybody's trying to become a business from these companies, nor do we want them to do that necessarily. A lot of them are free to try out and experiment with this space. But the goal from our side is to ensure that there's a lot more experimentation. So quickly, the schedule for today is that these are the teams that will be going up one by one and talking about their demos. And the judges that we have for today calvin Liu from Compound, alice Corsini from Proofable Things, and Austin Griffith from the Ethereum Foundation will be our three main judges that will be looking at all of our demos giving feedback and asking questions to these teams and doing the hard work that, frankly, we are extremely thankful for and getting their comments on these projects. So with that, I want to actually kick off our very first demo for the day and that is Project Context. So please welcome Project Context to the Zoom call and I'll let them take it from hey guys. So, cannot share my screen, but now I can. Cool. So I joined Hackmany to see if I can build an Ethereum app on my own, basically. And I took a JavaScript class and a React class and then spent a decent amount away through Stack Overflow. And I noticed that especially on Ethereum problems, I still relied mainly on asking friends. But the thing is, solutions were there, but they were pretty hard to find, they are pretty hidden. So what I started to build was a social node tool that would be able to scale this Ethereum mentor relationship. And it's not a problem of content creation like we don't need a patreon clone, but rather curation. I want to incentivize people to link all those juicy bits of information hidden in newsletters and special forums and the depths of Twitter feeds and link them back to relevant sites with traffics like you can see here, Ethereum.org. So with my Chrome extension I can now edit the site's content, open notes, add highlights, or simply add links to useful related content and save everything to IPFS using Freebox. And then any other application can pick this up. In this case, it's just my extension also being able to read that. So basically you can add in Share just like a shared Google document, only that now the whole internet becomes your shared Google Document. And in its UX it also follows the advantages of Reddit. So there are upwards and downwards summing up to public measurement of reputation, just like karma and the advantages of Twitter, which means you can filter all public messages through your follows and allow the accounts you follow to retweet into your feed. So additional to serverledge storage. Also, the difference is that your reputation is bound to your ETH address, which for example, lets anyone directly reward you with crypto money. Users can choose to stay anonymous or they can verify your web two, their web two identities from Twitter, Reddit, GitHub or any other social platform and this way import their existing reputation. So now also anyone could look up their Twitter name and find their corresponding Linked ease account. So it's like a decentralized addressbook, right? And I just want to make clear quickly that right now I'm using three box interface, but later I want to integrate that into my UI, just make it feel like a product, right? But it's just awesome that simply use their work and build on top and just prototype quickly. I know Austin loves that up until now. So we added content, right, which is sort of the supply side of information. But now let's look at the demand side at those guys who need content curated, for which I added boundaries so they allow an A one to signal the need for information and to add a price tag and then match those guys with the content curators, which is pretty similar to Gitcoin. It's nothing new with the difference that in the end there is no wrong or right. There is no working code versus broken code. It's just information. Right? So to fairly reward contributors, we need some subjective measure of quality of information. We want to contributions from accounts you follow, but we also want from strangers, right? You want to scale it and you want to make sure that those guys also don't spam you. So to guarantee this, you want to make sure you use your web of trust. And right now I'm following this guy and this is just sort of like a DeFi copy of Twitter. You simply start by opening a funding pool of certain topic, which could be say, Ethereum Foundation, who want to have a continuous pool dedicated to curating links to DeFi projects on Ethereum.org. You open a fund, you fund the pool, then you follow your friends, your friends then upload the strangers post. And when the bounty vote, you give feedback on every post and reward everyone according to those numbers to the upwards. And finally, this curation game is not just great for DeFi education, but because it's stored on IPFS, any application can access the curated information of these web of trust relationships between Etherdresses. So for example, you could spot fake news, or you could curate MetaMask warnings for phishing sites, or you could help Ether scan to take malicious addresses quickly. Or you could do stuff like curate CSS code for any website so you can get dark mode anywhere and pay people for just putting up this CSS and whatever you can imagine. Right. So, yeah, thanks for tuning in and I'm looking forward to get your feedback. So, just to start it off, just to think through it. So basically it's a browser extension that lets you write notes and share those notes with your social web of trust and then using signed messages, basically you can basically build a web of trust between people and that's all stored in IPFS. Is that a pretty good way to sum it up? Exactly, yeah. And there's two ways to build this web of trust. Like you could import your Twitter GitHub or whatever, or you could build it anonymously just with Vox, just for your ease. And is there a private key that's stored in the extension or are you extending some other key management system? So it's all built on three box, basically. Okay. And I'm using portis. Right, okay, so portis for the private keys and three box for the storage and social graph. Exactly. Cool. That's pretty interesting."
