00:00:06.250 - 00:00:17.630, Speaker A: So I'll transition it over a couple minutes early here. Then we are going to have Elaine speaking next on mev activity since the merge strategies searchers and Builders during marketbacks.
00:00:19.810 - 00:00:30.502, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Just checking if the audio is working right. So in the next 15 to 20 minutes I'm going to go through some.
00:00:30.556 - 00:00:33.122, Speaker C: Of the mev activities since the merge.
00:00:33.186 - 00:00:36.546, Speaker B: I'll touch a bit on everything including.
00:00:36.658 - 00:00:39.678, Speaker C: The strategy, the searcher strategy, the proposals.
00:00:39.794 - 00:00:43.542, Speaker B: The builder competition, market and specifically touching.
00:00:43.606 - 00:00:57.166, Speaker C: Two recent stress or market crisis events. Yeah, so let's get started. So before I go into the data.
00:00:57.268 - 00:01:08.334, Speaker B: I'd like to highlight the concept of nev because it's a theoretical value that sometimes it's difficult to assess and obtain.
00:01:08.382 - 00:01:37.002, Speaker C: All the data on chain to do this. So therefore we introduced a concept of realized extractable value. So rev is the actual value that we can observe on chain that's from the mev opportunities. So before the merge we've done something similar by collecting the rev from the proposer balance change or the minor balance change.
00:01:37.056 - 00:01:49.242, Speaker B: And after the merge we are collecting the same data. So here we're using the east send to the proposer as an approximation for the total rev.
00:01:49.386 - 00:01:54.494, Speaker C: But bear in mind the rev pi, which is only a portion of the.
00:01:54.532 - 00:02:01.346, Speaker B: Mev theoretical pi, also contains different parts. For example, we only look at the.
00:02:01.368 - 00:02:10.150, Speaker C: Atomic arbitrages, the MEB opportunities, we don't look at any kind of arbitrages outside one block.
00:02:10.490 - 00:02:13.634, Speaker B: There are also revs on other domains.
00:02:13.682 - 00:02:16.082, Speaker C: On cross domains, and also on centralized.
00:02:16.146 - 00:02:20.970, Speaker B: Exchange, which currently we don't have too much data on these.
00:02:21.120 - 00:02:26.554, Speaker C: So the numbers that we see currently in the ecosystem is mostly focused on.
00:02:26.592 - 00:02:46.890, Speaker B: Atomic arbitrage or mev opportunities on chain. And some of you might be aware of one of the products that we have from flashboards, which is called Mavix Core and there have been many quotation of the numbers from Mavix Core.
00:02:47.050 - 00:02:54.594, Speaker C: But just to highlight that, Mavix Core only represents a small portion of the pie. So when you look at the data.
00:02:54.712 - 00:03:01.078, Speaker B: From MAV Explore, just bear in mind that doesn't tell you the whole picture. Okay?
00:03:01.244 - 00:03:03.398, Speaker C: So let's have a look at the.
00:03:03.564 - 00:03:10.426, Speaker B: Mev activities since the merge. On layer one back in 2021, we.
00:03:10.448 - 00:03:16.746, Speaker C: Have produced similar numbers using Mabix core. Here we're showing on the right hand.
00:03:16.768 - 00:03:19.942, Speaker B: Side a twelve month coverage of mev.
00:03:20.006 - 00:03:24.534, Speaker C: Activities from liquidations and arbitrages and that's.
00:03:24.582 - 00:03:25.822, Speaker B: In total of 475,000,000.
00:03:25.876 - 00:03:31.950, Speaker C: And bear in mind that the dollar value was based on the east price.
00:03:32.020 - 00:03:36.626, Speaker B: At the time at the end of 2021, which is probably much higher than.
00:03:36.648 - 00:03:40.226, Speaker C: Where we are now. On the left hand side is what.
00:03:40.248 - 00:03:43.838, Speaker B: I'm going to show you in the following slides.
00:03:44.014 - 00:03:46.306, Speaker C: This is the six months since the.
00:03:46.328 - 00:03:49.074, Speaker B: Merge and in total we've seen the.
00:03:49.112 - 00:03:54.674, Speaker C: Total e sent to the validators around 146,000 ease.
00:03:54.802 - 00:04:08.314, Speaker B: That's equivalent to around 260,000,000 in dollar value today. Just looking at this number, again, just to highlight that we are using the.
00:04:08.352 - 00:04:11.914, Speaker C: East pay two proposes as an approximation.
00:04:11.962 - 00:04:13.690, Speaker B: For the total mev.
00:04:13.850 - 00:04:22.382, Speaker C: And we've seen this number have been accumulating since the merge. But you can see two distinct bar.
00:04:22.436 - 00:04:24.818, Speaker B: Charts on the right hand side here.
00:04:24.984 - 00:04:35.922, Speaker C: Where the weekly numbers are actually much higher than the other weeks. So these are the two events that I will talk about later on in my slides.
00:04:35.986 - 00:04:39.842, Speaker B: So these are the two market crisis events happened recently.
00:04:39.906 - 00:04:46.262, Speaker C: One in November, the FTX collapse. One in March. Not too long ago, the bank run.
00:04:46.316 - 00:04:50.330, Speaker B: Owned SVB, and also shortly the pegging of the stablecoins.
00:04:54.350 - 00:04:56.790, Speaker C: Just to show you all the parties.
00:04:56.870 - 00:05:00.202, Speaker B: Involved in the supply chain, we're talking.
00:05:00.256 - 00:05:02.346, Speaker C: About only the ease pay to proposers.
00:05:02.378 - 00:05:08.090, Speaker B: Which is only one component, or one party involved in the supply chain.
00:05:08.170 - 00:05:14.034, Speaker C: And if we make a simple assumption to say the other parties other than.
00:05:14.152 - 00:05:20.770, Speaker B: The proposer and the searcher receives no mev, which is not exactly accurate at the moment.
00:05:20.840 - 00:05:30.626, Speaker C: For example, the builders, some builders do take a profit from building the block. But let's just assume the breakdown is only between searchers and proposers.
00:05:30.658 - 00:05:34.054, Speaker B: We see a 48% mev going to.
00:05:34.092 - 00:05:38.186, Speaker C: The searcher and 52 going to the proposer. So the numbers I show in the.
00:05:38.208 - 00:05:54.746, Speaker B: Previous slides only represent that 52%, roughly on average. Okay, so since the merge, what's happening with the relay? So we see the relay competition has been increasing.
00:05:54.778 - 00:05:58.778, Speaker C: There are more relays in the ecosystem now than since the merge.
00:05:58.954 - 00:06:02.110, Speaker B: At the beginning we have just flashboards.
00:06:03.430 - 00:06:07.054, Speaker C: And no other relays in the ecosystem.
00:06:07.182 - 00:06:09.246, Speaker B: Now we have multiple relays.
00:06:09.278 - 00:06:12.834, Speaker C: And you see flashboards slot shares has.
00:06:12.872 - 00:06:16.194, Speaker B: Been decreasing since the beginning of this year.
00:06:16.392 - 00:06:35.946, Speaker C: At the bottom here, you can also see the east paid from flashboards relay versus the others. You also see there used to be a gap where flashboards relay pays more than the others. But now this gap is closing rapidly. Looking at the builder space, also at.
00:06:35.968 - 00:06:39.306, Speaker B: The beginning, at the beginning, since the.
00:06:39.328 - 00:06:41.770, Speaker C: Merge, we have flashboards and also builder.
00:06:41.850 - 00:06:45.518, Speaker B: Zero x 69 dominating the market.
00:06:45.604 - 00:06:52.878, Speaker C: But then the share from flashboards builder also started to decrease since the beginning of this year.
00:06:52.964 - 00:06:58.558, Speaker B: And now we have shown just the top ten builders in the space that we can identify.
00:06:58.654 - 00:08:05.910, Speaker C: But at the same time, there are many other smaller builders I haven't included, which I will touch base on the later slides. So latency. So what do we mean by latency? Usually, among all the parties involved in the supply chain, we look at when the block submission happens. So this slide shows the time the validator asks for the get header from the builder. So this is around 400 milliseconds after the slot starts. So after this 400 milliseconds, the validator starts to ask for the bid from the block builder and when was the block ready? On average? Here we see that the average winning blocks winning blocks means the blocks that actually lended on chain on average they arrive 149 milliseconds before the slot starts. Just going to show you the winning blocks.
00:08:05.910 - 00:08:15.306, Speaker C: Also the proposed the lended blocks versus all the blocks submitted to a slot. So this chart shows you actually a.
00:08:15.328 - 00:08:18.538, Speaker B: Very interesting picture that most of the.
00:08:18.544 - 00:08:23.902, Speaker C: Blocks actually submitted in the last 2 seconds of the slot. And this is what we are talking.
00:08:23.956 - 00:08:25.870, Speaker B: About in terms of latency.
00:08:26.370 - 00:08:56.214, Speaker C: So there is a delay from each involved party to submit the block as late as possible to the end of the slot so they can include as much transaction as possible to increase the total profit. So here this picture just shows you that most of the blocks that lended on chain arrives 2 seconds before and also some of them are too late 2 seconds after the slot ends. But at the beginning, let's say the.
00:08:56.252 - 00:09:01.750, Speaker B: First 10 seconds, there are not that many blocks being submitted.
00:09:01.830 - 00:09:05.162, Speaker C: So high latency in block submission could.
00:09:05.216 - 00:09:07.946, Speaker B: Cause some major issues.
00:09:08.048 - 00:09:34.290, Speaker C: For example the delay in the Attestation and also the congestion in the last few seconds to the network. I believe there are speakers talking specifically about the latency problem in the later sections, so I won't touch too much details in this. So now zooming in to the two recent market panic events.
00:09:35.430 - 00:09:41.334, Speaker B: One happened on the 9 November when FTX and three Arrow Capital collapse and.
00:09:41.372 - 00:09:49.210, Speaker C: The other one very fresh in your mind probably just a few weeks ago that we saw the SVB Bank run.
00:09:49.360 - 00:09:51.930, Speaker B: And the stable coins such as USDC.
00:09:53.470 - 00:09:55.350, Speaker C: And Dai depict shortly.
00:09:55.430 - 00:10:02.590, Speaker B: So here's a chart showing the bitcoin price and the east price during these two crisis.
00:10:03.090 - 00:10:30.686, Speaker C: Interestingly, you see the first crisis actually lasted much longer all the way until almost the beginning of February, whereas the recent event recovers very swiftly. So why do we want to look into these two events and what is particularly interesting? So here we can see the daily mev paid to the proposals have reached.
00:10:30.798 - 00:10:32.438, Speaker B: All time high since the merge in.
00:10:32.444 - 00:10:41.094, Speaker C: A recent event and that's like nine times more than the average daily mev. And that's due to the USDC deepak.
00:10:41.142 - 00:10:45.100, Speaker B: Events shortly happened after the SVB bank run.
00:10:45.470 - 00:10:52.026, Speaker C: Whereas before in the FTX collapse event we see a slightly less severe in.
00:10:52.048 - 00:10:56.830, Speaker B: Terms of the nev sent to proposes.
00:10:57.250 - 00:11:00.350, Speaker C: But still six times more than the average.
00:11:03.190 - 00:11:07.426, Speaker B: Also looking into the mev from a.
00:11:07.448 - 00:11:23.746, Speaker C: Searcher'S perspective, we collected the data from Eigenfi. This is showing the Arbitrage Sandwich and liquidation specifically during these two events. You can also see the same pattern.
00:11:23.938 - 00:11:26.840, Speaker B: Can be observed from this chart where.
00:11:27.210 - 00:11:31.130, Speaker C: The Arbitrage volume on that day skyrocketed.
00:11:34.270 - 00:11:47.022, Speaker B: Interestingly looking at the cross domain. So the cross domain shows a slightly different story. You can see the FTX event has.
00:11:47.076 - 00:11:49.354, Speaker C: More impact on a cross domain, whereas.
00:11:49.402 - 00:12:04.366, Speaker B: The recent bank run, SVB bank run and the DPAC event is more contained within the Ethereum network. So interesting, data from semiotics cross chain.
00:12:04.558 - 00:12:11.254, Speaker C: MEP specifically, we are going to look.
00:12:11.292 - 00:12:17.106, Speaker B: At how much ease were paid on these two days to proposers and what's.
00:12:17.138 - 00:12:26.470, Speaker C: The builder competition look like during these two days, and also the latency in block submission. And these are on ethereum.
00:12:26.630 - 00:12:28.346, Speaker B: And we're also going to look at.
00:12:28.368 - 00:12:31.520, Speaker C: The cross domain strategies on these two days.
00:12:33.250 - 00:12:38.958, Speaker B: So, on the 11 March, when the.
00:12:39.044 - 00:13:15.340, Speaker C: Bank run happened, we see that 6000 ease has been sent to the proposers. So this is equivalent to or even more than the average weekly total ease paid to proposers. So at the bottom here, you see the weekly average is around 4000, where on that single day on the 11 March you see 6000 paid. Similarly, on the 9 November when FTX collapsed, you see around 4000 is paid. So, these are extremely large single day MEB activities that I'm highlighting here.
00:13:15.870 - 00:13:24.874, Speaker B: On the right hand side, I have a breakdown by the builders in terms of the total east paid to proposes.
00:13:25.002 - 00:13:27.934, Speaker C: So, back in November we see that.
00:13:27.972 - 00:13:36.610, Speaker B: The top builders flash was Beaver build and builder 69 dominates the market, taking.
00:13:36.680 - 00:13:48.966, Speaker C: About over 60% of the market. But in a recent event, the top builders portion have actually decreased. We see more builders coming into the.
00:13:48.988 - 00:13:51.366, Speaker B: Space and the non top builders or.
00:13:51.388 - 00:14:26.622, Speaker C: The smaller builders actually takes 60% of the total east pay to propose it. So you see a kind of decentralization happening, a diversification in the builder market from the recent event compared to back in November. Now, what about the searcher strategies? So, we also look at these two days. So on the left hand side you can see the arbitrage on these two days, and on the right hand side you can see the liquidation.
00:14:26.766 - 00:14:37.458, Speaker B: So, bear in mind, I mentioned the MAV inspect Pi, which powers the MAV Explorer dashboard, is only counting liquidation and arbitrage.
00:14:37.554 - 00:14:39.878, Speaker C: So it's only a small portion of.
00:14:39.964 - 00:14:45.906, Speaker B: What'S happening on that day. Just to highlight that, Eigenfi also provides.
00:14:45.938 - 00:14:49.706, Speaker C: This data and they also cover a.
00:14:49.728 - 00:14:52.426, Speaker B: Wider spectrum of the mev types, they.
00:14:52.448 - 00:14:58.006, Speaker C: Also cover sandwiches and also probably more protocols are included.
00:14:58.118 - 00:15:17.874, Speaker B: But here I'm just sampling the data on these two days from Mev explore. You can see that most of the arbitrage happened among ethereum bitcoin and stable coins. So in terms of the token that's been Arped, they're very similar between these.
00:15:17.912 - 00:15:28.438, Speaker C: Two events, but in terms of the liquidation, it's more event based. So, as you can see that the recent event at the bottom here we.
00:15:28.524 - 00:15:32.642, Speaker B: See the curve pool actually have gained.
00:15:32.706 - 00:15:36.534, Speaker C: A lot more portion in the whole.
00:15:36.572 - 00:15:40.170, Speaker B: Pie, whereas the November event is also.
00:15:40.240 - 00:15:50.646, Speaker C: Simply arbing through across different tokens. Okay, in terms of the search strategy.
00:15:50.678 - 00:15:59.054, Speaker B: By protocol, this is also looking into MAV Explorer data where we included nine.
00:15:59.092 - 00:16:00.960, Speaker C: Different protocols in this data.
00:16:01.490 - 00:16:05.810, Speaker B: Just comparing the two days, we see the same story.
00:16:05.880 - 00:16:10.286, Speaker C: Basically, back in November when FTX collapsed.
00:16:10.398 - 00:16:24.310, Speaker B: Most of the arbitrages happened on Uniswap V two and V three, whereas the recent event we see an increase in the percentage in Arbing on the curve stablecoin pool.
00:16:25.050 - 00:16:28.294, Speaker C: And in terms of liquidation, the recent.
00:16:28.342 - 00:16:32.746, Speaker B: Event has not much in terms of.
00:16:32.768 - 00:17:16.406, Speaker C: Dollar value of liquidation, that's kind of obvious because the recent event is not highly correlated to a liquidation event, whereas the FTX has a wider effect in the market where more liquidations were happening. Okay, in terms of latency, here on the left hand side we see the November FTX event, and then on the right hand side we see the recent event. Very interestingly, the chart on the right hand side is very similar to the overall chart that I've shown at the.
00:17:16.428 - 00:17:18.190, Speaker B: Beginning of this presentation.
00:17:18.370 - 00:17:23.850, Speaker C: And it's probably showing that the latency gain is more severe.
00:17:26.350 - 00:17:29.826, Speaker B: If we compare it to the beginning of the merge.
00:17:29.958 - 00:17:36.238, Speaker C: Because most of the blocks, if you look back to November, are submitted quite.
00:17:36.324 - 00:17:40.366, Speaker B: Evenly across different time frames of the.
00:17:40.388 - 00:17:58.006, Speaker C: 12 seconds, whereas now most of the blocks are submitted in the last 2 seconds. So just in a short span of four months, we see the latency gain is more severe. So this is probably not related to.
00:17:58.028 - 00:18:04.294, Speaker B: The market panic events, but more of a time comparison in terms of the.
00:18:04.332 - 00:18:10.010, Speaker C: Relay and the builders getting more sophisticated and competing on lending the block.
00:18:13.230 - 00:18:22.046, Speaker B: Now, looking at the cross domain, we have two different types of events happening.
00:18:22.148 - 00:18:29.694, Speaker C: Also on the cross domain, the top Arbitrage tokens are very similar to the.
00:18:29.732 - 00:18:32.206, Speaker B: Single domain, or on Ethereum, you can.
00:18:32.228 - 00:18:35.298, Speaker C: See most of the hopping paths happened.
00:18:35.384 - 00:18:41.010, Speaker B: Or initiated from either the stablecoins or Bitcoin or east.
00:18:41.590 - 00:18:45.158, Speaker C: So this is also very similar in.
00:18:45.164 - 00:18:47.238, Speaker B: Terms of the percentage, so it's probably.
00:18:47.324 - 00:18:51.350, Speaker C: Not that different across different market events.
00:18:51.930 - 00:18:57.554, Speaker B: Just one thing to highlight again, the cross domain mev in terms of US.
00:18:57.612 - 00:19:15.406, Speaker C: Dollar value is much higher back in the FTX collapsing event, but the recent event has a much lower Mev value. Looking at the chains and the particular.
00:19:15.508 - 00:19:20.110, Speaker B: Path, we see that Ethereum and BSc.
00:19:21.890 - 00:19:25.838, Speaker C: Are the most frequently Arped chains.
00:19:26.014 - 00:19:29.522, Speaker B: And also one thing to notice is.
00:19:29.576 - 00:19:37.750, Speaker C: Back in November we also see Polygon and Arbitrum, whereas in the recent event.
00:19:37.820 - 00:19:41.510, Speaker B: It'S mostly between Ethereum and BSc.
00:19:44.890 - 00:19:48.842, Speaker C: Okay, lastly, just a little bit more detail.
00:19:48.976 - 00:19:59.590, Speaker B: On the top ten Arbitrages, by profit, we have shown the top ten Arps conducted across different domains.
00:19:59.670 - 00:20:05.294, Speaker C: So this is the exact path the bots have simulated, where the bots can.
00:20:05.332 - 00:20:08.490, Speaker B: Detect any Arbitrage opportunities.
00:20:08.650 - 00:20:10.414, Speaker C: Just to bear in mind that the.
00:20:10.452 - 00:20:27.826, Speaker B: Data provided here is not actual cross chain mev realized data, it's based on simulations across different eight different chains and around 40 different decentralized exchanges and 60 tokens.
00:20:27.938 - 00:20:39.114, Speaker C: So there might be inaccuracy in the simulation where the missing Arbitrage opportunities or the missing data could cause the value to be even higher.
00:20:39.312 - 00:20:58.880, Speaker B: So just to summarize, I've talked a lot about different activities, mev trends in L, one in cross domain since the merge. So what we can summarize is that we know that mev estimation is very difficult.
00:20:59.250 - 00:21:03.370, Speaker C: We have only limited data from ethereum.
00:21:03.450 - 00:21:06.466, Speaker B: And on chain data there is a.
00:21:06.488 - 00:21:09.762, Speaker C: Lack of data in the estimation of.
00:21:09.816 - 00:21:17.926, Speaker B: Mev in the centralized exchange activities. We also observed that more relays and builders come into the ecosystem since the.
00:21:17.948 - 00:21:20.470, Speaker C: Merge and the space is more diversified.
00:21:21.530 - 00:21:24.982, Speaker B: The top builders market share interestingly during.
00:21:25.036 - 00:21:35.450, Speaker C: The high mev periods have actually decreased. So this is also a sign showing that the builder market is more diversified than since the merge.
00:21:36.270 - 00:21:40.102, Speaker B: In terms of search arbitrage strategies, we.
00:21:40.176 - 00:21:47.166, Speaker C: Don'T see too much of a difference between different market crisis. Most of the arbitrage strategies focus on.
00:21:47.268 - 00:21:51.390, Speaker B: Arbing across ethereum, bitcoin and stablecoins.
00:21:52.130 - 00:22:22.646, Speaker C: The liquidation strategies are actually event based. So if it's more of a cris that's related to liquidation of certain assets, then you will see the liquidation number in terms of mev goes up. But in the recent event this is not the case. Cross domain strategies also have the same pattern. The mev activity spiked during the crisis.
00:22:22.838 - 00:22:26.442, Speaker B: But in terms of the magnitude, on.
00:22:26.496 - 00:22:30.418, Speaker C: Average it's much higher than the daily average.
00:22:30.534 - 00:22:32.634, Speaker B: Probably because a lot of the cross.
00:22:32.682 - 00:22:36.174, Speaker C: Domain Arbitrages on a daily basis are.
00:22:36.212 - 00:22:41.834, Speaker B: Not as much as on ethereum. But when major events happen, the bots.
00:22:41.882 - 00:22:49.970, Speaker C: Are searching everywhere for opportunities. So that's why you see much more of a spike during these events.
00:22:50.470 - 00:23:02.374, Speaker B: And also the strategies differs from different market crisis, it's event driven. And lastly, just want to mention that.
00:23:02.412 - 00:23:23.002, Speaker C: Because of the lack of data we have a lot more room to improve in terms of the estimation of cross domain mev, the centralized exchange to decentralized exchange mev and there's still a lot of work to be done to collect the accurate mev activities and total values.
00:23:23.146 - 00:23:25.374, Speaker B: So here is a list of the.
00:23:25.412 - 00:23:28.014, Speaker C: References and also some of the interesting.
00:23:28.132 - 00:23:36.014, Speaker B: Readings that I recommend. Lastly, a special thanks to Tina from.
00:23:36.052 - 00:23:40.794, Speaker C: Flashboards and Eigenfi Blocks, route Metrica, Semiotics.
00:23:40.842 - 00:23:49.620, Speaker B: And Block Native for helping me prepare the slides and contributing to the charts and the data. Thank.
