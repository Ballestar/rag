00:00:00.490 - 00:00:13.630, Speaker A: So this isn't the main stage, but we'll do here. Let me introduce myself. My name is Nick. I'm the software well, first, let me know when we're rolling on the camera if you want to record it.
00:00:13.780 - 00:00:16.798, Speaker B: Perfect. Great.
00:00:16.964 - 00:00:44.060, Speaker A: My name is Nick. I'm the software integration engineer here at Wire, and I'm going to be talking about Wire and why it's beneficial to you as a developer, why you would use it, and the ways you would use our products here at Wire. So who here who is not employed by Wire, which limits the audience down to about 50%. Has heard of wire before.
00:00:44.830 - 00:00:45.338, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:45.424 - 00:00:46.780, Speaker A: 100%. Okay.
00:00:48.190 - 00:00:48.940, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:49.970 - 00:01:06.580, Speaker A: Who here has used Wire before? 25% for those on camera. We've got four people here. Not that many people. 25% is great. So let me ask you this. What have you used it for?
00:01:10.230 - 00:01:10.642, Speaker B: Cool.
00:01:10.696 - 00:01:19.320, Speaker A: So nothing in production, though. Okay, sweet. What would you test out, if you don't mind me asking? What did you.
00:01:24.890 - 00:01:25.494, Speaker B: Cool?
00:01:25.612 - 00:01:27.970, Speaker C: From us to Latin America?
00:01:28.050 - 00:01:38.810, Speaker A: It's a great use case. And why did you choose or why did you look into Wire? Because that case, obviously. So I guess my next question is, what stopped you from actually putting it into production?
00:01:39.710 - 00:01:42.400, Speaker C: On ramps are super hot.
00:01:45.170 - 00:01:49.790, Speaker A: Yes, true story. Okay, enough of me heckling the audience.
00:01:54.710 - 00:01:55.314, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:01:55.432 - 00:02:26.742, Speaker A: Okay, well, now that we've yes, more people. Come on in. Great. So now that you can know about Wires, what we do, I'll read here, promote financial innovation by offering entrepreneurs compliant ports in our regulated Fiat world. So what that really means is we do the compliance. We do the on ramp. We've built basically the trade engine for transfers, cross border payments, all the relationships with the banks.
00:02:26.742 - 00:02:54.994, Speaker A: We do all the stuff that really developers don't want to think about. We do that for you. So then you can focus on building products. So we take care of the banking and regulations. You build products so that users can then ramp on ramp from Fiat to crypto. Go from there. Feel free to interact too, since this is really small, private crowds, feel free to if you have any questions, ask them at any time or whatever is the case.
00:02:54.994 - 00:03:36.414, Speaker A: Feel free to ask for those that just came in the audience. My name is Nick. I'm the integration engineer here at Wire, and thanks for having me here. So, once again, Fintech's Hard, you guys don't want to spend the time actually doing the compliance, doing the onboarding, doing all the necessary backwork that we've spent past five years doing. You want to focus on building your products. You want to basically focus on bringing more users into the space to get on your platform and to do the things that you want them to do on your platform, onboard them. Convert crypto sorry, Fiat to crypto in under 48 seconds.
00:03:36.414 - 00:04:09.146, Speaker A: That's our fastest records. If you want to try to break that the hackathon, go for it. Might give you some prize money. So the main thing here for Wire, what you really want to take away is it's really two products, right? We've got our Widget and then our API. And then within those two products, really think about three things here. Thinking about accounts, payments and transfers. At a core, that's what Wire does.
00:04:09.146 - 00:04:11.840, Speaker A: All right, so again, what do we do?
00:04:13.970 - 00:04:14.766, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:04:14.948 - 00:04:21.642, Speaker A: Awesome. One out of the eight people got it counts, payments, transfers.
00:04:21.786 - 00:04:22.480, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:04:23.250 - 00:05:39.350, Speaker A: So that's on a high level, what our product does in order to go from Fiat to crypto, that's all you remember from this presentation today. And you go back and do the hackathon and connect with our Widget, our API, accounts, payments, transfers. So in accounts, basically you create accounts, right? Your user accounts, they go through a process. KYC AML, the payments, you add either credit or sorry, debit cards, banks, and then transfers, transferring from Fiat to crypto. What I want to focus here today on the Widget. So if you are using wire, bringing wire, integrating with wire into your application, the fastest and quickest way to go from zero to I want to say Fiat to crypto or zero to CryptoKitties or NFT tokens or ERC 20 tokens using wire is through the debit card feature on the Widget. What that means is that, as the product manager says, faster payments, faster onboarding, better user experience for your users.
00:05:39.350 - 00:06:02.000, Speaker A: So that way your users come on upload or put in a bank information or their debit card information and be able to buy whatever crypto they want and go from there and continue on on your platform. Does that make sense for everyone? Yes. Questions so far?
00:06:05.670 - 00:06:17.110, Speaker C: You were building like native mobile app, swift implementations react native.
00:06:19.290 - 00:06:38.086, Speaker A: Yes. Context. rceo Mike here. Yes, it did each. Yep. Neo just had a big launch. They used our debit card feature.
00:06:38.086 - 00:07:00.900, Speaker A: So it's pretty nice. Again, what were the three things here to remember? A plus. All right, let's remember his name. Give him some dive for price points. This is where I can go into the demo here. But I mean, as you can see here, I'll play the video. It's really simple.
00:07:00.900 - 00:07:31.262, Speaker A: They put in their information, upload information, right? User input. That was the accounts part. For the demo purposes, just put in 12345. The phone gets auto approved for the debit card or for the going fast. But for the email, you have to put a valid email address, which will then send you the confirmation, you confirm it, and then when going through the process again, we'll go through it here.
00:07:31.316 - 00:07:35.502, Speaker B: What part is this, guys? All right.
00:07:35.556 - 00:07:58.914, Speaker A: Accounts. Great. Then payments and then everything. All the dummy data. This is all the dummy data here is provided in the docs. In order to use our test environment with debit card, you just look at the docs, reference the API, read through there. You're going to have to put the credit card number.
00:07:58.914 - 00:08:07.698, Speaker A: There's a specific credit card and expiration date. There's a specific billing address you have to put in there to go through the flow transact and go from there. Does that make sense?
00:08:07.884 - 00:08:08.620, Speaker B: Cool.
00:08:13.320 - 00:09:07.830, Speaker A: Sweet and then again, our second type of product here is the API. So with the debit card, the Widget, we provide the UI experience. So you can then go from US. Dollars to Dyer to ETH in less than 48 seconds. But if you had the use case of wanting to create your own user experience and customize UI or other features that required you to do payouts or cross border payments, you use the API, like in your case, in your example you had earlier. So think about the not sure, don't want to confuse you too much, but reading through the docs again, accounts, payments, transfers, and there's a postman collection that you can use to get more familiar with the API. So who here has used before?
00:09:09.400 - 00:09:10.150, Speaker B: Cool.
00:09:11.080 - 00:09:46.360, Speaker A: Some people use postman. Super simple. I'm going to go ahead and show you the presentation right now on the postman. Give me a second. Okay, so I've got an overview. Got an overview here of our buckets. Again, accounts, payments, transfers, and then there's one other bucket, extra credit for subscribing to Webhooks if you want to go that do.
00:09:46.360 - 00:10:28.806, Speaker A: So without getting too much in the weeds with our API endpoint, who here is planning on using the API for this hackathon? Sweet okay, if you do use it, know that there are two types of authentication mechanisms, and feel free to ping us on discord if you have any questions. But basically this is the quickest and easiest way to use it is through Postman. There are different endpoints here. So if I want to get my accounts, I just click on Get Accounts send it's going to send back my account information. All the information is in the docs. Just go ahead and have a read. You're going to have to put, well, I'm not going to open up that because it's going to show you my secret key.
00:10:28.806 - 00:10:57.666, Speaker A: And it's recorded. So that was a quick one, that was a close one. Then create an account. Again, you would have to populate your own environments in Postman, and then just click a button, and then you'll see back all the JSON object returned. So that way if you wanted to build your own UX UI experience for your users, you have that to play with as an open source tool. Makes sense. Sweet all right, so let's go in here.
00:10:57.666 - 00:11:33.820, Speaker A: If I wanted to create a transfer cool. Got transfer information, have my endpoints, create the transfer. Bam, comes back, unconfirmed status. Don't want to get too much into the weeds. You can then here go into even though I am confirming the transfer, boom, hit the endpoint, confirm the transfer, goes into pending status, get transfer, boom, gets it, it's completed. Super simple transfers, fiat to crypto under 48 seconds. Very simple.
00:11:33.820 - 00:12:20.810, Speaker A: And that's really about it. I know it was short, and I didn't know how much in detail you guys wanted me to go into, but feel free if you have any questions. Go to discord. There's the Discord Channel. There's our API, documentation for the camera. There are prizes. So if you want to prize money, pretty good size prize, a little under $3,000 in a few different tokens die and Zero X tokens for our joint partnerships here ourselves, zero X and Fordmatic.
00:12:20.810 - 00:13:18.750, Speaker A: And basically, hint hint, we're going to give most, or at least we'll heavily prefer people who build. For the debit card widget that I showed earlier, there's a specific parameter that you pass in when initializing the debit card. That's a destination address that you then send the ETH to or your Crypto to. We are going to focus on giving some of the prize money away to anyone who wants to come in and build a forward function or smart contract that then replicates that wallet address with another address for a forward function or smart contract address. So if you wanted to do any cool things with that type of implementation, that's something that we're looking into. And that's it. There's our URLs for the postman, our API.
00:13:18.750 - 00:13:57.306, Speaker A: Again, use our test account and test URL instead of production. And feel free if you run in any questions, I'm here at the booth. Feel free to ping us on Discord. And, yeah, I've got some time for questions. Yes, we've also that's it. All right, again, quiz time. What are the three things? Say it again.
00:13:57.306 - 00:13:59.260, Speaker A: Payments, accounts, transfer.
00:14:01.070 - 00:14:01.820, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:14:03.390 - 00:14:10.120, Speaker A: Awesome. And that's about it. You guys have fun. Focus on building. I'll be here if you have any other questions.
