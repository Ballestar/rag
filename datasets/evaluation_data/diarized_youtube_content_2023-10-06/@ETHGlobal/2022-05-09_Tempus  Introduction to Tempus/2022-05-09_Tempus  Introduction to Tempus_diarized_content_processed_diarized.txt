00:00:00.090 - 00:00:02.400, Speaker A: For the live stream to get set up.
00:00:16.690 - 00:00:17.102, Speaker B: Great.
00:00:17.156 - 00:00:28.990, Speaker A: So I have Georgia here with me and he's going to give you an introduction into Tempest today and if you have any questions, feel in the chat and we can take them at the end.
00:00:29.060 - 00:00:32.814, Speaker B: Thanks. Perfect.
00:00:32.932 - 00:02:06.686, Speaker C: Thank you for the intro. My name is George and I'm here to give you very short introduction to Tempest and what we built so far. So we started with building fixed income protocol. What does fixed income mean? It means, like if you deposit funds somewhere, either a bank or DeFi pool or anything similar to that, you would get, like, fixed amount of money at the end after some predefined amount of time, let's say you want to fix your yield for one year, you would deposit to such a pool and after one year expired, you would get, let's say, five or 10% or something like that. Where do the DeFi yields come from? So obvious ones are lending staking or decentralized exchange LP tokens. So one common thing for all of them is that they are variable depending on market conditions. So what does it mean for Dex LP tokens? It means if more swaps are there, you will receive more yield for lending.
00:02:06.686 - 00:03:24.140, Speaker C: Obviously, if more people borrow, you get more yield. But all of them are risky and all of them can go up and down depending on bullish or bearish market. So how Tempest fixed income works is that we actually build secondary market on top of these yields that I already mentioned. So let's say we build a pool that has some properties. These properties are like start date is obviously when we deploy the pool, end date is the maturity date. So between these two dates you can deposit and fix your yield up until maturity date. So one important thing is the actual underlying protocol and the pool we have integrated so far yearn compound ave, lidl and I think Arari as well, but we don't use all of them obviously.
00:03:24.140 - 00:05:36.806, Speaker C: So another thing that we need to initialize is also AMM which I will explain how actually works in our yeah, speaking of that, how one gets fixed rate, what I have here is explanation in case of lido so people can deposit it or stake it to tempus pool, they get equal amount of capitals and yields. So just to make it more simple, capitals and yields are in financial terms they are zero coupon bonds where capital is redeemable one to one to backing token at maturity and yield token is zero coupon bond redeemable for the actual amount of yield that is accrued on one capital. So basically, what does it mean? How to fix your yield is actually to sell off your yield tokens for capital tokens and at maturity you will have fixed amount of it or stake it. In this case. Our AMM is built to directly trade capital against yields which allows us to have more capital efficient market because you don't need to provide liquidity with additional stable coins. If we developed two AMMS that trade capital with stablecoin and yields with stablecoin, we decided to trade them directly. It's built as a balancer stable pool with some Tweaks and yeah, it's basically not only the tool to trade the tokens but it actually sets the rates of the market.
00:05:36.806 - 00:06:26.130, Speaker C: So AMM dictates what's the fixed rate that you can get currently and vice versa. So if one thinks that the current fixed rate is too low, he can buy more yield tokens. So sell off his capital for yield tokens and that would be basically leverage the yield. This was in short I plan to submit few. We as a team plan to submit few medium posts. We already have some explaining in more detail all of the parts that I just went through really quickly. So if you want to inform more about any of these, you can find it there or in our docs.
00:06:26.130 - 00:07:51.150, Speaker C: So for hackathon I have few ideas here. Let's say I will go through one by one and all of these ideas I think we will have some posts explaining where to start building this. So one of them is new protocol integration. What does it mean? You can take for example Maple Finance or any other protocol that we already don't support and implement tempus pool for that particular protocol it includes some smart contracts methods like calculating current interest rate or current index liquidity index. So yeah, it's not too complex but most complexity comes to understanding how the underlying protocol works. Another one would be new blockchain deployment which in itself probably includes the new protocol integration because the only option is if there is some fork of the other protocol. But we think that there is not much sense into integrating protocol with less than 15 million TVL.
00:07:51.150 - 00:08:53.090, Speaker C: So exploring another blockchains, finding good protocol and then implementing integration for Tempus is also something that we are looking. There's also nosisafe app for tempus. This is only for front end. It's pretty interesting and quite nice feature. There is like guide how to build this app so one can start with that. On top of that, any unsupported wallet integration currently we support wallet connect and MetaMask so any other wallet support is very welcome. And the other two things are also quite good to start fixed income front end.
00:08:53.090 - 00:09:43.586, Speaker C: I have few ideas for this. Let's say for example you fix your yield by fixing a little bit less and then you are left with some of the capital that you can use upfront. So this is quite interesting. Use case or building extremely simple UI for fixed income that is not a part of a greater Tempus app which includes all the use cases. And then finally graph integration to optimize front end. Currently we we don't use any Caching or anything similar to that. So this is quite interesting.
00:09:43.586 - 00:10:21.920, Speaker C: Use case for us. So you can find resources on these links. I think we can share this presentation publicly and you can find more about Tempus here. And yeah, now I'm open to questions. I see some of them are already coming. Guide for Gnosis say I can share it here as a link, but.
00:10:23.990 - 00:10:24.306, Speaker B: You.
00:10:24.328 - 00:10:57.540, Speaker C: Can just find it in nosis documentation. It's pretty easy which wallets we were thinking of, it really doesn't matter, but any wallet that we don't support or is not supported directly through Wallet Connect. Any other questions for me?
00:11:19.830 - 00:11:20.290, Speaker B: Great.
00:11:20.360 - 00:11:37.370, Speaker A: I think you covered everything. Georgia, there is a few people that are joining. Maybe they might have questions. Someone asked if you could elaborate on the minting.
00:11:42.850 - 00:12:36.800, Speaker C: So yeah, about minting. I will get back to that slide about minting. So, let's say you deposit 100 eat at the start date. In case of lido here, you would get 100 capital tokens and 100 yield tokens. If you want to fix your yield until maturity date, you would swap all 100 yields for some amount of capital. Let's say AMM suggests that current yield rate is 10%. For 100 yield tokens, you would get 110 capitals, which means at maturity you will have 110 eat back.
00:12:36.800 - 00:13:22.830, Speaker C: However, only at deployment time, you would get 400 eat. You would get 100 capitals and 100 yields. At the middle of the pool, we need to count for already accrued yield. So you would get a little bit less of both capital and yield token, but they need to stay in equal amounts until maturity. The total supply of these two tokens is always equal until maturity because you can't withdraw them separately. You need to withdraw them in pairs before maturity. But yeah, TEMCO supports also early withdrawal.
00:13:22.830 - 00:13:48.470, Speaker C: If you, let's say, want to withdraw some of your tokens, there is a way to swap to end with equal shares and then you can redeem your capital. I hope this helps for minting.
00:13:54.730 - 00:13:55.190, Speaker B: Great.
00:13:55.260 - 00:14:06.540, Speaker A: Georgia, I think there's no more questions, but if anybody has any later on, feel free to reach out over discord and we can go from there. Thanks a lot.
00:14:06.990 - 00:14:18.620, Speaker C: We have a lot of our team members that can answer any more deep questions about code or anything, and I will be available as well. So please feel free to reach to us.
00:14:20.750 - 00:14:22.814, Speaker B: Thanks. Bye.
00:14:22.902 - 00:14:24.990, Speaker C: Thanks, everybody. Bye.
