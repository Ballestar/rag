00:00:00.410 - 00:00:02.800, Speaker A: Let's welcome all of you to eat New York.
00:00:04.210 - 00:00:07.630, Speaker B: The vibe is electric, it's alive.
00:00:08.050 - 00:00:12.720, Speaker C: I love the energy, the community, the inclusiveness, and it feels like home.
00:00:14.290 - 00:00:22.990, Speaker A: This is not a conference. These are hackathons. And our goal is to bring on as many developers as we can into the Web Three ecosystem.
00:00:23.890 - 00:00:30.914, Speaker D: Describing hackathon to somebody who's never been to a hackathon. It's just a bunch of people that are interested in creating, building new solutions.
00:00:31.042 - 00:00:42.220, Speaker B: Staying up really, really late, working on extremely weird, extremely cool projects. There's people from all around the world on all types of skills and we're all coming together to build some amazing stuff.
00:00:46.910 - 00:00:47.514, Speaker E: You.
00:00:47.632 - 00:00:57.278, Speaker D: I just love being able to be part of community and building ideas, not only because we're using awesome tech, but because we're solving real issues that are really pressing right now.
00:00:57.444 - 00:01:07.090, Speaker B: We've had a lot of opportunities to meet sponsors from all these different companies sharing their ideas and how they want to continue to build their technology and how we can implement it.
00:01:07.240 - 00:01:11.906, Speaker F: I think if global has been such a constant and important presence in our.
00:01:11.928 - 00:01:17.186, Speaker D: Ecosystem, bringing people together, really being like a champion of innovation, the crowds are.
00:01:17.208 - 00:01:26.918, Speaker B: Always really well curated as far as the different types of skills that people bring. I've already had probably 30 conversations today with hackers that have been really fruitful for our community and just enjoyable for myself.
00:01:27.084 - 00:01:32.746, Speaker D: I think people at East New York have really beautiful visions for ways that we can operate in the world.
00:01:32.928 - 00:01:38.300, Speaker B: We can come in and we can have an impact on certain areas we never really thought we could touch.
00:01:38.670 - 00:01:50.270, Speaker E: To act as an optimist, you make something better because you see a path to a better future. How are you going to actually have an impact if you don't believe in yourself to make that impact?
00:01:50.690 - 00:02:03.838, Speaker F: Web Three is all about leveling the playing field. It's about creating choice, it's about creating opportunity and really that access to resource, regardless of socioeconomic background, regardless of geographic background.
00:02:04.014 - 00:02:09.558, Speaker D: Blockchain web. Three. This entire tech stack is pretty new, so anybody from anywhere can do anything.
00:02:09.724 - 00:02:21.834, Speaker C: For a very long time, minorities have been underrepresented and I think when we put diverse people into the focus, people can identify themselves. If this person is here, I can also be part of it.
00:02:21.952 - 00:02:35.150, Speaker E: There are people from 56 countries, different backgrounds. Some of them are learning how to code, some of them are developers that are seasoned. And we love to make sure that this experience is memorable for everybody that attends any of our events.
00:02:35.810 - 00:02:45.502, Speaker D: The submissions were very innovative. They tackled a lot of problems across many industries. They were the highest quality of ETH Global hackathon projects I've ever seen.
00:02:45.636 - 00:02:52.180, Speaker G: Eat Global is an amazing catalyst for the Ethereum community and I think an example for the entire open source community.
00:02:53.590 - 00:03:02.930, Speaker E: ETH Global has led to so many different projects. It's just been a hugely important way for things to be developed in Ethereum.
00:03:03.090 - 00:03:18.230, Speaker B: You never know what's going to come out of these events. We came out of a hack Effect 2020 hackathon. And we've been going to other East Global events for a while. And now we're here, we've raised money, we've built the company, and actually we're growing pretty great. So just keep hacking away. You're going to meet some amazing friends. You're going to build amazing things.
00:03:18.230 - 00:03:19.880, Speaker B: East Global is the best.
00:03:20.370 - 00:03:33.758, Speaker E: Um, the last time we did this was 2019. Seeing this being the biggest event we've ever done with over 1500 people, it's just great to see that the excitement about Web Three has not slowed down in any form.
00:03:33.924 - 00:03:38.750, Speaker B: If you're looking to build something cool, I don't think there's a better place to do it than ease Global.
