00:00:05.290 - 00:00:17.040, Speaker A: Our first speakers for today, and Larry, Arrow and Getty are going to talk about what does it mean to work for the compound protocol. So without further ado, let's welcome all three of them on stage. And welcome.
00:00:20.130 - 00:00:20.494, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:00:20.532 - 00:00:24.720, Speaker C: Kartek is the floor now.
00:00:25.530 - 00:00:26.710, Speaker D: You're all good?
00:00:26.860 - 00:00:27.442, Speaker B: Sweet.
00:00:27.506 - 00:01:08.654, Speaker C: I guess the first thing I'll say is thanks so much to the global crew. I mean, they made it so easy for us. All we have to do is show up and talk about compound, which we're happy to know. I'm the compound grants lead. My name is Larry Sikarnik, and just to give you guys a little bit of background on compound Grants before we dive right into the summit, but compound Grants is a community funded and independent grants program that was really created by just a lot of compound, a group of compound bands. And so it's not related to the core team. And it was funded actually by the treasury, which was we were one of the first grants programs to do that right after uniswap.
00:01:08.654 - 00:01:51.520, Speaker C: And really our focus is pretty simple. It's to fund really cool development happening on top of compound. We've funded so far over 30 different grants to many, many individuals, and we will continue funding many more for months to come. We're sort of on pause right now in terms of the grants program as we ran it for six months. And now we're in the process of thinking about how to scale it to make it bigger, faster and even stronger than it was before. And so you could find more about Compound Grants@compoundgrants.org, you could go to Compound's Telegram or Discord to learn more about what the community is up.
00:01:51.520 - 00:02:14.870, Speaker C: You know, we'll dive right in and just give you guys a taste for what it means to work for compound. This panel I'm really excited about because we all sort of are, and Getty and I, we all sort of met on the Internet. So this is a very internet DeFi native panel. Getty, R, do you guys want to give a quick intro to yourselves?
00:02:15.690 - 00:02:35.310, Speaker D: Sure, yeah. So I'm Getty Hill, joined the compound community a long time ago, back when I was working with Grapefruit Trading, did trading for the last few years, and now I'm with GFX Labs in our project and we do all sorts of fun things with compound. And I'm a huge compound advocate.
00:02:36.930 - 00:02:58.226, Speaker B: So arrow. Whichever you choose. I've been working with compound for a long time now. I found compound about mid 2019 to late 2019 and just was in awe of it. Everyone who comes into D Five is like, wow, this is so cool. So I just looked at compound, I was like, I want to know how this works. Right.
00:02:58.226 - 00:03:16.250, Speaker B: So I went down on Read all the code. It was like incredible. Was on the discord for months. And initially before governance, not much to do. But then mid 2020 came and that was my time. And since then I've been helping out on proposals through any way I can and making impact in compound.
00:03:18.110 - 00:03:52.550, Speaker C: I think one of the first things maybe we could chat about is what does it mean to work for compound protocol? I think a lot of people, they have regular jobs working for companies, very standard recruiting process, and then they hear about people working for protocols and it's kind of a weird thing to do and it's not clear how to even get started. But can you kind of talk about what you think it means to work for a protocol and how you even got started in the first place? I know you just mentioned a little bit, but practically what do people have to do to start working for compound?
00:03:55.990 - 00:04:13.270, Speaker D: I'll go and say that I sat in the community for a long time, long before there was like a compound token. So there wasn't a big reason back then to get super involved. It was just like chatting with the team, mostly onboarding users, giving feedback on the product and how Compound V One worked.
00:04:13.340 - 00:04:13.574, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:13.612 - 00:05:44.214, Speaker D: It wasn't really until about a year and a little more than a year and a half ago. Now that the comp token came out and that there was this new incentive structure for community members to participate and actually help grow the protocol in a more active way than just relying on the Core Labs team back when they were kind of building their product that everyone's familiar with and using today. So I think in my mind, just having been around the protocol enough, you occasionally will ask yourself, well, why doesn't it have this feature? Why doesn't have that feature? Why doesn't this thing work? Why isn't that thing there? And at least for me, the biggest impetus for my participation was my first one was wanting the rap bitcoin collateral factor to be higher. And so the compound has these cool community autonomous proposals where instead of needing that gigantic, well, today it's 65,000, but back then it was 100,000 comp to actually make a proposal, you could get like 100 comp instead. So I went, bought my bag of 100 comp prior to this, owned no comp, which was like a fair amount of money for me at the time. Bought my 100 bag of comp, went online, learned how to make a cap, posted the cap up there, and then just started pestering and messaging people, being like, hey, this is a good idea. Wrote out the methodology on the forums and then just tried to keep sharing that with people until we got enough people on board to be like, oh, okay, this is a good idea, this can work.
00:05:44.214 - 00:05:48.440, Speaker D: And then made a lot of friends that way and then it kind of just snowballed from there.
00:05:52.890 - 00:06:54.154, Speaker B: So for me, if I'm going to start from the very beginning, I actually started out writing just articles on basically every proposal. I would go very deep into the diff changes and the reasoning behind yes and no and trying to give people an unbiased opinion on how to vote, which would be very useful nowadays. It kind of don't have enough time to do that anymore. But the community was very applauded that definitely and as I was really well positioned question from the okay, I was very well positioned to start building things on my own and contributing things because I saw how everything was moving and then I just got myself in and positioned myself to start contributing independently. I think that contributing to a Dow is very different than a normal job because a lot of self guidance and you really can contribute in any way. It's not like anyone's going to tell you like no, you're not welcome here. Right.
00:06:54.154 - 00:07:05.840, Speaker B: Really, any Dow that exists nowadays just needs more people doing more things and almost anyone can do something which is helpful to the Dow in some way and get paid for their work.
00:07:08.610 - 00:08:23.494, Speaker C: We looks like have a question from the audience. I'll read it out loud. There are a lot of DeFi lending protocols that do similar things in your mind, what makes Compound different? What sets it apart from other DeFi protocols that make you enjoy working with it so much? I can go first and then curious what you guys think. I think generally that's the right positioning which is a lot of the DeFi projects functionally like product wise kind of do similar things. I think culturally though is where they start to differ. My sense is and certainly what made Compound appeal to me personally is the community I would say is way more conservative, I think relative on the risk side in particular relative to some of the other kind of cowboy DeFi projects. And I think if you want to build a project over many dozens of years and make it as successful as it can be over the long term, you have to think about risk deeply and think about the long term, as opposed to some projects that may be optimized for short term gains at the expense of long term thinking.
00:08:23.494 - 00:08:36.540, Speaker C: And second, I would say I think the website just looked really good and the brand goodwill looked really good relative to some of the other projects which are really confusing to use or getty. What do you guys.
00:08:41.730 - 00:09:31.790, Speaker B: Started working with Compound really when it was the only one like mid 2019, late 2019. It was Compound and Ave was there but very small and then other than that, I don't think there was anyone else and I really just enjoyed my time with Compound so much. I love the community, the Compound team and I'm in a position where I'm really well positioned to contribute to the Compound protocol and that's where my time is the most useful. Again, being conservative and thinking in the long term is really nice. You don't have a pop up project which is just here and all of a sudden clone someone else's code or something. So that's nice. Compound Team and Community is just really incredible.
00:09:32.450 - 00:10:23.706, Speaker D: Yeah, that's the big difference for me. I mean, I'm a fan of pretty much all the main protocols, like Compound Ave, MakerDAO, but Compound to me is the one that has the most embracing community. It's definitely like if you're new to the community, even if you're just a regular user, it's a great feeling to join the Discord and ask questions and get an immediate reply from a community member or even Robert chills out on Discord all the time. That's a great feeling to know that the whole team is there and everyone's just trying to help everyone out and build a better product. I used to be very interested in Maker Dow. That was kind of like my first big foyer into, I don't know, DFI. And I think I chose Makerdow at an awkward time because it was when the deeping was happening and Die was at like $0.95
00:10:23.706 - 00:10:33.700, Speaker D: forever and there was the purple paper and a lot of bureaucracy. So it was like back in the day, there was only two options really and Compound was the one that was most embracing and never left.
00:10:35.190 - 00:11:30.920, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think for folks who are not exactly sure what we mean by all this sort of stuff, just go to the forums, right, and look at the sophistication of the discussions and I think you'll find a really fleshed out, thoughtful community. And I look at some of the other forums and everyone's trying to make a quick buck. This is not the case for Compound and I think that is appealing to a lot of people. I think one of the challenges a lot of projects and certainly Compound and Compound Grants have is knowing as a contributor, you're sort of not sure what exactly you should work on and what's the highest priority thing for the protocol that you could be spending your time on in the next few months. How do you guys think about, okay, here's what I'm going to work on over the next few months that is actually useful to the protocol and to the community.
00:11:32.330 - 00:12:17.060, Speaker D: If you're new to the protocol and you have a decent understanding of DeFi, or at least just familiar and used compound, before I say go the selfish route and say, what do I want in the protocol? That's not currently there, it's very likely that other people also want that thing that you would want and then just start there and make it a passion project and learn from there. If you join the protocol and you truly do not know what to do but you want to get involved, then we have a list of requests for proposals on Compound grants of ideas for people. Or of course, if you just join the Discord chat or the forum and say, hi, I have these skills and I want to help. We'll throw a lot of things at you and you can choose from the long list.
00:12:19.910 - 00:13:04.100, Speaker B: Yeah so for me it's generally a lot of just, I'd say temperature checking, like seeing what people have been talking about over the past few weeks in discord what people want, what comes up often. And there's a lot of things which are just things that people want that haven't been a priority. So if I have free time one of those few things would probably get on the agenda. It's very subjective which is again something which is specific to working for a Dow where you are essentially your own boss and you decide what you're going to work on. But based on community feel you can figure out what is going to be important.
00:13:06.550 - 00:13:51.966, Speaker C: We can talk about the sexy stuff now, which is getting paid from compound protocol and I think we have the right folks to talk about that. Know, both Getty and R have been paid from the treasury and Getty in particular. I think you're the only sort know salaried employee, team member, contributor of the protocol which is kind of cool I think for a lot of people it's a little bit awkward. Right. People know exactly how much you're getting paid and it's all transparent and can you kind of walk us through what it means to get paid from compound protocol and how you personally feel about it? Maybe you don't like the transparency of it, maybe you do. But how should people think about working for a protocol and public compensation figures?
00:13:52.158 - 00:14:45.330, Speaker D: Yeah so I'll preface it by that. Compound for me is like a passion and something that I enjoy. The comp I'm earning for the protocol for me is not in my mind a salary. None of that will probably ever get sold. It's just going towards my already position in the protocol and when I got started in the protocol and started working on project there was no grants program so it was even more ambiguous at the time as to how you actually got paid to do work. So I think for me personally and from what I've learned over the last year about figuring out what the protocol does need and what's valuable to the protocol, there's a lot of low hanging fruit that the protocol needs to be working on. And for me in particular at the time it was like this Oracle problem.
00:14:45.330 - 00:16:04.646, Speaker D: So for some of you might be familiar if you've been in crypto for a while, which is probably most of people watching the ETH global stuff, you remember the November 2020 die price happening on compound where the protocol functioned as expected. But because of how it was configured, it wasn't ideal outcome and that was like my call to action to like okay, no one was fixing this for a few months, I'll figure this out, how am I going to pay? Don't really know and it was an extremely awkward process. Come like, all right, we did a lot of work here, a lot of value was provided. How do I get paid? I think even today we're still in the very early days of Dao, so it's like only a year and a half of compound Dao, so everyone's still figuring it out. But at least today, if there are the grants programs, if you are curious about trying to get paid, talking to Larry and myself or other community members there, you can get a very good sense of what compensation might look like, what milestones you can reach to get that compensation, so that you're getting paid before the actual work is performed. In my case, all the work was performed and then I asked to get paid, which makes it even more awkward. And then I guess the other half of that question is how is it to know that everyone knows what I'm getting paid and that it's a bit of a political issue no matter which way you cut it? Like the sense that everyone knows what president gets paid in the United States and so on and so forth.
00:16:04.646 - 00:16:44.950, Speaker D: And all the public servants for my particular grant, I think a lot of it right now is back pay for a lot of the work that was performed. That was kind of the preface that was submitted under was like, I did six months worth of work here. That was a lot of work. Let's run it out for six months. And at that point we'll revisit the topic and say like, hey, am I still contributing commensurate value to what is being rewarded to me in the community's eyes? Because it is all totally built on the compound protocol. If the community were to say like, you know what, fuck this Getty guy, he's not doing a good job, they could just throw up a proposal. Anyone could who had the votes and they could just stop paying me whenever they wanted.
00:16:44.950 - 00:17:03.440, Speaker D: So I'm very well incentivized right now to make sure I keep doing productive work for the protocol in the future if I want to keep earning that amount. So it's a really interesting set of incentives that is totally, totally new. But if anyone ever has questions about this stuff, do reach out to me.
00:17:05.410 - 00:17:29.350, Speaker C: I should say. I suspect a lot of people watching this have worked in big tech or currently working in big tech and are I mean, you've worked in big tech too for a bit, right? But what was the experience like working in big tech and then sort of going to compound and working for the protocol? What are the things you like more about compound, less potentially kind of walk people through that transition.
00:17:31.130 - 00:18:00.194, Speaker B: So big tech obviously depending on your position, but in general you're given a task, right? And it's quite limited scope. You work on the same thing generally for a long period of time. I guess Compound is about the polar opposite. You can get where your skill set is similar, but you're doing completely different things and there's a lot more to what you should be doing.
00:18:00.232 - 00:18:00.386, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:00.408 - 00:18:50.100, Speaker B: You're thinking, what should I be doing rather than actually doing right? A lot of lobbying, a lot of person to person skills, which you need to have to work for a Dow, at least at this current time. Right. You have to be on the forums explaining your reasoning behind what you're doing and then actually executing it, right. People aren't going to be holding your hands and it's something where it requires a lot more independence and drive than working for a big tech company. I think for a lot of people, this is really good, right. Big tech is well, you get paid nicely and your impact is limited and it's quite easy to just get content at Big tech. Working for Dows keeps you on your feet, keeps you up to date on all the newest tech, and you got to keep running.
00:18:53.400 - 00:19:07.610, Speaker C: And then I'm sure what everyone is thinking. What about compensation? If you're working for big tech, presumably you're still there because of the money. Do you think it's possible to make similar amounts of money working for Dows, Compound or even more amounts of money?
00:19:09.500 - 00:19:17.390, Speaker B: I think that all three of us know it is definitely possible to make more money working for Dows than Big Tech. Definitely.
00:19:19.120 - 00:19:20.590, Speaker D: Substantially more.
00:19:26.320 - 00:19:50.900, Speaker C: I know we're running a little bit short on time, so one more question for you guys. But you've been working for Compound for a while now, right? I think you guys are probably some of the leading contributors for The Protocol. Knowing what you know now after working for The Protocol for probably years now, what sort of advice would you give to the newcomer or someone who's considering starting to work for Compound?
00:19:55.180 - 00:20:39.590, Speaker B: I can go first. I'd say for a newcomer, just like don't be afraid to just come onto the discord and say who you are, say you want to help out. Compoundrite is such, on paper, such a large company, but we are very welcoming to new contributors. And if you want to get started, there's always going to be someone who's there to help you at the beginning and tell you what tools we're using and be able to answer your questions. Even for me, there were people who are willing to answer my questions at every point when I was starting out. And there's always something to be done in the Protocol. You just have to not be afraid to get your feet wet, come into the discord and get started.
00:20:41.180 - 00:21:17.970, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's well said. There will be times that you'll get discouraged, because unlike a big tech company here, there is some extra people skills that you need in order to succeed. In that you have to occasionally explain your stuff. But on the bright side, there's substantially more people who want to see developers and other community members and whatnot, join the protocol and be productive contributors. And we're all willing to, I think, put a lot of resources into helping onboard those new community members who are going to help us build the protocol into being the best it could possibly be.
00:21:21.480 - 00:21:22.276, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:21:22.458 - 00:22:09.830, Speaker C: And I would mirror that. I would say if you're working for a large company, you're sort of like very much a cog in the machine, right? And no one or very few people, I think, like that feeling. Working for a protocol initially may seem like you could potentially be stuck doing some minor tasks that no one really notices, but anyone has the option and the ability to work on the thing to getty's point that you want to see in the protocol and take it from, hey, I have this vision in my head. I think it's a little crazy. I'm not going to talk about it publicly to all of a sudden working on it on the forums and making it a thing. I think that's a very powerful thing that many people who work for traditional companies may not be used. And certainly I had to get comfortable with that sort of power.
00:22:09.830 - 00:22:17.430, Speaker C: Getty R thank you so much guys, for the time. I think we're running out. I'll hand it back to Kartek now.
00:22:17.880 - 00:22:52.524, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Larry. Getty and this was amazing discussion. I think just maybe to summarize, I think the best thing about this thing is that I know you kind of implicitly implied, but anybody can be part of this from any place in the world. And that to me is so exciting that you sort of now actually have a level playing field that you wouldn't have to be sort of bound by a region or some certain prerequisites or a college degree or something to contribute. You actually are normalizing. It to be skill based and interest based. So this is incredible and Compound has been doing an amazing job with this.
00:22:52.524 - 00:23:05.520, Speaker A: So thanks for that awesome discussion and I think with that we are ready to move on to our next talk. It's.
