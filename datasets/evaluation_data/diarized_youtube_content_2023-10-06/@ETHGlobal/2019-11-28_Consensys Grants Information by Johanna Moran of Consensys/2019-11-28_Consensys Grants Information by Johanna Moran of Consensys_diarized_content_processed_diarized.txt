00:00:08.900 - 00:01:00.072, Speaker A: Grants. So I wanted to kind of give an info session about where we are in the grant program. We're just trying to put our way to you. So, consensus grant. So we're funding Ethereum projects under the following categories. We launched this in Deb last year and we hoped to distribute five hundred and fifty K of grant money in 2019. We've currently distributed about 120 and we hope to on the next wave, wave two, which is closing on Tuesday, we hope to give about 200K in grant money and they're given out in twenty five K and ten K chunks at the moment.
00:01:00.072 - 00:01:45.220, Speaker A: So at the hackathon we're giving away $1,000 for a prize on Sunday under these categories, anything that falls under those categories. But if you're not successful on that, you can also apply in general to a grant program. Okay, I'm just going to do about ten minutes on this and I'm going to open it up to questions. So what's the objective? We're supporting the ecosystem and we're supporting underfunded projects. So the grant criteria. So what kind of projects? As I say, under the categories, so when they are submitted, projects must benefit the wider ecosystem. They must be open sourced projects, open source projects.
00:01:45.220 - 00:02:41.930, Speaker A: If the project has, the startup has got funding prior to applying to the grant, it'll be rejected. But that's not to say that once they get a grant that they can get follow on funding, there's no problem there to kind of give you an outline of the application process. So it takes about two months from you sending in your application if you win at any of the hackathons that we're involved in. So if you wish to win on Sunday, you get through the first round of the process, which is great. Okay, so you submit your application, you reach out for interviews, you acceptance notification, and then you set milestones with a mentor. We currently have about eight to ten mentors and we are onboarding more mentors as we coach. And then for the duration of the grant, it usually lasts for about three months.
00:02:41.930 - 00:03:20.100, Speaker A: And I said, let's just say you get a 25K chunk. It's handed out in three parts. So you get your first part and then you do your easy your mentor milestone, check in with your mentor and then the next follow on parts of that 25K or ten K is distributed. So this is kind of an idea of the advisory board that we have. These are the people kind of making decisions on some of the projects that are coming in. Jim is with consensus. Tara Tan Ken and then Tanya Evans as well.
00:03:20.100 - 00:04:09.216, Speaker A: So we have other board members. So if you want know any more questions about it, I would suggest just taking a snapshot of this and it'll kind of lead you to any kind of like frequently asked questions that we usually get, hopefully can answer them. So these are a couple of grantees that have already been awarded. They were awarded, I think, back in May. So gas station Ribbon, which is a healthcare project. There's a guy here from Consensus. He's going to be brought on as their mentor, which is great black girl code, African blockchain developers.
00:04:09.216 - 00:05:01.508, Speaker A: And we fall under the category of education and then Light, which is all under security. And I think there's like another six projects that have also been funded. And you can go on to the grant. You can go down to meet the grantees, and I'll give you a download of what's the type of projects that are applying for the grant and that have been successful. So we're partnering with Gitcoin to distribute the grant money as well, just so you know. And then also, as I said, we have the $1,000 that we will be giving away on tomorrow. So is anybody here interested in yeah, no, we're together.
00:05:01.508 - 00:05:32.520, Speaker A: You're together? Okay. And then most importantly, our Wave Two application is closing on Tuesday. So if you want to get in on that, that's great. And you'll kind of, like, get an answer a lot quicker than if you apply on Wednesday, because then it'll be another, like, ten weeks before you get kind of answers on that. Okay. And if anyone wants to take a screenshot of that, and it will bring you to the application. And that is kind of it so far.
00:05:32.520 - 00:05:42.784, Speaker A: People have a lot of questions, usually about the grants program. So does anyone have any questions? I'm wondering the difference between a ten.
00:05:42.822 - 00:05:45.010, Speaker B: K versus a 25K.
00:05:45.640 - 00:06:23.008, Speaker A: Yeah, so if you kind of look here so you can see, like, infrastructure, they've allocated, like, 200K for a lot of the infrastructure projects. It just really depends on what you want to achieve on your milestone and what you need that money for, kind of justifies how much you need. So if they see any for 25 versus ten K. So, for instance, on the grantees so far, they've allocated ten for asking blockchain developers, versus a lot of, like, the heavy lifting on developing goes like 25 days.
00:06:23.174 - 00:06:27.280, Speaker B: Do you know if this awarded amount is considered taxable?
00:06:31.310 - 00:07:05.318, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think so. No, it's not. Then you just the grants don't usually yeah, it might differ on where you are. We've had applications globally. There's no one place that we're getting applications, which is really nice. What we're doing is we're partnering with Hackathons. We really we've got a good few applications there, and they just keep on rolling in.
00:07:05.318 - 00:07:47.216, Speaker A: But it's really global. Sydney, Singapore, they're coming from everywhere, which is something about mental or check in. Yeah. So when you agree on your milestones, you'll probably agree on that with your mentor. So if your project is in healthcare, for instance, we'll pull out a healthcare mentor for you, and then you'll agree your mentor, you'll agree your milestone. That's how you get that's how you check in point. That's what you say.
00:07:47.216 - 00:08:31.360, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'm reaching this milestone kind of think about grants as like, preparators who are allowed so trying to get ecosystem and in order to have to reject grant work. Oh, yeah, absolutely. This is all remote. Yeah. So it's really important that this can you can reach places that don't get grant funding. So that's why it's all done remote. Hi.
00:08:32.210 - 00:08:50.660, Speaker B: So do you want to see sort of a business plan for return on investment or no, I just don't understand the judging. How would you judge that a grant is worthy as opposed to another?
00:08:54.550 - 00:09:21.100, Speaker A: At the start, they broke down the categories, so infrastructure so they said, okay, well, there's a need for infrastructure projects and that's why they allocated like a big chunk 200K for that. And so they see a need to build that out more. And so projects come in and it goes through different grounds. Does that answer your question?
00:09:21.790 - 00:09:31.430, Speaker B: Well, it just seems quite arbitrary. So the judges sort of make up their mind and give it a category and it's a roll of the dice whether you're going to get approved.
00:09:31.610 - 00:10:25.590, Speaker A: Well, you've got like so there's like checkpoints at each round that they need to meet and I can bring up them. So the first round will be let's just say we kind of do a quick call if there's no link, if the team doesn't seem legit, if we feel that the team doesn't have what it takes.
00:10:26.360 - 00:10:28.372, Speaker B: You have to have a team. Is that true?
00:10:28.426 - 00:10:38.980, Speaker A: No, you don't have to have a team. You can have like one or two people, anything from one, like four people, but you just can't have had funding, previous funding.
00:10:39.060 - 00:10:41.850, Speaker B: What's the rejection rate? Could you tell me that?
00:10:45.660 - 00:10:54.350, Speaker A: It's about 10%, similar to investments. Between five and 10% of applications get the grant. All right.
00:10:58.400 - 00:11:02.160, Speaker B: So if you receive prior funding, there's no way that you can get a grant?
00:11:03.700 - 00:11:04.450, Speaker A: Yes.
00:11:05.540 - 00:11:09.856, Speaker B: What is the definition? Like, if you have a fellowship that pays you for three months?
00:11:09.878 - 00:11:21.110, Speaker A: No, that's fine. It's more like thinking something, but anything, any other grant, that's fine as well.
00:11:23.000 - 00:11:33.042, Speaker B: If you apply for a grant, if you aren't accepted, do you have an opportunity to fix maybe you weren't what you were trying to do today originally?
00:11:33.186 - 00:12:20.534, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. On this way. This is way too we went back to previous applications on Wave One and just said, hey, because they got feedback with their applications and then they applied. And I think, like, one or two of them guys came up through a couple of rounds about applied for grant. We launched this late last year and so we are honing it as well as we go. It's not perfect, but we're just kind of learning at each wave what's the best, and it comes on to the committee members as well, getting stronger and being okay. What's the need for this project? What's the real need for this project and we're hopefully getting better.
00:12:20.534 - 00:12:47.780, Speaker A: So I think I'm actually working on telling more hero stories about the project that came out. So that kind of gives you an idea of like, okay, well, these are the types of things that are actually getting through the grants program and these are like nice stories about it.
00:12:48.550 - 00:12:49.730, Speaker B: So kickback.
00:12:57.980 - 00:12:59.530, Speaker A: I didn't know that. Sorry.
00:13:01.260 - 00:13:03.464, Speaker B: We had to use it or else we couldn't help.
00:13:03.662 - 00:13:31.570, Speaker A: Oh, right, okay. Because I was like sponsor, I didn't have to do that. Okay. So I came on the grant program about ten weeks ago, so I'm learning about what authorizers coming in and then getting into how to meet the ecosystem as well. I got to know who you guys are and guys and girls. Yeah.
00:13:33.300 - 00:13:40.760, Speaker B: Other question about with the grant money, what does that usually get used for? Would that be for hardware?
00:13:42.300 - 00:13:58.084, Speaker A: You break down what you are going to use that money for and so you okay, well, dev allocate like ten K for that. We need to buy X, Y and Z are the funds.
00:13:58.132 - 00:14:04.510, Speaker B: So if you receive a ten K award, are those funds transferred sum or is it something where the mentor will.
00:14:06.900 - 00:14:34.540, Speaker A: Yes. So it'll be over three months. Okay. And after the first month you have your check in with your mentor. Your mentor goes, yeah, they're reaching a milestone. Release the thumb or release or cargo. Yeah, well, maybe how it works is that if you're not reaching your milestones, then committee members are kind of brought in to kind of help you through, not slap you on the wrist.
00:14:34.540 - 00:14:39.850, Speaker A: See? Okay, well, why aren't you meeting your milestones and try and bring in other mentors among people to help you?
00:14:43.790 - 00:14:50.400, Speaker B: Five minutes. Yeah, but also a question, do you take any IPS or.
00:14:52.290 - 00:15:18.070, Speaker A: No. So we're figuring out that they're a venture leg. And what was kind of like what I hope will happen is that there are really interesting projects that are coming out of the Grant program that will be interesting to labs coming down the line and just bringing those projects just for question a little bit more and hopefully then they can get funded.
00:15:20.410 - 00:15:24.802, Speaker B: You see this as a way to funnel to the CPC program.
00:15:24.876 - 00:15:44.720, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes sense. Some things will make sense to go to that and some things won't. So backward growth code merchant program wouldn't probably make sense for that, but there's definitely some projects coming out that would.
00:15:45.170 - 00:15:47.680, Speaker B: It has to be focused on ethereum only.
00:15:48.230 - 00:15:51.780, Speaker A: Yes. That's a very important question.
00:15:55.190 - 00:15:57.902, Speaker B: Is it funding in dollar or in ethereum?
00:15:58.046 - 00:15:58.980, Speaker A: In dollars.
00:16:01.430 - 00:16:03.380, Speaker B: What state do you see? A lot of dollars.
00:16:07.450 - 00:16:25.580, Speaker A: So that's why we're kind of partnering with a lot of hackathons. So it could be MVP, it could be a little bit further down the line, or it could be just an idea, but you kind of have to show okay, well, if I'm going to build this, this is what I want to achieve at the milestone at the check.
00:16:32.850 - 00:16:42.610, Speaker B: Okay, let's say you get some money. Do I have to pay it back? Can I get sued or cut your losses or what the hell happened?
00:16:42.680 - 00:16:43.154, Speaker A: No.
00:16:43.272 - 00:16:44.530, Speaker B: I go to jail?
00:16:45.030 - 00:16:50.260, Speaker A: No, not so far do I know.
00:16:51.270 - 00:16:53.000, Speaker B: So we have to keep the money.
00:16:53.930 - 00:17:10.940, Speaker A: Like, if you're not reaching your milestones, as I said, the committee members the board members will be brought in to try and get you over the line. And you might not hit, like, after three months, it might, like, be five months, you know what I mean? The next chunk of cash.
00:17:11.470 - 00:17:17.340, Speaker B: Okay. Sorry to ask my question in a weird way. Thank you.
00:17:20.670 - 00:18:11.960, Speaker A: So where does weird I'm at the desk behind here we go out. Just so you know who's here from so we've got Academy, which is the education guide solidity yesterday. If anyone has any questions, they're around. Just ping me on discord, and I'll make sure that they get they know you're here. There is guys Academy, discord, and also I believe he's probably heading to for a series of.
