00:00:08.250 - 00:00:41.334, Speaker A: Hi everyone. I'm Regina. This is Allison. We're from uma, it's universal market access. Uma, and today I'm going to be talking about synthetic tokens, why they're important and how you can build with them during Boston. So I'm going to go through what synthetic tokens are and why they're important. Going to demo how you can actually use our synthetic token builder on testnet, on riffy to build your own synthetic token and then eventually building projects you have.
00:00:41.334 - 00:01:44.838, Speaker A: And then lastly, talk a little bit about what you can do with synthetic tokens. Give you a couple of starter ideas and also give you so what are tokens? There are general class of types of tokens, right? So they're anything that's pegged to a particular price. An example of this is makerdog die. I think that's a great example actually, where someone has deposited ETH to create synthetic USD that's backed by a portion of that ETH, right? So what you've created is you've created synthetic USD tokens backed by ETH, in fact, overclockalized by ETH. But all you said is that each of those dies is supposed to be pegged to a price index. And that's the price index of USD. And the really important reason that we care about synthetic tokens is that you never have to actually own USD.
00:01:44.838 - 00:03:02.770, Speaker A: You never actually have to own bitcoin, you never actually have to own a particular stock index in order to actually get price exposure to those indices. Right? So this is why we think they're super interesting, because you can imagine that normally when we want to trade different types of assets, we have to hold them in order to actually buy and sell them with each other in the real world, right? But with synthetics, the whole idea is that we can actually still trade cash and move money around based on the price of those assets or other things we care about for those assets without actually having to have any of us ever own or touch them. So that's why I say that synthetic tokens are this general plaque of things, because they're tokens where these value associated with them comes from this price feed. And that price feed can be any number. And it basically gives us a lot more flexibility to have different kinds of financial risk. So, uma, in fact, back in March or so, created a synthetic us stock token. This is a helium that was backed by dye and in fact overflowed by dye.
00:03:02.770 - 00:03:34.542, Speaker A: But the amount of dye that was backed in that token fluctuated with where this us stock index was. This us stock index was at, say, 2500. There would be 2500 die backing that token. If it went up to 3000, there would be 3000 die backing that token and so on. And so that's really cool. We've created a token that when we trade it with other people, has backing value equal to this random price fee that you set. None of us actually had to actually own the actual US.
00:03:34.542 - 00:04:20.880, Speaker A: Stock index in order to have that kind of technology. So what are uma, synthetics tokens? We've created a tool that lets you create tokens like this. So what you're going to do is deposit a bunch of Dai. We're going to deposit dye into this, what we're calling a token facility. And so a portion of that is going to be used as backing collateral to fund these amount of tokens. In addition, you're going to be required to have at least the required amount of collateral. So you have to have total collateral in excess of that.
00:04:20.880 - 00:05:02.730, Speaker A: You have to exceed the total required collateral for your terms. This looks a lot like a maker CDP. And the subset of the maker CDP we have is you have ETH. A portion of that ETH represents backing collateral for your dye, but you always have to maintain at least enough east to match to make sure that you're well collateralized. You have to have at least 150% of the value of the die. 80 that would be this amount. And then you have a little bit of extra cushion on top so that you're over collateralized beyond your liquidation.
00:05:02.730 - 00:05:57.200, Speaker A: It's the same idea here. But what we've done with Uma is instead of depositing a volatile asset like ETH and then borrowing a stable asset like Dai, you're going to deposit a stable asset like Dai and borrow a volatile asset so that volatile Token could track the price of Bitcoin in dime or the price of Tesla in dollars, but we just use die instead. Or it could even track the number of Twitter followers. So you could have a synthetic token where the number of die that back, that token is equal to the number of Twitter followers that Andy Yang has. So you can do all these things, is what I meant when I said that. It makes things very flexible. It just allows you to create tokens whose value is whatever you want.
00:05:57.200 - 00:06:53.070, Speaker A: Okay, so again, I said this is a lot like maker CDTs, naturally. The question is what happens when there's not enough collateral, when the total collateral is less than the required enough collateral? And just like other protocols, there is a liquidation process associated with these custom synthetic codes. So what I've just drawn here is that let's say the total collateral, right, everything in here is actually less than the required collateral. So you've got this shortfall in rest. And what's going to happen is a portion of the over collateralization is going to be assessed with a penalty. And that's going to go from whoever owns that token facility to the people who own the synthetic token. So a portion of that is paid from the token facility owner to the owners of the synthetic token.
00:06:53.070 - 00:07:37.454, Speaker A: So it's slightly different from maker CDPs, where a portion of that fees is paid. Whoever buys the contract buys CDP. But it is somewhat similar in the sense that there's a penalty that's assessed and then the whole thing kind of liquidates and wipes down. So that's the overall idea. If you guys have more questions about it source, I can go into more detail in the Q A. But the last point I want to mention about these synthetic tokens is that unlike maker, unlike other sort of like synthetic tokenization platforms, these tokens will have an expiration timestamp. This is important for a couple of financial engineering reasons that I can also go into more detail about.
00:07:37.454 - 00:08:16.780, Speaker A: But I just want to give you guys a heads up that after expiration, after that expiration timestamp, the amount of backing collateral is fixed and anyone holding those tokens can redeem them for the backing collateral. And so in a way, it's as if your economic risk at that point after expiration stops. So if you held one of these synthetic tokens, that was the number of Twitter followers that Mr. Yang has after expiration. The number of die that you're going to get for redeeming that token is just fixed. It doesn't move anymore. And it's going to update the latest price that it has, the latest number of Twitter followers that it has right before.
00:08:16.780 - 00:09:06.746, Speaker A: And then in this diagram, any excess collateral beyond the backing collateral will be paid back to the token facility owner before expiration. The only difference is that only the token facility owner can redeem his tokens against the facility. So it has to be, for example, to put this back into Baker CDP terms, only the CDP owners could close that continuity. Okay, so how do we create synthetic tokens? I'm going to do a quick demo now of how you can use Cuma synthetic token builder. I'll also put a link to this in the discord. But I will say one thing about this. You have to be on Riffy, that's kind of the main thing.
00:09:06.746 - 00:09:39.010, Speaker A: And you also have to have testnet ETH and testnet die on Rizpi in order to use the synthetic token builder. So in my case, I already have one created, but I want to show you how to use this app and we'll create synthetic tokens to get started. Open the token. Yeah, that's true. So I already have testnet fees and testnet die. I'll show you. If you put this, you'll get sent to the receipt profit.
00:09:39.010 - 00:10:19.120, Speaker A: What you have to do is plug your address into then send a link to that and it will start giving you fees and then to get more testnet die. Once you have that ETH, you have testnet ETH to pay the gas to get your testnet die. So then you're going to just go through this, confirm that and then have a transaction eventually go through that. We can do more. If you have trouble there getting testnet either or you just don't have a Twitter or Facebook account or don't want to expose it, just ping us in the discord channel.
00:10:21.090 - 00:10:21.840, Speaker B: Cool.
00:10:22.370 - 00:10:42.820, Speaker A: Let's go ahead and get started. Let's open a token facility. So this at this stage, we're actually just creating the facility that we're then going to use to borrow tokens. So right now, we're just setting up the facility. So what asset should we track or what price deduction should we track? Someone picked something out of this list.
00:10:43.350 - 00:10:44.690, Speaker B: Chinese, you on.
00:10:44.840 - 00:10:45.394, Speaker A: Sorry?
00:10:45.512 - 00:10:46.702, Speaker B: Chinese, you on.
00:10:46.856 - 00:11:03.180, Speaker A: Okay, wonderful. So we're basically saying we're going to now create a facility that's going to give us the ability to create synthetic tokens that track Dny. Great. Let's take an expiry date.
00:11:05.230 - 00:11:06.182, Speaker C: October.
00:11:06.326 - 00:11:44.866, Speaker A: Perfect. Okay, we basically at, uma, curated this list of expirations so that it's easier to sort of aggregate liquidity. Everyone kind of knows that these are the regular dates that are going to expire October. And so here we've got a summary, right? We're going to launch this token facility that's going to track Cmysd. We're going to have to over collateralize it by 2%, which is all because CMY USD is not very volatile. It's going to expire or settle on October 31. And then this is just the contract name that it's spit out by automatically generating a name and the token symbol.
00:11:44.866 - 00:12:49.280, Speaker A: And I'm okay with these. Let's go ahead and create the facility. Okay, great. Now our facility is created, right? So that box that I had in that diagram, that's now been created. Now we have to authorize it to actually fund it and to begin issuing synthetic tokens for. So let's go ahead and authorize that. So now we're ready to actually begin funding that facility.
00:12:49.280 - 00:13:11.196, Speaker A: In this case, we can see the current price of CMI USD. This is the price of one Chinese yan in USD. So let's say that I wanted to create ten tokens. That means that I would need 1.4 die, right, manually. So let's put in five dies. Just be like Overclockwise.
00:13:11.196 - 00:13:47.216, Speaker A: And you'll see it calculates for you that the max number of tokens you could safely create is 34. So I know that I'm well over collateralized borrow these tokens. So now I'm at the stage where I've begun funding it. So I just want to show you guys. So now I've actually put in all of that collateral, and it's telling me that, of course, I have the backing collateral needed for ten tokens. I've also over collateralized to meet that 102% ratio. And I've also got some cushion on top.
00:13:47.318 - 00:13:52.160, Speaker B: So you had more in there, and you pulled ten out to make it turning dye.
00:13:52.660 - 00:14:16.600, Speaker A: So I deposited how much dye did I put in? Five. So I put in five dyes. And now I know that I only needed, like, 1.4 die to have enough backing collateral. Those 1.4 dies are going to create ten synthetic CNY tokens. Each of those tokens is worth zero point 14.
00:14:16.600 - 00:14:53.670, Speaker A: So now let's see what I did. So I created this token facility, and what it's telling me is I have this token facility that I can short those tokens, but I also borrow those tokens myself, so I long those tokens. Does that make sense? Exactly. So I'm short the tokens, but to myself. Great. So it tells me again, I have ten tokens, so the total exposure is ten, and then I own all ten. So they all net out to zero.
00:14:53.670 - 00:15:34.640, Speaker A: If I went ahead and gave these tokens to someone in the room, this number would go down, but this number would not, right? Because the total number of tokens that this facility thinks are outstanding is ten. Even if I give away like five of them to Alan. Okay, again, I can go in. I can manage this position, right? So just like a CDP, I can borrow more tokens, which is like borrowing more die. I can repay the debt by sending back some of my tokens. Again, because I'm the token facility owner, I can redeem my tokens against my own facility. And then here, I can either withdraw or deposit some additional dai to make sure that I'm always over collateralized.
00:15:34.640 - 00:16:06.812, Speaker A: Makes sense. Cool. So that's how the synthetic token builder works. If you guys have questions on how to use it, definitely ask us in our discord or come up to us. I want to spend the last couple of minutes just talking about what you can do with these tokens and why they're important. So I said that you have a lot of flexibility with synthetic tokens, right? That was like the main value add that I was describing. But the reason I think that's really cool is these are three examples of applications that you might be interested in.
00:16:06.812 - 00:16:28.352, Speaker A: So with that synthetic token builder, we could build this synthetic Chinese range, right? And what you do with that, you could create a Chinese ranch denominated wallet for Chinese users. So normally we're really focused on, I say, like, giving people wallets that had ETH or dai or other stable coins in US.
00:16:28.406 - 00:16:28.972, Speaker B: Dollars.
00:16:29.126 - 00:17:13.950, Speaker A: But again, now you can create stablecoins denominated in other currencies. You can now create globalized products for those audiences. You could also create synthetic bitcoins, and if you sell them to other people, remember that here I'm short CNY in effect, right? Because I got this token facility. So if I sold all of my long tokens, I would no longer be short the tokens to myself, I'd be short the tokens to someone else, and I have effectively leveraged short exposure. PNY. Makes sense. Okay, sorry.
00:17:13.950 - 00:18:49.180, Speaker A: Okay, so if you were to create the synthetic bitcoin, you could also get leveraged short exposure to bitcoin without actually needing to own bitcoin, right? This is important because instead of now having to go onto a protocol like, say, to buy DX, where you have to physically borrow bitcoin to short it, you're now able to get synthetically short bitcoin. And all you have to do is find a counterparty who just wants to buy one synthetic bitcoin on ethereum. That's really different before, to get leveraged short bitcoin, you have to actually go out and borrow bitcoin and then short it either on your own going out and finding your counterparty who will lend you bitcoin or via kind of like hidden protocol, like duads, where they kind of do all that for you in the background here. You can actually do it in a very pure form. And the last example I'll give is something that's weird and creative and maybe it's interesting to communicate, but there were these reddit donuts a while back, and these donuts were trading on, I guess, a couple of different ways, but they were being sent to people to track how many upvotes certain Reddit posts had or I think certain users had. But they weren't backed by anything, right? They were akin to reddit, gold or silver in that sense. But this time you can now create reddit donuts that have actual backing value.
00:18:49.180 - 00:19:27.832, Speaker A: So you could say like, let's create some token facilities, and those token facilities will have a price feed that tracks the number or the amount of karma that a particular user has, and then I can sell you those tokens if you think that that user has really good memes and I can get leverage short that user. And there are all these kinds of weird things that you can do when you're changing that price feed and making things sort of synthetic. So what are we looking for? We have this bounty out there. We're giving away $3,000 to a project that has the most creative use of tokens that are made with our synthetic token builder.
00:19:27.896 - 00:19:29.400, Speaker B: 3000 USD.
00:19:29.560 - 00:20:09.226, Speaker A: Yes, we can pay an ethereum. USD works. And so I just want to give you guys a couple of more suggestions as to what we're looking for. Because when we say creativity, I think there are two types of creativity. We mean there's creativity at this level, right, which is different applications of the token. So that could mean, right, like now that I've told you that here we actually just created synthetic, now that we have that, you can come up with a creative way to use that. I already have the tokens, so I could just send them to you and then you can plug them into your own project.
00:20:09.226 - 00:20:46.306, Speaker A: So if you can come up with creative ways to use that, that's one thing we're looking for. On the other hand, if you have your own special idea for what kind of price feed you want to use, that's another type of right? So I suggested three ideas here, bitcoin and Chinese band. Those price feeds we actually do have in the DAP. So if you want to use those now, you can. But if you have ideas for other price fees, we can also talk later about how to actually give you tokens that track those. So I gave you reddit donut numbers as an example I gave you Twitter followers as an example. Maybe fantasy football.
00:20:46.306 - 00:21:04.842, Speaker A: Now that football season, right? Fantasy football season in, right. There are all these different other ways that you can be creative. So I'd say that's kind of how we're thinking about creativity. Cool. Any questions? Yes.
00:21:04.976 - 00:21:18.222, Speaker B: So I had a question about the price fees on the app. The facility uni had a list of different things, like how can I buy.
00:21:18.276 - 00:21:18.880, Speaker C: One.
00:21:25.090 - 00:21:26.480, Speaker B: Is it possible?
00:21:27.010 - 00:21:59.294, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'd say for the purposes of the taxonomy, just given we do have something here that a custom index, right? And that'll give you kind of like a dummy token that effectively tells us that, okay, it's a custom thing, it's not one of our price feeds. And you can use that token for now, but if it's something that later you do want to build on after the hackathon, we can definitely have a longer conversation about whether it's a price that you'd be willing to support or if we know of any other data sources for that.
00:21:59.492 - 00:22:07.802, Speaker B: And then also, do you have any APIs that interact with APIs? So I can know this programmatically?
00:22:07.946 - 00:22:38.730, Speaker A: Yeah. So I don't think we have an API product per se, but I'm more than happy to walk you through certain portions of our GitHub and show you the particular smart contracts that are particularly relevant for this staff. So I'm happy to show you. I'll just include a link, I guess, in the discord later. But even though we don't have an APS product per se, still happy to like, our GitHub is open for everyone to read and happy to share the context.
00:22:42.270 - 00:22:54.880, Speaker B: If the data feed for the index is data that's already on chain, is that easier to implement? Would that be something that still you guys would have to set up?
00:22:59.010 - 00:23:03.300, Speaker A: Good question. I'm going to set that up to heart.
00:23:04.310 - 00:23:05.506, Speaker B: We talked about this.
00:23:05.608 - 00:23:06.258, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:06.424 - 00:23:07.522, Speaker B: What was the question?
00:23:07.656 - 00:23:21.320, Speaker C: So basically, if you had a data source that was on chain, could you have the contract read it? And the answer is like, absolutely you could, but it's going to require some code changes.
00:23:22.010 - 00:23:27.670, Speaker B: Would it require code changes specifically to your core facility contract?
00:23:28.170 - 00:23:41.294, Speaker C: I'd have to take a closer look. So our core engineers that know this stuff really deeply aren't here, but I'd have to take a closer look. And yeah, there's a couple definitely workarounds that we could work through what is.
00:23:41.332 - 00:23:45.498, Speaker B: Like CoinCap API, say once more? Like a coincast API.
00:23:45.594 - 00:24:14.266, Speaker C: Yeah, we actually can okay. Without over promising like what Regina said, we have an easy ability to have fake tokens. Is there an ability to add new price like yes, but some of it requires deploying a bunch of contracts and a whole system and it becomes more complicated. So having to talk about that and all that and then again doing an on chain thing API definitely technically possible, but I need to look a little.
00:24:14.288 - 00:24:21.930, Speaker B: Bit would you say that would potentially be easier than an actual API price feed because it's on chain. Like you wouldn't need to use Oracles.
00:24:23.390 - 00:24:29.726, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd have to look before. I don't want to miss.
00:24:29.828 - 00:24:31.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I got you.
00:24:32.850 - 00:24:46.720, Speaker C: But Coin market cap type data is an API that is accessible. It's not built in by default. So we can talk a bit more about what the challenges are there and what we're used to.
00:25:07.080 - 00:26:08.120, Speaker A: Again, I think like having very attractive feature. For example, in the Bitcoin example, on the other hand, if you're someone who is looking at and you are able to have a real world head or otherwise offset your risk, your leverage short risk, what you've effectively created is a position where you're flat risk. Right? So let's say initially I would have been leveraged short, but I can offset this by actually forcing another long position to get effectively long the risk of their token in some other way. Then I'm flat risk. But there are ways to make money still in this environment. So it's a little bit complicated. But the rough idea is that if I'm someone who has this token facility, I can create these tokens and then sell them to the market at a premium.
00:26:08.120 - 00:27:10.620, Speaker A: And then if I sell them to the market at a premium, I get to over the lifetime of the token until expiration, I get to collect the spread between the price which I sold them and their true backing price over that period of time. And in a way, these tokens then become kind of like forward on the underlying assets, right? And they reflect this kind of funding rate for the asset. They reflect in some way the cost of someone like me as the token facility owner to have all this stuff on my balance sheet. It reflects the cost of me having enough money so that I could afford to maintain this hedge as well as put in all the capital to sell these tokens. Right? And so it's a measure of my balance sheet. Does that make sense? Okay, cool. So that's why you might see that these tokens might sell at a premium to their backing price or price index.
00:27:10.620 - 00:27:27.600, Speaker A: Right? And that's another way that a token facility owner could make money a little bit more complicated, a little bit more nuanced and more moving parts. But I think it's definitely an interesting proposition or value prop to more sophisticated work purchases.
00:27:31.320 - 00:27:36.170, Speaker B: Because that just made me just wonder about one thing. So in the Bitcoin example.
00:27:38.220 - 00:27:38.648, Speaker A: For me.
00:27:38.654 - 00:27:42.330, Speaker B: To sell it, do you guys provide a marketplace or do I have to go out?
00:27:43.820 - 00:28:22.996, Speaker A: So, uma, have not set up any decomposite exchange or exchange service or any we don't have anything like that right now. I think the best way for someone to actually go about doing this is probably to integrate with Uniswap or some other kind of automated market maker. I will say right now everything's on testnet, so I wouldn't worry too much about the actual sourcing a ton of liquidity for the tokens right now, but it's something we can discuss in more detail if we have some other ideas around how you might do it.
00:28:23.178 - 00:28:25.072, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll buy your test bent token.
00:28:25.216 - 00:28:43.180, Speaker A: Exactly. That's the main reason why we're focused on creative uses of the tokens themselves rather than the whole shebang, depending on the people that could be interested in mainnet products. But while the contest end.
00:28:50.390 - 00:28:53.890, Speaker B: Could you answer the questions on the last slide?
00:28:54.710 - 00:29:36.370, Speaker A: Well, these are the guys didn't have questions. You helped read questions, but we don't need to go through this. A lot of the answers actually are so these first two are more detailed, like financial engineering answers. I won't go into too much detail right now. This kind of was your question, right? Like, how do we ensure that there's liquidity? We don't know that there will be, but don't worry about it. You can still testnet. And then the last answer is, uma is also not just creating these kinds of smart contract templates for synthetic assets, but also providing an oracle service or a data verification mechanism DVM.
00:29:36.370 - 00:29:49.620, Speaker A: And there is a value recruit process based on increasing us with margins and relying on the DBM. We've got a white paper out about that which you can read, or you can come by and talk to us.
00:29:52.810 - 00:29:55.400, Speaker C: Why don't you give a short answer, though, on the top two questions?
00:29:55.770 - 00:30:33.200, Speaker A: All right, short question. Why do the tokens expire? They expire so that eventually the price of the token will you know for sure that the price of the token will match the price of the pricing. That's the shortest answer. And the second is because the tokens expire. And if you want more details, you have to talk to or ask questions.
00:30:33.830 - 00:31:12.080, Speaker C: Well, the question is is a regulatory thing. Well, I'll answer that. So there is a regulatory like the CFTC is derivative exception where your derivatives are less than 20 days. But that's actually not the point here. Just to go in 2 seconds in more detail is if the tokens don't expire, if they're perpetual, you can have these weird circumstances where, say, demand for the synthetic token way outstrips supply. So the price of the synthetic token could trade at a massive premium relative to the actual underlier. And there's no mechanism if there's no mechanism to bring it back, it could just stay there.
00:31:12.080 - 00:31:22.260, Speaker C: Expiry provides a mechanism to bring it back because then arbitragers know that at some point in the future, these two things will converge and they will theme for each other.
00:31:23.750 - 00:32:13.750, Speaker A: And if you want real world examples of what's happening in the crypto universe, you can look at bitfire and BitMEX. Both are derivative exchanges. They treat bitcoin as perpetual BitMEX to make sure that their perpetual bitcoin contract matches the actual type of bitcoin forces this transfer payment between long and shorts based on the supply and demand imbalance bitflyer tried to create a bitcoin perpetual, didn't implement that transfer payment thing and totally fucked everyone over. Basically, on bitflyer, their customer base was all retail. Their price of their bitcoin perpetual just kept going like this. And at one point, it was like a 40% premium versus the real price of bitcoin and they just could never get it back down. So it was a total failure, I think.
00:32:15.320 - 00:32:29.930, Speaker C: So traditional futures contracts have expiries, and if the futures contract, it can't trade that far away from the underlier because an Arbitrator will do this trade and arbitrage, sorry, negative, it wouldn't be worth it.
00:32:31.660 - 00:32:32.650, Speaker B: Going below.
00:32:33.900 - 00:33:05.830, Speaker C: Well. So let's say you have an expiry at the end of the year for something, right? And the real life version is trading at $100, and the synthetic version could be trading at 110. In that case, then you sell the synthetic version, buy the real version, and you know that by the end of the year, you'll make $10. Whereas if the synthetic version is trading at a discount at $90, then you do the opposite. You buy the synthetic, sell the real one, you know you'll make $10 by the end of the year. But if you don't have that expiry, you don't know that it's going to happen. Right?
00:33:06.520 - 00:33:19.370, Speaker B: And when you say BitMax has the transfers between the long weeks and the shorts, is that transferred in terms of liquidation or is it transferred in terms of a settlement? Like every eight or so.
00:33:21.340 - 00:33:33.736, Speaker C: You can actually literally think of BitMEX almost as like an eight hour expiring thing, which is kind of an interesting way to think about it. So every 8 hours, there's sort of this expiry that keeps it's an expiry.
00:33:33.768 - 00:33:35.470, Speaker A: And automatic roll forward.
00:33:37.780 - 00:33:40.050, Speaker C: Yeah, they're pretty smart, pretty cool.
00:33:43.140 - 00:33:59.210, Speaker A: And here, you can write a wrapper over this thing. His questions combined us. Otherwise, good luck. Thanks for coming.
