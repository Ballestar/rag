00:00:00.410 - 00:00:23.754, Speaker A: So let me get some notification from Machu Picchu and then you can get started sharing your video and presenting. Yes, we are ready. Okay, great. Go ahead. Executive director of the Ethereum Foundation.
00:00:23.882 - 00:01:16.866, Speaker B: In order for business to succeed, you need to think about economic, social and environmental. My name is AMA. I'm a member of the Machapuchu team on this hackathon. Machapuchu actually is part of a much larger project that provides data as a public service to all the organizations that provide the benefits listed on the right. Today I want to focus on Ibisa using Earth observation and actuarial techniques. However, one of the things that it lacks which this hackathon will bring is the blockchain element to provide decentralized technology that is cost efficient and scalable. Ibisa is currently today has 310 paying farmers in Tamil Nadu and hopes to scale their solution to 10,000 in 2021.
00:01:16.866 - 00:01:44.378, Speaker B: In our demo, you will see we have three key roles. We have the member, who is the farmer that contributes to the Pot and shares in the risk. Then we have the watcher who is an independent assessor based anywhere in the world. They use Earth Observation data to assess the crop damage. They place their stake and submit their assessment into our DAP. Then you have the enabler who is like the village chief. They, on their mobile phones also assess the crop and drought damage.
00:01:44.378 - 00:02:28.852, Speaker B: They then calculate the compensation and pay the member for their loss. Now the demo we are using opengsn so that the enablers and the villagers do not have to provide gas. We also use MetaMask and porters for the wallets and transactions. This member is contributing 20 rup tokens to the common risk sharing pot members do not have blockchain access. They have an old feature phone that receives an OTP generated via chain link external adapter. The member will send the OTP to their enabler, who will act on their behalf. In our demo, this watcher has 100 tokens.
00:02:28.852 - 00:03:16.994, Speaker B: They need to stake some before they can do a crop loss assessment. Watchers will receive their stakes back plus or minus some tokens, depending on the quality of their assessment. Relative to all other watchers, this watcher has staked 25 tokens. The assessment uses a mobile app developed by Ibisa Labs outside this hackathon using Google Earth engine. It uses data from different satellites and shows visually the difference of the current vegetation with the average for that specific month over the last 20 years. This is the assessment made by this watcher for the crops of this village. Ibisa Networks has today more than 100 watches scattered around the world.
00:03:16.994 - 00:04:05.010, Speaker B: Due to time constraints, the fusion of assessments from all the watches is not done by the contract here. Rather, we have manually invoked the function monthly loss calculation from the Truffle console. Once the eventual loss for each village is calculated, the enabler calculates the entitlement of each member based on their merit in contributing to the common pot. The member will be informed of their entitlement for lost compensation along with an OTP. If they decide to retrieve their compensation in cash, they'll send the OTP back to the enabler. If you wish to learn more about Machipuchu, please feel free to contact us. Thank you for listening.
00:04:16.450 - 00:04:21.220, Speaker A: Great. Thank you for presenting judges. I will take it away.
00:04:24.390 - 00:04:48.650, Speaker C: Can start. That was super awesome. It's really interesting to see a use case using DeFi and staking that's completely different from the kind of use cases I've thought about. I'm curious to know, is it a common problem to maybe provide misinformation about vegetation or crops? That staking on chain is really solving a major problem in information accuracy?
00:04:49.550 - 00:05:17.780, Speaker A: Yes. The satellites images are like human faces, so using automatic or artificial intelligence is possible. They do marvels with that. But they have to do a lot of ground truth in order to train the system. So it's not scalable, economically speaking. And here we use watchers, so we use the collaborative work.
00:05:19.670 - 00:05:21.060, Speaker C: Got it. Thank you.
00:05:22.810 - 00:06:13.830, Speaker A: Hi. Yeah, that was a cool project. Could you share a little bit about how the watchers get penalized? How they get penalized if they provide incorrect information? Yes. We have done some RStudio simulation statistics and the watchers, when the answers, like the majority of the watchers, they are considered as having answered correctly. If the answer diverge too much from the majority, they are considered as having done something abnormal. And if they answer regularly, every time the same thing, we detect that they answer every time the same thing. So they're cheating, so they're also penalized.
00:06:13.830 - 00:06:36.538, Speaker A: We can do that. It's based on the Kinesian beauty contest. That trend may recognize that it's a theory. Gotcha. Thank you. Yeah, great presentation. I like the fact that you guys did think about the UI part as well.
00:06:36.538 - 00:06:57.186, Speaker A: So I was just interested. I think in the video it mentioned 310. Watch it. You got frozen. Given that it was mentioned, can you repeat your question? You got frozen, ahmed. Hello. Sorry, I think I froze a bit.
00:06:57.186 - 00:07:13.078, Speaker A: Yeah, go on. Exactly. Can you repeat the question, please? Yeah, I was just basically saying in the video it mentioned 310 paying farmers. Yes, that's true. Right. I was just interested to hear a bit more about that. Yes, so actually there are more than that.
00:07:13.078 - 00:07:57.000, Speaker A: We partner with Dan Foundation, which is an NGO in India, and they have 2 million farmers. We started with 310 just to make sure that all the process is correct. And these farmers are paying, so they are really motivated for that. We wanted to scale to 5000 this year, but with the COVID it was not possible. But working like hell with Ebisa developed a mobile tool so that the farmers can do that instead of doing it on hand. And we still hope to scale to 10,000 next year. And when I say we, it's Ebisa, it's not much of a show.
00:07:57.000 - 00:08:01.320, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you.
00:08:03.210 - 00:08:11.126, Speaker C: If there's a minute, I just have a final question. How are you guys sizing what the stake is and what is affordable for the farmers?
00:08:11.318 - 00:08:38.930, Speaker A: The farmers are not staking the farmers. They do what they have done for centuries. They bring in the pot, whatever they can. And in the blockchain we calculate their merit. The merit is the average monthly payment. And then if there is any issues on their plot, we calculate backwards the loss and we multiply it by the merit of the farmer. And the farmer received the compensation.
00:08:38.930 - 00:08:44.040, Speaker A: The reputation on the watchers is another issue.
00:08:46.410 - 00:08:46.966, Speaker D: Got it.
00:08:46.988 - 00:08:47.720, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:08:54.490 - 00:09:47.842, Speaker A: We still have about a minute or so, so if there are any other questions, one one that I had was what do you think is going to be the biggest challenge in the future or one of the big challenges you've had? I can imagine working around the technology issue where the farmers have a very limited access to mobile data or how did you build around that restriction? The challenges are immense. Ibisa would not have started if we knew all the challenges. The first challenge is the regulatory part. The second challenge is how to scale smoothly. Regulatory part. We are considered well Ebisa is considered as a mutual so it falls under the law of insurance. And somehow we have to partner.
00:09:47.842 - 00:10:16.430, Speaker A: And this is doing they are working very well Ebisa to partner with big insurers in order to get the understanding. But normally it's in the blockchain. It should not be considered as insurance. But for the time being, the law hasn't changed that's the biggest one of the biggest. The second biggest is also human. The NGOs are pushing like hell to scale. And we know that they have to train their field workers.
00:10:16.430 - 00:11:10.590, Speaker A: They have to train to explain to the farmers and so on and so on. It's more human than technological. Technological we started to see already with IPFS, with Filecoin, with Biconomy. Cooldeep has done a great job to that. And things are being solved little by little on the blockchain part and even the decentralized decks we see that wonderful, because in the future we can almost imagine the farmers working only with tokens given by the FAO incentives given by FAO incentives given by the World Food Program. And then instead of cashing these tokens, they can use directly the token with the DEXes. But this is of course, a vision.
00:11:10.590 - 00:11:42.750, Speaker A: It's not for tomorrow, it's for after tomorrow. Right. Okay, perfect. That was a great answer. Thank you, Machu Picchu, for presenting and the judges for their feedback. We're going to keep going on to the next team. We have something there is a question that we would like them to be asked, and we haven't yet is looking to raise funds in order to scale very quickly, as fast as possible.
00:11:42.750 - 00:12:01.650, Speaker A: So spread the word, please. And also programmers can testify on that. Thank you. Okay, thank you for sharing the request. Thank you. Okay, so, judges, that was Machu Picchu. And next up will be DeFi Asset Manager.
00:12:01.650 - 00:12:40.866, Speaker A: And I believe they've already been promoted. So if they would like to start sharing their screen trent, I think Emily said that you may want to play you would like me to play the video for you? Yeah, please. Okay. Yep, I can pull that up. Is the rest of your team already joined? Another person has joined, just Chase. Yeah. Okay, great, thank you.
00:12:40.866 - 00:13:37.582, Speaker A: Yep, here we hi, welcome to DeFi Asset Management, a secure way to crypto investing. Our members are Haktukner Jeter Ramasan. With this application, you can manage portfolios with different asset class. You can invest in crypto, gold and real estate assets. There's a simple three option portfolio selection. With one click purchase, you can use USDC as gas asset and then buy Ave and Compound for DeFi savings and ill farming. We use Chainlink Oracle for asset prices.
00:13:37.582 - 00:13:54.600, Speaker A: And for non crypto users, you can use Fortis Login. We're using React Frontend to pull information for defined protocols and use solidity smart contract to purchase assets on UNICEF. Let's see the demo.
00:13:55.530 - 00:14:53.704, Speaker E: We have a few options to sign in for Matic, forges and MetaMask. I will start with MetaMask, and here on the first page you can select already a predefined portfolio. And it has different characteristics from conservative to aggressive based on your risk tolerance. And the difference between these portfolios is that it has different asset allocations. For example, the conservative one has 30% gold, 860 percent cash, and only 10% crypto. So of course, cash is the safest option, lowest yield and the lowest risk. So I will select moderate portfolio and I have forked the main net to my local blockchain and I have some virtual.
00:14:53.704 - 00:15:27.320, Speaker E: 100 e on my account would be $30,000 right now. And it distributes these funds to different assets tokens. Within one click, I could select this predefined portfolio. I could also change values. But let's assume right now I'm happy with this asset allocation. I would then click, yes, get me that portfolio. I have to confirm the transaction.
00:15:27.320 - 00:16:36.392, Speaker E: And then after the transaction is mined, I would see my different asset allocation. So what's happening in the background is that there's a smart contract that's going to uniswap and buying the different tokens according to this allocation and then putting the stablecoin the USDC into Compound and Ave. It would take too long until the transaction is mined. I will show you the result with a different wallet where I already had a successful transaction. I will use this time portis account, portis wallet, and it now takes a few seconds until it's connecting to Fortis and then getting the different balances. Reading the balances from chain and tier on my dashboard now I can see I have 40% in cash, 41 31 crypto, and 29% in gold tokens. It's very basic.
00:16:36.392 - 00:16:52.420, Speaker E: Just Ethereum wrap bitcoin Cduc and aUSDC and the PEX Gold Token. And here I have a better overview over my different savings protocols. Harvey and compound.
00:17:08.700 - 00:17:53.820, Speaker A: Thank you guys for that video. I will let the judges lead off. Yeah. Great demo, guys. I think it was well built. What I quickly wanted to know was, in terms of dictating how much you'd be putting into these crypto protocols, what sort of parameters do you put for that? How did we decide how to divide? Right now, we just divide just some random figures, like 40, 30, 20. This is just randomly defined right now with saying, conservative portfolio, medium portfolio, and high stack portfolio.
00:17:53.820 - 00:18:44.500, Speaker A: So we don't have any algorithm to say how to distribute the fund. It's a predefined amount percentage, but we can always go the user can always go and change the amount. Once you select a portfolio, you can go and change the numbers to get whatever value you want to purchase for that particular asset. Okay. Got you. So you have the ability to not only select a particular portfolio type, but also be able to change the numbers as you wish in that one of the screens when you are presented with that. But we don't have an algorithm that says, okay, if you're looking at your profile to suggest something right now, it's just three different sizes.
00:18:44.500 - 00:19:12.048, Speaker A: Got you. And I like the real estate piece. Have you thought about how you would include sort of like would it include, like, REITs or form of a derivative? Right. I think we were thinking of integrating with Realty. We have not done that yet. That's our next so Realty has that we could, I guess, buy Realty tokens, but haven't implemented that yet. But we want to do that.
00:19:12.048 - 00:20:06.828, Speaker A: Cool. Hi. Could you talk about how the onboarding experience looks like for someone who is completely new to crypto, how they can get in and start using this application? Right. We have not given obviously, right now, if you have an account ETH, you'll be able to do this, but there are certain tools, like on Moon and other products are out there. But given that, I think one of the product we tried did not work from us. So that's why we put that in for the onboarding experience. Right now, you need to have an ETH account to be able to put the money into crypto.
00:20:06.828 - 00:20:42.080, Speaker A: Gotcha. So the input always has to be ETH, and then it will convert ETH to various different assets. Right now, that's the way it is right now. Okay, thank you. We have not explored different opportunities to see if we could do with fiat yet, but definitely on the cards. Okay. David, do you have anything?
00:20:44.210 - 00:20:54.530, Speaker C: Not really. Maybe just one question. So, I mean, there's quite a few DeFi Asset Manager platforms out there. How do you see your UI or your app competing?
00:20:59.670 - 00:21:53.540, Speaker A: I think we have the simple selection, portfolio selection that you don't have to think too much in terms of where do you want to put your assets, how do you want to buy it. So that's kind of simple. Plus the UXUI, I think we have done a good job in the UXUI front just to kind of have clean interface, simple interface and I think it's more geared towards non crypto users who don't know how to distribute the funds through different assets, but rather take the system, take care of themselves. Great answer. And with that, I believe the time is up for this session. So I want to thank this team for presenting and the judges for their questions. Thank you.
00:21:53.540 - 00:22:20.520, Speaker A: Okay, we are moving on to the third team of the day, which is El Dorado and I believe they've been promoted. And there it is, right on queue. Does your video have audio? Because we can't hear it.
00:22:26.980 - 00:22:30.800, Speaker F: Hello, sorry, it does have audio.
00:22:32.420 - 00:22:33.250, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:22:34.660 - 00:23:19.810, Speaker D: Demo for Ad Online 2020. We are a group of Venezuelans all around the world working to radically improve the financial infrastructure in our region. Our main products are digital dollar accounts, peer to peer payments, peer to peer exchange, remittances and specially developed for this event, savings accounts. All these products are possible with today's technologies and we use them to boost financial inclusion in Latin America. El Dorado is a modern, easy to use mobile and web application that allows users to pay, receive and operate not only in ethereum tokens, but also in Bitcoin and some L. Two solutions like the near protocol. Having all that is great, but we were missing an important part.
00:23:19.810 - 00:24:11.910, Speaker D: During Earth Online, we have developed a proof of concept of a savings account smart contract with a stablecoin initial implementation. Our submission consists on several parts, the most important one being the design around the savings accounts contract and protocol interfaces. Many saving providers, as we call them, can be implemented for any protocol in the DeFi ecosystem. Our first provider implementation uses amStable. By using this protocol, our users will achieve financial gain without getting into the risk of more exotic tokens or platforms, while getting into the fantastic APY that it provides. One interesting effect of the Mstable protocol is that we had to keep the savings balance for each user, which we used later to create an interest bearing token called Dorado. Let's dive into the demo.
00:24:11.910 - 00:25:49.120, Speaker D: Our DAPT connects exclusively through our savings contract and maintaining our philosophy of simple UX, we integrate it with Portis as a wallet provider for it. As you can see, it's a very simple process that requires only approve and deposit actions. The deposited value is sent to the provider, which in turn will mint Dorado tokens for the user to either keep, send to someone or withdraw at any time. Integrating this interest bearing stablecoin token in our app will be our top priority since it will help reduce the amount of transactions needed to make payments from tokens locked in a savings protocol, users can exchange their Dorado back to any stablecoin at any time. Thank you for your attention, and we'll be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.
00:25:57.810 - 00:26:24.560, Speaker A: Thanks. Got. Guys, just quick question from my side. I'm interested to understand a bit more about the Dorado coin and if it's resembling sort of the same function that the A tokens would typically have, and if so, how different is it? Is it sort of basically being that interest bearing sort of token of all the protocols that you guys interact with?
00:26:25.330 - 00:26:54.246, Speaker D: Yeah. So in this case, this Dural token is just for M stable. It was like a side effect of it, and we liked the idea, so we continue. It was not our initial goal to have that as well. And the best part is that the difference is just a stable coin based bearing token, so you don't have to withdraw or change it to anything else. If you use Mstable, for example, you have to redeem it.
00:26:54.268 - 00:26:54.598, Speaker A: Right.
00:26:54.684 - 00:27:17.520, Speaker D: And then send it to someone else. You cannot send your savings. So we just built upon that. So you don't have to do more transactions, just send that the value is dollars. Right. So this is much simpler. So just a simplified version built in.
00:27:19.810 - 00:27:21.950, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. Gotcha.
00:27:24.530 - 00:27:33.170, Speaker C: Great job, guys. I just had a question if you thought anything about the cash out process or how users can spend with Dorado.
00:27:34.790 - 00:28:24.500, Speaker D: Again, Dorado is not our main focus here, but I understand all the questions about this. We have built a pay to pay tier to peer payment application, right? And so by using that, you can just save money there and use our app to save money and then use the app to interact with other people. So instead of using USDC, which you can still use or die or anything else bitcoin, you can just trade using this. We also live in an exchange inside it. So ideally, you will be able to use it as well as a token inside the market. That'd be very interesting. We're also building an on ramp part of the application.
00:28:24.500 - 00:28:56.160, Speaker D: For now. We have circle. We also have some tests with Sandwire, and ideally, we can build something out that just goes directly there to Dorados instead of going through all the process of stablecoin and then transaction back to Dorados. So it's a very interesting thing that we have now because we're focusing on this type of market and stable coins. It's a very easy concept to grab first for people.
00:28:59.970 - 00:29:17.970, Speaker A: Hi. You mentioned that El Dorado, you aim to be like the crypto dollar bank of Latin America. Could you highlight something that's specific to Latin America or unique in your product that's especially beneficial to Latin American users?
00:29:18.870 - 00:30:19.842, Speaker F: I can take this one. Hong yeah, that's a great question. Our main focus when started to build this product almost two years ago, was actually seeing the experience in different latin American countries with centralized exchanges. And basically in our case in Venezuela, the model that really took off was the peer to peer exchange, pretty much the local bitcoins model. So we were bitcoin miners in 2013 and we were liquidity providers to local bitcoin. So we really saw the explosion in use and the ability that peer to peer exchange has to attract market makers that are looking for arbitrage opportunities. So in this case, what we did was integrating also the three main stablecoins so people can go from Colombian pesos to USDC, to Bolivars to Argentinian pesos, all in a peer to peer fashion.
00:30:19.842 - 00:30:23.770, Speaker F: And we believe that this is the successful model in our region.
00:30:25.790 - 00:30:38.240, Speaker A: Got you. Thank you. Okay, any final comments? Is everybody good? No. Great job guys. Yeah, well done. Awesome.
00:30:38.610 - 00:30:40.320, Speaker D: Thank you. Appreciate it.
00:30:41.170 - 00:31:11.320, Speaker A: Thank you, Aldorado. Thank you. I'm going to pull up the next team and that is git three. Yeah. Hi guys. Hey Yasuk. In this video I would like to present to you my hack which I have been working on in the past few weeks.
00:31:11.320 - 00:32:00.790, Speaker A: The idea is to create a decentralized GitHub where it's merged with the functionality of gitcoin. I created a tiny git client. Furthermore, we have a small front end where we can look up repositories. And we have smart contracts which are running on a tick test network. We have there a git factory which is used in order to create new repository contracts. And it's mapping those in order to be able to look them up. Deployed or smart contracts which represent a repository where a user is able to push the current CID, so the current master status practically and receive some ETH tokens.
00:32:00.790 - 00:32:45.880, Speaker A: Let's just start by creating by creating a repository. So here you see my command line. First, what I'm going to do is to critically initialize a repository, get three repo. We go with a git directory where all the contents are stored and add this file to the repository. The next step we are going to push that file. As you see, we see that there is a message repository has been not registered yet. Use git create.
00:32:45.880 - 00:33:28.418, Speaker A: What we are going to do is to register a new repository by calling the create command. What it does is it's calling the git factory contract on the Matic test network, checking if there is a git three repo repository already registered. And if not, it's deploying a new smart contract which represents this repository. Push again. So currently it's pushing to IPFS and it has been successfully pushed. Let's get over to the front end. You see here, very simple front end.
00:33:28.418 - 00:33:52.490, Speaker A: In order to show repositories. Let's have a look for the repository which I'm just created. Git three repo. And as you see there's the git directory and there's our README MD file. As you see here is a coffee market tip. The repository. You know what, I really like this repository I like the work he's doing.
00:33:52.490 - 00:34:24.598, Speaker A: So I'm going to click on this and I can tip that user checking how much ETH I have, calculating how much it is out, about, let's say $3 or an Eve. I say you know what through. And once the transaction went through, the cup becomes normal. I can tip again. So here we have the code which we are currently seeing. What if there is an issue here? I can go to the issue side and check out issues. Currently, no issues.
00:34:24.598 - 00:35:07.920, Speaker A: Let's create a new issue. New issue there. I have a problem with the reading. You can specify more what problems you have. And since it's very important to me, I'm going to leave a bounty which is 1000 way. And then once the transaction has been through there we go there, we see our issue and it has a bounty of 1000 way. All right.
00:35:07.920 - 00:36:12.498, Speaker A: Can I ask questions? Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, that was a really cool demo. And now, just yesterday, I think the RIAA, which is the organization that represents all the record labels and stuff in the US, submitted like a DMCA notice to take YouTube DL, which is a popular tool to download YouTube videos down from GitHub. So this is actually really interesting to me, just because we can create sort of uncensorable GitHub using this technology. I would like to know, I think you mentioned putting something on the Medic testnet, what actually goes into the blockchain and how much of it is decentralized. Do you have like a backend or is everything fully in the blockchain and IPFS? Yeah, I'd like to learn a little more about the architecture.
00:36:12.498 - 00:37:05.194, Speaker A: Sure. So, yeah, there is no back end. We have this git client, which is an open source client, which I used and rewrote practically there's practically a factory contract on the Matic test network, which is like the, let's say, central point, where I can check has been a repository already registered there. And if not, please register. Like in our case just now, the git three repo. In that case it deploys another smart contract which represents then this repository on the Matic network and all the files are stored in IPFS. So currently I have been using IPFS on my local host, but can practically extend it, no problem what goes inside.
00:37:05.194 - 00:37:47.800, Speaker A: So the repository or the smart contract which represents this repository stores like the newest CID. So when you push everything to IPFS, you receive a CID. This is then stored in the contract. There's also a history of CIDs. So if you want to go back and the files are still in IPFS, you can practically go back in history and check out an older state. What else? The CIDs of the issues are stored also in there so that can reference them which are stored also in IPFS. Yeah, this is practically everything which is stored in there for now.
00:37:47.800 - 00:37:50.520, Speaker A: Got you. Awesome. Thank you.
00:37:56.670 - 00:38:03.120, Speaker C: That was really impressive. I don't actually have any questions. Just wanted to say that was really cool. Excited to see how it goes.
00:38:03.970 - 00:38:20.818, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you for the feedback. Hey, Jessica, just want to say that was really cool. I actually like the tipping function. Thanks. Makes a lot of sense. And no questions from my side, but yeah, good job.
00:38:20.818 - 00:38:50.100, Speaker A: All right, thanks. I added tipping functions. Just sometimes you have projects and you're like, you know what, I really enjoy what he's doing and want to help him out or just give him a coffee because I'm using a project or something and I feel it makes sense sometimes. Great. Okay, I guess there are no further questions so far. Yes, thank you. And I hope you continue to build on it after this hackathon.
00:38:50.100 - 00:39:12.376, Speaker A: I really would like that I have to find the time because in the meantime, also I have a full time job, so I will try to find a little bit of time to continue on that. I'm open for some grant or something in case to help it out so that I can continue. Definitely work on that. That would be also great.
00:39:12.558 - 00:39:12.904, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:12.942 - 00:39:24.360, Speaker C: I would suggest maybe reaching out to the Radical team. Radical. R-A-D-I-C-L-E. OK. They're building something similar. I think they're also based in oh, OK. All right.
00:39:24.450 - 00:39:37.590, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Thanks. Great. Okay, I think the time's up for this session. Thank you. Yasek for sharing that idea. Thank you, guys.
00:39:37.590 - 00:39:55.770, Speaker A: All right, so we are going to move on to the next team. For the judges, we're going to jump one down to Samaj, which is being presented by Keshav. So just be aware that we're jumping one down and then we're going to jump one back up.
00:39:58.300 - 00:41:00.604, Speaker G: Hello everyone. I am Keshav and my project focuses upon improving user experience for DApps. So currently we can all agree that it's a pain for non crypto users and non tech users to get a wallet, get ETH from some exchange, and then they also have to manage their gas fee. So what my solution proposes is that we use meta transactions to pay the appropriate gas fee to the relayers and in ERC, 20 tokens. And we can use decentralized Oracles to get on contract price feed for a particular token to pay relay accordingly. So I'm using Biconomy's APIs to relay the meta transactions and decentralized Oracles by Teller to get on contract latest price feed for any token which is required. So in order to demonstrate this functionality, I've developed this particular DAP, which is a social network, and users can post their patents, blogs and et cetera over here.
00:41:00.604 - 00:41:21.460, Speaker G: And it's a pretty simple DAP. I'm going to register first. I'm going to choose a profile picture and register so I won't have to pay any gas fee. As the transaction is relayed by someone else, I only have to sign the transaction. All these details go. To IPFS. And the hash I get from the IPFS go to contract.
00:41:21.460 - 00:41:50.632, Speaker G: And as soon as the transaction is confirmed, I'll be taken to the profiles page. And a profile is pretty simple. We can view our blogs, the research papers we have posted, and et cetera. And the right side is the part which I want to focus on. It's the part where multiple tokens in which you can make a payment on this particular DAP are listed. So Dai and Km are available on this particular DAP. So it shows the balance and the allowance for this particular contract to transfer on your behalf.
00:41:50.632 - 00:42:21.652, Speaker G: So, balance for the user is 1000 and the allowance is currently zero. So I'm going to put in some allowance over there. I'm going to make the allowance 200. And here's the cool part. With the Dai token, we did not have to even hold Ether once, because Dai provides approved via signature functionality and some of the tokens don't provide that. So for them, you have to pay gas fee, at least while approving someone to pay on your behalf. Also, we have a pay via card option.
00:42:21.652 - 00:42:55.680, Speaker G: So pay via card is pretty simple. You make a payment to the DAP and the DAP puts some balance on a contract upon your behalf. So over here, I made a payment for $100 and these US dollars will be mapped on a contract. And whenever you make a transaction, it will get whatever is the value for the gas fee in USD at that particular time and it will charge you from that particular contract. And here the transaction are confirmed. So, let's now try to add a blog over here. So I'm going to add a blog, I'm going to select a cover image.
00:42:55.680 - 00:43:33.816, Speaker G: And here I have provided an option to pay in whatever currency you want to pay the gas fee. I would call it a transaction fee and add blog so I won't have to pay any gas fee right away. I can pay in any of the tokens and keep an eye on the Dai. As soon as the transaction is confirmed, the balance for Dai and the allowance should be updated. And here we go. So basically, the gas fee has been paid by the relayer and the balance for the Dai from our account goes to the relayer. And all this has been done in a single transaction.
00:43:33.816 - 00:44:17.548, Speaker G: Also on this particular DAP, we have a search user functionality where you can view other people's profile, you can view their blogs, their research papers, whatever they have on this particular DAP. And yeah, it fetches this research paper from IPFS. So another feature we have is to support a user. So let's say that I like a user's work and I want to support them, so I can select the currency I want to support them in. And I'm going to click on Support User and it's going to make a transaction and it will transfer ten km from my account to the user's account. So that's basically it I have developed for this particular hack. And thanks guys.
00:44:17.548 - 00:44:19.310, Speaker G: Any questions, please?
00:44:24.550 - 00:45:00.400, Speaker A: Yeah, great job, by the way. Really like the demo and basically UX is a huge thing and basically being able to pay gas fees in tokens is a great idea. Something which I really like and believe in. So just go back to part of that demo I was interested in. There was 1000 die balance and there's 100 die allowance. Right? Was that 100 die? I think you mentioned it in the video. Was it that 100 die goes to the relayer? Is that no.
00:45:04.290 - 00:45:20.178, Speaker G: The contract on which this particular DAP is running the contract has been allowed to make a transaction of 100 die. Whenever a transaction is made, it's going to calculate the amount of die from way and it's going to charge the user and transfer the amount from that.
00:45:20.264 - 00:45:55.870, Speaker A: Okay. It makes sense. And then because with Dai it's got that permit function, so that makes a lot of sense. Well, it's easier, for example, to have that account abstraction, as you mentioned, for other, ERC, sort of 20 tokens as well. The ones that don't have the permit function of die with the km one, how would you allow the end user to pay the gas fees in that particular, ERC, 20 token? Yeah. Interested to see how you sort of built the architecture for it. Okay.
00:45:55.940 - 00:46:14.198, Speaker G: So, yeah, with those tokens which don't have the permit functionality, I couldn't figure out a way to not pay gas fee even once. At least the user will have to hold at least once. User will have to hold the ETH at least once to allow the other user the user has to be the message sender, right?
00:46:14.364 - 00:46:15.080, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:18.490 - 00:46:24.780, Speaker G: I think with that it can be done, but yeah, with a lot of other tokens it can be.
00:46:25.870 - 00:46:26.620, Speaker A: Okay.
00:46:30.510 - 00:46:47.780, Speaker C: Great job. I just want to point out, I don't know if I've seen anyone use meta transactions with a card. So I think that's pretty exciting. Have you thought about the use cases for that where a user might want to pay for gas with their card but make the transaction on ethereum still?
00:46:49.110 - 00:47:23.130, Speaker G: Yeah. Basically every DAP, like whenever a new user enters the crypto space, they don't really want to manage their gas fee and they don't want to handle their wallets private keys sometimes. So those people who don't want to manage their gas fee and other stuff can definitely opt for pay via card option. Or if other users are holding, let's say, any tokens, then they can even go for tokens. Yeah.
00:47:23.580 - 00:47:55.460, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So first of all, I just wanted some clarification. Is the hackathon submission the social network that you showed, or was it the meta transaction aspect? That's one question. Another one. Is the balances you were showing in the DAP, were those balances from the EOA, the externally owned account that user had, or do you have some kind of a smart contract wallet? I'm assuming not, because you mentioned that permit function is required.
00:47:56.920 - 00:48:14.170, Speaker G: Yeah, for the first one, my project is the later one, the Metatransaction functionality for improving the user experience part. And second question is yeah, the user has to use externally owned account, like something like MetaMask or something.
00:48:15.820 - 00:48:17.130, Speaker A: Got you. Okay.
00:48:21.120 - 00:48:23.870, Speaker G: So I guess no other questions.
00:48:26.160 - 00:48:47.180, Speaker A: I had one more question. You know the Km token, right? Yeah. Now, that token, did that have a permit function? Because I think in the demos or you allowed I can't remember, but I'm not sure if in the demo, you allowed the end user to pay gas in those tokens.
00:48:47.340 - 00:48:54.500, Speaker G: Yeah, Km token did not have a permit function, so I had to pay the gas fees to allow the user allow the contract.
00:48:55.000 - 00:49:10.332, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Thank you, Kishab. That is time for this session. Great presentation, and thank you, judges, again for your comments. Thanks, a okay, so thank you, everyone.
00:49:10.386 - 00:49:11.390, Speaker G: Have a good day.
00:49:12.240 - 00:49:36.760, Speaker A: You too. So we're going to move back up just for the judges. We're moving back up the list. I think you're looking at the same order I am. So we're going back to ERC Graph, and we're going to take a short break after this, just so everybody knows. A couple of minutes, get some water, use the restroom.
00:49:39.100 - 00:49:40.632, Speaker H: Hello. Should I start?
00:49:40.766 - 00:49:41.930, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:49:43.020 - 00:50:06.412, Speaker H: Hello. Today I'm going to be presenting ERC Graph, my submission for the ETH Online 2020 hackathon. I'm Pablo yancioto. I'm a software engineer, and I built an interactive analysis and visualization tool that shows ERC 20 transfer. It's in Python. Some previous work of mine called Ether Blocks. How it works, it listens and retrieves past ERC 20 transfer event logs.
00:50:06.412 - 00:50:56.640, Speaker H: It plots those transfers on a canvas as addresses, as nodes and transfers and links. And it allows you to filter the data and what you see on the canvas based on different criteria, protocol, token, address, amount. Let's jump right into the demo. So here's the home page where you can parameterize the front block, two block token address you are interested in. But for the time being, we'll leave it everything as default. So now it's loading the past few blocks and plotting all the ERC 20 transfer transaction that happened in the past few blocks. You can see every address is a node, and every link between two addresses represents the transfers that happened between those addresses and the tokens that were transferred.
00:50:56.640 - 00:51:37.352, Speaker H: The addresses have different colors based off if they are external loan accounts or smart contracts, and also based on the protocol they belong to. For example, uniswap is pink. You can see the mint and burn address is gray, and the curve is blue. You can also filter all the information you see by, let's say by token. So we are interested in USDT transfers, and we only want to see more than 1000 USD transfers. So we can apply filters to that. Let's say we want to filter, for example, an Arbitrage bot.
00:51:37.352 - 00:52:20.792, Speaker H: Okay, here we can see all the transfer that the Arbitrage bot bot did in the past few blocks and it's updating in real time, of course. Let's go back home. Let's say we are interested in a particular transaction or set of transaction. We can use a list of transactions that we want to plot. So instead of being real time, we plot specific transaction we are interested in. Here we are seeing a one inch transaction where someone swapped wrap bitcoin for UHDC and one inch swapped rabbitcoin for wrap ethereum, ethereum for UATC, UTC, USD, et cetera. Using curve, balancer and uni if you want to push it to the limit.
00:52:20.792 - 00:53:09.150, Speaker H: We can see for example how the unisop AirDrop looks like at the moment 15,000 blocks showing unisop transfers. Here we have the unisop router and here the address in charge of the AirDrop or where people were sending transactions to claim the 400 union or whatever amount. So that's the idea behind the application. How it's made is it gets the ERC 20 data using MetaMask and pocket network. It fetch the dynamic pools of units of balance and feature using the graph. You can look up the address levels using reverse ENS. And of course it has a canvas that I made, like a drawing I made myself to boost performance and allow you to plot like 20,000 transfer.
00:53:09.150 - 00:53:38.550, Speaker H: Future work create a custom subgraph so we can do more complex query and reduce loading times because we can query the subgraph directly instead of filtering client side and show ITER transfers using debug trace transaction using like a custom node that spokes the debug endpoint the RPC. It's live already. You can try it out and hopefully enjoy it at Ercgraph live. Thanks.
00:53:44.230 - 00:54:12.330, Speaker C: I can start. So that was awesome. I mean, I'm quite biased. So I work at the graph and we've been waiting for someone to build an ERC 20 subgraph for a while, if I remember correctly. The difficulty is that it takes weeks to sync a node, given how many ERC 20 transactions occur and figuring out which tokens to actually include. So I'd love to hear more about your methodology and how you chose what your subset of ERC 20s were and specifically why those pools and where you see that evolving.
00:54:12.670 - 00:54:39.060, Speaker H: Okay, so first of all, let me clarify that it's not using the graph to get the transfers themselves. It's using pass log. The graph is right now it's being used to get all the uniswap pools, balancer pools, sushi swap so we can color them accordingly. But the idea is to build a subgraph so you are not querying every time you load the page. You are not querying pass log for 20,000 transfers. That's the next step. I haven't thought exactly how the graph would look like.
00:54:42.070 - 00:55:02.426, Speaker C: Yeah, that's fair. I was just asking even the ERC 20 tokens that you had chosen. Others that have tried to create subgraphs for token sets have sort of struggled to figure out how do you choose what that set is? Because then you'd have to sort of redeploy the app or redeploy the subgraph or the API every single time you wanted to add a new token. I was curious what your methodology was for choosing that set.
00:55:02.528 - 00:55:21.490, Speaker H: No, there is no token set. Like right now, it's filtering every transfer topic that matches the ESC 20 standard. You can filter by token later on, or you can filter for a specific token using the logs filtering by address. But by default, it's showing everyone every token.
00:55:21.910 - 00:55:22.660, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:55:25.190 - 00:55:38.520, Speaker A: Hey, Pablo. So that was a really cool demo. Could you share some potential use cases you've thought about for your product?
00:55:38.890 - 00:55:57.982, Speaker H: Yeah, let me share again. So I actually have the first one was showing those one inch complex transactions. Those are kind of interesting. Then this is something I saw while I was like, trying it out.
00:55:58.116 - 00:55:58.414, Speaker A: Here.
00:55:58.452 - 00:56:14.890, Speaker H: For example, you can see all the transfer between chain link aggregators. I'm not super familiar with the chain link protocol, so I'm not sure what the transfers means. But look at they are distributing zero point 62 link among different aggregators.
