00:00:01.850 - 00:01:22.262, Speaker A: So hello everybody. I'm Ernestoado, I'm a blockchain developer for Abe and today I'm going to make a presentation about the flash launch that is featuring our protocol and their composability in DeFi. And yeah, we did yesterday, another one a bit more technical, but this one is going to be more a high level picture of what are the flash loans, how is the ecosystem around the flash loans use cases, applications, et cetera. First of all, so a quick introduction I suppose a lot of you already know what are the flash loans since the last two weeks that they become really mainstream in the ethereum ecosystem. But to start, the flash loans are uncollateralized loans, borrowed and repaid in the same transaction. So it means that you don't need to deposit any collateral, but you still can borrow in opposition to almost all the DeFi protocols out there that you need to have deposit a collateral and then borrow from there. So this is enabled by the property of the ethereum blockchain itself.
00:01:22.262 - 00:02:31.914, Speaker A: That is the atomicity. That means that everything that happens within the context of execution of one transaction, if it goes through, it goes through, but if it fails, at some point everything gets revered. So what this means for DeFi, for the ecosystem, for the rest of the platforms, is that this brings a lot of composability and a lot of possibilities of interaction between one protocol and the other. So it can be understood as a building block for DeFi because it allows to build applications, tools and whatever you can imagine around it. Something that is really important also on the flash loans is that potentially it allows something like high frequency movement of capital between DeFi and decentralized applications. Unlike some other current cases of movement of capital that they depend on multi block and over time getting yield. With flash loans this can be done in every transaction, potentially even in multiple transactions, even on the same block.
00:02:31.914 - 00:03:36.050, Speaker A: So some good comparison will be like the high frequency trading in the traditional banking, of course, with the limitations of the ethereum blockchain. Another thing of the flash loans is that they kind of democratize the access to capital. This means that at the end of the day, you only need to execute a function in a contract that has funds. So the only resource necessary in advance is the knowledge of what to do with that capital. If you have a really good knowledge of how all the protocols are interconnected, which are the opportunities out there, you only need to implement a bot or do direct transaction and get the profit and everything. This before. What it leads to, especially in this context of a hackathon, is that it's a huge boost for biddlers of defy applications because now you know that you don't need to have any capital.
00:03:36.050 - 00:04:29.330, Speaker A: You can only spend time of understanding really well the ecosystem having a really good idea of an application and from there just getting profit use cases of the flash loans. Like one of the first platforms that implemented this flash loan feature with real usage is ours, Abe. And so this is still growing and is really early to say these are the use cases. There will be a lot of more. But for example, one of the first is that these flash loans can be considered like a stress test of security of the Fi ecosystem. Because at the end of the day, you cannot try to attack multiple platforms for free or really cheaply. So it brings like a lot of stress tests without needing any capital.
00:04:29.330 - 00:05:14.370, Speaker A: You can do liquidations on over collateralized systems. That is one of the main use cases that we thought about when we tried to introduce. Like for example, you see that a loan is under collateralized, is about to be under collateralizing compound. So you flash loan from Abe and you liquidate the loan on compound without having the capital in advance. So there are multiple advantages for that. It can be used also for a lot of platforms that don't have, like ours for example, don't have leverage in a native way because we are not a trading platform. But with these flash loans you can actually do leverage because you can flash long and accumulate and doing multiple transactions you make the accumulation of capital.
00:05:14.370 - 00:06:22.450, Speaker A: Another one that is quite general is the swap of currencies and positions between platforms. Positions will be like you can move CDPs or the exposure in one vaulting MakerDAO from one currency to another. Potentially you can move a loan position from one DeFi platform to another and et cetera, even on exchanges. There are a huge potential here and of course the Arbitrage the Arbitrage is the one that looks the most simple of all. You just look for opportunities exchanging in multiple steps between decentralized exchanges and then you take the capital and you combine multiple steps and get the profit. And like I say, this is just the beginning so way more will appear for sure. One of the objectives of the talk is like presenting from our experience and from our internal analysis which are the models that works best for the pros and cons of each model of applications implementing a flash loan feature.
00:06:22.450 - 00:07:57.094, Speaker A: So starting for the most pure one, let's say, is like imagine a standalone pool, like a pool of funds that is built exclusively to do in flash loans. So people accumulate in a smart contract their funds in whatever currency or multiple currencies and the only objective of those funds is that there will be some operator or some dow or there are multiple models that will try to execute transactions with those funds and give guild to the people that deposited in that fund. Pros of this approach this is the general idea and even people came with this idea one year ago but the cons were quite high pros still there are the simplicity of the code is noticeable because at the end of the day it's just the funding, a contract and then define some rules that needs to be respected. But the movement of capital is whatever the operators decide, there is always liquidity available to withdraw because at the end of the day these funds are executed, are moved in one transaction, but at the end of the transaction they are in the pool. So you just put your funds there and then you can withdraw it at any point. That is quite important actually, and this is a bit more abstract, but there is an alignment of interest between the parties involved. This means that I am depositing in the pool to do flash loans, nothing else.
00:07:57.094 - 00:09:15.566, Speaker A: It's like we really trust in the operator. So there is no subjectivity here about the cons that actually were the ones that didn't allow for people to develop this idea farther before is the main problem is this chicken problem on liquidity that is basically that you need liquidity to get advantage of opportunities in the market. But how you attract that liquidity because at the beginning people will need to deposit a good amount in a fund and they will not have any revenue until there is an arbitrage opportunity or a liquidation or whatever. This can be a problem and in our case we know it quite well because we have a borrowing platform that was P to P and one of the main problems is that when you offer to lend out funds you need to deposit the funds and while the funds are waiting, they are not getting any revenue. So you could have used the funds in another way so the pool model is a bit better in that sense. So that is the main con of exclusive fund for this. The other is that the frequency of income is irregular because you depend on different market opportunities, liquidations, arbitrage, whatever.
00:09:15.566 - 00:10:32.950, Speaker A: For now at least, there is nothing like a continuous revenue, something that you can do block by block. You depend on multiple and complex variables and there is another that is moderated with the coordination and is who decides which opportunities to take or which is the business model of this standalone fund. For flash loans this boils down to make a Dow or boils down to have some certain kind of centralization. So we could define it as a con, maybe as a pro, but it's subjective also. So this is the purest model but back in the days we also thought about some product like this but it was not so worth it. But we realized that the actually powerful model is when the flash loans are on top of money markets. What this means is that you build the five protocol that has an underlying economic model like ours that is based on borrowing and lending capital in a pool way and the profits are shared for all the depositors and the flash loan is just an extra on top.
00:10:32.950 - 00:11:42.142, Speaker A: So it's like a boost for giving profit to those depositors in a different way because it doesn't follow the same model as the borrowing lending model of interest rate for example. That is the big advantage. Another pro, I mean the pro is that you have a basic income for people that wants to do flash loans because at the same time they are depositing and those funds are being borrowed and the liquidity doesn't come for the flash loans. The liquidity most probably comes from depositors that are allowed to borrow money and flash loans are just a consequence. Another feature of the system like nothing else. The cons of this is for sure there is more complexity on the system and we know it quite well since the last two weeks. Because once we introduce this feature in a set of smart contracts, the interconnection between the functions of those smart contracts become way way more dangerous because there is like arbitrary release of capital, different movement, like you could interact with multiple functions of the protocol at the same time.
00:11:42.142 - 00:12:32.270, Speaker A: So it introduces a complexity that you need to evaluate and development gets a bit more difficult. Could be considered that there is an added risk because of the flash loans themselves. Because even if you borrow out the money and in the same transaction you validate that you receive the funds back. At the end of the day the funds are going out. So it could be argued that it boils down that some problem in EBM in some particular cases could be problematic. So there is a bit of added risk even if in practice is zero, let's say more or less zero. And another con, and probably is the biggest one, is that there is constraint the liquidity available because a lot of funds are borrowed out.
00:12:32.270 - 00:13:13.754, Speaker A: So the funds that you can use are the ones available, are not borrowed at this point. So for example, this is our platform and what will be submitted to flash loan is like in this case, imagine ethereum. There is like 4 million in assets right now and borrowed out there are like almost 200K. So what you can flash in this case is the difference between the total liquidity and the borrowed out. So it will be 4 million. In the case of ethereum it's not a big deal because ethereum is used more as collateral to then borrow, for example stable coins. But if you check, for example Die, you have 1.1
00:13:13.754 - 00:13:29.646, Speaker A: in total. Borrow is almost everything. So you only have two hundred k to borrow that. So if you compare with a model that is puristic like the previous one, for sure you cannot flash so much in proportion. Yeah. What happens if two people try to.
00:13:29.668 - 00:13:30.960, Speaker B: Borrow at the same time?
00:13:31.650 - 00:14:49.174, Speaker A: If they both try to take if they try to borrow the problem is that nothing can happen at the same time. Like if you try to borrow, I try to borrow, what it means is that, yeah, we submit a transaction and one will go after the other so the funds will be returned in the middle. So, yeah, about our particular implementation of the flash loans, there are some specific details is that well, like I said before, anybody can flash borrow the available funds. So the difference between the total liquidity minus the borrowed assets, in our case the flash loans are available, are enabled to all the assets in the protocol. So it's not only ethereum, it's not only that, it's like every listed currency can be borrowed depending on the constraints of the liquidity. Then we chose kind of simple approach in the implementation, really constrained in the sense that our implementation is basically we borrow out the money and at the end of the function that executes this transaction we check that the balance of the contract storing the funds is the same as it was at the beginning plus a depositor's yield. That is the next point.
00:14:49.174 - 00:16:04.094, Speaker A: This depositor's yield is basically that from every flash loan there is a percentage that the person that did the flash loan needs to return back to the pool and that the biggest part of that will go to the depositors as an extra income. And this is what I mentioned before of the boost of income in the depositors that they are borrowing money, they are getting interest from that. But apart from that, every time there is a flash loan the pool receives some income that gets also spread between the depositors. Something interesting with real numbers and how powerful could that be is like imagine that you have here like the ethereum that have 4 million available to borrow. The interest that depositors earn is really small like zero 6%, but this is because the interest is always based in the utilization, like the difference in the available and the borrowed. But if you start doing flash loans of 4 million that are available, imagine that you do a flash loan that gets a profit of, I don't know, 1% for example. Or imagine a stream case in liquidation that can be potentially imagine 10%.
00:16:04.094 - 00:17:18.598, Speaker A: With 10% you will get 400K in one transaction and for the will get 70% for the depositors to split between the depositors. This will mean that in one transaction maybe you are generating an interest of 20% one transaction income. That is a stream case because it's a 10% and it's not unrealistic but if you put a 0.5% still it's quite big amount. So this is really powerful when you have it on top of a money market because the boost potentially could be even more important than the interest coming from borrowers. So just to give a bit of overview and that also boils down to the liquidity available is important to have liquidity available, more proportion of liquidity available and less optimized to less utilization rate or is important to optimize to more utilization rate and better interest for the borrower? It's a good question, but yeah, one thing about the flash loans, and probably this is the most known thing is that how is the interest rate of.
00:17:18.604 - 00:17:20.410, Speaker B: The flash loan calculated?
00:17:21.550 - 00:17:55.034, Speaker A: The interest rate of the flash loan, this depository is hard coded in the protocol, I mean hard coded, it can be changed. And right now, for example, is the 0.9% of the flash loan amount. So from there still the 70% 70%, 70% goes to the depositors and the 30% goes to protocol fees. That then gets barned for the token that is behind and that kind of stuff. But yeah, it's 0.9% and of that 70% goes as depositors redirection.
00:17:55.182 - 00:18:00.520, Speaker B: Is there like a calculated amount of compound at the moment?
00:18:01.050 - 00:18:13.740, Speaker A: No, it's the borrowed amount initially. Like it doesn't matter what you do in the middle. In the middle, if you get like the double you need to get the nine off what you borrow, it doesn't matter.
00:18:18.350 - 00:18:20.650, Speaker B: Would be like every filter block.
00:18:21.950 - 00:18:26.320, Speaker A: But you don't know. No, it's not. It's completely dependent on that.
00:18:29.570 - 00:18:48.980, Speaker C: Instantaneous interest accumulated. So if you have 0.9%, you can consider that 0.9% like an Apr accumulated in instantaneous. So it gets instantaneously added to the reserve at instantaneous interest if you want.
00:18:50.150 - 00:18:54.840, Speaker B: If I put liquidity your protocol, how much would it be in a year?
00:18:56.330 - 00:19:05.702, Speaker C: It depends on the volume of flash loans. Of course, if there are zero, flash loans will be zero. If there are 10 million flash loans.
00:19:05.846 - 00:19:07.340, Speaker B: At the moment, for example.
00:19:09.630 - 00:19:11.520, Speaker A: No in numbers. I don't know.
00:19:14.370 - 00:19:35.962, Speaker C: Yeah, it depends on the growth of the project. Right. So every time the calculation specifically works this way, every time a threshold is taken, we calculate like how much was the flesh loan, how much is the current liquidity, we do the ratio between the two and that is basically the accrued interest in that particular transaction.
00:19:36.046 - 00:19:36.438, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:36.524 - 00:19:43.590, Speaker C: So it gets added to the reserve as a kind of instantaneous interest, so it accumulates.
00:19:44.330 - 00:19:55.242, Speaker A: But in terms of prediction, it's not so easy. But the other actually even the borrowing, you cannot predict at all.
00:19:55.296 - 00:20:18.830, Speaker C: What we estimate usually is that until now, how much happiness and you can do a projection if you keep that volume until the end of the year and have an approximate evaluation of what it should be. That is the best idea because like Ernest was saying, it's not like interest accrued per second, it's something depends on the actual volume.
00:20:20.470 - 00:21:35.318, Speaker A: Yeah, but going on with this thing is like as you know, this went mainstream like two or three weeks ago because these flash loans have like a dark side and this dark side is like it looks more like this actually not like Darter. And for me it's not so dark side, let's be honest. But it's considered as that and is how some protocols can be subjected to exploits because of the flash loans. Now it's like protocols that before were safe because no attack vector had so much flexibility as the flash loans where the liquidity comes instantaneous and it changed a bit of the rules. But now with real funds and with the feature of flash loans on top, stuff like that is allowed. That basically the sployed was that somebody borrowed, took a flash loan from a platform, then they make an operation in compound that is a money market. Then they create a trade position, another platform, BCX.
00:21:35.318 - 00:22:06.600, Speaker A: Then they crash a price in a decentralized exchange. And from all this combination, they got a huge profit. Because at the end, at the same time, there was a small bug in BCX in this case. And then at the end of the transaction, they just returned the flash loan and they got like, I think it was 350k in profit, but it was 350k without spending more than the gas cost of calling the function. So it was like also the problem.
00:22:08.170 - 00:22:25.498, Speaker B: Has some kind of limit, put some limit on it so you can just come in and risking just gas money. You can move so much money around and read so much money on there. It's a new product and a new platform. So you think some kind of limit that you can put in there in.
00:22:25.504 - 00:22:28.938, Speaker A: The beginning English sense, the limit, I.
00:22:28.944 - 00:22:55.394, Speaker B: Think it's a new product, right. Flash was a new product. Dex has only been around for maybe two years and we have to be very smart and clever. We know how to technically call you worth these things, able to come in and bring practically nothing to find vulnerabilities or whatever market manipulation in the market. So that's why I think maybe the beginning should be at some kind of percentage on there, how much you can get in this could get worse for you before.
00:22:55.512 - 00:23:21.758, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think the solution for that is not putting the is not on the flash loan side because the flash loan is not a problem per se and putting a limitation of how much you can flash loan is not a problem. The limitation should be if you want to put the limitation, it could be legit in some cases. I didn't evaluate more about that. Okay, sorry.
00:23:21.844 - 00:23:25.066, Speaker B: On the smart contract or the exchanges on the PGx.
00:23:25.258 - 00:23:28.654, Speaker A: Yeah, that could be a solution because.
00:23:28.692 - 00:23:53.910, Speaker D: Another, like one guy who mines E for example, on $1, he have the huge amount and he can do the same without any flashball. It will be a bit risky for him because maybe he will not be able to go out because it will be blocked on some exchanges, but he will go to Dex deposit like Flesh loan. Don't introduce this attack. In general, the Deck organization introduced.
00:24:00.090 - 00:24:00.418, Speaker C: I'm.
00:24:00.434 - 00:24:02.006, Speaker B: Saying so far I'm not just going.
00:24:02.028 - 00:24:02.626, Speaker D: To have the capital.
00:24:02.658 - 00:24:07.180, Speaker B: You also have the technical knowledge how to do that this is not an easy thing to do.
00:24:08.990 - 00:24:41.974, Speaker A: Can we discuss better because we have a bit constraint. I will finish this and then we discuss. So yeah, just to wrap around like future cases of flash loan this is important and it's like future of the flash loans in themselves. The defy use cases are going to grow for sure. They are growing like day by day. People is coming with ideas everywhere because now there is the perception that the barrier to capital and to do interesting stuff and getting profit in the middle is really low. So people just entering more developers are attracted to the system just because of that.
00:24:41.974 - 00:25:37.122, Speaker A: That is really good. The thing of the dark side at the end the main consequence is that there is more focus and there will need to be more focus on security in the five protocols to protect about this for example and the development of the phishing automated tools like bots to get better arbitrage et cetera. And this is not only limited to loans, because here the most powerful feature is actually the atomicity that allow the flash loans. And there are multiple ideas. It's way more experimental because it depends on some other economics. But, for example, people is coming with this idea of flash mintable tokens that is like, ERC, 20 tokens that can be minted randomly arbitrarily from one transaction. This is still quite experimental, I have my DApps on it but it's really original.
00:25:37.122 - 00:26:40.270, Speaker A: Or these flash minted depositors that is something that we are actually checking internally that is about minting our a tokens that represent the deposit to send to some place and then return them back. And then those eight tokens that you actually mint they have a value at the end of the transaction but they didn't have at the beginning. It's like a bit of time travel of value but this is still experimental and a lot of stuff that needs to come and the validations at the end of the transaction. The atomicity is actually the main powerful thing that the flash loans are based and a lot of developments are going to come from that. So yeah, we can do questions but I think it's already finished. You have then the discord is Abbey.com and Discord and our telegram so just join there, ask the questions or we will be around if you want to have any talk work.
00:26:40.270 - 00:26:40.940, Speaker A: So thanks.
