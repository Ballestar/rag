00:00:06.330 - 00:00:30.166, Speaker A: All right, welcome to the Orb Terradon workshop. We have a ton of stuff to get through and we want to leave time at the end for you to ask any questions that you have. Hopefully we'll have the chance to do that, and if not, you can just catch us later. So we're going to cover three main things today. First of all, why we made the orb in the first place. Secondly, how it works. And that's when we'll actually walk through the hardware itself.
00:00:30.166 - 00:01:14.994, Speaker A: And then lastly, what's next for the orb and for WorldCoin itself. So just to give you a little bit of background on why we made the orb within crypto is super awesome, but it has two core problems today. Very few people have used it, but all of the value is being hoarded by a very small amount of people. And so a few years ago we thought, well, what would have happened if bitcoin has started by giving one to each person in the world? And so we decided to give it a shot. We said let's try this with a token we call that WorldCoin. And for the past few years we've been working on this. But we ran into a problem which was how do you make sure each person only claims their part once, right? And the more we look into this problem, it turns out that this was a very common problem that a lot of projects have around the world, which is civil resistance.
00:01:14.994 - 00:01:49.214, Speaker A: It's basically this idea of if there's 20 accounts, you don't know if there's 20 people with one account each person or one person with 20 accounts. And so we started looking to how to solve it. And there were three things that were super important for us when doing this. First, however we were going to solve, it had to be private. Secondly, it had to be inclusive, which means everyone in the world should be able to use it. And then lastly, had to scale, right? There had to be a feasible path to get this to everyone in the world. And so we started with what you can imagine, as usual suspects, let's just make people verify their emails or verify their phone numbers.
00:01:49.214 - 00:02:27.882, Speaker A: But that obviously breaks pretty quickly because it's very easy to just get a new email or a new phone number. Then we said, okay, what if we do something like KYC, right? Like this is what banks do, let's just verify the documents that people have. But it turns out that more than half the population of the world either doesn't have an ID or doesn't have or there aren't SDKs where you can actually verify those IDs. Furthermore, it's like super expensive and it's super privacy invasive, right? We don't want the names and personal documents of a bunch of people around the world. And so we discard the KYC. Then we run into this idea of web of trust. It's basically the idea of, hey, I endorse you as a real person and you endorse me.
00:02:27.882 - 00:02:58.194, Speaker A: And through mathematical things, either implicitly or explicitly, you can actually build a trust model where you can have certain certainty. And we actually think Web of trust is super cool. And there's a bunch of projects out there that are building a web of trust. The problem with Web of Trust is that you need a very large set of initial users you can trust. Because if the early users lie to you, then you're basically building a house of cards. So we actually think Web of Trust is how we'll get WorldCoin from 1 billion people to 8 billion people. But the only way to bootstrap that is to do something different.
00:02:58.194 - 00:03:35.086, Speaker A: We need to find a different way to get to the first billion users. And so after doing a lot of thinking, a lot of experiments, we just got to the conclusion of the most fundamental solution is biometrics. In general, if you want to have the concept of a unique person, the thing that sets us apart as people is our biometrics. So here we also looked at a bunch of stuff. And the obvious solutions don't work for three main reasons. Firstly, they don't have enough data points or enough entropy to distinguish between one in a billion people or one in 10 billion people. Something like your fingerprint just doesn't have enough data points there.
00:03:35.086 - 00:04:15.966, Speaker A: Secondly, a problem that we had is we're not trying to verify that you are who you say you are, right? So when you go to Worldcon, you don't say, I'm Tiago SADA and I am showing my biometrics to prove that I am who I am. You're proving that you're someone who has never been here before. That means that even if we could have an update on the palm of your hand, for example, if you just make a small cut, you're now a new person. Now you wouldn't be able to prove that you're Tiago SADA, but you can always just keep making cuts and you're a new person every and every time. And then lastly, there was a bunch of really cool technology that is just very new, right, and just hasn't been studied enough. And we wanted to have something that was super reliable. And so we went through a bunch of things here.
00:04:15.966 - 00:04:32.814, Speaker A: We went through fingerprints is very tamperable, not enough data. Same thing with facial recognition. We looked at palm scanning. This was actually the first prototypes that we built, used palm scanning. But it's just too new and there's too many uncertainties around that. DNA is just too creepy. It's expensive, it's inefficient.
00:04:32.814 - 00:05:11.742, Speaker A: So we didn't want to do that. And so we landed on iris, right? It turns out the iris of your eye has enough entropy, enough data to actually distinguish between many people. And it's also very impractical to change. You can do laser surgery or things like that, but are you really going to get laser surgery to do like one more and one more identity. It just doesn't scale. And then lastly we said, okay, how are we going to do this? Our first idea was, well, let's try to do something with the smartphones, right? Everyone has a camera, but it turns out the resolution just isn't there. If you for example, take something like Face ID, it can only distinguish between one in 10 million people, which is great because only one in 10 million people can break into your phone.
00:05:11.742 - 00:06:01.758, Speaker A: But if you're trying to prove onboard everyone to one system, that means after 5 million people, half people will be falsely rejected because you would confuse them with someone else. Then we said, okay, then you need specialized hardware. Let's look at what's on the market. But the problem with that was those hardwares are made for one to one comparisons, right? They're made to check, hey, is Philip who he says he is? They're not made to check, hey, is Philip a new person? And furthermore, the way the operations were going to work, we need to operate in untrusted environments. We're sending hardware to a bunch of random parts of the world and you also have a bunch of fraud prevention things that you need to make sure people aren't aware of prosthetics, people aren't just showing pictures. And most of these off the shelf biometric scanners just did not have support for that. And so we finally just realized we're going to have to build our own hardware for these.
00:06:01.758 - 00:06:23.574, Speaker A: Which was honestly not very good news. We did not want to build our own hardware. Building hardware is really fucking hard, but we decided to do it. And so for the past two years, we've built a bunch of generations of the orb. We'll get into one of those in a second. And then finally after a long time, we got this little beauty that you've seen on Twitter, you've seen here at the conference and at a high level. It does three things.
00:06:23.574 - 00:07:06.610, Speaker A: It first checks that someone is a real person that is not trying to cheat. So it checks their face to make sure that they're alive, that they actually have that they are breathing, that there's like a 3D mapping of their face to make sure it's not a picture, things like that. You're not wearing prosthetics, you're not wearing contact lenses. The second thing it does is it generates a code from your iris and by default that's the only thing that leaves your and then that gets compared to everyone else that has been verified before. And then if that is unique, then it registers your world ID, which is basically the proof of personhood that we issue you. Now this is a point that I really want to emphasize is world ID is not your iris code. Your identity or your proof of personhood is not your biometrics.
00:07:06.610 - 00:07:08.494, Speaker A: World ID is also not your wallet.
00:07:08.542 - 00:07:08.706, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:08.728 - 00:07:30.342, Speaker A: We're not verifying your wallet. What we are doing is we're issuing you a new type of key that we call World ID. It is self custodial, just as a wallet private key would be. And so in the World Coin app, you can have 100 wallets. You don't have your iris code there because your iris code doesn't need to live there. And then you have one World ID key, and that World ID key is basically what the or whitelists.
00:07:30.486 - 00:07:31.002, Speaker B: All right?
00:07:31.056 - 00:08:01.954, Speaker A: And so that would already be super private. But then on top of that, we actually build zero knowledge proofs, which means that key that we issue you is not even like a public ID that people can query. And, oh, I am number 1234 or five that lives secretly on your phone. And you only use it through Serial Knowledge Proofs to prove that you're a person that hasn't done something before. And so we're really excited about this system. If you're curious about how that whole side of things works, in particular with the Serial Knowledge Proofs, there's a blog post on our website that breaks it down. It's called privacy preserving proof of person to protocol.
00:08:01.954 - 00:08:25.360, Speaker A: It's a Pppop, and you can just check it out and you can come by the booth and we can give you more info on that. But now let's get to the fun stuff, right? How does the orb work? Right? What did we spend two years building? And how do we solve these problems of fraud prevention? Generating the iris code, comparing that, and then issuing you the World ID. And for that, we have Sandra here, head of orb at WorldCoin. And so he'll walk us through this.
00:08:26.690 - 00:08:28.926, Speaker C: All right, let's do this.
00:08:29.108 - 00:08:33.390, Speaker B: Let's see. Can you hear me? Somewhat. All right.
00:08:33.460 - 00:08:42.370, Speaker C: Sorry. This is a rockpool. You've been tricked. We won't actually disassemble an orb. We'll go the reverse ray. We'll assemble it from scratch.
00:08:42.710 - 00:08:43.780, Speaker B: Let's go.
00:08:46.330 - 00:08:50.534, Speaker C: So the first part of the orb is the mainframe here.
00:08:50.572 - 00:08:51.400, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:08:52.970 - 00:09:25.890, Speaker C: And the most important part here is like the circular aluminum CNC machined frame. It gives the orb stability, rigidity, et cetera. And very importantly, it's spherical. This did not come from engineering. Trust me. It's a pain to make the orb circular, but in the end, we really wanted it to be something unique that has never been out there before. Make it very recognizable.
00:09:25.890 - 00:09:44.674, Speaker C: And as you can see, it actually has angle to it. It's a small symbol. It's the angle of the Earth, 23.5 degrees. We really care about making this clear. We intend to really expand the scope of this and bring this beyond crypto. Nerds like us, really bring it out to the world onboard.
00:09:44.674 - 00:10:20.458, Speaker C: 1 billion plus people to crypto and then the rest. What we can see here is like cooling to get all of the heat out, speakers and slot for the exchangeable battery. And then up next, we have the mainboard. So this is where a bunch of really vital functions live. We have like capacitors for the illumination. We'll get into the optics in a second. We've audio amplifiers, a connector for the front unit up here.
00:10:20.458 - 00:10:55.634, Speaker C: So other PCBs driver for the liquid lens is actually really cool. Autofocus, we'll also get to that in a second. We have a microcontroller controlling most of the periphery like cameras, LEDs powering up the device, et cetera. SIM card slot and then an SSD. It's really important to state here that per default, no images ever leave the device unless users opt into backing up their biometric data. So it's extremely privacy preserving. And of course, it's encrypted.
00:10:55.634 - 00:11:31.010, Speaker C: On the other side we have like connector for the liquid lens. Autofocus catches that in a second. GPS for fraud, monitoring connector for the main infrared camera and then an LTE module down here. Up here we also have WiFi wait to make it really easy to connect. Power electronics for the front unit. Battery connector down here. And then very importantly in here slides the brain of the orb.
00:11:31.010 - 00:11:55.490, Speaker C: This is really where all the magic happens. Let me see. So Nvidia jetson. It's an incredibly powerful system on a module. It runs a custom Linux distribution. Main program is written in rust and supports multiple camera streams. It's incredibly powerful, which makes it very, very flexible.
00:11:55.490 - 00:12:26.210, Speaker C: The reason why we actually need it to be very powerful is that a bunch of neural networks are actually running in parallel in real time on this tiny chip to make sure that all of the processing can happen locally. And we do not need to upload images ever. Everything can stay on this device. Your iris gets converted to an iris code. All of the images are deleted and only the iris code leaves the device for verification purposes.
00:12:28.710 - 00:12:29.506, Speaker A: Cool.
00:12:29.688 - 00:12:46.140, Speaker C: So the Jetson the heart slides in here into the mainboard. See, let's get it in. There we go. And then we actually assemble it here into the mainframe, into the cooling to get all of the heat out.
00:12:46.910 - 00:12:47.980, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:12:48.990 - 00:12:53.050, Speaker C: There we go. That's the first part of the assembly.
00:12:53.790 - 00:12:57.120, Speaker B: Let's move on. So.
00:12:58.930 - 00:13:10.414, Speaker C: Next up we're going to talk about imaging. So why do we actually care so much about imaging? Tiago already talked a little bit about it. Good imaging quality is really, really important.
00:13:10.612 - 00:13:11.466, Speaker B: But why?
00:13:11.588 - 00:14:01.410, Speaker C: Let's take a step back on an aerial view. What do we care about? Has to be secure, has to be inclusive and it has to be scalable to make it really inclusive. It has never been done before on such a scale in an untrusted environment out there in the wild. So what we need to do here is really something new and to make the error rates, get the error rates really low to make sure what Tiago said before, what happens with facial recognition is after a while you confuse new people with people that have already been in the database and you falsely reject them. So, of course, not great if you want to build something that's fair and scale it to the whole world. So we really need to build something that is extremely accurate. And the baseline for that, really, the basis is being able to extract, being able to capture a lot of entropy.
00:14:01.410 - 00:14:43.630, Speaker C: And to do that, we need very high image quality, because that, in the end, is the limiting factor for all algorithms that build on top. So this is for all the math people out there. This is a bunch of distributions. And you can see for bad imaging quality, we get a lot of overlap in those distributions in the real world, which means a lot of error rates. Good image quality is what the basis is to really separate out those distributions, make sure that the same person really gets recognized as the same person, and a new person really gets recognized as a new person. But because it's biometrics, there's always some statistical part of it, so we need to make sure they're very far apart. All right, let's dive into some more of the optics.
00:14:46.850 - 00:14:47.694, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:47.892 - 00:14:48.800, Speaker C: All right.
00:14:50.610 - 00:14:50.926, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:50.948 - 00:15:33.790, Speaker C: So, we have an optical enclosure here to make the whole thing dust and waterproof, so it can really be operated all the way out there, not just in buildings, et cetera, but it can be out there in the world, no matter where it is. It's dust and waterproof. And then really, the heart of the imaging system is this baby here. So, we have a custom lens paired with an extremely capable imaging sensor. That lens, we actually had to custom manufacture it. We partnered with an external machine vision specialist in the space. Took about a year from handing over requirements to actually get it.
00:15:33.790 - 00:16:07.110, Speaker C: We tried really hard to work with off the shelf components, but in the end, nothing satisfied the requirements that we needed to make sure we can really scale this to a billion people. This lens is optimized for the infrared. So let's see if you can see this here. It's actually blue. The coating is blue, so it works best for infrared light. Has a custom liquid lens integrated. What that means is regularly for camera systems to focus on what you're imaging.
00:16:07.110 - 00:16:42.920, Speaker C: You're moving a lens with a motor, and this, of course, is not the most durable solution, not the fastest solution. And we really want to make sure that orbs are extremely reliable, can be out there, and don't immediately die if they fall from, like, 5 CM. So we took something that is extremely robust. It's like a membrane. There's liquid oil in it. It's incredibly fast and durable. This whole thing then assembles together like this, and it slides in here in the back of the optical enclosure, just like that.
00:16:46.410 - 00:16:50.534, Speaker B: All right, so next part is that.
00:16:50.572 - 00:17:33.620, Speaker C: Lens actually has an incredibly narrow field of view. So you don't see, like, a whole person or something like that. What the orb really only sees is a tiny fraction of a person. So now it's like, how do you actually align someone who's trying to verify with WorldCoin for world ID? How do you actually align them with the device? So, very nontrivial task. Wrapped our heads around, like, took a while. The first thing we came up with is, okay, let's just take two separate cameras. Let's put mirrors on top that are transparent in the infrared, but a mirror in the visible light so people can hold it in front of them, can see their eyes and position them correctly this way.
00:17:33.620 - 00:18:03.470, Speaker C: It kind of worked. Was simple to build an MVP, but it was not great. It was not cost effective. The lenses are quite expensive, and then the alignment, especially for people who are wearing glasses, which is tons of people around the world, had trouble positioning themselves. So we were like, okay, damn, that's not going to work. It looks cute, but it's not the way to go. So then, for future generations, what we did is we built a 2D gimbal.
00:18:03.470 - 00:18:32.290, Speaker C: What this is basically, is we've the camera that you've seen before. It's here in the back. Then we have a static mirror, and the light reflects from there to a 2D gimbal. That 2D gimbal can be moved, as it says, in two directions via two motors. Up, down, left, right. So no matter where the user is positioned, we can just steer the lens directly. Good thing we didn't build this for the first prototype.
00:18:32.290 - 00:18:45.690, Speaker C: Was a pain to actually get this to work. But by now, the verification process is incredibly easy. You can check it out later. Takes like 10 seconds and you're done. And it doesn't matter where you are with respect to the device.
00:18:46.050 - 00:18:49.040, Speaker B: So there we are.
00:18:52.850 - 00:19:24.690, Speaker C: All right, so the 2D gimbal then slides into the let's see, into the optical enclosure like this. It's a little bit tricky. There we go. It's almost complete. What goes on top here? What goes on top is the front PCB. So what's on here is a lot of very important things. First of all, we have a visible camera.
00:19:24.690 - 00:20:08.418, Speaker C: You can compare it to your camera on your iPhone, et cetera. We use it to scan the QR code of the user's app and to guide the 2D gimbal that we've been talking about before to make sure it's actually aiming correctly. Then we have a lot of LEDs in the near infrared spectrum. So they're all around here, all of those sections. So why do we need so many LEDs? All of you have probably been at some point to, like, a photography studio, and you've seen photographers use a bunch of light. This is not for fun, but because it makes up for a lot better image quality, making sure there is no motion, blur, et cetera. At best, when you try to capture an image with your phones out there, at night, it becomes really hard to image.
00:20:08.418 - 00:20:44.606, Speaker C: So light really helps to capture high quality images. So this is why there is so many LEDs. And then last but not least, very importantly, there is a few fraud prevention sensors on there that Tiago was talking about before. We need to make sure that people are not only unique, but that they're actually also human, that they're not trying to spoof their device, et cetera. So we have a 3D camera here that makes sure, okay, this is not a display, et cetera. Heat camera. And then another infrared camera.
00:20:44.606 - 00:21:05.660, Speaker C: Very importantly, again, here is like, all of those images do not leave the device. They're only processed locally unless users choose to back them up. All right, this then goes on top of here. And we have a fully assembled optical unit here.
00:21:08.030 - 00:21:08.874, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:21:08.992 - 00:21:12.246, Speaker C: And then we marry this with the rest of the orb.
00:21:12.358 - 00:21:17.502, Speaker B: It slides in here just like that. Let's see.
00:21:17.636 - 00:21:19.040, Speaker C: This is a little bit.
00:21:20.930 - 00:21:21.870, Speaker B: Moved.
00:21:24.450 - 00:21:26.766, Speaker C: No, does not want to.
00:21:26.788 - 00:21:27.840, Speaker B: Oh, that's why.
00:21:29.350 - 00:22:01.046, Speaker C: There we go. And that's it. We're almost done. And then as the next part, one thing that's missing is a spectral filter. So, we've been talking about that the orb images in the near infrared spectrum. What that means is there are different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and only an extremely narrow part of that is what we, as humans, can see with our eyes. This is what we call the visible spectrum.
00:22:01.046 - 00:22:40.294, Speaker C: It's here, this tiny bump in the middle. And then the camera can actually see quite a bit more of the electromagnetic spectrum, quite a bit more of the light. And we really want to make sure that no visible light gets into the imaging process because it disturbs the imaging process. What we need to do is we create a lab environment out there in the world, no matter where the orb is. And that's actually a really hard part. And to do that, we separate out a very large part of the spectrum of sunlight by using this filter. In the visible spectrum, it's black.
00:22:40.294 - 00:23:02.298, Speaker C: That's why you guys perceive it as black. It's nontransmissive, but it's actually transparent, like a window. In the near infrared spectrum, we just can't see it because as we said before, humans can't see that part of the spectrum. And it goes just on top of here, and it seals the optical unit for it to become dust and waterproof.
00:23:02.474 - 00:23:05.040, Speaker B: So we're almost done.
00:23:07.570 - 00:23:33.890, Speaker C: The only part that's missing is a battery to power the orb. So in the beginning, we started with integrated batteries. We just took like, RC car batteries, put them in. It was quick and dirty solution. It worked, but it wasn't great because it didn't last for a full day. However, the advantage was like, you don't need certification. You don't need all of those fun things, but you can actually just test things out, get out in the wild, talk to people, et cetera.
00:23:33.890 - 00:24:13.400, Speaker C: But eventually we realized, okay, we really need the orb to be able to run all day to get to 1 billion people. We can't put it to charge for 3 hours and then get back. So we had to build a custom exchangeable battery. Fun fact, it's built out of 18 650 cells, which are the same, that are used in a Tesla Model S. And then this battery goes in here on the bottom, and we have a fully functioning orb. Now, not exactly, because this orb doesn't work. All the cables, we've removed them to make the disassembly here, or the assembly, I should say, really easy.
00:24:13.400 - 00:24:32.742, Speaker C: However, we have one where you can still see what's inside and it actually works. You can come check it out. We have ten orbs, transparent ones, chrome ones, purple one from Egal, bunch of orbs here for the first time at a conference at a really large scale.
00:24:32.886 - 00:24:33.494, Speaker B: Ten orbs.
00:24:33.542 - 00:24:40.320, Speaker C: Come check them out. Yeah, hand it over to Tiago for what's next.
00:24:41.410 - 00:25:07.090, Speaker A: All right, super cool stuff. That's way cooler than what I'm going to talk about. All right, so just before we open up for questions, just to wrap up, what's next? First thing is we announced a few weeks ago that we're open sourcing everything that we do at WorldCoin. So we've already started. If you go on Worldcoin.org slash open Sourcingworldcoin, you can read a blog post and already see parts of the protocol that are live. And there is a roadmap to open source everything, including the hardware.
00:25:07.090 - 00:25:44.766, Speaker A: We were hoping to have the hardware ready here by the conference. Everything on our side is ready to open source it. The tricky thing with open sourcing hardware is the licensing, because it's actually very important that we make sure that the hardware is not misused. And so we're working with leading Open sourcing advocates on a new type of custom license that we will then also open source so that we can put the hardware out there, be very transparent about what we're doing, let the community contribute, but limit or remove the amount of damage. Putting this out to the world can be right. So that is super exciting. The rest of the WorldCoin stack is also being open source.
00:25:44.766 - 00:26:24.106, Speaker A: You can see the timeline for that on the blog post next. We have been testing the orbs along with the entire WorldCoin project in over 26 countries or something like this. At this point, this is the first time we're coming to the US. Not the entire project is being launched in the US, but at least the or verification is. And so what we found in the field is that each of these orbs is doing between 301,000 verifications per week, which is super, super cool. And so what this means is that in the last few months, we've done over 600,000 verifications around the world with just under 30 orbs on the field. Now, these orbs were super janky.
00:26:24.106 - 00:27:01.334, Speaker A: We built them in a lab by hand and we had very few of them. So we were constantly moving them around the world to figure out how to operate in different parts. In the hot and in the cold, in the sun and in the snow, in rich countries and in developing countries like Mexico where I'm from. And so it's been a lot of fun getting to see all of this. Now the good news is that while we did a lot of verifications with 30 orbs, now we have a really new badass factory. And so for the first time last month, we did our first batch of orbs that actually came out from the factory. And this was about 250 orbs.
00:27:01.334 - 00:27:30.674, Speaker A: So all of the orbs that you're seeing here at the conference come from that. Now this gives us the ability to now actually produce hundreds of orbs per month and pretty soon thousands of orbs per month. And so you will see us scale our operations between now and the end of the year significantly, which is very exciting to get everyone their World ID. The second to last thing that we're working on is we're obviously always thinking about what's next. You've seen this is the fifth major generation of the Orb. We're obviously thinking about what's next. Both from the user experience side of things.
00:27:30.674 - 00:27:52.060, Speaker A: We've been playing around with using light feedback instead of voice. The orb speaks today. If you've been at the conference, you can see that in the noise environment, it's actually a pain in the ass. And so we've been playing around a lot with that. We've been playing with colors. We have a prototype of a white Orb in the booth if you want to check it out. And then also we're already starting to do some long term thinking of alternative form factors, but that will probably take a while.
00:27:52.060 - 00:28:31.894, Speaker A: Then the last thing that is coming out regarding to the Orb is as if you heard the conference yesterday, this weekend released an SDK where any developer can reuse the World ID verification that we issued to users. This means that just as we WorldCoin have been using World ID outside the US to decide hey, is this a real person? And have they claimed WorldCoin before? Now any developer around the world can, using the same serialized proofs in a super private way, verify any action. So this can be, hey, I'm a real person and I've never voted on this poll before. Hey, I'm a real person. I've never claimed this NFT before. Hey, I'm a real person and I've never joined this discord before. So I know that a bunch of you are hacking with this.
00:28:31.894 - 00:29:12.478, Speaker A: Super excited to see what you and so that's pretty much it. We want to give a huge shout out to a couple of open source projects that we use to make all of this happen. And then also we are hiring. Very aggressively across the company, obviously for hardware firmware in the Orb, the AI systems that power all of these and then all of the product stack, right? Solidity engineers, product designers, both for the hardware and for the software. Basically, if you can think it, we're hiring for it community as well. So that's pretty much it that's the orph the Orb helps us verify people and issue them a world ID to build civil resistance at scale. It is private, it is meant to be private, it is meant to be inclusive and it is meant to be scalable.
00:29:12.478 - 00:29:51.470, Speaker A: The hardware, as you saw from Sandra is pretty badass engineering and then all of this is married with zero knowledge proves for even more privacy that you can read on the website. And so with that we have like ten minutes or so, so we wanted to just leave a bunch of time for questions because we know there's probably a ton. So yeah, that's it. So any questions? Don't be shy, bring your hot takes. Yes. Pink orb soon. PM.
00:29:53.510 - 00:30:11.814, Speaker B: Yes, there's a company. Do you have any plans to help people? No.
00:30:11.932 - 00:30:46.002, Speaker A: So the difference between Clear and WorldCoin and specifically the Orb is that Clear is meant to reidentify people. It's meant to say hey, I'm Tiago, I'm about to board this plane, make sure that I am still the person that I was two weeks ago. As you heard, one of the pros but also cons of our approach is that we cannot uniquely identify people and that is by design. We do not want to be able to reidentify people randomly. What you can do with the SDK, which is what we also use ourselves for our products is you can know that someone is a unique person that hasn't done something before, but you don't know which unique person that is.
00:30:46.056 - 00:30:46.274, Speaker B: Right?
00:30:46.312 - 00:30:58.040, Speaker A: And so I do not expect us to be using the hardware or the software for any use case related to those types of things. Player is an awesome company and they can do that on their own.
00:31:01.050 - 00:31:07.510, Speaker B: What else? Ideas?
00:31:09.470 - 00:31:56.806, Speaker A: So there is if you go on Worldcoin.org Ethny, there's actually a list of ideas, but in general anything where you would want to make sure that each person only does it once. So there is governance, right? You might have one person, one vote conviction voting, bunch of things like that. In DeFi you might be able to do under collateralized loaning because you can make sure that if you lend money to a person they don't pay back, they cannot just borrow money. Again, you can do obviously a lot of things in the quadratic flavoring. So quadratic funding, quadratic voting, quadratic a bunch of things where every individual, like ten individuals doing one thing is worth more than one individual doing it ten times basically there's also cool use cases around NFTs. There's a bunch of hype around soul bound NFTs.
00:31:56.806 - 00:32:19.162, Speaker A: There's a way in which with WorldCoin, you can actually make it soul bound rather than wallet bound. So there is also in Web two, as I said, we on our Discord have a Discord bot, and it's open, so you can actually install it on a Discord server. That gives users a real human role, which allows them to post on certain channels and gives them additional permissions.
00:32:19.226 - 00:32:19.550, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:19.620 - 00:32:35.442, Speaker A: So that means that for moderation purposes, if we ban them, then they cannot come back and get that role again because they already burned that one. And so there's like a ton of things, and you guys are way better to think about this than we else.
00:32:35.576 - 00:32:36.838, Speaker B: What else? What else?
00:32:37.004 - 00:33:14.382, Speaker A: Also, Miguel, can you tell me the so we as as a token for coming to the US. For the first time with the orbs, we made these beautiful pet orbs that you can adopt. So if you see an orb around and you actually get your wall ID, you can find a bunch of these around the conference and you can adopt one. You get an NFT adoption certificate and you have your own little orb. You'll probably never have one of those, so you might as well get one of these. Any last questions before we wrap up? All right, then. That's pretty much it.
00:33:14.382 - 00:33:27.746, Speaker A: If you have anything else, just look for us in the booth. We'll also be around. Definitely get your world ID. It's the first time we're in the US. I don't know when we'll have have ten orbs in the US. Again, so make the most of it. There's really cool stuff you can do with it, and it's a lot of fun to play with the orb.
00:33:27.746 - 00:33:29.060, Speaker A: All right, thank you so much. See you.
