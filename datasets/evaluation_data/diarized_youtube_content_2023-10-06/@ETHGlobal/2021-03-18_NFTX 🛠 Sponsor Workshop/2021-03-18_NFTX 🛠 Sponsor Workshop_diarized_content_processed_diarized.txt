00:00:09.770 - 00:00:54.298, Speaker A: Hi everyone. All right, so hi everyone. Welcome to the Nftx workshop with will be I'll be letting him take over in a second, but I want to remind you that if you have not done your staking yet for the event, please do it as soon as possible so that you can actually participate as a hacker. For any question you may have, please post them in the chat and Alex will review them as we go. We'll also have a little bit of time if you want to voice your question at the end and that's pretty much it. So I'll let you take it over.
00:00:54.384 - 00:00:56.330, Speaker B: Alex cool.
00:00:56.480 - 00:01:14.340, Speaker C: Hi everyone. I'm Alex Gosman, founder of Nftx, and I don't have a big presentation plan, so I'm just sort of going to wing this and if anyone has questions when I'm done, I'm happy to answer them to give you a quick overview on Nftx. For those of you that don't know.
00:01:14.950 - 00:01:17.410, Speaker B: Sorry, just a SEC. Close discord.
00:01:17.990 - 00:02:03.810, Speaker C: For those of you that don't know, nftx is an open and protocol for creating NFT index funds on Ethereum. These index funds are basically managed as vaults. So basically how the contract works is that every vault is linked to an ERC 20 token and then also an asset. And in most cases the asset is an NFT and usually an ERC 721. And then there's like a one to one correlation between these two tokens. So when you deposit one of the asset, you get to mint one of the fund token. And then this way we have funds like for instance, Punk Basic, which is backed by crypto punks.
00:02:03.810 - 00:02:53.460, Speaker C: And then we also have funds like Glyph, which is backed by Autoglyphs, and there's always this one to one correlation. And it's also possible to make targeted funds that are directly focused on specific subsets of NFTs. For example, we have a punk zombie fund which is specifically focused on zombie crypto punks. And the way that we do that right now is basically it's just like the Punk Basic fund. It's connected to the crypto punks address and it's connected to its own fund token, the punk zombie token. But then we also add a specific list of token IDs, and that's called like the Eligibility Allow list. And so you put specific token IDs and you say, these are the only ones that are ever allowed into this fund.
00:02:53.460 - 00:03:09.986, Speaker C: In the future we're hoping to add metadata links because right now, of course, it's kind of gas intensive and just kind of a pain in the butt to have to do it that way. But for now, yeah, that's the best way we can recommend in terms of our actual contracts.
00:03:10.018 - 00:03:21.100, Speaker B: Here, let me just share my screen. All right.
00:03:23.390 - 00:04:15.660, Speaker C: So in terms of the actual contracts, we've done a number of upgrades since we launched a few months ago and the actual Nftx contract is upgradable. So we have version two, version three, version four, version five, version six, and now version seven. And these have all been minor upgrades along the way. And we recommend anyone if you want to come on to our GitHub and to check that out. But we also now have some documentation, I believe, on our docs page that will help you kind of run through all this and see the interfaces. So, yeah, like I said, I don't really have a big presentation planned here, but I'm wondering, does anyone have questions.
00:04:15.730 - 00:04:20.270, Speaker B: Yet or should I keep jabbering away for a bit?
00:04:25.640 - 00:04:33.910, Speaker D: I'd be curious about a walkthrough of just like I'm reading the docs on creating a portfolio, but any pitfalls yeah, okay, for sure.
00:04:35.100 - 00:04:38.250, Speaker C: So in terms of the actual product.
00:04:42.140 - 00:05:15.190, Speaker B: How it works, you can just come to the main website. Oh, sorry, I forgot to share my screen. 1 second. I see a question here. All right, okay, cool.
00:05:21.020 - 00:05:23.176, Speaker C: All right, so yeah, I guess I'll.
00:05:23.198 - 00:05:36.160, Speaker B: Walk you guys through actually making a fund so we can see how that's done. Let me go to OpenSea. So.
00:05:38.130 - 00:05:43.140, Speaker C: Let'S do a squiggle fund. Even though I've already made one. We can do another one here and.
00:05:43.510 - 00:05:47.810, Speaker B: Just so everyone knows what's happening. So I have a squiggle.
00:05:49.510 - 00:05:57.206, Speaker C: So first of all, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to this contract address and check out the contract. I'm pretty sure it's 721.
00:05:57.308 - 00:06:00.200, Speaker B: I'll just make sure yeah, it is.
00:06:01.050 - 00:06:04.326, Speaker C: And then I go to Nftx, I.
00:06:04.348 - 00:06:11.130, Speaker B: Will get our contract address, proxy.
00:06:15.290 - 00:06:23.626, Speaker C: So you can make funds in the front end, but I will show you how to do it through ether scan just.
00:06:23.648 - 00:06:26.060, Speaker B: Since that kind of shows how it's actually working.
00:06:26.670 - 00:06:49.470, Speaker C: So it runs as a proxy. So right now you'll go to write as proxy and then there's two create vault functions. The first one has been deprecated. The first one has three parameters. The second one should have four parameters. The second one is the one that we're using nowadays. So for this fund, I would name it Squiggle.
00:06:49.630 - 00:06:53.860, Speaker B: Let's say two and then squiggle two.
00:06:54.390 - 00:06:57.638, Speaker C: For the asset address, I am going.
00:06:57.644 - 00:07:21.250, Speaker B: To put this contract address, which is the art blocks contract. One thing actually, sorry, I'm just going to check something because there's another art blocks contract as well. Let me see. Ringer.
00:07:44.960 - 00:07:45.710, Speaker C: It.
00:07:49.200 - 00:07:50.590, Speaker B: Sorry, 1 second.
00:07:55.840 - 00:07:59.460, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. That's what I thought. There's two or different art blocks contracts.
00:07:59.560 - 00:08:02.576, Speaker B: So no worries. Okay, this is the one we want to use.
00:08:02.758 - 00:08:04.224, Speaker C: So what we do is we take.
00:08:04.262 - 00:08:13.844, Speaker B: That asset address and then we go back to ether scan right here. Asset address here we're going to put.
00:08:13.882 - 00:08:37.710, Speaker C: False D two vaults are so we only have one D two vault right now, and that's the Punk vault. And basically that's like a more complex vault, which is like an index fund and it runs on balancer and combines multiple tokens into one. We have some more information on our docs about that and feel free to ask us, but for most people, I imagine you'd put false here.
00:08:38.400 - 00:09:29.220, Speaker B: Most of our vaults are D one and then connect. So then I'm going to make that super expensive. Then the next part, which is a little tough, is figuring out which vault ID it is.
00:09:29.590 - 00:09:31.766, Speaker C: We have another contract called Xdore and.
00:09:31.788 - 00:09:53.786, Speaker B: That basically stores all the contract data, like the state. So you can go to that one and you click on events and it will show that just now a vault was created, new vault added, and it's vault 54. So we'll just remember that then over here.
00:09:53.968 - 00:10:14.274, Speaker C: So we go back to the squiggle that I originally wanted to start to put in the vault in. So at this point, the vault has been created and it's in a managed state right now and we'll finalize it in a second. And it takes a second to show up on the front end, but well, not a second, it takes about ten minutes. So that'll show up there in a little bit. And the way that we would get.
00:10:14.312 - 00:10:20.694, Speaker B: To that is we would just go right now. Last fund, click on one of these.
00:10:20.812 - 00:10:23.830, Speaker C: That's 47. I think we said this one is 54.
00:10:23.980 - 00:10:26.738, Speaker B: So we go 54 here and it's.
00:10:26.754 - 00:10:28.150, Speaker C: Not going to show up quite yet.
00:10:28.300 - 00:10:30.600, Speaker B: But that's where we'll be in a second.
00:10:31.130 - 00:10:32.986, Speaker C: The next step then is we want.
00:10:33.008 - 00:10:34.570, Speaker B: To mint an item.
00:10:34.910 - 00:10:38.010, Speaker C: Normally again, we could do this through the front end, but that's going to take ten minutes.
00:10:38.080 - 00:10:40.314, Speaker B: So what we'll do is we figure.
00:10:40.352 - 00:10:43.342, Speaker C: Out what the Token ID is here, 4461.
00:10:43.476 - 00:10:44.720, Speaker B: Copy that.
00:10:45.330 - 00:10:46.986, Speaker C: Then we go to this art blocks.
00:10:47.018 - 00:11:38.768, Speaker B: Contract, write contract, and we're going to approve token ID 4461 to the Nftx proxy contract here and connect. All right, so that's approved. Now we're going to mint it.
00:11:38.934 - 00:11:45.076, Speaker C: Here's the mint function. So the first parameter is how much ether we're sending, and that'll just be.
00:11:45.098 - 00:11:54.852, Speaker B: Zero vault ID 54, NFT IDs. So we had that a second ago, 4461.
00:11:54.906 - 00:11:56.312, Speaker C: And we put that around with square.
00:11:56.366 - 00:12:19.870, Speaker B: Brackets just because it's an array. And then the D two amount is also zero because this is not a D Two fund. And then we write super expensive and we can check if this is up yet. I doubt.
00:12:25.360 - 00:12:26.110, Speaker C: It.
00:12:36.030 - 00:12:50.314, Speaker B: Okie doke. So that went through. That should show up on the events as well. So on the Xdor event, yeah, it says holdings added.
00:12:50.442 - 00:13:09.026, Speaker C: So basically it says that this item 4461 has been added to the vault 54 and we're still the manager. So what it means when you're the manager is you have some abilities to just change certain things, like fees and stuff. So normally after the fund is set.
00:13:09.048 - 00:13:15.240, Speaker B: Up, the best thing to do is to finalize it and you just go to finalize vault 54.
00:13:23.500 - 00:13:24.296, Speaker C: And that just.
00:13:24.318 - 00:13:26.010, Speaker B: Gives up your management control.
00:13:29.180 - 00:14:16.104, Speaker C: Now, if we had wanted to add a specific allow list or eligibilities we would have done that before we gave up finalization. And what you would do then is there's a function called Negate set Negate eligibility. So when the eligibility is Negated, it acts as a deny list and when it's not Negated, it acts as an allow list. When the vault is created, it gets automatically set to true, which means it is Negated. And that way, since the list is empty, it means that all token IDs are allowable. But yeah, if you wanted to so if we had been making like the punk zombie fund, what we would have done is after we made the vault, we would have gone to Set Negate eligibility, we would have set that to false and then we would have gone.
00:14:16.142 - 00:14:19.928, Speaker B: To Set is eligible, we would have put 54.
00:14:20.094 - 00:14:22.076, Speaker C: And then here you'd put each one.
00:14:22.098 - 00:14:24.668, Speaker B: Of your token IDs, whatever they are.
00:14:24.754 - 00:14:29.820, Speaker C: And then you'd set that to true and then you'd do that before you finalize.
00:14:30.640 - 00:14:38.304, Speaker B: Okay, so that's finalized. Let's see, hopefully it's up. No it'll probably be a bit longer.
00:14:38.502 - 00:14:42.880, Speaker C: But yeah, the next thing you could do now is if you want to redeem an item.
00:14:44.740 - 00:14:53.860, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure, let me check. I'm pretty sure I will have one token of this now.
00:14:53.930 - 00:14:58.324, Speaker C: So even though the front end is not up yet, we can still check some of this data.
00:14:58.442 - 00:15:00.580, Speaker B: So what I'll do, the X token.
00:15:00.660 - 00:15:06.584, Speaker C: Is what we call like the fun token, the ERC, 20. So here, if we check at that.
00:15:06.622 - 00:15:11.420, Speaker B: Event when the vault was created, this is the token that it created.
00:15:12.400 - 00:15:14.590, Speaker C: And see, it's called Squiggle two.
00:15:18.320 - 00:15:20.796, Speaker B: If I check this token, if I.
00:15:20.818 - 00:15:24.850, Speaker C: Check holders see a quantity of one.
00:15:25.380 - 00:15:29.424, Speaker B: And then that's me. So that's me.
00:15:29.462 - 00:15:32.290, Speaker C: I'm the only holder with a quantity of one right now.
00:15:33.220 - 00:15:43.636, Speaker B: So then check one more time. Thought we had it. Okay, I'll do it through here. So then what I will do if.
00:15:43.658 - 00:15:44.964, Speaker C: I want to redeem an item, first.
00:15:45.002 - 00:15:57.030, Speaker B: I have to approve this right contract prove.
00:16:01.770 - 00:16:03.974, Speaker C: So first thing I have to do.
00:16:04.012 - 00:16:11.430, Speaker B: Is I'm going to prove sending this over here, sender note.
00:16:14.890 - 00:16:34.400, Speaker C: And it.
00:16:49.030 - 00:17:05.698, Speaker B: I'll get this one queued up. So the redeem is pretty straightforward. Put zero for the Ether vault ID 54. The amount is just one because that's.
00:17:05.714 - 00:17:08.390, Speaker C: Like the amount of NFTs that we're going to be redeeming.
00:17:11.370 - 00:17:13.414, Speaker B: It's approved, so I'm going to send.
00:17:13.452 - 00:17:18.934, Speaker C: That and then obviously when I redeem this, it's going to give me the only item which is in the vault.
00:17:18.982 - 00:17:19.690, Speaker B: Right now.
00:17:19.840 - 00:17:35.722, Speaker C: Normally when items get picked during the redemption, always it is a random selection. But in this case, since there's only one item, it will obviously be that one. And then once that goes through again, you can check that in the Xdor.
00:17:35.786 - 00:17:40.926, Speaker B: Contract on the event. And I doubt it's up yet, but.
00:17:40.948 - 00:17:46.610, Speaker C: Yeah, the idea is after like ten minutes or maybe a little bit longer, the fund will show up here and.
00:17:46.760 - 00:17:51.160, Speaker B: You can get to it by typing in that specific token or specific vault ID.
00:17:52.490 - 00:17:57.206, Speaker C: Okay, so I think that sort of gives a run through and ate up.
00:17:57.228 - 00:18:00.280, Speaker B: A bit more time. Let me see if anyone has questions.
00:18:04.750 - 00:18:09.130, Speaker A: Yeah, please feel free to ask any question. Thank you for your presentation.
00:18:09.550 - 00:18:15.454, Speaker C: Sorry if that was put anyone to no, no thanks.
00:18:15.572 - 00:18:23.760, Speaker A: Is there anyone who has more questions on this? Please write them in the comments or feel free to take the mic.
00:18:24.210 - 00:19:13.018, Speaker C: So yeah, to answer Kiba here, anyone's able to create an NFT fund? One thing that's kind of cool that some people might want to explore. So the idea of the managed vault kind of came from balancer. When you create a balancer pool, at first there's like a manager and that person kind of gives up management. So then we had a similar idea that we would do the same thing. The cool thing with that model is that it's actually possible to transfer management to another smart contract. And so that's kind of how balancer smart pools work, is that you create a pool and you're the manager, but instead of saying, you know what, I'll just give up management, you say, I'm going to make this other smart contract manager. And then all of a sudden you have what's, like basically a smart pool because you've given this other contract privilege.
00:19:13.018 - 00:19:17.998, Speaker C: So yeah, if that's something that somebody wanted to work on for Nftx, no one's done it yet, but it could.
00:19:18.004 - 00:19:20.340, Speaker B: Be a cool idea. Sorry, I just thought of that.
00:19:20.870 - 00:19:24.222, Speaker C: But yeah, thank you everyone for the compliments.
00:19:24.366 - 00:19:26.340, Speaker B: I think that's most of the questions.
00:19:27.910 - 00:19:29.060, Speaker C: Anything else?
00:19:29.930 - 00:19:35.430, Speaker D: Quick question, is it one NFT contract per vault?
00:19:36.090 - 00:19:40.198, Speaker C: It is, yeah. And that's something we would like to change in the future.
00:19:40.284 - 00:19:41.878, Speaker B: But yeah, it's just one for now.
00:19:41.964 - 00:19:46.486, Speaker D: Do you mint them directly into the vault or can you mint them first and then transfer them into the vault?
00:19:46.678 - 00:20:35.154, Speaker C: No, you mint them directly. Although there is another function called a Mint request. Right now we have these funds which are their targeted funds, but some of them are really big. So the CryptoKitties generation zero fund, for instance, there's like 40,000 generation zero kitties, which is way too much for us to add to the actual list and we don't have metadata yet. So there is a function called Request Mint. And basically what someone can do is they come to the vault and they realize that the token ID that they want to mint, it hasn't been added yet, but that it should be allowed so that they can request the mint. And that kind of like locks up their kitty and then our dao comes along and says, okay, yeah, we approve this Mint.
00:20:35.154 - 00:20:41.866, Speaker C: And then that NFT goes into the vault and they get their token. It's kind of a cumbersome mechanism that we're hoping to move away from, but.
00:20:41.888 - 00:20:44.090, Speaker B: That is one other feature that we still have.
00:20:44.240 - 00:20:48.298, Speaker D: Is it minting a new one or is it like locking the old one in the vault?
00:20:48.474 - 00:21:21.880, Speaker C: So it's just kind of doing the first half of the mint operation. So a mint is kind of two parts. It's like I give my NFT and I get the token back. So if someone wants to come along and they want to mint but their token hasn't been allowed yet because it's like a really big vault, they can just do the first half and basically say, here, I'll give you the kitty and then give me my token back when you approve it. And if it doesn't get approved, then they just get their NFT back. It's really not a feature that I recommend most people use. We're hoping to move away from it.
00:21:24.810 - 00:21:29.722, Speaker D: So we should make a new NFT contract and mint tokens and mint new NFTs directly into a new fund.
00:21:29.776 - 00:21:34.960, Speaker C: Is that yeah, yeah, no it's best to create new vaults and to actually.
00:21:35.570 - 00:21:47.410, Speaker B: Send the items in and get the tokens. Some other questions here.
00:21:50.260 - 00:22:38.640, Speaker C: Yeah, so we are actually hoping to move more into like so right now funds are basically like a holder product for people that want exposure. But we are realizing that a lot of people would like to create curated funds. Sort of, sort of like an influencer could come along and say, hey, I'd like to make a fund of all my favorite NFTs. So we are hoping to move in that direction more. Again, it's not something that we really have ready yet and we're kind of in the middle of transferring to a version two. But yeah, the best ways that people could kind of extend the protocol right now would be to try and do like a smart vault type thing probably by proxying management to another contract or there's also really cool things you can do with lending markets with NFTs and NFT tokens.
00:22:39.540 - 00:22:40.408, Speaker B: Oracle.
00:22:40.524 - 00:22:47.316, Speaker C: Yeah, there's definitely cool things you could do as well with hooking up to.
00:22:47.338 - 00:22:50.550, Speaker B: Oracles that we haven't actually tried yet.
00:22:54.140 - 00:23:00.856, Speaker C: Do we need a safety module? No, I don't think we do. We're always fully backed so there shouldn't.
00:23:00.888 - 00:23:05.630, Speaker B: Be any problem like that unless we try and extend our reserves more in the future.
00:23:14.240 - 00:24:02.856, Speaker C: So yeah, things that would be cool. A lending market is something that I've always really liked the idea of. So one thing that's really cool about our funds, like the Punk Basic fund, is that it can be lent to any. So if I have a crypto punk and I want to get a Punk Basic loan, what I could do is I can lock up my crypto punk and I can get one Punk Basic in return. We don't have that yet, but I've always thought that would be like a really cool use case because basically it's perfect collateral, right? If I lock up a crypto punk, that crypto punk can always be used to mint one punk basic no matter what. It's just that I want the liquidity of the punk basic. So it'd be cool if someone right now, if I want a punk basic, I actually have to give ownership of my crypto punk away.
00:24:02.856 - 00:24:34.244, Speaker C: But I've always thought that someone could build a protocol on top of Nftx basically that says, hey, what if you don't want to give your crypto punk away? What if you want to keep it sort of like keeping your ETH when you make dai, that's more of like a lending use case and that's something that could happen on top and then it kind of becomes like a pawn shop, right? You can come here with your NFTs and you can say, hey, hold on to my NFTs, I'd like to get some liquidity. You pay a small fee type of thing. Yeah, it's one use case. I've always really hoped that someone would go after, but it's not super easy.
00:24:34.282 - 00:24:39.188, Speaker B: To do in a weekend, but that would be cool. Hey, Alex.
00:24:39.364 - 00:24:40.090, Speaker C: Hi.
00:24:40.460 - 00:25:28.276, Speaker E: So on that particular point, are there any mechanisms for separating? Sort of if you're going to do a lending scenario like that, there's the concept of holding the title to an object, which means you're the account or contract. That can change ownership, which is one thing, and then control of the asset, which is the ability to, say, set the resolver for an ENS domain or maybe breed a cryptokd. Although I'm not too sure how that works. But this idea of sort of having title and then which is ultimate control versus sort of possession, which is immediate control. Is there anything like that or is there a way to log into a game like God's unchanged? If the tokens owned by a smart contract and you want to log in.
00:25:28.298 - 00:26:19.350, Speaker C: To prove you own that item, there's nothing that I know of yet that does that and there's nothing that we have in our protocol, but it's definitely something that we're really interested in. And another reason is just because we see NFTs as being becoming productive assets. Right? So we have an axe mystic vault and we would really like it in the future if we could say, hey, let's put somebody in charge of this vault and put those axes to use, right? Get them breeding, get them battling, they'd still be in the vault. If someone had an Axe Mystic token, they would still have a right to one mystic axe at any point. But yeah, in the meantime we could put someone in charge of kind of managing them without actually having ownership. And I think that's kind of what you're getting at. So it's not something that we have yet.
00:26:19.350 - 00:27:10.264, Speaker C: I think it's a really cool concept. Another thing I'll just throw out here, I'll put out there as well, and I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I'll say it anyways is that as much as I'd love people to build onto nftx since we are kind of in the middle of, like, a version one to a version two. It could just make sense for some of you hackers to literally just look at our contract. The basic functionality is very simple. You have this vault, you keep track of the NFTs, and you keep track of the balances, and the errors are 20s. If people wanted to fork our original contract, just keep the really basic functionality, but then start adding new cool features in there, like having a vault manager or something like that, I think that would be really cool. It's not something that we could leverage right away, but it's great having MVPs like that.
00:27:10.264 - 00:27:11.816, Speaker C: So, yeah, it's something to consider if.
00:27:11.838 - 00:27:13.850, Speaker B: People are thinking about that sort of thing.
00:27:15.340 - 00:27:16.840, Speaker A: Thank you, Alex.
00:27:19.420 - 00:27:21.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I hope that was all right.
00:27:21.500 - 00:27:54.240, Speaker A: I want to cut the question. Yeah. Thank you, everybody. We're running a bit overtime, so a big thank you for this presentation and all the questions that came in. If you do want to stay in touch with Nftx or have more questions for Alex, please find him in the sponsor channel that you have access to if you're part of this hackathon in our Discord channel. And we will all see you on Discord.
00:27:54.740 - 00:27:56.130, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you so much.
00:27:56.580 - 00:27:58.310, Speaker B: Pleasure. It.
