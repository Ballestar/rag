00:00:06.170 - 00:00:25.046, Speaker A: Hey everyone, welcome. We have Terence Riley here from Alta who's going to give a session on interactive arts. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to pop them in the chat and we can take them over Discord as well.
00:00:25.108 - 00:00:27.640, Speaker B: Thanks. Cool.
00:00:28.250 - 00:00:29.206, Speaker C: I get going.
00:00:29.308 - 00:00:51.658, Speaker D: Okay. Right, so hi, guys. Hi everyone. My name is Ten Swelly. I'm co founder and CEO of Ulta. I've got a background in three character animation and love to create interactive forest. Please note just get ahead of this.
00:00:51.658 - 00:01:24.470, Speaker D: I'm not a developer. My co founder couldn't be here today to help out. But he's going to be available in discord. So if any tech questions, please direct him there. So today we're going to be talking about Dynamic NFTs. So during the workshop, I'm going to do a brief demo of working of an example. We've prepared it's on our Mumbai Ulta testnet.
00:01:24.470 - 00:02:10.470, Speaker D: Then we're going to jump through some of that code of that example. And then you'll be able to grab that example actually on our GitHub. Afterwards, we welcome you to create your own Dynamic NFT experiments on our testnet website. So the focus of today's workshop is all about code as a creative medium. By the end of this workshop, we hope to inspire you to use your coding skills in new creative ways. So thanks to our and E Global for inviting us to do this. So our smart contracts are built on top of smart contracts.
00:02:10.970 - 00:02:14.806, Speaker E: We extended them with additional features to.
00:02:14.828 - 00:02:36.990, Speaker D: Give creators who code more control with our type of art. So here's an example we're going to be looking at truth today. This is on Mumbai.
00:02:41.170 - 00:02:42.400, Speaker B: This is a project.
00:02:44.130 - 00:02:47.300, Speaker D: The idea of the Dysdynamic NFT is.
00:02:47.830 - 00:02:50.254, Speaker E: To enable collectors to get different interactive.
00:02:50.302 - 00:03:40.210, Speaker D: Controls depending on their additions, depending on when they purchase or mint that NFT during the Dutch auction. Okay, so let me show you, for example. So here's the project. There is four of these artworks minted. The first one and the second one are actually minted in the first drop time. So if I just go into edition one, you'll notice there's tree interactive controls here where you can do some basic stuff. This is, by the way, a three GS scene.
00:03:40.210 - 00:03:48.734, Speaker D: Then if I go over here to that project and I look at edition.
00:03:48.782 - 00:03:54.760, Speaker B: Number three, I will see two controls. Okay.
00:03:57.530 - 00:03:58.280, Speaker C: Okay.
00:03:59.530 - 00:04:09.978, Speaker D: And then the last we've not just done tree. I'll just refresh that. If I go to this is ID token four. You've got one control.
00:04:10.144 - 00:04:10.860, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:11.710 - 00:04:20.446, Speaker D: So additionally, there's also one other thing where you've got the properties of the.
00:04:20.548 - 00:04:23.486, Speaker B: Aesthetic can change as well.
00:04:23.668 - 00:04:47.906, Speaker D: For example, there's more boxes on this one. In this there's less boxes. And this one there's even less. There's the working example Zona Mumbai. And just wanted to start off with that. So we will have this code up on GitHub for you to grab and explore and create Dynamic NFTs.
00:04:47.938 - 00:04:50.806, Speaker B: There so first of all, I just.
00:04:50.828 - 00:04:51.830, Speaker D: Wanted to introduce.
00:04:53.770 - 00:04:54.538, Speaker B: Know Altar is a.
00:04:54.544 - 00:05:19.378, Speaker D: Platform for NFT experiences. It's for people who love to create interactive art, interactive design, interactive music, web games, all that sort of stuff. If you think of Google Chrome experiments or like Fior or AOR immersive Web as me, that's what we're all about. You can check out by the way.
00:05:19.544 - 00:05:26.398, Speaker B: Oldart.Com for a range of NFTs.
00:05:26.414 - 00:05:40.150, Speaker D: We've already got Minted, got some motion detection NFPs. We've got web VR, NFPs got treaty interactive, NFTs lots of different types.
00:05:41.050 - 00:05:45.446, Speaker B: But today, this workshop we're going to.
00:05:45.468 - 00:06:30.006, Speaker D: Talk about dynamic NFTs. To get started on that, we have to first know a bit about the Projects feature we've built and the subgraph. So what are projects on Ulta? Our new feature is called Projects. A project is a smart contract which basically manages additions. Dynamic NFTs are NFTs that can dynamically change based on events that happen on the blockchain. We built an older subgraph using the.
00:06:30.028 - 00:06:33.334, Speaker B: Graph Protocol for creators to represent blockchain.
00:06:33.382 - 00:06:43.434, Speaker D: Events in their artworks. So when the state of the blockchain changes, the artwork changes like shown. And then using Coder's creative medium with.
00:06:43.472 - 00:06:46.254, Speaker B: The oldest subgraph, creators can choose which.
00:06:46.292 - 00:06:52.160, Speaker D: Events their NFT query and how exactly it affects it. So there's ultimate control.
00:06:55.330 - 00:06:56.926, Speaker E: There's a few properties that we can.
00:06:56.948 - 00:07:21.400, Speaker D: Use in the projects so we can query data and fetch data back to the projects. Those are addition number, commonly known as a token ID, seed number seed ID and a project smart contract address. For each project there's a smart contract so that's known as a Project ID.
00:07:23.290 - 00:07:25.094, Speaker E: The key takeaway is that these unique.
00:07:25.142 - 00:07:42.960, Speaker D: Properties are added to the URL so they can be rendered and viewed in a browser. And by reading the URL, additions can become dynamic. So let me show you.
00:07:44.690 - 00:07:48.322, Speaker B: A local artwork here.
00:07:48.456 - 00:08:30.560, Speaker D: So this is the example I showed you that you can all scrap at the end. So, as mentioned before, this project is this specific project queries the different price drops in its Dutch auction. So collectors get different interactive controls based on when they mint during that during this project's Dutch auction. So it's going to run through briefly some of the files here that makes up this example. So we've got start off with.
00:08:32.690 - 00:08:33.146, Speaker C: We'Re.
00:08:33.178 - 00:09:44.370, Speaker D: Importing three GS, which is a 3D interactive library. And then we're running some sorry, running the URL search parameters from this helper JS file. Then we're getting the project data from the graph through the query JS file. And then here, for example, we've got some the logic of the subgraph logic basically. So what we're really querying here is the meat of it. Like querying the Dutch auction, drop the number of price drops and the remaining okay, now we've also got things. So because the project ID is not created until you actually create the NFT on Alta, we have got in this example for you some mock data we can bring in that's coming in from datajs.
00:09:45.130 - 00:09:53.830, Speaker B: In here you've got lots of data you can pull into your main JS file.
00:09:53.990 - 00:10:12.030, Speaker D: For example, we're bringing in data all around the Dutch auction drop. So in here, for example, this is a local example so I can query.
00:10:14.450 - 00:10:18.174, Speaker B: I can have tree controls bring in.
00:10:18.212 - 00:10:19.760, Speaker D: Here and so on.
00:10:26.700 - 00:10:27.508, Speaker C: Okay.
00:10:27.694 - 00:11:05.720, Speaker D: However, there's also another thing where you can override all these like mock data, where if there is actually an auction running on Alta, you can paste the project ID address in here and test how your NFT updates, whether it's aesthetically or controls, you can test it there. So in here we've got this is the subgraph URL in here. This is a sort of a tool.
00:11:05.790 - 00:11:08.410, Speaker E: That you can create or use to.
00:11:09.340 - 00:11:37.812, Speaker D: Query data on the blockchain. And in this example, we've got like we're creating the first ten projects on Ulta subgraph and things like the name, the total Minted, the creator and the ID and stuff like that. Over here there's a range of functions you can check out and you can.
00:11:37.946 - 00:11:41.124, Speaker B: Then bring all this data and put.
00:11:41.162 - 00:11:49.384, Speaker D: It into sort of a query JS file. Then for example, this is just getting.
00:11:49.422 - 00:11:52.808, Speaker B: The project ID, which has got everything.
00:11:52.894 - 00:12:01.112, Speaker D: In it, and the Dutch auction ID as well. So that's what we're querying here in JS.
00:12:01.176 - 00:12:01.900, Speaker B: Mainly.
00:12:13.700 - 00:12:33.540, Speaker D: Then that's like the most parts of briefly to show you. The last thing to show you is then the actual app. So, for example, anything in this folder is basically that what you're going to sip up and upload to Ulta.
00:12:34.760 - 00:12:36.740, Speaker B: And in here, the only thing that.
00:12:36.890 - 00:13:48.750, Speaker D: Might be unique is an app web manifest. This is a file you can edit to include like a screenshot image or thumbnail or extra metadata if you like. And then when you NPM start or build this, you then will bundle all your JS into this file and then you can just zip that up the app and then upload it to Altar. So basically that's the majority of our workshop. Please again direct your questions like no more technical questions to our discord NOTA. But with this example, we welcome you to create your own dynamic NFT experiments on our testnet. And just to let you know that all the creator tools such as like the upload, let me show you.
00:13:50.560 - 00:13:55.280, Speaker B: So in the beta altar arc Mumbai.
00:13:55.780 - 00:14:46.130, Speaker D: We have got upload create. And then once you create, you have auction access on our testnet. And if you do want to become a creative on Ulta for Polygon mainnet, you then have to submit an application because we're curating the people there. But please, you're welcome to go wild on using this example. Play with it, explore and please push the boundaries of NFTs because we'd like to see more interesting stuff out there and we really think coders are creative. Thank you.
00:14:53.060 - 00:14:59.520, Speaker A: Thanks Terrence, for the great workshop. And yeah, we can follow up with the questions over discord.
00:15:00.180 - 00:15:01.712, Speaker D: Brilliant. Thank you very much.
00:15:01.766 - 00:15:02.272, Speaker B: Great.
00:15:02.406 - 00:15:02.800, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:15:02.870 - 00:15:03.970, Speaker A: Have a good day.
00:15:05.140 - 00:15:05.948, Speaker D: Take care. Bye.
