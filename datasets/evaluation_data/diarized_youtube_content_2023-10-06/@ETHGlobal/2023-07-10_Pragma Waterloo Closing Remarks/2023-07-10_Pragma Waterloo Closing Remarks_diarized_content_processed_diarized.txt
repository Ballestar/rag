00:00:07.610 - 00:00:09.294, Speaker A: All right, well, that was our last.
00:00:09.332 - 00:00:13.678, Speaker B: Talk, so I'm going to quickly just say a couple of thank yous. And I want to thank, first of.
00:00:13.684 - 00:00:18.318, Speaker C: All, all of you, for being in this room and intently listening to all.
00:00:18.324 - 00:00:19.658, Speaker D: Of our amazing speakers.
00:00:19.834 - 00:00:21.614, Speaker B: We didn't do questions intentionally this time.
00:00:21.652 - 00:00:23.006, Speaker D: Because a lot of our speakers are.
00:00:23.028 - 00:00:29.670, Speaker B: Going to be outside in the room and you get to actually walk up to them and ask your questions yourself. So we'll kind of keep that open and give all of you the opportunity.
00:00:29.740 - 00:00:34.214, Speaker C: To talk to them directly instead of standing 20ft away asking something on a mic.
00:00:34.412 - 00:00:42.726, Speaker B: I want to also quickly thank some of our partners here, WorldCoin Filecoin, Polygon and Quantstamp. They've been here and they've been kind of talking to everybody about what they're building and what you can do in.
00:00:42.748 - 00:00:43.970, Speaker C: Each of these ecosystems.
00:00:44.050 - 00:00:55.998, Speaker B: I want to give a massive shout out to the ETH Global team. They've been running all these things behind the scenes. You've kind of seen them run around behind the stage. Please give them a massive round of applause for really ensuring that today and all the next three days are going.
00:00:56.004 - 00:00:57.726, Speaker A: To go really well.
00:00:57.908 - 00:01:06.094, Speaker B: So those are some of the things I want to also take a second to tell you what's next. You've all obviously seen Pragma in Waterloo.

00:01:11.112 - 00:01:24.242, Speaker C: Here to announce the next Pragma, which I've already confirmed, and that's going to be Pragma with a new branding and Pragma with a new theme. And we're going to pilot this for the first time in Paris. It's just all going to be about the future of ethereum.
00:01:24.306 - 00:01:25.414, Speaker B: A lot of topics here were today.
00:01:25.452 - 00:01:28.406, Speaker C: About the importance of decentralization, and what.
