00:00:06.090 - 00:00:29.800, Speaker A: I want to welcome Chef Maki Scooby trooples and Rogue itachi on stage, they'll be talking about everything that means to be to be anon in this world right now and everything that they're doing in the world of DeFi. So I'll save the intro for our moderator, who will be Rogue, and I'll ask them to turn on their video and and unmute themselves and get us started. So welcome, everybody.
00:00:33.930 - 00:01:02.542, Speaker B: Great to be thank you. There we go. Now my video is looking good. What's up, my fellow Anans, Apes, Big Brains, and all the normal people out there listening. For those that don't know me, I'm Rogatachi. I'm a founding member of Young Capital an anon Dao, and just a general Djen here in the crypto and DeFi space. I want to say I'm super honored to be here to moderate this event.
00:01:02.542 - 00:02:05.182, Speaker B: Thank you again to ETH Global for letting me hop on the mic here at ETH Online, which is such an awesome event. So with me today, I have two awesome non panelists that will surely be shaping the future of France before our very eyes. First, I'd like to introduce one of my oldest friends in the space, a man who I admire not only for his talent, but his awesome personality and principles. That, of course, is Scoopy Truples. Scoopy is one of the founding members and core developers of the Protocol Alchemyx, an ingenious protocol that leverages DeFi to allow users to take out self repaying loans that can never be liquidated. One might think it to be magic, but in fact, it's the work of a brilliant team with incredible execution. The second panelist with me today is someone who has done just about as much for DeFi as anyone, in my opinion, a developer who has helped build a protocol that is innovative, ever growing, and fearless in its vision.
00:02:05.182 - 00:02:28.620, Speaker B: This is someone who the day they followed me on Twitter was the day I knew I had made it and would also need to get my act together and start tweeting things of value because smart people were reading them. I am, of course, talking about the Chef Ox Maki, co founder and advisor of Sushi Swap. I'm super excited to have the chance to chat with both of you Anans today. Welcome, guys.
00:02:30.110 - 00:02:31.580, Speaker C: It's great to be here.
00:02:32.190 - 00:02:34.346, Speaker D: Thank you for the intro.
00:02:34.528 - 00:02:38.542, Speaker C: Yeah, thank of course, of course.
00:02:38.676 - 00:03:35.714, Speaker B: So, like you both, I am a non as well, though I'm an anonygen, so not quite as glamorous as you builders. But I found that being anon has a lot of benefits, especially in terms of privacy and safety. That said, there is one problem that haunts me over and over, which is having to answer the question to the people in my life, what do you do for a living? What exactly is your job? I usually answer with some version of, like, oh, I'm in finance, or I'm a financial consultant. But the other day, a girl I was talking to was like, yeah, me too, and then started grilling me on exactly what I did. Obviously, I did the only rational thing I could at the moment, which was to turn around and sprint away. But I'm curious, what do you tell your friends, family and strangers about what you do for a living? Like, how secretive are you? Do you have a cover story? We can start with you.
00:03:35.752 - 00:04:34.260, Speaker C: Yeah, so with me on this one, very few people in my life know that I'm scoopy triples in what I'm doing. It's just my immediate family, like my wife and a couple of my close friends who I know, like IRL before I got into crypto, also know who I am. But other than that, I just have a pretty good cover story, which is that I work as a software developer, and they asked me what company and I actually was working for a DeFi protocol as a front end developer before I got into Alchemics. And so I just tell people I work for them so if they really want to know, but everyone else who doesn't know or think I work for that company thinks I work just in it.
00:04:37.190 - 00:04:46.070, Speaker B: Okay, so you do kind of say that you work in crypto. You're like, oh, well, I at least work for a front end developer for this crypto.
00:04:47.050 - 00:04:51.020, Speaker C: I just haven't told them that I left that place and started Alchemics. That's all.
00:04:53.710 - 00:04:55.180, Speaker B: Just a minor detail.
00:04:57.870 - 00:05:10.190, Speaker C: I just don't want people to know. I think for me, it's more like I just don't want people to treat me any differently. And that's why I'd like to keep it a secret.
00:05:11.730 - 00:05:31.080, Speaker B: Right, that makes sense. One of the reasons why I chose financial consultant, too, is because it seems really boring. And so I feel like people don't usually ask follow up questions and I feel like software developer, while it's not boring, it's more of like it's so general that people don't really ask follow up questions. So that makes sense.
00:05:32.090 - 00:05:32.840, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:33.770 - 00:05:35.350, Speaker B: What about you, maki?
00:05:37.290 - 00:06:35.900, Speaker D: Usually I just say I'm in finance, and if some people start to quiz me or ask, I just say that I do HFT. I mean, I read a book like Flashboys a while ago. Michael Lewis was pretty good, and I was just like, oh, yeah, there you go, HFT trading. And it is what it is, and I think everyone no one knows about it what is HFT? So they just give up straight up. Otherwise for friends and family, kind of very close friends and kind of family members, they kind of know. The problem is, and that's the thing with Scoopy that is not saying here yet is that the moment you're going to go to events or be kind of surrounded by people in crypto, your voice is docked, so it's going to be way harder to kind of camouflage or to just stay hidden. So I had to deal with this not that long ago and basically someone just told me hey, I know you.
00:06:35.900 - 00:07:14.710, Speaker D: There is not many people with the same voice that went on Laura Shin podcast. And I was like oh fuck. Actually the person was also had on so that went well. But what I found the most curious about is the same anon was saying for a living was doing absolutely nothing and I don't know, that just stuck with me. I was like oh, some people are just not even trying anymore. So that was great. But anyways, at conferences it's another topic I guess, right?
00:07:14.780 - 00:07:16.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I get that.
00:07:17.450 - 00:07:42.320, Speaker C: I'm not sure when I'm going to actually go to a conference. It's been whole corona thing and I think there was like a recent event where a lot of people ended up getting corona and it just sort of seems like be this repeating theme and I don't want to make it this far and then get it before I'm double vaxxed and all that stuff at the very end. So I'm just playing it cautious until then.
00:07:43.970 - 00:08:12.570, Speaker B: Along with the voice docs thing, I host the Goodwill Hunting podcast, goodwill Yunting Sorry podcast. And me and other youngs hop on and talk to people and we actually had on our second episode, one of our fellow youngs got voiced docs by someone who worked with him. He just got an email that said like hey, you sound really like this guy on this podcast, is that you? He was like oh crap, crap, crap.
00:08:13.070 - 00:08:13.820, Speaker C: No.
00:08:17.150 - 00:09:08.490, Speaker B: Yeah, there's not much you could do at that point. Kind of along the same vein, I often find myself like wanting to tell friends, family and even strangers what I do because I find crypto and DeFi so exciting and fascinating and I think there's so much value that other people can get in their lives from it. Yet I don't want to spend 6 hours explaining the basics of it to a boomer who will just call the scam or a stranger who will follow me home and hit me over the head with a renter or something. So do you have IRL people that you talk about crypto with who aren't really in the scene? How do you kind of balance the excitement of what you guys are building, which is so cool, and also wanting to be safe or not lose brain cells? Talking to Normies about crypto.
00:09:10.910 - 00:10:36.246, Speaker C: When I was really first getting into crypto back in 2016 and 17, I was trying to evangelicize everyone poor summer child I was at the time, and I almost had a few people get into it back in December 2017. And then the crash happened after that and the bear market, and people were just like, oh, how's your crypto doing? And kind of like laughing at me. Like in 2018 I've kind of learned not to really talk about it with many people from that because God forbid they actually fumbled in the top and then got wrecked, that would have been something I would have to live with. So I try not to talk about it with people in my everyday life too much, but a couple of my friends approach me because they know I'm into it and they want to learn more. And when people are like that, I'll talk to them and educate them, tell them, stay away from EOS and cardano. But and I have one of my friends, he's really into it and we talk about it pretty regularly. But other than that, I don't really try to mix crypto with a lot of my friends in real life because it's not like something people want to talk about all the time.
00:10:36.246 - 00:10:43.180, Speaker C: Not everyone's as obsessed with it as we are. I don't want to be the crypto guy.
00:10:47.310 - 00:10:48.890, Speaker B: What about you, maki?
00:10:51.310 - 00:11:56.430, Speaker D: I think it's kind of funny because a bunch of my friends and people I know that were asking me about crypto, I gave them a small list of things to do, like try out, like just take $500, buy, eat and just try all of these DAPs. And among these DAPs there was like dYdX. And basically everyone got a fat AirDrop not that long ago. And basically for some of them, literally for them, one of them paid all of his student loans with it and kind of basically was able to make it. For them, it's massive AirDrop. And they've been since then ringing the phone and pretty much getting seriously into it because they just feel like that this is madness. And I told them, yeah, that's just an AirDrop.
00:11:56.430 - 00:12:31.420, Speaker D: No biggie. It happens quite frequently. Yeah, this size. Yes, it's a big one. But anyway, so that kind of motivated them to kind of study or dig deeper. Of course, they can always find someone that will help them in me. But I'm not too much evangelizing anymore because people just literally I got banned from a few not crypto, but friend circles because of it, because I was talking too much about it.
00:12:31.420 - 00:13:17.126, Speaker D: I'm quite intense regarding crypto, DeFi and so on, even with my friends, not just with community and strangers online anyways, but for the ERL part, in real life, people, you talk about crypto, it's always like, oh, I've heard about bitcoin. And then it's just like they don't push the discussion further. And to be honest, I'm not too interested. The only thing is, at some point I was in a shop. I went in a shop and I strolled with, I think, my sushi cap, because I have a sushi cap. And for me, I'm kind of hiding in plain sight sometimes. And anyway, the sales associate there was just like, hey, I know this logo.
00:13:17.126 - 00:13:23.146, Speaker D: This is sushi. I was like, indeed, I love sushi. And they were just like, they didn't know.
00:13:23.248 - 00:13:24.538, Speaker B: Little do they know.
00:13:24.704 - 00:13:57.426, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. What do I say? What do I do? And then it's like, where do you hear about it? Oh, it got added to robinhood or the equivalent locally, something like that. And I was just like, oh, okay, cool. And I asked, is everyone in the store into crypto? And she said, oh, the whole staff is trading. I was like, no fucking way. I was like, this is crazy. You just walk in a random clothing store? And she told me like, yeah, there's five, six people here that are like all trading crypto.
00:13:57.426 - 00:14:10.538, Speaker D: I'm like, wow, I was shocked. And I asked what was their biggest holdings? And they told me about I think it was extremely, like, shitcoin heavy, like elrond something.
00:14:10.704 - 00:14:11.740, Speaker B: Oh, beautiful.
00:14:14.530 - 00:14:58.060, Speaker D: And I just told her, I said, I think you should consider looking into and I asked her, do you know about MetaMask? And she said, no. I said, oh, okay. So we have people, investors or people dabbling into this space that are not even aware of this yet. They only stay in their own little gardens. And that was just eye opener because for me, MetaMask is kind of a no brainer. But apparently for some people, they don't even want to consider dabbling more into this, like desktop wise and so on. So very interesting to talk with people that are exposed but in another way than us, usually.
00:14:58.430 - 00:15:44.060, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. That's a hilarious story. So kind of going into the dows and governance, one thing I feel like normies in the future might be afraid of or the idea scares them is like, trust in anonymous dows and in terms of governance. And I think it's funny because I don't know anyone in young capital dao in real life, and yet I trust them as much as anyone and literally with my money. So I'm curious, do you guys see anonymity as a hurdle beneficiary or non factor when it comes to trust in DAOs governance and generally between people in crypto kind of now and moving forward?
00:15:48.030 - 00:16:38.902, Speaker C: I think somebody like maki and someone like myself, we have online reputations built up already. And because of that, if we do something bad, that reputation that we have is going to go down with it. And that takes a long time to build up. And it's not like any of us could just switch to a different alt and then have it be the same as it would be as who we are now. In fact, a lot of people would probably be like, oh yeah, this altus that, scammer scoopy, blah blah blah blah, something like that. So there's a lot at stake for us to be good actors especially. I'm obsessed with crypto and DeFi.
00:16:38.902 - 00:17:33.040, Speaker C: And I can speak for maki. I know he is as well. And why would we want to banish ourselves from the space just to earn a quick buck or something like that? It's given so much to us. I feel like it'd be foolish to do something some heinous act abusing our power, whereas in our case, I don't think it's really hurt us. In fact, sometimes being anonymous is pretty nice in a lot of ways because you do get to keep your privacy, at least for most people. But if you're a new person starting out and you don't have any following online or credit online, you don't have relationships with other people in the space and you launch something and you're anonymous, then I think people are going to be a lot more skeptical of someone like that.
00:17:34.450 - 00:17:38.510, Speaker B: Right, interesting. What are your thoughts, maki?
00:17:39.730 - 00:18:57.334, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the fact that you shouldn't be trusting analysts, that's for sure. I do think, like Scoopy said very quickly, short term results for short term gains and short sighted people are going to be kind of outed very quickly. I mean, we kind of see it with everything that happened, the rocks on DSC and so on. So in my opinion, the true builders and so on are going to be staying for the long term game. It's going to be easy to identify in the long run, usually like interacting with this anonymous dows and so on. I do like whenever there's a new entrant participants or someone that wants to create something new, et cetera, it's always like there's more scrutiny and there shouldn't be any, how can I say no checkpoint or no verification of what is happening at the code level and then from there you can move on. There should be checkpoints like time locks or making sure admin keys and multisig, et cetera, just to make their life more complicated and overall securing kind of the dows because we don't want to have any problems.
00:18:57.334 - 00:19:09.420, Speaker D: And then that is to me the only kind of barrier. Aside from that, I'm pretty comfortable with people like using Sotos and kind of personas online character, whatever.
00:19:14.260 - 00:19:55.070, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's like the culture of crypto to be pseudo anomaly and a lot of people do choose to be public and rebuild their identity. But from the beginning the creator of cryptocurrency in and of itself was a pseudo anonymous person or persons. As long as people like pseudo anonymous developers and actors act with morals and ethics, then I think it's fine. And I think the more people do that, the better it will be for the space because they'll be.
00:19:57.860 - 00:20:17.270, Speaker D: I don't trust them less. We've seen some very cool example of this, by the way, with Olympus dow that kind of prong up from nowhere and built every dedicated community. So Alchemyx is another one sushi. Honestly, it's kind of a never ending list at this point.
00:20:17.880 - 00:20:54.108, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I totally agree. So I think we've talked at length kind of what it means to be anon right now. So let's find out what you guys are doing as anon devs in the space. Let's start with Maki. So we all know Sushi started as an AMM, but it's grown to be so much more since then. Sushi is now deployed on multiple chains, has awesome new products like Bento and Kashi and you've created partnerships with some of the best protocols in DeFi for either other developers out there or investors looking for the next Sushi.
00:20:54.108 - 00:21:02.790, Speaker B: What do you think is the kind of secret sauce to a protocol having so much value growth and development in such a short amount of time? Really.
00:21:05.960 - 00:22:10.144, Speaker D: In the case of me, when I was involved on the day to day at Sushi, it was kind of a multi one man army kind of type of situation for me initially it was the one that I was recruiting team, I was the one that was also building a partnership. I was the one aiding marketing, investor relationship even manning the discord community manager quote unquote. So it was kind of a multipronged approach where it was also doing strategy. And basically over time, this kind of grew into a team of 24 people, even 25 I think now, and basically just trying to delegate as much as I can on areas that people were better at and so on until I felt comfortable kind of stepping down because I felt the whole team was tightening it together and basically able to run the day to day. And myself. It's kind of exhausting also being in DFI like 24/7. So that was another consideration.
00:22:10.144 - 00:24:13.760, Speaker D: And regardless, there's also many other new challenges that I want to explore while contributing to Sushi with them anyway. So I think for finding the next Sushi or Alchemy, you need to have passionate builders that are going to be I think being a crypto native also helped tremendously people that know exactly how to what is going to be beneficial for these new protocols. Of course the technical aspect is always very important but the truth is it's better to have something that is accessible, that is easy, that is friendly on the UI UX and the onboarding then something that is revolutionary on the tech side. Sushi itself and the AMM is nothing crazy, it's only like a fork of V two but we've still been able to onboard many people that were not kind of used to being LP via incentives or just the way we're kind of supporting everyone that just joined our discourse and so on. So there was this aspect that is very important I think in growing a product and then for the next ones. From what I've seen, what is really working well for bootstrapping these community nowadays is a mix of AirDrop incentives and then a kind of, I don't know, like communities that are almost cult like or there is like some I don't know but there is this genesequa factor where people are drawn into it. Whether this is with an emoji, whether this is with a meme like tree tree or I've seen lately, what I've seen is Token Mag doing this kind of gamified governance thing with voting and so on, that just appealed to various appealed to various communities.
00:24:13.760 - 00:24:41.404, Speaker D: So I think there was like 42 tokens that were selected that could basically vote for having a reactor and that created a lot of attention from these third parties into this project. For liquidity, I was just like, this is pretty cool. Way to bootstrap communities. It's just like novel use case to just grow overall, right?
00:24:41.442 - 00:25:03.970, Speaker B: No, absolutely. Yeah. Bet on memes and Cults. But no, I totally understand. Just being in DFI is exhausting. I can't imagine building 24/7, especially like you were talking about with being kind of wearing every hat in Sushi early on. That must have been crazy.
00:25:03.970 - 00:25:33.550, Speaker B: But move to you now. Scoopy, you and the Alchemy team changed the game with the protocol that provides self repaying loans that can never be liquidated. For me, Alchemyx is a paradigm shift because this idea kind of along with your ideas for the Dao can be foundational blocks for really infinite possibilities. In what ways is Alchemyx aiming to develop its utility for its users and DFI as a whole in the future?
00:25:35.200 - 00:26:39.324, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'll take this moment or this opportunity to talk about V Two, which is the next thing that's coming out from Alchemyx. So basically right now in Alchemy you can have one collateral in one strategy it uses to borrow an Al asset. So for both Al USD and Al ETH, we are using urine to do that. Notably missing for LUSD is we only have Dai as a stable coin that can be used as collateral to borrow LUSD. So in V Two that's going to open up to a number of other stablecoins that will be accepted as collateral. And you can think of any of the major stablecoins and a lot of the up and coming decentralized stablecoins, they will be accepted as collaterals. And we're also working with trying to accept LP tokens, stuff like curve LP tokens, like things that are stable swap and maybe Trident if you guys are ready soonish.
00:26:39.324 - 00:27:45.616, Speaker C: I'm not sure. So essentially if we expand the amount of collaterals that we accept except for Al USD, and then we also allow LP tokens to be accepted as well, it's going to allow us to offer people lots of different options. And not only will they have different stable coins, they can put in in different ways, they will be able to choose from multiple strategies. So they can sort of build their own meta yield aggregator inside of Alchemics by mixing and matching their collaterals across their deposits, across different collateral types and strategies so they can optimize it for themselves. Whether that's for maximum yield or for risk tolerance. People can sort of it's like sort of like a factory to build your own yield strategy which you can have diversified across lots of different things. And then all those positions can be added together to be your aggregate sort of balance.
00:27:45.616 - 00:28:37.552, Speaker C: In Alchemics, in order to mint al USD and that kind of thinking will extend to Al ETH. And we're also going to be bringing albtc out as well. So there'll be different types of BTC collateral, different types of ETH collateral. Think like stake ETH from Lido, rocket ETH, things like that would also be accepted. And then kind of later on we're going to be doing what I like to call Alt Chemics, which is expanding our offering of al assets. Instead of right now we're aiming for the big three, stablecoins ether and bitcoin. But after that we'll be trying to find other coins in the DeFi ecosystem in order to bring alchemics to Maki.
00:28:37.552 - 00:28:39.510, Speaker C: There might be an Al Sushi one.
00:28:43.960 - 00:29:15.170, Speaker D: Be there should be by the way, and just like a small intervention here about this and that is I think overlooked a little bit. Like Treasuries could also use Al Sushi as a mechanism to basically diversify their treasure in my opinion. This way they kind of earn yield on it without being equitable and they can just do a huge bet on all Sushi, get the all USD and basically buy whatever they need or just take all USD. So to me that is super cool.
00:29:15.640 - 00:29:56.560, Speaker C: Yeah. Alt Chemics is going to be definitely a part of version 200 going into the into the future. We're also going to be trying to do MultiChain targeting L two S like Arbitrum and side chains like Polygon. So those are definitely the ones that we would probably be targeting early on but wouldn't limit ourselves to just those. So that's going to be part of our plans to expand. And then we're going to be revamping the governance procedure by having an on chain dow. That's going to be a custom contract that we have.
00:29:56.560 - 00:30:06.370, Speaker C: It's going to have some pretty unique mechanisms in it that I think hopefully will be getting copied in the yeah.
00:30:07.540 - 00:30:22.570, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds man. A lot of a lot of great alpha dropped Maki. Now you have to show him up. Can you drop some alpha about Trident and maybe some of the cool stuff you're working on in the future, just in general?
00:30:22.940 - 00:30:48.690, Speaker D: Right now I'm looking at two things for Sushi. I can say that Trident is around the corner. Show you like the contract have been deployed to Mainet, I believe, yesterday or so. Like Levix posted them on social media. So in theory, everything is good. There's only the UI that needs to be basically started, I guess. So that should be as soon as possible.
00:30:48.690 - 00:31:39.280, Speaker D: This is going to be our next kind of release on this front. Besides that, for me personally, I'm just taking this off for a few more weeks. I'm exploring kind of tax efficient subprocols like how to make all of this highly tax efficient for users of DeFi and then Omnibridge. So these are kind of the two things I think there's a very bad UI on all these multi chain bridges right now and there's not like one to rule them all. So I'm just kind of trying to study and kind of see what is happening with various of like there is multiple model right now. Some are keeping custody of assets which is not really DeFi friendly in my opinion, and that caused security risk. Some others are doing mere LP pools.
00:31:39.280 - 00:32:46.150, Speaker D: There's a pool on Polygon, there's a pool on BSc and that's the way to kind of transit between them. I think that is not as capital efficient per se, so I'm kind of just exploring, looking for the next thing, I guess in DeFi keeping up with a bunch of know like Tokymac and Olympus, like the bond mechanism, I've been very surprised with it. And then tokymac for I think use case with single side liquidity providing that can be enabled with this in my opinion, super exciting. And then overall just trying to see whatever the Djens are up to these days. There's a bunch of things on Avalanche, on Solana, on Terra, on the multi chain level that I haven't kind of paid attention to, that I'm kind of diving slowly into and who knows, we'll see what happens. I guess at this point it's just like recovering or not recovering, but starting to rediscover again. Some of the stuff I might have missed basically.
00:32:46.920 - 00:33:14.690, Speaker B: Right, I think that makes a lot of sense and sounds super exciting. I'll be keeping my eyes out for all of that and any of the other stuff you're building. And of course Scoopy V Two is high on my radar and I can't wait for all the exciting developments you and the team are working on. I think we are at time here, unfortunately. Do you guys want to show yourselves, drop your Twitter, talk about anything you want people to look at, projects, whatever.
00:33:17.300 - 00:33:47.210, Speaker C: Yeah. Alchemics is currently number two in the Tokamac core event, so if anybody hasn't voted yet, we'd appreciate your support to get us a reactor. That'd be pretty awesome. You guys can find me on social media at Scoopy truples and it's Spelt, Scupy and Triples, but if you search Scoopy with AOO, I think you can find me anyway.
00:33:49.580 - 00:33:53.212, Speaker B: Awesome. Maki, anything to drop, anything to show?
00:33:53.266 - 00:34:07.360, Speaker D: Yeah, for everything sushi related, sushi swap on Twitter or Zero Xmaki where you can follow my insight or things like this. There's going to be some alpha dropping very soon, so stay tuned.
00:34:08.500 - 00:34:14.960, Speaker B: Awesome. And just for me, if anyone wanted to give me a follow, for some reason I'm at the Rogue underscore Uchiha.
00:34:16.740 - 00:34:19.620, Speaker C: Yes, follow this man, he has alpha.
00:34:20.440 - 00:34:44.510, Speaker A: Exactly. Well, Scoopy maki, thanks for that amazing conversation. And Rogue, thank you so much for facilitating. Of course, all three of you deserve an equal recognition for everything that you're doing in this ecosystem and I can't wait to see what everybody does next. So please follow all of these people on Twitter and we'll be sure. To bring you on for a future event and go deeper into everything that you're excited about next. So thanks so much.
00:34:45.200 - 00:34:46.190, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:34:46.640 - 00:34:47.244, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:34:47.282 - 00:34:47.610, Speaker C: Thank you.
