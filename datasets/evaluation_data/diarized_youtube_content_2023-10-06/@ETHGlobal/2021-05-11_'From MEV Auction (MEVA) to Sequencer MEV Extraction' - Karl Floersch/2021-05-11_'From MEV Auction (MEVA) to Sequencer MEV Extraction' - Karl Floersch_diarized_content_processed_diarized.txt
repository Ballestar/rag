00:00:00.570 - 00:00:23.520, Speaker A: Perfect timing for Carl to switch on and talk about Neva or rap about Viva. I am very excited to see Carl make through his presentation in time, I will make a beeping sound. If you cannot go through 169 pages in 15 minutes, feel free to share screen.
00:00:24.290 - 00:00:38.140, Speaker B: You don't think I can do? Wow. Wow. Okay, let's go. You're right. I'm not going to lie. I will have a timer as well so that we can see anyway. Why hello everybody.
00:00:38.140 - 00:02:27.062, Speaker B: I am Carl, and today we are going to talk about Miva mev auctions also sequencer auctions also, just like generally, what is know, what can we do with it and why is this extremely exciting, in my opinion, for just literally the entire internet and the way that we work and communicate together? Because more things are communication problems than you might imagine. So anyway, first, why is this such an exciting topic? I think that the reason why this is such an exciting topic is because I love open source and blockchains miva, blah, blah, blah. We'll talk about how this works, but blockchains give a business model to open source. This is my claim and I think that this is actually pretty accurate and pretty revolutionary. And in fact, blockchains give a business model to public goods in general, the ability for us to build things that aren't necessarily extractive but instead get used. And when they are used, maybe you are rewarded in some way that doesn't incentivize you to hoard and whatnot it's this beautiful future that we can potentially have and I really do believe that it is possible. So I've been working in this crypto space for a while and guess what? I'm working on all these various projects, they're all open source and they're all public goods.
00:02:27.062 - 00:03:42.510, Speaker B: And so there is this fundamental thing where it's like, okay, it's amazing to be able to work on this technology, give it out for free, et cetera, et cetera. But how is this actually being funded? I'm not going to lie, I got paid for all of my work. I'm not just doing it out of the goodness of my heart alone, right? And I would say that a large portion of where this came from is just the fact that ETH itself got bigger and bigger and the network effect grew and grew and the price grew and grew and then people started reinvesting and it got bigger and bigger and just showered ETH on everybody, right? And that's legitimately how all of these open source projects have been funded to some extent. And so Yay Blockchains gave a business model to public goods, these public goods that I was working on and that many of us have been working on. But it's like, is that really the business model? Patronage essentially, or reinvestment into ETH. It's not terrible. I'm not going to say that it's like a bad thing, but it doesn't feel as sustainable long term.
00:03:42.510 - 00:04:33.282, Speaker B: And so here's why it doesn't feel super sustainable. Because users, right, they have a bunch of ETH and crypto and they use DApps. And then those DApps essentially pay miners because you end up spending a transaction fee, you end up getting arbitrage profit taken from you, whatever it is. And then developers make these DApps and they're just kind of like, oh okay, well I'm just going to deploy my smart contract and now it exists. And now guess who's getting paid for it? It's not the developer, it's the miners, right? And so this is like a kind of like wacky scenario. Doesn't seem particularly sustainable. And I'm not saying that developers need to make all of this cash, but this is an issue anyway.
00:04:33.282 - 00:05:24.194, Speaker B: So the miners are making minor extractable value. And just imagine, just imagine for one moment, imagine that the miners had to actually pay the developers, right? That would be pretty sweet. And maybe, what if miners literally paid everyone? What if we could all use the blockchain and guess what? The blockchain pays us back. That just seems like such a nice kind of weird circular mindset and circular strategy that just seems like a great basis for an economy. Every good economy is circular. Anyway, so this is an amazing future and then we can all join in universal consciousness as we're paying ourselves and being good. Okay, I'll take a step back.
00:05:24.194 - 00:06:00.058, Speaker B: But anyway, let's get into some mean potatoes and talk about minor extractable values. So what exactly is mev? I think that this concept is probably a lot more normalized now, thankfully, but I will still define it. I think it's useful. Basically, it's the revenue from being a minor. So it includes block rewards, it includes transaction fees, includes front running, includes slow market arbitrager. There's probably a better word for that as well. But we often think of it as just like just front running because that's the thing that gets a lot of attention.
00:06:00.058 - 00:07:00.258, Speaker B: But really it's all of the above. It's literally what can be extracted from running a minor, right? And shout out to Phil Dime for introducing and so there is another form of mev, and that is just the minor extractable value that you can make from 51%, attacking the network, being bad, all that kind of stuff. Don't be bad. Okay? And so we make this assumption in blockchains that the mev for being honest, basically the economic reward for being honest exceeds the economic reward for being malicious, right? So the miner is making money. What is keeping the miner from doing anything bad? Well, it's because it's making more money being good than it makes being bad. And that's great. But what happens if the mev honest is actually way bigger than the mev malicious, right? An honest is a spectrum, right? Like if you're front running, everybody is that really honest.
00:07:00.258 - 00:07:46.114, Speaker B: It's kind of like quasi honest. It's not necessarily great, it's not pro social, pro us, pro community. It's more just like pro you. So this big Mev Honest is not necessarily a good status quo. We should just taper that down a little bit and give back to us, give back to the community. And so when mev malicious is low, especially proportionally to the mev honest and Casper and consensus protocols that are a little bit more, have better security properties, can actually achieve this, then we can extract that excess mev, extract that minor extractable value. So that seems pretty fun.
00:07:46.114 - 00:08:33.286, Speaker B: So now I'm going to talk about of like, it's a little bit of an ambiguous term at this point, so I'll try to make the distinction pretty clear and I'll go into it. But anyway, so these are the sources of mev. And we're not going to talk about extracting the block rewards, we'll just talk about extracting the transaction fees, front running, slow market arbitrage. And by the way, I'm a big fan of the previous talk where we can actually eliminate much of front running just by using some commit reveal timelock crypto, which I'm very excited for. But anyway, here we are. These things we can extract and that's a solid chunk of change. Okay, so first, gas auctions.
00:08:33.286 - 00:09:08.906, Speaker B: We currently have priority gas auctions. Flashbots is working on much more sophisticated kinds of auctions here, and those are, by the way, called miva as well. So, I'm sorry, it's a little bit of confusing term because there are a lot of auctions all over the place and there are auctions for mev all the time. So anyway, users or arbitrage bots or whomever are submitting transactions to the Miner. The Miner is about to create a new block. Sorry, I got to get a little bit more context here. The Miner is creating a new block, figuring out which transactions go in it.
00:09:08.906 - 00:09:56.682, Speaker B: And so how are they going to do this? Well, they're going to hold an auction. And that auction, you'll have the participants be either the users, arbitrage, bots, flash bots, et cetera, and they will send these transactions which express some desired inputs to be included in this block. And it'll propose this modification. And it can be conditional, it can be arbitrarily complicated, it can be very interesting and at a very simple level. The Miner is going to choose the transactions that provide the most value to the Miner, right? Pay the highest gas price, pay the highest fee. And so that is the transaction that is going to be mined and that is the ordering of the transactions that will be mined, et cetera. And the Miner will make that gas times the gas price.
00:09:56.682 - 00:10:55.840, Speaker B: And so the mev plus equals transaction fee, right? We just got some money from including transactions, so that's an mev auction and that is one sense of the term. And so I think I'm going to start disambiguating these terms a little bit and just call the next one a sequencer auction. And that's what I'm talking about when I say extract the mev, let's talk about a sequencer auction. So the sources of mev, right, we just got transaction fees, but now, notably, this also works for arbitrage. If there's a free arbitrage opportunity, everyone's going to be wanting to take advantage of it. They'll all be bidding and they'll bid up to essentially how much money there is to be made. And so this is just to give a feeling for how the miner actually makes the arbitrage opportunities in some kind of perfectly competitive market situation.
00:10:55.840 - 00:11:27.110, Speaker B: Now, mev plus equals the arbitrage opportunity on the chain. That's pretty crazy. And I included this little flashbots 2.0 diagram of these gas price auctions because they bid each other up up until pretty close to the value that they're going to make anyway. So those cover all of the other sort of forms of mev. And now let's talk about sequencer auctions. So minor, another word for minor.
00:11:27.110 - 00:12:05.890, Speaker B: Part of what a minor does is it sequences the transactions in a block. And so that sequencing is the thing that we're going to focus on. And so I'll instead talk, right, they order these transactions and so I'm going to actually just call it a sequencer, call the miners a sequencer. Sometimes I forget I have animations that describe what I'm saying. So then I have to play them back. Anyway, okay, so this is that auction that we just had, right? Users paying transaction fees, extracting mev. I'm sending mev, essentially transferring mev to the sequencer.
00:12:05.890 - 00:12:45.954, Speaker B: So what if we had an auction for being the sequencer itself? So let's hold an auction and let's say, okay, if you want to be a sequencer and you want to make this juicy, juicy profit, why don't you bid for that? Right, that privilege. Well, we can expect that the bids will be the expected, know, gained, minus the operational costs of being a sequencer. And guess where that money can go first? It was going to the sequencer. Where is this money going to? It's going to Facebook. We're going to send all the money to Facebook and Google and Amazon. No, I'm just kidding. Imagine a future.
00:12:45.954 - 00:13:25.358, Speaker B: Imagine a future where we send it to Ethereum, send it to us, send it to the community, send it to not just the Ethereum community, everybody. If everyone's going to be using this blockchain, it better be good for all of us. Build public goods. So one thing that I'll just point out, although I don't have that much time, so I'll just mention it. One thing that we need to do for this to work is we need to have really good open source software that commoditizes being a sequencer. We want to make it so easy to extract the mev in the way that we want it to be extracted. So essentially, we may not want any front running to be possible.
00:13:25.358 - 00:13:59.382, Speaker B: We may want to require that all transactions are encrypted and with commit reveal schemes and whatnot. That is something that we definitely want to do. But we need to commoditize being a sequencer for this mev extraction to actually work and to be something that doesn't get itself captured. And then, okay, I don't remember what that mev greater than. Okay, what's with this optimism? So that's what I'm working on. Right? We're building optimistic roll up. The OVM.
00:13:59.382 - 00:14:20.746, Speaker B: Optimistic ethereum. We are scaling ethereum. I forgot to give that context in the beginning. It's very important. It's a very important project. Anyway, Mivas, whoops sorry about that, can be implemented on top of optimistic roll up. And we got a charter to enshrine public access to public goods.
00:14:20.746 - 00:14:40.838, Speaker B: So that's pretty great. And Mivas can fund public goods. In fact, they should fund public goods. And maybe they must fund public goods because who is going to accept a future where blockchains aren't giving back to ourselves? So anyway, currently we're sad. Let's make ourselves happy. This might be sequencer auction. We can call it sequencer auction anyway.
00:14:40.838 - 00:14:56.266, Speaker B: And then we'll fund tons of awesome public goods. Give a business model to public goods. They're going to fund public goods. Blockchains will fund them. In fact, we will fund public goods. In fact, we will give back to ourselves. All right, this is what this is fundamentally about.
00:14:56.266 - 00:15:12.206, Speaker B: Value is subjective. All this stuff is subjective. We're all just kind of like slurping around in a soup. We need a good non extractive system. We want a little circle. We want that circular logic. That's what I'm all about.
00:15:12.206 - 00:15:28.002, Speaker B: Just kidding. Great. Look at these rich people. Also, I guess it's right here, pretty centralized. We got to spread the money around a little bit more in my next image. Anyway, that's public goods funding. I don't know how to distribute the gut for the funds.
00:15:28.002 - 00:15:44.010, Speaker B: We've got Gitcoin grants and whatnot, but I believe we can do it. Love no snow borders. And thank you. All that's optimism. Check out optimism. Check out optimistic ethereum. Check out Miva and shout out to all these folks.
00:15:44.010 - 00:15:50.640, Speaker B: That's me. I think I hit it. I think I hit the 15 minutes. I'm 11 seconds over. Let's go.
00:15:52.210 - 00:16:44.880, Speaker C: Yay. Congratulations, Carl. Good job. Do we have any questions for Carl? No questions from Eve TV chat, but awesome presentation. I guess I have one maybe questions if there's no question. So I guess one option for redistribution is burn, right? And that's like the simple equal redistribution to everyone. What is your intuition in terms of how inefficient the burn is? If we were to focus the money on specific projects, how much more bang for the buck can we get?
00:16:45.970 - 00:17:43.102, Speaker B: Great question. So I think intuitively that there is value in having some sort of redistribution mechanism that is a little bit more complicated. The reason why I think this is the case is because we do currently redistribute a lot of value based on I work on some project I'm convinced some venture capitalists to pay me some money, and then I go out and I build my thing and then it makes everyone a bunch of money. That's like a very sophisticated money redistribution system. And I think that it gets even more complicated. You introduce taxes, you introduce government subsidies, all of these things. I think that it is just kind of the nature of the problem of collective value and collective value distribution.
00:17:43.102 - 00:18:11.594, Speaker B: It's essentially like a preference function on what we as a human civilization want. And so I just think that that preference function is going to be quite complicated. And I'm not sure if there's one distribution system to rule them all or if we can just do like, okay, this is a really simple one, let's just focus on that. Only I think it's one of many.
00:18:11.792 - 00:19:03.980, Speaker C: So here's my kind of counterargument for the burn. Basically just a simple burn. And the first one is you kind of mentioned it is like if you don't burn, then you have all sorts of questions around credible neutrality, right? So burn gives you credible neutrality. I guess the other thing is that the burn is part of the ultrasound money thesis. I keep shitting the ultrasound money thesis. But there is a possibility that ether will become in the same way that ethereum could become the internet of money, EF could become the money of the internet with tons of monetary premium. And if we focus on this one thing, the burn, then I think we have a higher chance of Eve becoming kind of this ultrasound money.
00:19:03.980 - 00:19:31.330, Speaker C: And the fact that Eve becomes ultrasound money gives us all sorts of rippling effects. It means more security for ethereum, it means more economic bandwidth. It means all of these other good things. So I think the trade offs need to be carefully weighted as to whether we want to be very ad hoc or just be credibly neutral and reinforce the burn.
00:19:31.750 - 00:20:09.466, Speaker B: Yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm feeling the burn too. I'm feeling the burn. But it's really just an argument that there are probably multiple ways to skin a horse. I'm not sure if that's but there are multiple ways to go about it. And I think that we definitely need to burn and we probably are going to want to be doing other things. And in fact, my thought is the most exciting mechanisms are the mechanisms that have submechanisms. And submechanisms like composable things that incentivize really good behavior.
00:20:09.466 - 00:20:51.614, Speaker B: So if you said, like, okay, if you say this mechanism, let's say it's the burn, let's say it's something else has this consequence of funding innovation, giving back to people who need it, just generally bringing everyone up. And those submechanisms are all dependent on you do this burn, and then you kind of have this ripple effect of all these other things happening. That's what I'm interested in. So for me to feel the most burn, that's where I really just would love to see it's. Like okay. Yeah, that's how you do the burn. And then the whole world's burn in I don't know, in a good way.
00:20:51.614 - 00:20:52.720, Speaker B: In a good way.
00:20:54.050 - 00:21:03.020, Speaker C: Excellent. Thank you, Carl. We don't have any more questions, so I guess we could move on to the next talk.
