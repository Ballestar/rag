00:00:06.090 - 00:00:47.500, Speaker A: So next up we have an amazing panel. We're going to talk about Komarebi fund and how everything that they're doing is set up from anywhere from logistics to the divisions and the goals and just the overall history of starting the fund. So with us we have three amazing panelists. We have Monty, Kenjo and Metta who are going to be talking about how they got everything started and without further ado, we'll welcome them on stage. And I think we're having a slight technical difficulty with one panelist, so we'll be able to loop them in and put them live in about a few seconds. But in the meantime, I'll welcome all of you.
00:00:48.830 - 00:00:49.782, Speaker B: Thanks Cardzic.
00:00:49.846 - 00:00:56.640, Speaker C: Hi, thanks so much for having us. Monsieur is just joining. Her laptop just died so she's joining from her phone.
00:00:58.050 - 00:01:55.442, Speaker A: Oh, good. I think we can kind of preface this by just saying today is all about DAOs and governance and we've kind of covered a handful of things around how Dows are set up from a legal standpoint to the Aspirational standpoint of cool things that they can do to bring on people together. And I think you are in a pretty good intersection of doing interesting things that tie both the real world and the crypto world together. Primarily funding people, reaching out to an audience that either is underlooked or just doesn't get always like the right channels to kind of go in to be successful. And on top of that, there's a whole set of world around tooling and logistics and how do you manage something at scale the way everything is set up. So there's like 50 different topics here and I think maybe the best thing to do would be just to start off by telling everybody what Cliffhunt is and how he got started and in the meantime, we hope that Monty is able to join. That's how we get going.
00:01:55.442 - 00:01:56.100, Speaker A: So.
00:01:58.150 - 00:02:31.050, Speaker B: That sounds great. I can kick things off. So thanks for having us today. We're really excited. My name is Kendall, I'm an investor in the broader blockchain ecosystem at Blockchain Capital. And earlier this year I kind of had this just revelation that I wasn't meeting as many female founders as I wanted to and wasn't investing as much into that cohort of founders. And so I started hosting office hours and so every month I chat with anywhere between five and ten women.
00:02:31.050 - 00:03:00.760, Speaker B: I actually just crossed 50 sessions this month and it's been honestly one of the most rewarding things that I did this year. And so I was super excited to start connecting with more women and then an opportunity came along where I got connected to Meta and Monsie about actually going the next step and starting to invest in women. And so that's really how we got connected and started to think through the formation of Komorebi and we'll talk a little bit more about that but that's my sort of beginning information.
00:03:02.490 - 00:03:46.114, Speaker C: Cool and yay I'm glad Monty could join. We're just going over introductions right now. So I'm meta. I spent most of my time in the blockchain space as a developer working on the cello ecosystem. But when I first joined the space around 2016, 2017, I think it was very apparent then that there just weren't enough women or underrepresented minorities in general in the space at the time. So very similarly to Kendall, I wanted to do something about it. So me and my friends back in college, alexis Galba and Sarah Reynolds, we decided to make she 256, which is a 501 nonprofit that's dedicated to increasing diversity in the blockchain space.
00:03:46.114 - 00:05:03.290, Speaker C: So we do this through a variety of different ways, mostly around mentorship, community building, and educational content. And so this did a lot of stuff around increasing the top of the funnel and increasing exposure to the crypto space and bringing in a lot more women and underrepresented minorities. But it didn't really necessarily tackle issues with women that were already in the space. And so that's something I was really passionate about, especially as I spent more and more time in the space and I met really cool women who were doing cool things but constantly cited things like finding it hard to get funding, finding it hard to hire and recruit other women, and things like that. And so it had been in the books for a really long time for she 256 to explore something like a venture fund to invest in female and non binary founders, but we kind of just always put it on the back burner and didn't think too much about it. But then I think in the past year, especially with Dows and stuff exploding, I think we just realized that this could be a really cool method to just jumpstart this whole initiative. And we got connected to Kim, Joel, and Monsie, who had really similar views by Ian, who runs Syndicate, and we just realized that we all care about the same things, and it just made sense.
00:05:03.290 - 00:05:31.640, Speaker C: And so this kind of just started from one call a couple months ago, maybe at the beginning of last year, and spiraled into this whole thing. And we ended up raising money and creating this entire collective where we're able to pull in kind of like crowdsource, not just funding, but also the resources that all of our Dow members bring into the table and kind of created a venture Dow, which we can kind of go into the structure a little bit more later.
00:05:33.690 - 00:05:37.590, Speaker D: I think I missed the initial part, but we are doing intros.
00:05:38.330 - 00:05:43.180, Speaker B: Yeah, just introductions and kind of how you came to this.
00:05:43.710 - 00:06:52.778, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm having terrible luck with laptops today, but I'm here and glad to be here. Thank you for having us at ETH Online. My background is mostly in the traditional finance space, having worked on Wall Street, large banks, and as I was transitioning into the crypto space very similar experiences like what Mehta mentioned. I realized quickly that we were repeating a lot of the mistakes and biases that the traditional finance space has in terms of just lack of diversity, lack of opinions from different people, and realized there was a need for an organization where women can come together, learn about the space, just feel empowered to contribute to the crypto space. I mission at Women in Blockchain, which I founded around 2016, is pretty similar to what she 256 is doing and that's why we have a lot of alignment. But we really want to empower more minorities to join the space and contribute in meaningful ways. And again, we do that through educational initiatives.
00:06:52.778 - 00:07:41.406, Speaker D: One of the things that we've worked with Sheet of 56 in the past is a bigness guide to Blockchain, which you should check it out if you're new to the space. But today we'll be talking more about Coma Rabi. I won't repeat most of the things that neither said. I think really we wanted to make an impact not just in the founding landscape, in the crypto space by funding female founded companies, but also the funding landscape. How can we get together really smart, talented, passionate women and enable them and empower them to become investors in their own right? So that's where our mission is at Comrade. We will be talking a lot more about that. But Mehta, I think it wasn't last year we, I think, started talking about it just like maybe a month or two before we launched it.
00:07:41.406 - 00:08:05.560, Speaker D: So that just talks how crazy and how quick the setup for a Dao can be compared to a traditional VC firm where the setup process, the costs are prohibitive. And we went about doing this, I think in less than a couple of weeks. The fundraise was maybe less than a week. It's insane how much Dows are enabling these days. I'll pause there.
00:08:06.250 - 00:09:03.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's maybe a good segue just to talk about the differences between doing a venture fund versus a Dow. I think the cost is a big component but I think bigger conversation is really around governance and user contribution. Traditional funds are structured in a way where the folks giving capital, typically limited partners are kind of handing over the rights for investment. They're saying, here's some capital and I trust you, my GP, my general partner, to go and invest that capital into a given with a given mandate. Whereas in a Dow it's much more structured. Like not only are you giving your capital, but you're also given a sort of seat at the table when it comes to investment decisions, when it comes to the governance of the overall organization. It's just, I think a slightly more involved path where it's much more oriented, I think around collective investing rather than delegated investing.
00:09:03.690 - 00:09:31.620, Speaker B: And so that's to me that's the main difference is that a lot of the not a lot of every single person who is a part of comarabi, feels really excited about our vision and about this mission and wants to contribute to that in more ways than just capital and also play an active role within the community. So that's kind of, I think, the clear differentiation from my perspective, in addition to cost as well and just being able to set this up super quickly. What do you guys think?
00:09:32.870 - 00:10:30.166, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely agree on all of those funds. I think one additional advantage of a dow structure is just being able to leverage the collective intelligence. We have some really talented folks on our dao. I don't think in a traditional VC setup we would be able to kind of dip into this pool of founders, investors, builders in the space. I think that's beneficial from an investment decision making perspective, but also from a portfolio support and just the kind of support that we can provide to portfolios. They're not getting a single partner at a VC firm on the cap table. They're getting these, in our case, 36 members that they can really leverage in terms of help from fundraising to tokenomics to building to deploying to user experience.
00:10:30.166 - 00:11:36.330, Speaker D: And I think that's really powerful with the dao. Another thing that I've been noodling on recently is this concept of principal agent problem where Kinsel tell me if I'm incorrect here, but in a traditional VC setting, there is a principal agent problem where you are managing someone else's money. And we've seen things go wrong in various ways where there isn't really as much alignment as we see in terms of skin in the game, in terms of a Dow where you are really managing your own money and there is a lot more transparency in terms of decision making which reduces kind of the areas where people can manipulate the system. And then final component, I would say, is accessibility is really key. Traditionally, VC returns have been enjoyed by a certain section of society and really hasn't been accessible to this broad swath of individuals. And I think that's really changing now with investment dows.
00:11:39.530 - 00:12:36.774, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think I agree with everything you guys said. I think the community aspect of running a dow is really fascinating, and that's something that we're still trying to understand how to completely tap into because it's just so powerful. We've invested in about two companies so far, and the things that we can offer our portfolio, I think, grows exponentially with how big our dow is. And I think those individual connections are super exciting, especially because everyone in our dow, if you look through the list I just posted, is in very different fields. We have a really cool group of investors, of crypto, native operators, of founders, and they're all in different niches, and so they can really give advice to a lot of our founders that I think isn't as possible when you're just getting invested from a venture fund. So that part of it is really cool. Also, before we move to the next topic, I just wanted to say feel free to ask questions in the chat.
00:12:36.774 - 00:12:47.980, Speaker C: We'd love for this to be super engaging and a conversation. So if you have any burning questions about Comorbis or dows in general or about us, please ask them here.
00:12:49.070 - 00:13:15.414, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Maybe this is like a good point for us to talk a little bit more about how we set Comorib up and certain challenges we might have on the dow side or areas that we think have been gone smoother. Yeah, maybe just thinking through some of the practical logistics and formation of it. Do you want to start?
00:13:15.452 - 00:13:16.166, Speaker D: Go for it.
00:13:16.268 - 00:13:53.540, Speaker C: Yeah. I was going to say one of the things I found most interesting was that tech wasn't the biggest issue. So going into it, I thought in running a dow, the tech would be the biggest inhibitor. Like we need to set up a dow and then figure out how to do token disbursements and do we want a token for the dow and things like that. But I realized, which made me really happy as a developer, that the tech has at least gone to the point where we can abstract away a lot of the crypto and that is not the hardest part at all. You can create a multi SIG safe really fast. We use Gnosis, there's so many other options as well.
00:13:53.540 - 00:14:45.518, Speaker C: And basically have everyone set up with a crypto wallet so that they can be a signer. And in the most bare bone sense that is a dow. But I think what I didn't expect was the human coordination aspect of it to be so hard. So everything from rallying votes to communication. So just basic organizational and government makeup. So kind of how do we divide up the votes, how do we communicate decisions and make large decisions while still making sure that we've reached quorum? How do we get everyone to be super engaged? And also how do we enable people to, I guess, enable their passions, but also in the construct of the bandwidth that they have. So everyone joins a dow from their free time right now, right? Especially Komorabi.
00:14:45.518 - 00:15:27.546, Speaker C: It's completely volunteer run. And so we want to make sure that people feel empowered to be able to contribute as much as they want and as little as they want while still maintaining some form of a structure. So basically we kind of evolved to have this core and larger member structure. So there's five of us that are core members. So like three of us on this call as well as Eva and Christy. And so the five of us basically just make sure that operationally, we're running, we're talking to founders. The pipeline is set up so that everyone in the Dow has access to all the same information and things like that and do a lot of the communications.
00:15:27.546 - 00:15:44.360, Speaker C: And then the broader Dow kind of has the most information possible to make an educated decision once a company comes to vote on whether we want to fund them or not. And that has worked out quite well the past couple of months but I can see this also being iterated on the next couple of months as well.
00:15:45.770 - 00:16:51.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I would just say I think there's a question in here about our investment process and how much you invest. I think one of the best ways to leverage the Dow has been helping with deal sourcing. And just like having so many different experts around the table, we've got folks that are at other funds. We have folks that are in DeFi, that are in the NFT space, that are on other chains, ethereum, salana, whatever it might be. And so it's been really interesting to just have a broader group bring in referrals for deals for companies that you might want to invest in. I think our pipelines since we've launched, we've probably chatted with a few dozen founders and we've probably had like 50 or 60 potential opportunities come in through the pipeline which has been really amazing to see. And then sort of on the tail end making sure that we have all information available for the broader Dow to help vote and make a decision on and making sure that the core team is kind of liaising in the middle there to help out with Diligence and help out with founder conversations.
00:16:51.590 - 00:16:58.270, Speaker B: So I think that broader at the top and at the bottom structure has been really useful.
00:16:59.970 - 00:18:09.198, Speaker D: Yeah and just reflecting on what Mehta said in terms of challenges, definitely human coordination but I think that's a challenge across all DAOs. How do you ensure that members are contributing to the Dao? What are their incentives? How do you design for those incentives? And something that we've been talking about internally as well, how do we motivate our members to meaningfully contribute to the Dow? I think given this is a hackathon, that's something I would encourage people to think about is tooling. Since we launched, definitely the tooling in the space has grown in terms of just managing the operations, in terms of managing voting and governance systems and then also engaging the community members. But I think that there's still a lot of room to grow and a lot of opportunities to kind of build in that segment. Yeah in terms of we kind of spoke through our investment process, I think there is a range across Dows. Our Dow is still relatively small. We are 36 members.
00:18:09.198 - 00:18:39.854, Speaker D: There are Dows out there with hundreds and thousands of members and those challenges kind of grow as Dows scale. So that's I think one of the biggest things that we are thinking about in terms of just how do we get members actively contributing on an ongoing basis and I don't believe that everyone will contribute equally and I don't think that's a possibility. We just need to identify who are these core members? How do you incentivize them?
00:18:39.892 - 00:18:40.480, Speaker C: How.
00:18:43.170 - 00:18:48.450, Speaker D: Do you kind of motivate them to continue contributing in a meaningful manner?
00:18:51.550 - 00:19:39.654, Speaker B: I think maybe we can talk a little bit about some of the investments that we've made so far, or kind of how we're thinking about investing into the future. So we've made two investments. One is Public Apricot Finance, which is founded by Cecilia, who's an amazing founder. They're a lending protocol built on Solana that I think is going to be doing some really innovative work in the lending space. We're really excited about that. And then the other protocol is actually in the Dow tooling space, but we haven't disclosed it yet, so we're not able to publicly sort of share that investment. But I think so far we've been thinking about our check sizes as being kind of like a larger angel size check.
00:19:39.654 - 00:20:26.200, Speaker B: So we're writing anywhere from twenty five k to one hundred k check sizes. And then I think as the Dow scales over time, we'll think about how our potential investment amount might scale as well. But the process I think has been really straightforward just in a sense that everybody has different strengths and different areas of expertise. And so we're really leveraging everyone around the table to make sure that we can diligence opportunities appropriately and then kind of move forward with an investment. And we're investing both on the token side as well as on the equity side, so there's no real limitations on that front. And we're open internationally as well, so we're really flexible when it comes to geography as well. Anything else I'm missing, guys on the investment side?
00:20:27.370 - 00:21:12.550, Speaker C: No, not at all. I was just going to add that I think this is another benefit of our kind of general fund approach. We're able to be super chain agnostic but still give money in a very crypto native way and I think that's super cool. So all of our investments so far, we're actually in the final stages of our third investment. They're actually all on different chains, which I think is so cool and I haven't really seen a lot of venture funds do. And that just goes to show like I think there's so many cool women and non binary folks working all across the board on very different niches and we just haven't tapped that market yet. So it's cool seeing all this deal flow come in know, spans so many different niches.
00:21:13.850 - 00:21:17.938, Speaker B: Looks like we have a question about legal structure. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Monty.
00:21:18.034 - 00:22:06.396, Speaker D: I was just going to go back to the earlier question briefly before we jump into the legal question around. How do you think about setting up a Dow? And I kind of think of it as a four step process and let me know if I'm missing something. The first is just identifying what is the mission of your Dow, what's kind of the objective for your Dow. And we've seen arranged Dows that do collector Dows which are just focused around NFTs investment Dows, have their own motivation grants focused Dows. There's a whole range of Dows social DAOs. So first and foremost is just identifying what's that objective and then recruiting a community that's equally passionate, recruiting group of people that really believe in a similar mission that you kind of start out with. The second component is fundraising.
00:22:06.396 - 00:22:46.920, Speaker D: Everything needs money. So just being able to bring in these passionate folks, investors who are willing to kind of put money where their mouth is that's I think the second component. The third biggest component is governance. And I think that's where the Dow space, I think, is still evolving a lot. How do you go about voting? How do you go about decision making, proposal process? And then I think the final component is once you've identified and set all of this up, it's just delivering and staying true to your mission. So that's how I think about setting up a Dow. But let me know if I missed anything.
00:22:52.810 - 00:22:55.020, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that covered it.
00:22:57.390 - 00:23:43.046, Speaker C: Yeah. I was going to go to this legal question. It's funny you mentioned it because when we talked about struggles, I think Kendall Monsey and I all agree that the hardest struggle was probably the legal aspect by far. Yeah, like, definitely a lot. Especially because it's just there's such few lawyers in the space who not only understand crypto but understand Dows in particular and can help us with these questions. This whole space is an experiment, but Dows in particular are very new and also because they're organizations and kind of trying to rival things like companies and LLCs and things like that. It's getting harder and harder to kind of get the regulation to a point where it's caught up with the technology.
00:23:43.046 - 00:24:16.020, Speaker C: So I think in the next couple of months and years, we're going to see a lot of changes in this. So what we say now is probably not even going to make sense a year from now. But for us at least, we want it to be as protected as possible. And I know a lot of DAOs have taken different approaches to this. Some have kind of incorporated in Europe or Latin America where the regulations are different. Some have not incorporated at all and kind of just function on chain and kind of hope for the best. But we wanted to be as protected as possible, especially because we were investing in companies.
00:24:16.020 - 00:25:11.318, Speaker C: So we actually ended up incorporating. We have an LLC that basically encapsulates all of the Dao's work. And then everyone who's in the Dao has signed an operating agreement to be someone who works in the LLC or works with the LLC. And then beyond that, all of our agreements are very standard, like similar to just how a normal venture fund would get token grants or equities. So we've invested, I think safe so far, but it kind of just depends on the standard that the company is using to raise. But I think what I would say is the hardest part was kind of like the accredited investor piece, making sure that we are not just one entity but every single Dow member falls under this category and things like that. I don't know if you guys have anything to add there.
00:25:11.484 - 00:26:34.504, Speaker B: Yeah, and I just want to say that I get the irony of Dows being for everyone and then us having an investment Dow where only accredited investors are members. And I really hope that we get to a point where this is much more of an open standard where investment Dows are much more broadly applicable. But I think it's going to be baby steps in crypto. There's definitely going to be shades of gray when it comes to the regulatory landscape and just kind of understanding protections. And so in this particular instance, this is definitely an experiment and so we're trying to ensure that everybody around the table has full protection and therefore that's kind of the path that we've chosen. Maybe I guess there's a couple more questions coming in. So there's one question that's asking about common observations as we've taken pitch meetings maybe is there a difference between talking to a pitch for the Dow versus for blockchain capital? I guess the only thing that I'll say, and this is a blanket statement for broader just the industry in general and across many different industries is that there's definitely a confidence gap and women are so qualified for the roles that they're going for and come in.
00:26:34.504 - 00:27:24.280, Speaker B: And I think there's just, I think a little bit of a difference in some of the confidence that I see where somebody who's incredibly qualified might still not be 100% sure if they should take the leap and start the company. And so I love being in that position where I'm like I've talked to hundreds of founders, you can do this. This is absolutely the right you're thinking about this the right way. And so I think that's something that I've noticed in conversations a little bit more on the Dow side, but in general, I would say the processes run very similar. I think the founder conversations are very similar. We're all kind of working towards the same goal of building the future of this space. So I think it's been pretty apples to apples except for that one thing, which I think is a broader observation.
00:27:24.280 - 00:27:25.192, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:25.246 - 00:28:15.130, Speaker D: And just adding to that, I think at least personally I've noticed female founders being a lot more comfortable in pitch meetings with us as they see female visas that they are talking to. And I think that's reflective in the numbers. Right. I was speaking to not going to name names, but I was speaking to a large investment fund in the crypto space and just talking, sharing notes about deal flow. And like Kinsel mentioned, we've already seen 50 plus companies come through to Coma Rabi and they haven't seen that much deal flow in two years, which we've seen in, I think, less than three months. So there's something there where we've set our mission. We've been really intentional in terms of what we want to fund and that has attracted the right people.
00:28:20.820 - 00:29:05.216, Speaker C: Yeah, and I really like what you said, monsieur around seeing female faces as the check writers. So when we were looking at the data for all of this, apparently 65% of all venture funds still don't have any female check writers. So no female VCs. So not only is there a problem with we need more female founders, but there also aren't enough female VCs. And that's for many different reasons. But I think these two stats are very tied because for example, female VCs are twice as likely to fund another female founder. So I think because all the core team is female, but also our Dow is more than 50% female like on the much higher end.
00:29:05.216 - 00:29:47.870, Speaker C: And I think that just makes us way more well positioned to be investing in female and non binary folks. And I think people do feel a lot more comfortable with us. And I think what's cool is that a lot of the times we're the first check going into a company or the first check in their bigger round. And so I think the onus is really on us to give these founders a good experience and to show them like crypto is for you, you can found in crypto and be successful. And I think that because we're such an early precede fund, we get that cool opportunity to meet these founders and continue to push them along so that they're able to raise like a seed round, a Series A, Series B, all of that.
00:29:50.240 - 00:30:38.110, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And I guess in terms of finding VC funds that are compatible with your project and vision, I think the way I think about it is finding a venture investor is kind of like dating a little bit. You're probably going to have a lot of conversations and ultimately the partners that you choose are going to be with you for a long time. Right? This is like a long term relationship that you're building. Oftentimes your investors are with you for five to ten years, if not longer. And so I think it's super important to make sure that you're having as many conversations as possible. I think aligning early on on what's important to you as a founder and what your vision is and how you want to see the company kind of evolve over time or the protocol evolve over time is important.
00:30:38.110 - 00:31:11.530, Speaker B: I think a lot of venture funds have so many they have just so many different perspectives to offer right on the table. There's many different partners or just investors in general. And so I think understanding who your one or. Two or multiple people are within a fund that you really connect with and that you feel like you have a relationship that you can build over time, I think is super important. I'm sure there's more to add here, but curious about what you guys.
00:31:19.430 - 00:31:51.854, Speaker D: Think. I agree with what Kinjel said. I think one thing that we've actively done, again, is what I mentioned leveraging our current Dao network to identify. I mentioned we have founders, angel investors, we see funds within our Dao community. And so what we try and do is make those connections to founders that we've identified that we want to invest in. And that's how really finding those mission aligned VCs is. But we would love to extend that.
00:31:51.854 - 00:32:46.958, Speaker D: I think that's a conversation that we are having with syndicate as to how can different dows kind of come together, work with each other, leverage each other's networks dows that have similar mission, especially investment dows, how can they work together? I think that's what's exciting about the crypto space in general, is that the space evolves so quickly and there's just so much experimentation to be done. But there was this one question I wanted to get. There was, what do we think about Dows disrupting VCs? I think that gets thrown around a lot. I can quickly chime in as to what I think. I personally don't think that Dows would completely disrupt VCs in the traditional form. I think there is space for how VCs function right now. But I do think that we are at, I think, $8 billion in Dows right now.
00:32:46.958 - 00:33:20.890, Speaker D: The space is growing, and there's definitely attention that VCs need to pay towards the investment Dow ecosystem, because I think more and more the deals are going to get snagged, especially in the crypto space by investment Dows, and there isn't going to be a lot of allocation left for traditional VC. So if they really want to get involved in the crypto space, I think that's going to be definitely a competition that they'll see. Kinsel Beta, what do you think about disrupting VCs?
00:33:23.390 - 00:34:27.440, Speaker C: I think I'm more on the extreme end. I think VC is going through a fundamental shift right now, and I don't think venture capital, the way it exists now will exist in the next ten to 20 years. And my vision, honestly, is for the way VC works now, especially in crypto, to just not exist. I don't know if it's Dows that are the future or what, but I definitely think moving towards a more decentralized way of funding protocols just makes a lot more sense and there's just a lot more value. And I think you're seeing that already with things like Comaribi, where we have a cool pool of investors who have their own funds, have their own projects, maybe are founders, but are able to pool in their money and their experience to help kind of the next generation of founders. And I think that honestly is going to be the future. And similar to what Kendall said, I really hope we get to a point in regulation where the accredited investor stuff is less of an issue and kind of who is able to invest in companies.
00:34:27.440 - 00:35:06.700, Speaker C: The barrier for that goes down a lot. So now anyone is able to invest, and I think we're already seeing this in the traditional world. With angel syndicates becoming more and more strong, you're also seeing even just in traditional cap tables, like the angel allocation is going up a lot more and you're seeing multiple lead investors in every round instead of just like one big name for clout. And I think people are realizing that it takes like a village to build a community and a company. And so having one venture fund is maybe not the way to do it, but yeah, those are just my thoughts, I think.
00:35:08.430 - 00:36:36.354, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I tend to fall on the same side of extremes as meta as you're saying. I think just one other point that I think is interesting about Dows in particular is and like the broader crypto ecosystem, is that traditionally in tech you could join a company, you'll get equity in that company and your equity exposure is limited to one particular entity. And in crypto you might be able to contribute and be a part of multiple projects, whether that's via Dows or just from an engineering perspective, joining protocol teams, whatever it might be. I think we're starting to see this portfolio emerge where you're not necessarily limited to one company at a time, but you might be able to contribute to multiple projects at any given time. And it's like that's your portfolio of investments, right? It's like you're contributing with your time, your capital, your effort, everything altogether. And so I definitely agree with the idea that angel investing is becoming more and more common. I think the barriers to entry there are getting lower and I think individual angel investors are really proving out what value can be had from having a single entity on your table, on your cap table, like a single person versus the fund value prop.
00:36:36.354 - 00:37:15.650, Speaker B: And so I think we're going to see that perpetuate a little bit more into the crypto space where you're going to have Dows with a very specific offering come onto your cap table and provide that service. I don't know, we're like the design Dow and when we invest in you, we also provide you design services or we invest in XYZ and this is our core focus and this is how we contribute to you. So I'm expecting all sorts of shakeups. I'm really excited about it. I think it's going to be really fun to invest in the next 1015 years of the space and just be a part of this entire ecosystem.
00:37:16.630 - 00:37:17.042, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:37:17.096 - 00:38:05.426, Speaker C: No, I love that. And I also think there's something to be said about the human aspect. I just feel like at least in my experience, dows seem to be more approachable like as a venture fund and they're not as general. I think crypto funds are a little bit different because they're very specific and a lot of them have specific niches. But VC in general, I feel like they're so broad that it's almost hard for you to help even if you want to in the way that a company needs versus a Dow kind of to the original question askers point. They can really reflect your company's vision and your project's vision in a way that is very bespoke to what you're doing versus a kind of one size fits all venture fund just might not be able to they can provide you money, but that's kind of it. And so I think we're going to see more and more of that.
00:38:05.426 - 00:38:55.320, Speaker C: Like Kendall, what you're talking about, where maybe you go to a larger investor for purely money, but you're going to these Dows specifically for kind of like a give and take. Like, yeah, you get money and investment, but in return you also get this entire suite of services. Hiring is another one that I've seen is super popular. There's also a marketing dow. There's so many other models that I think we just haven't explored yet. And then going back to the human aspect, I think it's so much cooler to be like, oh, we're talking to these individuals who happen to be a part of this Dow but are also just like cool people in their own right and are able to help me run my company in this very specific way. Which I've just noticed those human interactions facilitated much more via Dows than a traditional fund.
00:38:56.890 - 00:39:35.300, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think there is the recent growth in just terms of diversity, diversity in terms of contributors to the crypto space that we've seen initially it started as this niche cyberpunk movement elite crypto nerds coming together and working on this technology because it was really technology first. I think we've seen that shift from really technology focused to human focus with NFPs and Dows. And I think a lot of the recent growth in terms of just new people, artists, creators coming to the space we can attribute to just the.
00:39:37.910 - 00:39:38.322, Speaker B: Idea.
00:39:38.376 - 00:39:48.790, Speaker D: Of NFDS, the idea of Dow is where right now we are focusing on the human aspect of this technology. So I'm super excited in terms of where we are in the whole crypto ecosystem.
00:39:53.130 - 00:40:22.514, Speaker A: Awesome. This was a really good note to end everything on. I feel like there are a couple of other things that are some of these some quicker questions, but I'll actually not ask that. What I'll do is I'll ask this question which I've been asking everybody here today is not even specific to comarebi, but what are some tooling that you think will be super helpful for you to make your lives easier to manage the fund or anything else that you're part of as we kind of deal with Dows? What are some things that come to mind or what are some obvious pain.
00:40:22.552 - 00:40:23.140, Speaker C: Points.
00:40:25.510 - 00:41:22.382, Speaker B: I can start. One thing that I think about a lot is the value chain of getting into a Dow and then some of the action items that you need to do. So getting onboarded, talking to members, connecting with members. I think there's a lot of low hanging fruit. This is super simple, but I would love if there was an easy tool where I could see what Dows a person is a part of. You could filter by person and say, oh, they're part of these three Dows. I'm literally talking about a directory here that would be so cool or a really great way for me to share a Dow's holdings and be able to look at, okay, what does the treasury look like? I know you can go look at a Gnosis, but I think if there was like a front end that you could track over time and there's different tools, but I think a lot of this is happening very ad hoc.
00:41:22.382 - 00:41:42.250, Speaker B: I think there needs to be a little bit more cohesion. Yeah. So I would just say think about the steps it takes to get involved in a Dow and then what are some of the quickest and easiest wins that I think we need in the space that I think will improve the overall UX?
00:41:44.990 - 00:42:33.340, Speaker D: Yeah. And just expanding that directory idea. I think it'll also be cool to not just see which DAOs particular person is involved with, but what their contributions are. It essentially replaces the traditional resume to being able to see what they've done in the past as you are kind of onboarding them to your Dow. So that's one another thing that I mentioned briefly, initially is just how do we incentivize Dao members and tooling around that? It'll be really cool if a Dow member is contributing and we can drop an NFT as an appreciation token or contribute through tokens within the Dao ecosystem. So anything that helps incentivize contributions and tooling around that would be exciting to see come out of ETH online.
00:42:35.070 - 00:43:27.850, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with all of these. I think it would also be cool to this is so simple, but like an off chain voting mechanism, but that's specifically created for Dows because I realize most decisions actually happen way before you even hit the multi SIG people don't want to do on chain voting. It's like too high friction. So either a way to lower the friction there or just make it easier than a Telegram poll to make off chain decisions. Also, just like on the whole cap table management thing, I know Syndicate is working on this, but basically a way for a venture Dow to see exactly how much of the fund you own, which assets you own, how much of the fund you own. Just like a basic dashboard, but it basically pulls in on chain data using your ETH address or your Gnosis safe address and things like that would be really helpful.
00:43:29.150 - 00:43:57.846, Speaker A: That's a really obvious good one because I'm kind of drawing some parallels on the fact that we had a similar conversation about a year ago with DeFi where everybody's like, hey, all this stuff is on chain. Let's put a dashboard and just do basic reporting so we can see what's happening. Now it's at a different scale and a much bigger problem, but now it's a lot more specific. So there's 1000 people working on this hackathon. I'm hopeful that some of them will tackle a lot of these problems. But I want to thank all of you today for this amazing conversation. One last thing for everybody.
00:43:57.846 - 00:44:05.750, Speaker A: How can people get in touch with the fund and you? And what is the best way to ping everybody about the next steps?
00:44:08.250 - 00:44:22.590, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe we can go through each of our individual socials and then I'll figure out our link for Comaribi. But for me, I'm really active on Twitter and Telegram. They're both just my name at mehta. Kotari. No spaces or dots.
00:44:23.890 - 00:44:30.910, Speaker B: Yeah, same here. Super active on Twitter. And my handle is underscore Kendall B. Shaw.
00:44:31.970 - 00:44:47.220, Speaker D: Same. We are all living and breathing on crypto. So my handle is Mansi. My first name elves and Bora. So you can find me there. You can find me on Telegram. If you want to get in touch with Comaraby, our handle is at.
00:44:50.230 - 00:45:10.778, Speaker C: Posted. Yeah, I just posted a link to our Web page. So there you can it's basically a web page hosted on Syndicate because we are a syndicate dow. And you can actually pitch directly there, which will send you to a form where you can insert your slide deck, things about your company, things like that. And you can also figure out more about our thesis and strategy on this page.
00:45:10.944 - 00:45:11.322, Speaker D: Amazing.
00:45:11.376 - 00:45:16.122, Speaker A: Yeah, we just shared that with everybody on the live stream. And thank you so much. This was awesome.
00:45:16.176 - 00:45:17.338, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you.
00:45:17.424 - 00:45:17.834, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:45:17.872 - 00:45:18.680, Speaker D: Thank you for having us.
