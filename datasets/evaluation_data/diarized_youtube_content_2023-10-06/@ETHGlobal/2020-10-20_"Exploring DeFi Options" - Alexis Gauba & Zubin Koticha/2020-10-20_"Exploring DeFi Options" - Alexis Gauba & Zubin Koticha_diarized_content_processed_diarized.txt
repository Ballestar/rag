00:00:00.090 - 00:00:10.000, Speaker A: Alexis and Zubin from Open and their talk is about DeFi options. So we're going to explore that topic and Alexis suba, I'll let you take it from.
00:00:12.880 - 00:00:14.844, Speaker B: Hey. Hey, how's it going?
00:00:15.042 - 00:00:45.850, Speaker C: Awesome. Hey y'all, let me just share screen. Okay, cool. Yeah. So today super excited to be talking about DeFi options. So we'll talk a little bit about what options are and then how they fit into this whole DeFi landscape. Okay, so the premise of this talk is we're going to chat a little bit about how one of DeFi's killer apps will be derivatives and then hop into options in particular.
00:00:45.850 - 00:01:32.250, Speaker C: And not only are options going to be a big unlock for DeFi, but DeFi is also going to be a big unlock for options themselves. Options are these traditional financial primitives that have been around for so long, but DeFi has the potential to elevate them to the next level. So what are options? They're a derivative instrument and we'll chat a little bit more about what a derivative instrument is in a second, but they can be used as tools for financial protection and insurance, also for speculation. And because they have this kind of wide variety of use cases, they create this massive market where we're seeing over $300 trillion of yearly volume for these options and they're an extremely versatile instrument which we'll get into in just a second.
00:01:33.900 - 00:03:07.700, Speaker B: Yeah, and so some of the incredible things that can be done with options are they're just so versatile and have so many use cases. One example is you can actually take any portfolio and by using a set of options on those portfolios, you can create the risk free rate. You can completely and utterly remove all the risk from a portfolio, and you can also completely remove the risk from an option itself through something called delta hedging. So there's some really incredible things you can do in order to hedge risk using options, but also options allow for the creation and expansion of an entirely new asset class, which is called volatility itself. Right? We in the crypto world know that sometimes cryptos go up, sometimes cryptos go down, but there's no way to kind of hedge yourself from this volatility, from this bumpy ride unless you have options where you can actually trade volatility itself without taking a directional bet on if ETH is going to go up and down. And there's actually a theorem that proves that using options on any asset in the world, you can create any payoff structure, so any futures contract, any other derivative. You know, you can use options in a very interesting way to create any other payoff structure and that makes them the ultimate synthetic asset.
00:03:07.700 - 00:04:07.908, Speaker B: So what is a derivative? I've just been talking about what can options do, but what are they? Well, a derivative asset, unlike an asset itself, is something whose value is based entirely on another asset, right? And so the asset that it's based on is called the underlying asset. And the derivatives that people peer probably are most familiar with might be futures and options. And what futures and options are, are they're based on a future trade that hasn't even happened yet, where you trade the underlying asset, like ETH for cash, right. And a futures contract is pretty simple. You have an obligation to make that trade in the future. And both sides are obligated to make a trade. One of them is paying ETH, another one is buying the ETH with dollars or USDC.
00:04:07.908 - 00:04:51.816, Speaker B: And since both people are obligated into this trade in the future, for one of the sides the trade is going to be profitable, the other side is going to be unprofitable. And so neither of them can back out of it. So one of the sides could make a loss when this trade happens in the future, when the future expires, essentially. And so because it's a fair trade, since both people are obligated, there's typically no initial cash flow. No one's getting kind of the better upper hand in this deal. Both of them could make a loss in the future. But in an options contract, kind of like the name suggests, one side has an obligation, the other side has the option.
00:04:51.816 - 00:05:37.830, Speaker B: And so the one who's selling the option, they essentially have to make the trade in the future. The person who bought the option, as the name of the option suggests, can choose if they want to make the trade in the future. And because they have the right to choose if they want to make that trade in the future, ETH for USDC, they could actually be flat or positive on expiry. They're never going to enter into that trade if it's costly for them, if it causes them to have a loss. So options, just like real life, are always helpful to have it's always helpful to have as many options as possible in real life. And that's why options in finance also cost money, why they're valuable. You always want to have as many options as possible.
00:05:37.830 - 00:06:06.080, Speaker B: And because options are positive in value, the person who's selling them gets premium for selling them. They get this initial cash flow. They're paid money. And the reason one way to think about it is they're entering into an obligation. The seller is obligated and they might make a loss in the future. So in order to put them into the situation of obligation, the buyer needs to pay them money. They need to pay them that premium.
00:06:09.220 - 00:06:48.572, Speaker C: So now we can chat about a couple of the different kinds of options that exist. And so there are two main options put Options and call options. Put Options give you the option to sell an underlying asset. So, for example, ETH for a specific price, which we call the strike price. And this is helpful when you think that the asset is going to go down in price. So for example, say that we have ETH at $200 and there's like a Black Thursday type of event where ETH falls to $90. If you're the holder of this option, you can still sell your ETH for $200.
00:06:48.572 - 00:07:22.408, Speaker C: So this put is giving you this protection, this hedging against ETH price falling. Now, we also have call options. And call options are the option to buy the asset. So, for example, ETH for a specific price, which again is the strike price. And this is helpful when you think the asset is going to go up. So say I have a call option for ETH at $300, and then ETH skyrockets to $1,000. Well, I can still buy ETH for cheap for $300 using my call option.
00:07:22.408 - 00:07:52.000, Speaker C: And so that's kind of the power of a call option. So one common misconception is that the opposite of buying a put is buying a call. But that is not the case. The opposite of buying a put is selling a put. So there are kind of four different types of transactions that can happen here. You can buy a put, you can sell a put, and you can buy a call, or you can sell a call. And each of these four are completely distinct with their own separate payoffs.
00:07:52.000 - 00:08:31.176, Speaker C: And then when you're buying an option, kind of like Zubin mentioned earlier, you have to pay a premium to get this optionality. In this case, you have the right to buy or sell ETH if it hits the strike price, but not the obligation. And so you have to pay the premium for that optionality. However, when you're selling the option, you are taking on an obligation. If the option buyer does exercise, you are obligated to pay them out, and so you get paid a premium for taking on that obligation. We can look at a specific example with a put option. So say we have ETH and this is a put option on ETH.
00:08:31.176 - 00:09:10.456, Speaker C: We've got a strike price of 200 USDC and it's expiring on December 31. So here this option gives me the option holder, the right to sell ETH for 200 USCC anytime before December 31. But again, that's a right, it's not an obligation. So if ETH skyrockets to 1000, I don't have to sell my ETH for $200. I just have that ability in case we end up in a Black Thursday like scenario where we've got ETH at $90 or ETH below $200 at any point. So this $200 is effectively a price floor for me. $200 is the lowest amount that I can sell my ETH at.
00:09:10.456 - 00:09:49.940, Speaker C: And so it's kind of creating this asymmetric upside payoff, which we can see here. So as ETH price goes up, I continue to earn more on my ETH, but I am capped at $200, with $200 being the lowest price I would sell my ETH at. And so that's kind of what buying a put option looks like. Now, on the other side, we have selling a put option. And you might be thinking, okay, buying a put option seems like a pretty good deal. It can give me this hedging and this kind of risk management type of property. Now, why would I want to sell a put option? Well, when you're selling a put option, you're earning this premium.
00:09:49.940 - 00:10:37.030, Speaker C: And many people kind of want to earn this premium for different reasons and different folks take different views on it. And so for some people, they think about it like they think that ETH is going to go up in price and the option buyer is only going to exercise this put option if ETH goes below $200. So they believe that ETH is going to continue to rise in price. And so if the option buyer doesn't exercise on them, then they just take their premium and leave. So that's one view that some folks will take for selling options. Another view that people will take is that they'll think about this as monetizing a limit order. So a limit order would be if I were to go to an exchange and I were to place an order to buy ETH at $200.
00:10:37.030 - 00:10:55.790, Speaker C: Here, if I'm selling an option, I'm earning a premium. And if a user or option buyer comes in exercises, then I basically have to pay them out 200 USDC. So it's like I'm buying ETH at $200. And that's another view that some folks selling options sometimes take.
00:10:58.400 - 00:11:39.960, Speaker B: So how are these options actually traded in traditional financial markets? Well, they're traded very similarly to the way that you could trade other assets as well. For example, centralized exchanges. So when you go and try to buy stocks, you would go to the New York Stock Exchange for options. Two of the major exchanges in the United States are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. And these work exactly like you would expect them to. They're run by a centralized operator and people come and buy and sell and place limited market orders as you would expect. But then there's another way which is even more popular to trade options.
00:11:39.960 - 00:12:44.860, Speaker B: And this is OTC over the counter trading. And so people make literal legal deals, like literal legal contracts for large orders off the exchange. It never touches the exchange in the first place. And so a lot of people often talk about how DeFi is going to affect centralized exchanges with things like Uniswap and AMMS affecting CFI in a real way as a Dex kind of renaissance is happening and a growth of DEXs. But how does DeFi affect OTC trading? So well, one way to think about this is to first understand why people do OTC trades. Why would you not just go to exchange to make your trade when an exchange exists, why would you go find another counterparty and do it with them? Well, the reason is there are many reasons, but one of the reasons is slippage, right? So you can imagine that there are for any asset. Let's take Tesla.
00:12:44.860 - 00:13:52.132, Speaker B: There's hundreds of different kind of potential expiries, there's hundreds of different potential strike prices for an option. So there's thousands of different options trading on just Tesla, and each of these options is a completely different contract. And so if I went to a single one of these options contract and tried to make a trade on the order book, there'd be a lot of slippage, as in there would be a big deviation on the price just from my one single trade if I was a large trader or a whale. So if I called up a counterparty and I told them that I wanted to make this trade, I could usually find a better price. We could kind of negotiate a more fair price than I would be able to get on an exchange. The other thing is customization, right? One of the reasons people like to do derivative trades, you have to remember they're legal contracts and so you can go into the terms and change them. And there's a whole class of options called exotic options, which are really advanced, which change different things about options.
00:13:52.132 - 00:14:27.052, Speaker B: There's barrier options and there's vault budget options and there's look back options, Israeli options. There's all these number of different types of options that are trading. And if I wanted to kind of get a bespoke contract, I would talk to a counterparty and we would come up with a legal framework and do that trade. The other thing is collateralization exchanges have very strict collateral requirements. Maybe I have a trusted counterparty, a friend, and we could say, let's do this with lower collateral because we trust each other. That would unlock capital efficiency. There's also custody.
00:14:27.052 - 00:15:28.900, Speaker B: Maybe we don't trust the exchange to custody our funds. Well, an example of this is in CIFI, you would have to trust Derebit, and maybe I don't trust derivIT and I trust this other counterparty, so I want to do a trade with them OTC, and then the last thing is regulatory arbitrage, right? The Derrivit example I mentioned, americans cannot use derrivit, and so maybe they are still kind of sophisticated market participants. They could call up someone else and do the trade OTC, and that may be the only way that they could get the trade done. Now, these are a lot of different reasons, but the main things to think about is that people don't necessarily trust the exchange. They trust each other and they want to create all these custom contracts. Now, Ethereum is this incredible thing where you can create custom financial contracts and where you don't have to trust your counterparty, you don't have to trust an exchange in order to have a fully collateralized position. And settlement can happen through like a blockchain itself.
00:15:28.900 - 00:16:39.688, Speaker B: And so you can imagine Ethereum being this incredible thing to replace 40, 50, 60 pages of legal paperwork that are required whenever an options trade is happening. And this is a massive unlock for the options markets. It'll also allow smaller players to enter people who are maybe not kind of attached to the large OTC markets or the large exchange traded option markets. And it allows this entire geography of individuals to access option markets, which is also really exciting unlock. And then kind of the classic things of trustlessness, the massive legal overhead of having lawyers draft up these documents and pseudonymity are things that people really love and will make Ethereum incredible for the options world. So this was kind of an upload on how options work, why they're so exciting, and why DeFi options are such a large opportunity. But one thing that we would kind of love is to be a source of education for options because they're such an exciting market.
00:16:39.688 - 00:17:30.250, Speaker B: So, some different ways you can learn about options. The first is Khan Academy has a great overview on how options work. Also, you can get started at Open Co. We are a DFI options protocol that has options trading on ethereum and number of different, ERC twenty s and as well as going to convexity open Co, that's a white paper for Open which describes options as well as DFI option spec. In more detail, if you're interested in kind of chatting with us and talking about the ability to build on Open or even kind of get help from us in building your applications, you can join our Discord. We're always happy to chat and talk about options and talk about DeFi derivatives. That's it for me.
00:17:30.250 - 00:17:35.130, Speaker B: We definitely have time for questions if people are interested.
00:17:35.900 - 00:17:47.632, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. Thank you, Alexis. Thank you, Subin. We do have a couple of questions as well, so let's just jump in. The first question is for you, Zubin. What is that on your head that I see on the live stream right now?
00:17:47.766 - 00:17:55.296, Speaker B: Oh, this is a Zoom hat. They have filters and I like this hat because it's like hat seption. I have a hat on my hat, which I like.
00:17:55.398 - 00:18:04.260, Speaker A: Okay, got it. Yeah. We had a lot of eager people wanting to know the answer to that, but now that we have that out of the way, we can move on to the less important question.
00:18:04.330 - 00:18:07.270, Speaker B: Yes, this was important. Yes, this was very important.
00:18:09.080 - 00:18:22.330, Speaker A: So what are the biggest challenges you see in kind of getting crypto? Options have been either in the past so far or in the future, kind of making this a viable product people to use?
00:18:23.020 - 00:19:00.710, Speaker B: This is a really great question and Alexis also has a lot of thoughts on this as well. But from my perspective, one big thing is capital efficiency. In traditional finance, there's a lot of crazy trust relationships and people know each other and there's a strong legal framework in kind of place there. And so sometimes you only have to put one dollars down for an options contract with a strike of $100. And so you can imagine that there's a lot of leverage. You can be 100 x leveraged or even more. Right.
00:19:00.710 - 00:19:23.004, Speaker B: And in DFI, where people don't trust each other, they don't know each other, it's much more difficult. And so that's been a big challenge. But for Open V Two, we're working on some pretty crazy solutions that make options much more capital efficient in DeFi. Alexis, do you have kind of also yeah, no, definitely.
00:19:23.042 - 00:19:42.470, Speaker C: Capital efficiency is a huge one. I think another big thing is education. Like Zubin was talking about, for the first time, these products are going to be available to anyone, anywhere. And so a big part of that is also teaching people about what are the best ways to use these things and making sure that they're interacting with them in a safe manner and that they really understand what's going on.
00:19:43.560 - 00:20:17.368, Speaker A: That's interesting. I'd love to dig into that for a second because I think that's kind of a challenge that a lot of DeFi products might face. These are traditionally heaven products for sophisticated investors, market makers, et cetera. And now there's this idea that anyone with a cell phone can use them. Should we expect the average person to actually want to use these sophisticated products, or are they going to be bundled into a very kind of simple platform, simple product for the average person with complex stuff happening behind the scenes?
00:20:17.544 - 00:21:13.200, Speaker C: I think that's a really great question and definitely something that a lot of DeFi projects are probably tackling right now. I think one of the most powerful parts is that we have all of these protocol layers. Like, we have this options protocol that anyone can build anything on top of, so you can have a sophisticated interface for people that are really familiar with finance and want that kind of experience. And then you can also have interfaces that are specifically tailored to folks that want to kind of gain the power of these instruments, but not necessarily wanting to be confused with all of the intricacies that are happening in the background. And there are some really powerful properties that this unlocks in terms of hedging and protection that just weren't available in DeFi before. And so those kinds of things would be really helpful for lots of people to be able to access in a way that is understandable, in a way that they do know what's going on, in a way that is easy to access. And so I think with the protocol being available to everyone at the smart contract there, we can really build applications for different audiences on top, which is exciting.
00:21:13.860 - 00:22:00.770, Speaker B: Yeah. And to add to that, I think it's very important that DeFi builders express that DeFi is still very kind of early. There's a lot of protocol level risk, there's consensus level risk, there's risks that exist in terms of regulatory. So I would say that as a user, it's very important to educate yourself and understand that there are risks in everything you use in DeFi. This still is the Wild West, I think, as many folks in DeFi like to say. And it's important that if you use these protocols, you kind of to a certain extent, try to understand what's going on under the hood. And I think that's also, as Alexis mentioned, a big challenge is education.
00:22:02.660 - 00:22:16.500, Speaker A: Great. And then so one more question we've got, and this is directly from Chat, it might require some disambiguation from you. How do these options get efficiently priced if they are all decentralized?
00:22:17.160 - 00:23:02.980, Speaker B: This is a great question. So there's many different ways. But the thing is, for us, our options are ERC twenty s, and as such they can be put onto Uniswap and then people can trade on Uniswap. And Uniswap obviously has like the constant factor function to come up with the new price after a trade, before a trade, et cetera. So the way we do it right now is that we seed pools on Uniswap and then the market kind of will determine the price. From then on, we are working on a option specific AMM that responds to the market as well and reprices them. But our goal is like, we don't think any centralized entity should ever price these things.
00:23:02.980 - 00:23:09.270, Speaker B: It should be the market and supply and demand forces that are pricing them. And that's what Uniswap functions for right now.
00:23:11.800 - 00:23:21.964, Speaker A: Great. Okay. Well, thank you, Alexis. Thank you, Zubin. Really appreciate you having you both on with us today. Great last talk to wrap up DeFi. Love it.
00:23:21.964 - 00:23:23.340, Speaker A: Really appreciate it.
00:23:23.490 - 00:23:25.870, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks so much, everyone.
00:23:26.960 - 00:23:28.280, Speaker A: Thank you. Bye.
