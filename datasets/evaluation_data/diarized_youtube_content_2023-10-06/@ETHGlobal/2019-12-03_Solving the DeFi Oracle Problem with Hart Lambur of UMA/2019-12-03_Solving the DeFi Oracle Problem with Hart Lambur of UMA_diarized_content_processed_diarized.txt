00:00:08.930 - 00:00:55.890, Speaker A: So I'll get into it. Okay, so just 2 seconds on what universal market access or uma, or uma, we say what it is and what we're trying to do. So we look at it as a decentralized financial contract platform, really trying to build infrastructure, let people like you guys build financial products on Ethereum. The mission really is market access. So this really cool idea that hey, we could actually create financial products that are actually globally accessible and not tied to your local beyond government jurisdiction. And also guys like Interrupted, there's really two parts to what we're doing. They're what we're calling self enforcing contract patterns.
00:00:55.890 - 00:01:35.970, Speaker A: Mouthful. But what we really mean on the contract design patterns? Yes, on the contract design patterns. These are going to be contract types or contract templates that let us create useful financial products on blockchains. Examples are like what we're promoting for our bounty, synthetic asset tokenization. So let's create a token that tracks some synthetic assets in the real world. These could also be swaps and derivatives like a decentralized fitness or all kinds of other. And then the second part of that is this Oracle concept, this Oracle that's going to power and provide real world data onto the blockchain that drives those financial contracts.
00:01:35.970 - 00:02:14.734, Speaker A: So these two concepts we think interact in both what we're doing, the financial contract templates are totally free, totally accessible. The Oracle is our solution to powering how we resolve disputes. So what we want to talk about is this idea of adding economic incentives to Oracle. Economic guarantee. So why do economic guarantees matter for Oracle? So it's a useful analogy, and again guys, I'm keeping this pretty theoretical. So if you're all like sleep deprived, some of this might be like but ask questions. A useful analogy here is to think about contracts in the fi world.
00:02:14.734 - 00:03:01.434, Speaker A: So stating the obvious, legal contracts are really useful. They let us build our modern financial system. And all these types of financial contracts, they depend on counterparties believing in the contract and the reference data cannot be manipulated. So here we've got just a theoretical example of Alice and Bob. They write a financial contract for a million bucks and it depends on some price of some external reference. They're both happy to do this under the state of Massachusetts law because they believe mostly that the court system, the state of Massachusetts, can't be corrupted. And there's laws in the fiat world super useful this concept of laws against fraud and manipulation that mean if Bob here tried to go and bribe the data source for that contract, he's going to go to jail.
00:03:01.434 - 00:03:46.540, Speaker A: And you could literally think about that economically as Bob having a huge economic cost to attempt to bribe the cost. So here goes. J the problem or really the opportunity is in the blockchain world there is no concept of fraud in this pseudo anonymous permissionless blockchain system like Ethereum. There's no laws against fraud or bribery. You can think of that actually as like a feature, not a bug. But it means that there's nothing to prevent Bob from corrupting an Oracle system or a data reference of any sort. And so what that means is Bob can totally go ahead and bribe or corrupt any Oracle out there.
00:03:46.540 - 00:04:07.706, Speaker A: And when you think about this, this scales to be a really big problem. So we had this million dollar theoretical contract that Alice and Bob entered into where Bob could steal half of it. Theoretically he could steal 500 grand if he were to corrupt this Oracle system. But now scale that up and Bob is pseudonymous, you don't know who he is. And he reads contracts with Alice. Charlie.
00:04:07.738 - 00:04:08.170, Speaker B: David.
00:04:08.250 - 00:05:02.340, Speaker A: Fred. Whatever. Right? Now all of a sudden he can steal two and a half million dollars by corrupting this internal price reference and of course the scales to unlimited size. So Bob can theoretically have a massive incentive for corrupting. So our point here of all this is that in a permissionless blockchain like ethereum private economic incentives are the only tool we have to incentivize behavior if we're not going to go back and use our legal system if we're going to really live in this new world. And so that's why we argue that economic guarantees here matter. In order to be able to trust that a smart contract that relies on off chain inputs is going to do what it says it's going to do, we need to somehow prove that there is no economic incentive to corrupt the Oracle or the price reference that this contract depends on.
00:05:02.340 - 00:05:29.414, Speaker A: Guys, with me so far so get through this. This talks about chainlink. Chainlink is great for a second I'm just talking about the different types of Oracle systems here. There's other systems that are really useful for providing constant API programmatic API access. What we're talking about is a little bit different. We're talking about something that is like more asynchronous, more expensive, but can really guarantee that the price source is not corrupted. And again I'm going to look through some of these slides.
00:05:29.414 - 00:06:20.042, Speaker A: There's a lot of we build, what did I say, how do we build an Oracle with economic guarantees? So we define this concept of an honest Oracle and there's two sort of subconcepts here. We start with this idea that any Oracle on a blockchain is corruptible because our only tool is private economic incentives to incentivize behavior. It means that there is always some amount of money that you can pay somebody on some blockchain system or off chain price source or whatever to corrupt it. And so we define then that the lowest cost at which you can corrupt the system. We define that as our cost of corruption. Separately. If you were to corrupt this Oracle system there's all these contracts and all this value theoretically linked to it.
00:06:20.042 - 00:07:04.086, Speaker A: What is the maximum profit, what is the configuration of the universe in which you could steal the most money. We define that as our profit. And then putting this together, we have our kind of definition of what an honest oracle looks like. An honest oracle is one where you can prove that the cost of corrupting this oracle system is always greater than the profit you could make if you were to corrupt it. Does that make sense? Yeah, just like an irrational you don't. So this does defend that there's rational economic actors and actually get really nerdy for a second. You can make an argument that say Jamie Dimon at JT.
00:07:04.086 - 00:07:46.860, Speaker A: Morgan doesn't like this future finance world and so he spends $50 million to go and blow this thing up. Right. And that actually might be rational for him as like a one time attack. But this is actually albert mentioned this in the Prisoners Dilemma. If you turn it into an iterative game, it doesn't make sense anymore because this is just going to pop back up and Jamie Diamond can't pay $50 million every time to shut it down. So ultimately, rational economic incentives you can make an argument will win out in the end as this thing gets tangential. Anything else, guys? Okay, just to explain this concept with our little diagram here.
00:07:46.860 - 00:08:11.910, Speaker A: So Alice and Bob have their million dollar contract. The profit from corruption is how much money you can steal from this contract. If you could control the price input. In this example, Bob could steal half the contract that's not his 500 grand. Alex steal 500 grand corruption. This 500 grand number. Our cost of corruption is whatever would cost Bob to go and bribe the external price reference to corrupt this system.
00:08:11.910 - 00:09:02.550, Speaker A: Okay, so then how do we go about actually building this oracle with economic guarantee? It is three step process. Create a system to measure this cost of corruption, create a system to measure the profit from corruption and the design of a mechanism to keep these two quantities to keep this inequality in check and prove it all works. So that's what we're going to try to do. I'm keeping this high level, got lots of white paper and other resources and go a lot deeper on this, but high level how we do these three things. So we measure our cost of corruption with tradable voting rights. So here we have a token where token holders have a voting right. Their voting power is weighted by the number of tokens they have.
00:09:02.550 - 00:09:36.370, Speaker A: And we use a shelling point style system where voters vote on price requests or price disputes here. And they're paid a reward for voting correctly, voting with the majority they're charged a penalty for. Not, the game theory behind this is that it's like the 51% attack on proof of work networks. As long as there's an honest majority, the system will vote result correctly, which allows us then to measure our cost of corruption. Our cost of corruption is whatever it costs to buy 51% of the voting power.
00:09:37.380 - 00:09:40.592, Speaker C: Yeah, or borrow 51% of the voting power.
00:09:40.726 - 00:10:16.270, Speaker A: Not exactly. Right. So this gets really interesting here too, where if you could borrow 51% of the voting power, you win for sure. But then you've got to think through what the economic incentives of the lenders of the voting rights are. If you're lending your voting rights here, it's not like you're lending something really valuable. So you really should be very fearful of lending your voting rights to the wrong person, because if you lend them really cheap, then someone can corrupt this thing. And this voting right that you had that was valuable goes to zero.
00:10:16.270 - 00:10:46.016, Speaker A: But it's like a really interesting line of thinking about like, okay, what happens if people do lend their voting rights? What are the economic question? Yeah. So what does it mean to vote correctly? Majority majority rules. Which is also a really interesting question. Right. It's like you get really philosophical, like, what is the truth here? The truth is whatever the majority says. Yeah. Get really philosophical on it.
00:10:46.016 - 00:11:35.012, Speaker A: But it's an interesting question when you actually think through some kind of real world examples that are kind of fun to think about. You guys remember the Coinbase flash crash, right, where I forget whether it was ETH of Bitcoin, actually, or the price dropped like 50%. These types of flash crashes happen in other traditional financial markets too. Do you consider that a good price or not? Is that price considered accurate or not? And the answer is it depends. Right. So like the CME, when this happens with traditional futures contracts, they decide whether they want to honor those prices and consider that real or not real. In this case, if you think about it from this context, whether that happens or not, whether it's considered a good price or not, would be up to the majority.
00:11:35.012 - 00:12:13.700, Speaker A: What do people think? Okay, I'm probably going to take something. Second part, measuring our profit from corruption. So when we go back to the individual contract, it's easy on an individual contract to figure out what the profit corruption is. How much money could get stolen out of that contract if an attacker were to control this price feed. So our system wide profit corruption number simply sums all of the contracts using the system. And it's like a worst case analysis. In the worst case, how much money could be drained in the system by an attacker if they were on one side of all these contracts.
00:12:13.700 - 00:12:26.520, Speaker A: In order for us to measure that, contracts have to register with the Oracle or with what we're calling our DBN or Data Verification Mechanism to allow us to calculate the system wide PSP.
00:12:27.180 - 00:12:29.864, Speaker B: Is it possible to have parasitic interest level?
00:12:30.062 - 00:12:59.568, Speaker A: It is. We have a super interesting parasitic usage solution which involves some zero knowledge stuff. I'm not the best guy to speak on it. It's in our white paper at a high level and it's something actually that we're going to be talking about more. It's really damn cool, but we think we have a theoretical solution on how to get around that in the early days. We're not going to worry about it. Yeah.
00:12:59.654 - 00:13:01.308, Speaker C: What's parasitic usage?
00:13:01.404 - 00:13:55.030, Speaker A: Sorry? This whole concept of measuring our profit corruption is premised on the fact that we know what's using the system. If we don't know what's using the system, then we can't measure it and economics and you can then make an argument, well, wait, if there is a cost for using this system, and people don't have to tell us they're using it, well, then there's an incentive to parasitically use the system. Auger kind of introduced the term, at least there was first person that used it. Auger introduced the term parasitic usage where if the parasites get too big, they kill the host. And I think it's a great analogy. We again do have a solution for how we can absolutely limit who can use the system. And yeah, it's a fun thing to talk about.
00:13:55.030 - 00:14:33.260, Speaker A: Okay, so we got part one done, we can measure our cost of corruption. We got part two, we can measure our profit corruption, barring this parasitic question. Right. Part three, how do we enforce this inequality where we make sure that the cost of corrupting the system is greater than what you could steal. And we do this with what we're calling a variable fee policy, or variable tax policy, where, if and when the cost of corrupting the system approaches the floor. So basically, as that inequality gets threatened, we levy attacks on the users of our system. So these are on the contracts using the system.
00:14:33.260 - 00:15:25.850, Speaker A: We charge them a fee and we use that fee to purchase the voting rights in the open market to support the market cap of the cost of corruption. And because we do this programmatically on the blockchain, it's completely credible and it's going to happen. So we have this very cool circular effect right. Where actually users of the system, third party speculators, if they see this inequality getting threatened, they know that this market force is going to come and start buying tokens. So arguably you can think of third party speculators having a free option as the market price approaches this floor. That's probably the funkiest part. We'll go in a bit more detail on it, but that's like the high level of how we lean towards this inequality.
00:15:25.850 - 00:15:29.562, Speaker A: Yeah. Would you ever admit tokens if one.
00:15:29.616 - 00:15:31.180, Speaker C: Is much less than the other?
00:15:34.430 - 00:16:09.894, Speaker A: No, I don't think so. Thinking about this from a business perspective, you think about what a business tries to do. They try to maximize profitability, they want to create the most money possible, and in that case they might issue shares or something. If their share price is really high, they go try to raise more money or something like that. Right. In our case, what's really interesting is we are not trying to maximize profit. We are only trying to ensure this inequality stays in check.
00:16:09.894 - 00:16:43.826, Speaker A: So it's like we want to make sure that we're going to charge enough. We're going to charge enough fees to make sure this inequality stays in check, but no more. And actually, it's kind of really interesting. This is the fun shit about this ethereum blockchain crypto stuff. That's a fun and interesting weird business model to think about where, hey, you're trying to make enough money just to guarantee the security of the system, but you're not trying to extract red task value. All right, there's some math here. Do you guys want to go to the math? No? Yeah.
00:16:43.826 - 00:17:28.110, Speaker A: All right. So to measure the cost of corruption, an attacker must control half of all participating tokens. So what I mean by participating tokens is if there's a lot of voting rights out there that aren't voting right, they don't actually secure the system. So we have this ada parameter that's just the percentage of non participating tokens. So our Y value here is the number of token rights that half of the participating token supply that an attacker would need to control the corruption system. Then our cost of corruption is then the price at which it costs to buy these tokens. We call that our cost of corruption.
00:17:28.110 - 00:18:13.540, Speaker A: This is actually pretty simple. This is just what I said in words. Measuring our profit from corruption is simply the summation of all individual contracts from corruption numbers that gives us our system wide PSE number. Then we rearrange and solve for this inequality. So we put those two things together and we solve for the price of the token that needs to be maintained to keep the system secure under this cost of corruption. Corruption framework. And basically what it's saying is we need twice the profit of corruption divided by the participating token supply.
00:18:13.540 - 00:19:05.738, Speaker A: And if you just to put some real world numbers around this, if we assume that the contracts in the system are symmetric, let's say we have going back to the Bob Allison example, we have that million dollar contract. Let's say we have $100 million of contracts in the system, total margin in the system. At any given point in time, the profit of corruption will be $50 million, half the value of the system, which means we need the cost of half of the voting rights to be more than $50 million. Multiply everything by two. We need the market cap of these voting rights to be greater than the total margin in our system. This is a short presentation, so I'm not going to go like, full speed and then add this last thing we create like a buffer. So we call it a safe price.
00:19:05.738 - 00:19:38.222, Speaker A: As a buffer above this floor price, we call it our safe price. Okay, so then how do we maintain the safe target? This is just through this programmatic buyback. So every period, every voting period, we calculate what our target price is by observing the system wide profit corruption. We look at what the current price of the market cap is. If the system is below where it should be, we levy at tax, we calculate the fee we need to keep the system secure. We levy attacks and we conduct a buyback. And we do this repeatedly.
00:19:38.222 - 00:21:14.650, Speaker A: This is like central bank's maintaining currency pay. We do this repeatedly and programmatically more math. But what's really cool about this, so what this actually looks like is sort of a perverted discounted cash flow model for traditional companies, where the value of a company's stock at any given point is the market's expectation of all future dividends. In this model, the value of our voting token is the market's expectation of all future buybacks, of all future taxes. And what's really cool about that is that in the early days of the system, when there is growth expected in use of the Oracle, the market will put the price based on that expectation above the floor, above where it should be. Which means that in the early days of the system, it's costless to use the Oracle system. Whereas long as there's an expectation of growth, it's costless to use this Oracle that we think is kind of cool and kind of wild, where we're actually able to use economic incentive we're actually able to use the expectation of future buybacks to subsidize the cost of using the Oracle system in literally all right, so where are we in implementation? We have a white paper that's out.
00:21:14.650 - 00:21:48.416, Speaker A: This whole presentation, guys, is linked in the Discord Channel and elsewhere, and it's all on our GitHub. There's a Tweet storm that you guys can check out that summarizes. Some of these concepts kind of goes through what I've talked about here. We would love feedback on this white paper and feedback on the mechanism and critiques on this whole way of thinking about the world. Love that. We also have our code out and it's on testnet. It's all up, it's live.
00:21:48.416 - 00:22:27.744, Speaker A: We've actually built this thing. It is d one, right? It doesn't do every it doesn't have all of our feature set, but this is more than theoretical and again, would love any feedback or critique on it. And then, yeah, these are the four of us that are here. Come find us and talk to us about this. Remember, we're here actually doing the more concrete thing. We've got this synthetic token thing, right, where you can go and use our system, our infrastructure, to build a synthetic token to track real world assets. This is an example of a use case of DeFi use case that then plugs into our Oracle on the back end.
00:22:27.744 - 00:22:39.360, Speaker A: So this whole talk is about this theoretical Oracle undertaking this thing and that's it. And actually, I think I sort of followed time mostly.
00:22:42.440 - 00:22:47.350, Speaker B: How are you making money off of this thing? How are you going to support your business?
00:22:48.760 - 00:23:49.274, Speaker A: In true crypto form, we don't want to have a business. We just want to own some of the token supply. So the whole premise of this is that these voting tokens should be valuable. If we can make this Oracle be useful as this dispute resolution mechanism, this Oracle last resort, that is truly decentralized, if we can make that a useful thing, these voting tokens will go up in value. And so we actually want to provide a lot of shit for free. A lot of shit that's just open contributions, specifically when it comes to financial contract infrastructure. So stuff that just needs some Oracle, we want to provide that all for free, like our synthetic tokenization contracts and other things purely out of the intention that these DeFi contracts that DeFi will grow and will use and are Oracle increasing the value? Yeah.
00:23:49.392 - 00:24:20.754, Speaker C: So then would one path to profitability be to either set up a consortium or join one, or basically like a mass of, let's say, ISDA members, and then try to get them in on this bone token and then try to in some weird post what is it? Post Basil, whatever it's called, try to bring some of those OTC contracts on chain so that and then through that. Is that what you guys are thinking.
00:24:20.792 - 00:25:14.146, Speaker A: Or is that like a route maybe? So to give everybody else some context, ISDA stands for International Swaps and Derivatives Association. They are like the main association that actually writes the legal templates for institutional derivative traders. I think it's interesting, right. But frankly, we're just much more interested in the grassroots approach where institutional derivatives work well, right? They work well enough if you've got $100 million and you want to like trade shade, go for it, right. We're really much more interested in creating a system or creating a D Five thing where if you think about what our name is, universal market access, we're much more interested in how we can create synthetic financial contracts or this global financial infrastructure. And look at this as a grassroots thing. So token distribution, we're not doing some crazy token launch.
00:25:14.146 - 00:25:41.844, Speaker A: We're going to do this very organically and to spread these tokens out to people that will vote. The one thing we care a lot about is voter participation. So we want these tokens to be spread far and wide and pretty organically and pretty grassroots e. And frankly, I think it is a long, long way before institutional counterparties care about doing something quite this radical. Yeah.
00:25:42.042 - 00:25:54.372, Speaker B: Another question, I've made it in white paper. I didn't see, but you outlined clearly the demand for the token. But under what conditions are you going to sell this?
00:25:54.526 - 00:25:55.340, Speaker A: How does it work?
00:25:55.410 - 00:26:07.090, Speaker B: Do you have anything to sell the token if it's to balance the cost and the profits, are you selling back it at any point in time?
00:26:10.340 - 00:26:16.420, Speaker A: Kind of like in equilibrium in the future? Yeah, in the near term. Like, what is the token distribution?
00:26:16.840 - 00:26:30.344, Speaker B: You're worried about the cost being less than the profit. Right. So you would buy to make it more expensive to corrupt the system. Does it work in the other way?
00:26:30.462 - 00:27:00.908, Speaker A: That's interesting. So we don't think it needs to because in the other way, basically, if the token value is trading way above where it needs to, that should be market expectations of future usage. And the whole thing just means the system is more secure. Right now, what I care a little bit about is like rape and speculation or that kind of shit, that's sort of bad. But I think we just use words and rhetoric to kind of temper people's expectations and keep them level headed.
00:27:01.004 - 00:27:03.180, Speaker B: So there's always demand for the token?
00:27:03.340 - 00:27:07.052, Speaker A: Essentially. Yeah. This is like a fixed supply.
00:27:07.116 - 00:27:09.120, Speaker B: Fixed supply, but always the demand.
00:27:10.600 - 00:27:56.080, Speaker A: Can you say a little bit more about how the fees are collected? Yeah, so there's a few different implementations or possible implementations that we've looked at. What we do right here is there's basically like a notice, it's almost like a tax notice that gets issued by the Oracle. It's easy to get collected and because we have this registry, the way the interface for the contract using the Oracle is written, we want to be able to go in and collect those taxes on close to real time basis. But in all honesty, this isn't all totally finalized or settled. So it's still sort of there's a few different possible implementations on how we and frankly, we'd love feedback.
