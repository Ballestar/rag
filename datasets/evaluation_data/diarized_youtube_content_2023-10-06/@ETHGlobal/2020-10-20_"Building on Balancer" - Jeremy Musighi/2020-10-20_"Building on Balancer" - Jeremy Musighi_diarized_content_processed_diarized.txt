00:00:00.170 - 00:00:12.240, Speaker A: Jeremy, who is going to be talking about building on Balancer and sort of what you can enable for your audience as a developer and also as a user. So I see Jeremy is already here and I'll let him kick off with his presentation. So welcome.
00:00:13.090 - 00:00:22.462, Speaker B: Thank you. Let me go ahead and share screen. All right. Is that working?
00:00:22.596 - 00:00:24.126, Speaker A: We're all good to go?
00:00:24.308 - 00:00:28.422, Speaker B: Great. So, yeah.
00:00:28.556 - 00:00:29.094, Speaker A: Hi, everyone.
00:00:29.132 - 00:01:52.880, Speaker B: I'm Jeremy Musigi. I'm the head of growth at Balancer Labs and I'm going to be talking about how Balancer is being used as a building block for decentralized finance. So first I'll start with a quick overview of what Balancer is and how it works on a high level. Balancer is a fundamental building block for DeFi and it makes a lot of different applications, products and services possible, both by allowing developers to reinvent systems of traditional finance, but also by allowing people to create all new innovations that never existed before because they weren't really possible with the tools that were available. So essentially, Balancer is a generalized AMM protocol and in that sense, it shares some similarities with Uniswap. But structurally, the two protocols are actually fairly different. And I think by the end of this presentation, you'll see that Balancer and Uniswap are actually very different.
00:01:52.880 - 00:03:05.714, Speaker B: To start, Balancer has the flexibility to create liquidity pools beyond simply a 50 50 split between two assets. You can create liquidity pools that can skew their weights as far as 98% in one and 2% in the other, but you can also create pools that hold up to eight different assets. So kind of the main point that I want to get across and that I'll be illustrating is that Balancer is a primitive for people to build and innovate on top of. So Balancer liquidity pools are smart contracts that hold between two and eight tokens. And these tokens are held in balance with each other according to preset weights. And these weights represent a proportion of the total value of a pool that is held in each token. And every Balancer pool is created with customizable configurations such as the tokens specifically that are allowed in that pool.
00:03:05.714 - 00:04:21.466, Speaker B: For example, ETH or any ERC, 20 token, as well as the weights of those tokens and the swap fee that that pool will charge for trades that are made with that pool. So users who interact with Balancer can be split into four groups. First being the liquidity providers who provide assets to pools on Balancer and earn passive income from fees as well as having their portfolio automatically rebalanced. The second is the traders who come to Balancer to exchange tokens with low slippage and favorable rates. The third being smart contracts that are seeking to source liquidity, for example, Dex aggregators or Smart Wallets. But definitely many other use cases for those types of integrations as well. And fourth would be the Arbitragers who come to Balancer seeking to profit from imbalances in price that occur in balancer pools.
00:04:21.466 - 00:05:07.962, Speaker B: And by trading those opportunities, they serve a very key role on the protocol in quickly putting those pools back into balance according to their set weights. So I'm going to cover the types of pools that exist on balancer. So anyone can create a balancer pool. And there are two general types. Shared pools. When you create one, you set the configurations as mentioned before, and those configurations are finalized as soon as the pool goes live. And at that point, they can no longer be reconfigured.
00:05:07.962 - 00:05:57.242, Speaker B: And this allows shared pools to be trustless. And because they're trustless, anyone is allowed to add or remove liquidity. Anyone can be a liquidity provider for a shared pool, and the creator of a shared pool has no additional rights compared to anybody else. And there's no controller for shared pools. So private pools are different, because when you create a private pool, you'll also set your configurations. However, they can be changed anytime after the pool is already live and the creator of a private pool becomes the controller of that pool. And only the controller can add or remove liquidity to a private pool.
00:05:57.242 - 00:06:45.818, Speaker B: So not anyone can be a liquidity provider to a private pool. There's a gate there and there's a controller who you would need to go through. Gatekeeper. Yeah, that was the word I was looking for. So I'll go through one sample use case for each type of pool. There are many use cases, so this is just a limited view. So for shared pools, anyone who wants to earn passive income and automatically rebalance their portfolio can create or join a shared pool.
00:06:45.818 - 00:07:44.290, Speaker B: And for doing so, they will receive BPts balancer pool tokens which represent their portfolio ownership in that pool. And you can think of this sort of like an index fund. Private pools can be used by a professional money manager who creates a private pool to allocate funds based on their own dynamic investing strategy. And as the controller of that pool, they would regulate who is able to invest in that fund. And so this can be seen more similarly to a hedge fund. So, third type of balancer pool is smart pools. These are private pools with a few modifications that give them certain superpowers.
00:07:44.290 - 00:08:46.280, Speaker B: The controller of a smart pool is a smart contract. And that smart contract acts as a gateway for anyone to add or remove liquidity trustlessly into a private pool structure. And the controller, as in a private pool, is granted rights to make changes to the configuration of the pool. However, those rights are specified during the creation of the pool and they can't be changed. So they can be limited in that sense. And that is transparent to all of the liquidity providers who would be interacting with that pool. So, for example, if a smart pool was created, that gave the controller the right and the ability to adjust the weights of the pool while it's live.
00:08:46.280 - 00:10:10.318, Speaker B: Anyone who is interacting with that pool would clearly be able to see that the smart pool has that power, but it does not have the power to change which tokens are in the pool, or the swap fee, for example. So a smart contract controller can connect to any other smart contract on the ethereum network and therefore it can act and make decisions based on events that are occurring outside of balancer. So any on chain information that is on the ethereum blockchain can be leveraged in that way. And this is where things really get interesting. So I'm going to cover a few of the use cases, real use cases of smart pools on balancer. And I want to note that most likely we have not discovered even a fraction of the potential use cases for smart pools, which is really exciting because this is a new technology and essentially a new innovation. It'll be interesting to see what people come up with.
00:10:10.318 - 00:11:27.510, Speaker B: But I'm going to go through a few of the things that have been done so far, or that have been imagined at least. So the first use case is managed index funds. The first ever smart pool was created and launched by Pydal and they use balancer smart pools as the underlying infrastructure for their crypto index fund products. And this allows investors to passively invest in diversified tokenized index funds which are designed to give them consistent returns with managed risk. So examples of these index fund products that Pydow offers there's the DeFi plus L and DeFi Plus S. Those are balancer smart pools that hold large cap DeFi tokens and small cap DeFi tokens respectively. There's the USD Plus Plus, which is a balancer smart pool that holds four different USD stablecoins which enables investors to maintain risk managed exposure to the US dollar via strictly crypto.
00:11:27.510 - 00:13:12.970, Speaker B: And there's the BTC Plus Plus, which is a smart pool holding four different wrapped or synthetic BTC assets so that investors can use that to gain risk managed exposure to bitcoin within the ethereum blockchain. Example of managed index funds on balancer is Realty, which is a platform for tokenized real estate investment properties. And realty token holders receive rent from the rental properties that they own through these realty tokens and it's converted into dai and paid to them as a dividend. And so using balancer smart pools, Realty can create an index fund which is a single token that represents diversified real estate investments. So an example of this concept is that Realty could, for example, create a California real estate index fund via a smart pool that contains tokens for properties in various cities in California, like San Francisco, La. San Diego. And the way that this is possible is that you can create meta pools on Balancer, which is a pool of pools.
00:13:12.970 - 00:14:17.406, Speaker B: So let's say, for example, that there is a smart pool for a certain neighborhood in Los Angeles, contains eight properties in that neighborhood, which are represented by eight different tokens. And that token from that pool is put together into another pool along with tokens from other properties in other neighborhoods throughout La. And that meta pool is then like an La. Real estate pool. And then you have your San Francisco real estate pool, you have your Sacramento real estate pool and so on. Each of those pools also has a token that represents the ownership in that entire pool. So if you took all of those tokens from those metapools, you could create yet another level of metapool, which represents basically diversified investment throughout the entire state through one token, which is pretty cool.
00:14:17.406 - 00:15:38.278, Speaker B: And you don't have to stop there. You could keep going up additional levels where there are regional pools, there could be national pools, et cetera. Really cool stuff. So another use case for balancer Smart Pools is Token Sales, what we call Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools or LBPs. And that's a very exciting name, but it is actually a really exciting use case that is gaining traction as a new mechanism for fair and transparent token sales as an alternative to other ido mechanisms. So a general example of how this could work is that let's say that Crypto protocol is launching their new token and they deploy a smart pool that contains their token as well as a reserve asset such as USDC. And they can create that pool with 90% weight towards their token and 10% weight towards the reserve asset.
00:15:38.278 - 00:16:51.470, Speaker B: They can set a duration for a three day token sale. And then while the sale is live, which is while the pool is live, they can gradually adjust the weights of the pool so that they skew in the opposite direction from where they started. So they start 90 ten and they, over the course of three days, can skew towards 1090, meaning that at the end of this three day period, the weights of the pool will be 10% network token, 90% USDC. And so the result of this is that the project has exchanged the majority of those tokens that they deposited into the pool for USDC and they have raised money for their protocol. So the first team that did this was Perpetual protocol. They did the first ever LBP a few weeks ago, and the second team actually just did it yesterday over the last 24 hours. I think it may have just ended right now.
00:16:51.470 - 00:17:42.550, Speaker B: It's October 16. And that was by the rally team. So another use case is smart treasuries. This is based on a concept originated by Joel Monegro, who's a partner at Placeholder VC, which is an investor in Balancer Labs. And the idea is for crypto protocols to use Balancer Smart Pools to create a smart treasury that is then controlled either by the team or by a Dow. And it's quite a complex but fascinating concept. And because of time constraints, I'm not going to dive into it, but I highly recommend reading the blog post on the Placeholder blog.
00:17:42.550 - 00:18:51.320, Speaker B: It's called Stop Burning Tokens and it proposes balancer smart pools as a solution for replacing the buyback and burn model with a buyback and make model. So a few teams are already working on implementing this and Aragon is leading the way on that. So definitely check that article out to learn more. Last use case that I'll go over is surge pricing for trades. So in moments of high liquidity demand in the crypto markets, people are less sensitive to minor differences in trading fees if they need liquidity right away. So to capitalize on that, one could create a smart pool that dynamically changes its swap fees in reaction to market conditions by charging higher fees in times of heavy demand. So this is a concept that's similar to uber surge pricing when a lot of people are trying to get a.
00:18:51.320 - 00:20:12.346, Speaker B: So no one has implemented this idea yet, but it's also an interesting one. Last thing I'm going to cover briefly is the Balancer Ecosystem Fund, where we provide grants and bounties to developers who are building on balancer. So bounties are ideas that come from our community and from our team that we specifically want to fund developers to build. So we would post those out there and any developer who thinks that they can do it can basically claim that bounty and build it and get funded. And grants are projects that developers will come up with and pitch to us for funding. The Ecosystem Fund is currently somewhere around 70 million USD in value, and we'll have a new announcement coming up pretty soon with regard to the Ecosystem Fund, so definitely stay tuned for that. And that's all.
00:20:12.346 - 00:20:13.860, Speaker B: So thank you very much.
00:20:21.670 - 00:20:54.030, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, Jeremy, for that amazing presentation. We have a couple questions coming in from the chat. We have a slight lag in everybody seeing what I'm saying and I'm hearing this. So we'll kind of coordinate our questions as they come in. And in case we can't do that in real time enough, I'll encourage you to just join the chat after and just answer these questions to the people directly. So the first question that we have is a quick clarification on how things are set up from the back end of the contract side.
00:20:54.030 - 00:21:11.460, Speaker A: And the question is kind of going from controller pool to a private pool, is that a taxable event in the sense that the tokens themselves get swapped and traded? So it's by us laws. Does that create, to your knowledge, a taxable event or is that a seamless record change?
00:21:12.710 - 00:21:24.690, Speaker B: So controlled pools and private pools are the same. Those are two words for the same thing. Maybe if you mean like shared pool.
00:21:24.770 - 00:21:31.082, Speaker A: We'Re just reading the questions directly, so maybe I'll ask the person who asked this question to clarify if they see this in time.
00:21:31.216 - 00:21:41.486, Speaker B: But regardless, I definitely am not qualified for tax advice. Even once we clarify that, I don't know if I'll have an answer going.
00:21:41.488 - 00:22:15.800, Speaker A: To be a different answer based on every region, so I totally understand that. The second question that I have, which is slightly broader, is balancer has been facilitating a lot of different types of pools, and you've seen some really creative use cases of this technology. So what are some of the things that have really surprised you in terms of what you didn't realize was possible? And then sort of corollary, what are some of the things that you have on your wish list as a team that you haven't really seen come to the same fruition that you hoped for and would kind of encourage people to experiment with?
00:22:17.390 - 00:23:25.258, Speaker B: Well, I would say definitely that Joel Monegro's idea for the Balancer Smart treasuries really blew my mind. I thought that was incredible, and I did not personally see that coming. The possibilities are endless. These are building blocks that you can create all kinds of stuff with. It's really infinite, which is so exciting. I think that me personally, I think it's important for the balancer ecosystem that we continue to integrate with developers who are building, whether it's smart wallets or other types of applications that are looking to source liquidity or teams that want to leverage smart pools for some investment products that they want to create or to launch their token sales. I mean, there's really so many different ways to interact with the protocol.
00:23:25.258 - 00:23:40.260, Speaker B: If you have an idea or you want to brainstorm something, definitely reach out. You can find me on Twitter and it's at immutable. But I-M-M-U-T-B-L. That's an amazing name.
00:23:40.870 - 00:24:24.990, Speaker A: Perfect. So I think what we'll do is I'll have you sort of join the chat directly and just engage with our audience there if you have time. And I want to thank you again for this amazing presentation. Was a great reminder to all the hackers that are participating that Balancer is a sponsor for this event and they're offering a handful of bounties. So if you have any of the ideas that you want to take from this presentation, do kind of try that out. And even if you're not hacking for the online hackathon, the community pool, the Ecosystem Fund is still a great resource for you that's available for anybody who's interested in experimenting and trying on different products and strategies. So thanks again, Jeremy.
00:24:25.330 - 00:24:26.222, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:24:26.356 - 00:24:46.850, Speaker A: And what we'll do is we'll take a quick five minute break for everybody on this chat. So this will give you enough time to just enjoy a little bit of the radio up and we'll resume with our next talk from Sergey at 03:00 P.m. Eastern. So we'll see you all in five. Bye.
