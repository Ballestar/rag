00:00:00.250 - 00:00:09.402, Speaker A: Network. You're like a super billionaire, so you can say how much you want. The second thing we're going to do is we're going to write a contract.
00:00:09.546 - 00:00:12.030, Speaker B: From scratch in Truffle.
00:00:12.850 - 00:00:24.170, Speaker A: Sorry, let me not confuse people, okay? It's a solidity contract we're going to write. We're going to write it using a kind of command line IDE called Truffle.
00:00:24.250 - 00:00:24.902, Speaker B: Right?
00:00:25.076 - 00:00:27.874, Speaker A: And we're going to compile and deploy.
00:00:27.922 - 00:00:30.626, Speaker B: That contract to our Ganache network.
00:00:30.658 - 00:00:35.606, Speaker A: So we set up the test network, we're going to write a contract, we're going to build it, we're going to.
00:00:35.628 - 00:00:37.430, Speaker B: Deploy it to our network.
00:00:38.190 - 00:01:08.462, Speaker A: So step three is really we're going to take and we're going to put a front end to that application. So if you think of traditional server client architecture, it's very similar, but in the sense of your server that you're deploying is on chain and you're interacting on chain. It's not kind of like a remote communication. You're just talking directly into your contract.
00:01:08.526 - 00:01:09.666, Speaker B: As your back end.
00:01:09.848 - 00:01:18.534, Speaker A: Okay, so that's the only slide that matters right here. Go there and we can get started on that.
00:01:18.652 - 00:01:19.560, Speaker C: Hang on.
00:01:27.070 - 00:01:29.114, Speaker B: There we go. Found it. Okay, cool.
00:01:29.232 - 00:01:44.340, Speaker A: So the first four steps we're going to do here is like I was saying, you should have an NPM environment. If you don't, that's kind of like one of the prerequisites. It would take us a while to install NPM for everyone.
00:01:45.190 - 00:01:45.940, Speaker B: But.
00:01:47.830 - 00:02:23.870, Speaker A: You don't have to do pseudo. It depends on your environment. But we're going to install a global version of Truffle and we're also going to install a global version of the CLI. And that means basically when I go to command line, I don't have to put in a path to reference Ganache, CLI or Truffle. I can just use the shortened phrase Truffle or Ganache CLI to start those. Okay, so next thing we're going to do is I can't do those because I'll break everything. Actually, I probably need to do Truffle because this isn't my computer.
00:02:24.020 - 00:02:24.960, Speaker C: 1 second.
00:02:59.370 - 00:03:12.042, Speaker B: It just guys, no food and no beverages in here, please. If you have some, just go outside and finish it. And I'm going to see you on every camera if you do it.
00:03:12.176 - 00:03:13.100, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:03:14.190 - 00:03:16.062, Speaker B: Cool. Thank you. Yeah.
00:03:16.116 - 00:03:17.658, Speaker A: So now we're installing.
00:03:17.834 - 00:03:21.214, Speaker B: Cool. Hey, I guess that's what this is for. Okay, cool.
00:03:21.252 - 00:03:25.790, Speaker A: So we're installing Truffle and it installed successfully.
00:03:26.690 - 00:03:27.450, Speaker C: Okay.
00:03:27.620 - 00:03:29.298, Speaker A: So kind of moving on to the.
00:03:29.304 - 00:03:32.802, Speaker B: Next steps now that we have our stuff there, right?
00:03:32.856 - 00:03:37.150, Speaker A: So I'm going to change my directory.
00:03:37.230 - 00:03:40.050, Speaker B: To the desktop.
00:03:41.850 - 00:03:42.726, Speaker A: And I'm going to.
00:03:42.748 - 00:03:46.118, Speaker B: Make a new directory and we're going.
00:03:46.124 - 00:03:52.766, Speaker A: To call that directory Sandbox. So when you're setting up a Truffle instance sandbox.
00:03:52.898 - 00:03:58.460, Speaker B: Sandbox. There we go. Cool. Oh, shoot, I'm sorry. Yeah.
00:04:00.510 - 00:04:02.540, Speaker A: Let'S move that over here.
00:04:05.330 - 00:04:06.080, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:04:07.330 - 00:04:08.494, Speaker C: Here we go.
00:04:08.692 - 00:04:09.902, Speaker B: Does that work better?
00:04:09.956 - 00:04:13.454, Speaker A: Can everybody see that? Oh, no, that's way down there, isn't it?
00:04:13.492 - 00:04:34.226, Speaker B: Okay to bring it up and then try and increase the font size? This is my life.
00:04:34.328 - 00:04:39.202, Speaker C: Okay. Really?
00:04:39.336 - 00:04:40.870, Speaker A: This is just the worst.
00:04:45.530 - 00:04:48.920, Speaker B: Yeah, but it'd be cool if it was not, like, totally at the bottom.
00:04:49.530 - 00:04:50.600, Speaker C: There we go.
00:04:52.270 - 00:04:53.180, Speaker B: What's that?
00:04:57.310 - 00:04:58.618, Speaker A: I can't resize it.
00:04:58.704 - 00:04:59.660, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:05:00.190 - 00:05:04.790, Speaker B: This is, like, my first day of using of something. Sorry.
00:05:04.960 - 00:05:23.006, Speaker A: Hopefully you can see that better. My apologies for everybody. Okay, so we're going to make a new directory, right? So we're going to call that directory sandbox, and then the next thing we need to do is to get into our new directory.
00:05:23.038 - 00:05:34.966, Speaker B: So we're going to change directory to sandbox, and we're going to call truffle init, and that's going to set up.
00:05:34.988 - 00:05:36.802, Speaker A: The environment in the sandbox.
00:05:36.866 - 00:05:43.094, Speaker B: Oh, cool. Node version not supported. Cool. All right.
00:05:43.132 - 00:05:56.640, Speaker A: Yeah, like I said, give me just a moment. I did get my laptop stolen, so I'm not exactly sure. Node version not support. We're currently using version 7.7.4 requires 8.9.4.
00:06:02.350 - 00:06:05.018, Speaker B: NPM install.
00:06:05.104 - 00:06:05.740, Speaker C: What?
00:06:10.410 - 00:06:14.360, Speaker B: Okay. All right, cool. All right.
00:06:15.210 - 00:06:16.200, Speaker C: Do what?
00:06:16.670 - 00:06:27.040, Speaker B: Okay, can we get the guy whose computer this is come help me for a moment. Forgot his name.
00:06:28.450 - 00:06:29.440, Speaker C: What's? That?
00:06:30.770 - 00:06:39.202, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. Isn't update. Right. Sorry. Yeah.
00:06:39.336 - 00:06:40.340, Speaker C: What's that?
00:06:43.950 - 00:06:47.020, Speaker B: Okay. I didn't know that.
00:06:47.710 - 00:07:01.754, Speaker A: Hopefully we don't break somebody else's environment, but hopefully everybody else is following along, doing this guide. He said there was, like, something to select your environment. So we're going to try that command.
00:07:01.802 - 00:07:06.020, Speaker B: Again now that we have a newer version oh.
00:09:05.120 - 00:09:06.030, Speaker C: For you.
00:09:18.070 - 00:09:25.860, Speaker B: To unmute. Excellent. Okay.
00:09:27.510 - 00:09:29.160, Speaker C: Hear too much of your.
00:09:40.900 - 00:09:41.792, Speaker B: I'm really sorry.
00:09:41.846 - 00:09:47.940, Speaker A: Y'all you know, I had this all set up to go, but unforeseen circumstances.
00:09:50.040 - 00:09:50.950, Speaker C: Right here.
00:09:53.240 - 00:09:55.110, Speaker B: So NPM install n.
00:10:12.420 - 00:10:34.158, Speaker C: Like node latest. Oh, you're getting password?
00:10:34.254 - 00:10:34.900, Speaker B: No.
00:10:37.750 - 00:10:38.660, Speaker C: All right.
00:10:39.350 - 00:10:40.100, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:41.510 - 00:10:42.260, Speaker B: Okay.
00:10:44.630 - 00:10:46.334, Speaker A: Do you have a new MacBook?
00:10:46.382 - 00:10:46.882, Speaker B: Cool.
00:10:47.016 - 00:10:53.874, Speaker A: I used to have one of those recently. Okay, here we go.
00:10:53.912 - 00:11:16.870, Speaker C: We got a dongle do, I assume my school?
00:11:17.040 - 00:11:18.080, Speaker B: Very good.
00:11:51.470 - 00:11:54.410, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Really appreciate it.
00:11:54.480 - 00:12:02.320, Speaker B: You might have to install everything. Okay, cool. Awesome. Yeah.
00:12:05.250 - 00:12:05.758, Speaker C: Okay.
00:12:05.844 - 00:12:08.080, Speaker A: So, yeah, we'll start there.
00:12:11.810 - 00:12:12.560, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:15.910 - 00:12:16.466, Speaker C: Okay.
00:12:16.568 - 00:12:24.660, Speaker B: And we'll go to tinyurl.com e pairs. Okay.
00:12:28.250 - 00:12:29.240, Speaker C: What's that?
00:12:32.890 - 00:12:34.710, Speaker B: Oh, right on. Cool.
00:12:34.860 - 00:12:36.694, Speaker A: What a fun club we started.
00:12:36.812 - 00:12:40.602, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah.
00:12:40.656 - 00:12:52.140, Speaker A: Okay, well, let's see if we have our NPM installed, our truffle install. I can't do any of the.
00:12:54.930 - 00:12:55.386, Speaker B: Magic.
00:12:55.418 - 00:13:05.142, Speaker A: Of television sort of stuff where I already have stuff installed and I can just go for it. So I'm going to do this with everybody else, too. So, yeah, we're going to install Truffle.
00:13:05.226 - 00:13:08.594, Speaker B: Then we're going to install Ganache, and.
00:13:08.632 - 00:13:13.682, Speaker A: Then this one actually takes a little bit, and then we'll start up our oh, no, that was fast.
00:13:13.736 - 00:13:17.110, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Yeah, dude, it's legit.
00:13:19.690 - 00:13:20.950, Speaker A: This is brilliant.
00:13:25.770 - 00:13:27.240, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:13:30.430 - 00:13:39.820, Speaker A: And so now we're going to have Ganache, and that also went in really fast. Okay, now we're going to make our sandbox, which is.
00:13:43.810 - 00:13:44.526, Speaker C: I'm going to put.
00:13:44.548 - 00:13:47.710, Speaker B: That on the desktop by making a directory.
00:13:48.450 - 00:13:50.494, Speaker A: Let's make sure everybody can see it, right?
00:13:50.532 - 00:13:51.520, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:13:54.230 - 00:13:55.490, Speaker A: Sandbox.
00:13:55.830 - 00:13:56.580, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:56.950 - 00:14:03.730, Speaker A: And then we're going to go into Sandbox and we're going to call Truffle init.
00:14:09.660 - 00:14:10.810, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:14:12.860 - 00:14:28.830, Speaker A: We did stuff. Okay, if you look at your tree, right, if you do an LS, right, you'll see there's Truffleconfig JS, there's test folder, there's migrations and there's contracts, and we're going to use each of those.
00:14:31.040 - 00:14:31.644, Speaker C: Okay.
00:14:31.762 - 00:15:01.640, Speaker A: So the next step would be to set up our Truffle JS, which actually Truffle JS is basically it's telling you where your environment is supposed to point to. Shoot, they changed the name. Sorry. We're going to modify truffleconfig. JS.
00:15:04.860 - 00:15:08.490, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, sure.
00:15:10.700 - 00:15:11.160, Speaker C: Yes.
00:15:11.230 - 00:15:20.670, Speaker B: Code no. Okay, yeah, cool.
00:15:23.760 - 00:15:25.570, Speaker A: No, this is my first day.
00:15:25.940 - 00:15:26.352, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:26.406 - 00:15:27.010, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:15:27.620 - 00:15:28.176, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:28.278 - 00:15:49.168, Speaker A: Okay, so yeah, now we're going to make edits to our Truffle config, the JS. And that just tells us what environment we're going to be talking to. So we're going to start up Ganache CLI and we're going to talk to that. And we want to say that we're talking to Ganache CLI and not Ethereum Main Net or Robstone or whatever. We want it to understand where these.
00:15:49.194 - 00:15:50.840, Speaker B: Contracts need to be deployed.
00:15:51.740 - 00:15:54.744, Speaker C: Cool, that's perfect. All right.
00:15:54.782 - 00:15:56.916, Speaker A: And so we're just going to clobber.
00:15:56.948 - 00:16:09.644, Speaker B: Whatever'S in here with the stuff from the guide. 85 45. Okay, cool.
00:16:09.842 - 00:16:12.990, Speaker A: So yeah, we're just going to clobber that.
00:16:13.760 - 00:16:27.590, Speaker B: Wow. This one. Say what's? That one? Oh, weird. Cool. Nice. Okay. Yeah, I know stuff.
00:16:28.760 - 00:17:10.844, Speaker A: Okay, so then now we're going to make the contract. And so that's also provided in here as a gist, right? So just copy and paste that. So you're going to want to go to over into contracts and you're going to want to make a new file called Simplestorage Sol. And that's a solidity contract. So smart. Contracts are not really a great name because they're kind of just like applications that get run by the network and don't really have much to do with being in contract.
00:17:10.972 - 00:17:11.312, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:11.366 - 00:17:26.870, Speaker A: And then the next to we're gonna call Truffle compile just to make sure everything's still working. Okay, so now that we put that stuff in there, actually.
00:17:28.920 - 00:17:36.184, Speaker B: I'm wondering actually do you have okay, cool, that works. Wait. Oh yeah. Cool. All right. Seems good.
00:17:36.382 - 00:17:49.180, Speaker A: So we compiled, right, the contract compiled onto bytecode. And so next we're going to stand up our Ganache CLI and we're going to deploy the contract into the Ganache, into our Ganache network.
00:17:50.480 - 00:17:54.510, Speaker B: So oh.
00:17:56.260 - 00:17:57.010, Speaker C: Okay.
00:17:59.140 - 00:17:59.890, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:18:02.900 - 00:18:36.300, Speaker A: Okay, so now to deploy it, we need to update something called our migrations, right? And our migrations tell us how to deploy something. When we're going to deploy it. I'm going to go into migrations. I'm going to create a new file called it has to be a number two, but I have a file name specified over here somewhere to underscore deploy underscore contracts.
00:18:47.760 - 00:18:50.140, Speaker B: And that's just a simple JS file.
00:18:54.320 - 00:19:14.820, Speaker A: And so now we have the now we have the deploy. And so it'll know exactly how to deploy the contract and what network to deploy it to. So I don't believe I said in here to start Ganache. Oh, I did. Up here. I said it way earlier, but okay. So now we're going to start Ganache CLI.
00:19:15.880 - 00:19:16.948, Speaker B: Oh, look at that.
00:19:17.034 - 00:19:44.610, Speaker A: It's so cute and tiny. So we'll call Ganache CLI. And this is actually, like, starting our network, right? So one of the cool things, one of the cool features wow. Is that it'll give you a bunch of private keys with, like, 100 ETH in them. And so in your private network, you have 100 ETH in each account, and they provide you with the private keys, which is pretty rad.
00:19:46.020 - 00:19:47.568, Speaker B: Why is it cutting off?
00:19:47.734 - 00:19:48.880, Speaker C: That's weird.
00:19:52.580 - 00:19:57.956, Speaker B: Go ahead and kill that. It's very strange behavior. Okay, cool.
00:19:58.138 - 00:20:32.800, Speaker A: That's more like it. So if you can see that we started our network. It's like our local host at 85 45, right? And so, like we specified earlier, we said we're talking to 85 45. And so, yeah, we're going to get to communicate with that. So now that we have our Ganache network set up, we have our compiled contract, we have all the kind of like the deployment stuff in this place. We're going to try truffle deploy. And what Truffle Deploy does is it then sends that to the Ganache network.
00:20:40.620 - 00:20:53.948, Speaker B: Okay. Is it yeah.
00:20:54.034 - 00:20:55.260, Speaker A: Isn't isn't it that way?
00:20:55.330 - 00:20:56.190, Speaker B: Did I?
00:20:58.240 - 00:20:59.436, Speaker A: I did that.
00:20:59.618 - 00:21:00.590, Speaker C: Let's see.
00:21:01.840 - 00:21:04.690, Speaker B: Oh, did I? Okay, let's try again.
00:21:07.620 - 00:21:08.690, Speaker C: Oh, cool.
00:21:11.620 - 00:21:21.670, Speaker B: Okay. Why won't it go away?
00:21:25.990 - 00:21:27.250, Speaker C: Okay, cool.
00:21:27.320 - 00:21:30.694, Speaker B: Let's try again. There we go.
00:21:30.732 - 00:21:51.834, Speaker A: Hey, it went yay. Victory. And big hand of applause for the guy who told me that I didn't save my file. I appreciate that. Okay, so now it's actually in the network. And if you're looking at your Ganache CLI console, it'll have all these transactions that come through. You don't really need to understand them all that much.
00:21:51.834 - 00:22:15.154, Speaker A: It's just some transaction data. You get better over time. You'll start to understand what they do and what they mean. And this will say then also your Truffle Deploy will output kind of like where the contract is, the transaction hash for that and how much it cost.
00:22:15.192 - 00:22:16.354, Speaker B: You to do that.
00:22:16.552 - 00:22:50.046, Speaker A: And those costs are somewhat representative of what they would be in the real world. Okay, so the next thing we're going to do is now we have the network, we have the contract. The contract is deployed. Now we want to talk to the contract. And so we're going to do some really just, like, basic corny stuff. We're going to update a value, and then we're going to read a value from the contract. And so I've written just, like, a fundamental create react app that gives you the very what I say, like, the.
00:22:50.068 - 00:22:54.010, Speaker B: Bare minimum to talk to a contract.
00:22:54.090 - 00:23:05.700, Speaker A: And so if you're going to be hacking this weekend, it's great because it'll give you a very fundamental place to start. Okay.
00:23:07.110 - 00:23:07.426, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:07.448 - 00:23:08.050, Speaker B: There we go.
00:23:08.120 - 00:23:17.960, Speaker A: So I'm going to clone down my simple client. And if you're kind of like a React or like, you know, node developer, this should be like pretty familiar for you.
00:23:20.330 - 00:23:21.080, Speaker B: Actually.
00:23:26.170 - 00:23:40.270, Speaker A: We're gonna we're gonna do that not in sandbox, how about that? And we're going to clone that down. We're just pulling down the repo. And now we're going to go into.
00:23:40.340 - 00:23:44.414, Speaker B: Simple Client and we're going to do.
00:23:44.452 - 00:23:56.500, Speaker A: An NPM install and that'll install all of our dependencies. That's pretty normal stuff for node developers. And then.
00:23:58.230 - 00:23:58.946, Speaker B: We'Re going to do an.
00:23:58.968 - 00:24:08.950, Speaker A: NPM start so we can kind of see it not communicating to the contract and then make some configuration changes and then make it talk to the contract.
00:24:28.850 - 00:24:30.110, Speaker C: Okay, cool.
00:24:30.260 - 00:24:36.720, Speaker A: So now we're going to do an NPM start to get our server started and we can see it'll start.
00:24:41.350 - 00:24:44.546, Speaker B: The Create react app starts up and.
00:24:44.568 - 00:24:48.820, Speaker A: It won't really talk to the contract. And that's what we're expecting, right?
00:24:50.490 - 00:24:52.854, Speaker B: Okay, so yeah, it's going to ask.
00:24:52.892 - 00:24:54.520, Speaker A: For your MetaMask stuff.
00:24:56.010 - 00:24:57.240, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:24:58.410 - 00:24:59.160, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:02.990 - 00:25:08.122, Speaker A: I really hope that I'm not going to blow away anybody's ETH fortune here.
00:25:08.176 - 00:25:12.460, Speaker B: When I'm making modifications if you're out there.
00:25:15.230 - 00:25:26.590, Speaker A: Okay, so yeah, it's not really like talking. This doesn't really do anything. It's like broken. And so we're going to open that up in Vs code and make some other edits.
00:25:34.310 - 00:25:35.060, Speaker C: Okay.
00:25:37.030 - 00:25:37.538, Speaker B: Yes.
00:25:37.624 - 00:25:44.934, Speaker A: Oh, dude, I need your MetaMask password. I'm not going to delete keys or anything, am I?
00:25:45.052 - 00:25:50.278, Speaker B: If I make modifications to MetaMask so.
00:25:50.364 - 00:26:08.880, Speaker A: We'Re going to start to talk to the contract, right? I need to add a private key to it, but that's okay. It won't affect your accounts. It'll just add. Okay, so we're going to open a folder showing this Simple Client stuff.
00:26:09.890 - 00:26:10.640, Speaker C: Okay.
00:26:11.890 - 00:26:16.782, Speaker B: And someday okay, cool. I guess it did it already didn't see that.
00:26:16.916 - 00:26:17.600, Speaker C: Cool.
00:26:17.970 - 00:26:28.622, Speaker A: So app JS, right? If you see this thing, it says Add address here, right? The address that we're talking about is the deployed contract address on our Ganache CLI instance.
00:26:28.686 - 00:26:35.318, Speaker B: So if I have a contract and I deploy it within Ganache, I get.
00:26:35.404 - 00:26:39.160, Speaker A: An address for that contract if I.
00:26:43.790 - 00:26:45.114, Speaker B: They wiped me out.
00:26:45.232 - 00:26:46.140, Speaker C: Come on.
00:26:47.150 - 00:26:54.042, Speaker B: Okay. Anyway, it's over in this other 1210.
00:26:54.096 - 00:26:56.718, Speaker A: That's the area code for San Antonio. That's where I'm from.
00:26:56.884 - 00:27:06.398, Speaker B: What luck. That's so cool. Yeah, it's been a very wild ride. Okay, so yeah, we'll just copy and.
00:27:06.404 - 00:27:28.310, Speaker A: Paste that into here. It's like saying, where am I going to be talking to? What's the contract that I want to talk to? And this is all normal stuff for node developers, so I won't focus on that too much. I just want to kind of get it started. Lost my other terminal.
00:27:30.090 - 00:27:30.840, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:32.650 - 00:27:33.702, Speaker B: Command tilde.
00:27:33.766 - 00:27:35.820, Speaker C: Wow. What?
00:27:37.390 - 00:27:47.680, Speaker B: Nah, I just made a backtick. Oh, command. Okay, cool. Yeah, that one.
00:27:48.050 - 00:27:50.960, Speaker C: Thank you. Really appreciate it.
00:27:51.650 - 00:27:53.134, Speaker B: What? Two side by side?
00:27:53.172 - 00:27:54.618, Speaker A: Dude, you guys are wizards.
00:27:54.714 - 00:27:55.166, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:55.268 - 00:28:13.606, Speaker A: This is awesome. So what step was I on? Oh yeah, we just did the thingy, and so now we're gonna do the same thing again. We're gonna start up our now that we put in the contract details, we're gonna start up the client now.
00:28:13.708 - 00:28:17.560, Speaker B: Okay. Oh, no, I want to do NPM start.
00:28:20.970 - 00:28:36.714, Speaker A: So we start up simple client. And so yeah, there it is. It's not connected to a wallet. MetaMask is going to ask for that. We're not doing that just yet. But we should be able to check number, right? And it should return like nothing.
00:28:36.832 - 00:28:38.014, Speaker B: Okay. It blows up.
00:28:38.052 - 00:28:39.214, Speaker A: Okay, well, whatever.
00:28:39.332 - 00:28:41.040, Speaker B: It's not supposed to do it yet.
00:28:41.730 - 00:28:52.082, Speaker A: Okay, so next thing we do is I'm going to grab some of these private keys and I'm going to import them, and I'm also going to try.
00:28:52.216 - 00:28:56.654, Speaker B: To not delete any of your precious.
00:28:56.702 - 00:28:58.660, Speaker A: ETH that you already may have.
00:29:00.650 - 00:29:06.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, 50 50.
00:29:09.210 - 00:29:09.766, Speaker A: Okay.
00:29:09.868 - 00:29:11.414, Speaker B: So, yeah.
00:29:11.452 - 00:29:15.242, Speaker A: Will you come put in your MetaMask password for me?
00:29:15.376 - 00:29:25.740, Speaker C: Thank you. We thank you.
00:29:28.930 - 00:29:30.320, Speaker A: We're going to connect.
00:29:33.890 - 00:29:34.446, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:34.548 - 00:29:46.610, Speaker A: This is on main network. So we're going to switch this to our local host, which is 85 45. And then also we're going to add a new account, one of these super rich accounts.
00:29:50.970 - 00:29:51.720, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:52.810 - 00:29:59.000, Speaker B: Okay. We're super rich is our account name.
00:30:00.650 - 00:30:04.570, Speaker A: And we're going to import yeah, we're going to import private key.
00:30:04.640 - 00:30:09.180, Speaker B: Boom. Dropping it in there. Boom. 100 e rich AF.
00:30:13.150 - 00:30:51.560, Speaker A: In imaginary money. Now we actually kind of like just because of a MetaMask bug, we have to kind of restart our browser right now because it's not going to work out of the box like that. So when we start up our simple client again, this time we're going to have our private key with lots of ETH in it. And so we should be able to connect our wallet, hopefully, and communicate and store a value and then retrieve it, hopefully, and not blowing up on camera. That would be cool.
00:30:52.490 - 00:30:53.334, Speaker B: Let's say.
00:30:53.452 - 00:30:56.554, Speaker A: Well, obviously my lucky number. Two 10. There we go.
00:30:56.672 - 00:31:01.018, Speaker B: For area code. Oh, cool. Yay. Awesome.
00:31:01.104 - 00:31:03.514, Speaker A: All right. Oh, hey, add address here.
00:31:03.552 - 00:31:03.706, Speaker B: Okay.
00:31:03.728 - 00:31:05.066, Speaker A: I didn't save a file again.
00:31:05.168 - 00:31:05.820, Speaker B: Cool.
00:31:11.170 - 00:31:19.920, Speaker A: No, it's common goal for my end because let's just not take our chances on.
00:31:22.290 - 00:31:27.714, Speaker B: Cool, cool. All right.
00:31:27.752 - 00:31:29.886, Speaker A: MetaMask, you need to ask for a connection.
00:31:29.998 - 00:31:35.560, Speaker B: That's what you're supposed to do. Yeah.
00:31:37.210 - 00:31:44.266, Speaker C: Okay, cool. We'll try that again because it's supposed.
00:31:44.288 - 00:31:45.420, Speaker A: To ask to connect.
00:31:50.840 - 00:31:51.572, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:31:51.626 - 00:32:05.230, Speaker A: Okay, so we got the connection request. Now I will ask you for a password, and if I cross my fingers.
00:32:05.570 - 00:32:14.478, Speaker B: Where it'll be talking to the contract by sending an update. Hey, it updated.
00:32:14.654 - 00:32:17.762, Speaker A: Well, the real test is did it actually update?
00:32:17.826 - 00:32:18.150, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:18.220 - 00:32:22.182, Speaker A: So now that we sent that to the contract, it stored it in there.
00:32:22.236 - 00:32:23.800, Speaker B: And now we're going to check it.
00:32:24.250 - 00:32:36.666, Speaker A: Zero. Awesome. Okay. That's not what it's supposed to be. It's supposed to have stored it. Sometimes this happens. There's a million things that we could do to troubleshoot it.
00:32:36.666 - 00:32:54.580, Speaker A: But I have used this, and the instructions are good. So I would say use it and do it on your own. Should work correctly, but let's give it one more shot. I bet you it really wants to work.
00:33:02.950 - 00:33:03.554, Speaker C: It.
00:33:03.672 - 00:33:16.198, Speaker B: Okay, so checking number 0210. Update. Confirm. It updated. So it said no.
00:33:16.284 - 00:33:44.860, Speaker A: Okay, well, it's not working. But it works. I've done it, I promise. But anyway, basically what we're doing now is we have the front end it's, storing it into the contract, then you're able to retrieve it. Yeah, sorry the demo doesn't work perfectly, but, yeah, we did my best. And if you have questions about it, I totally willing to help any teams that need some sort of guidance on how to do any of this stuff.
00:33:45.990 - 00:33:48.018, Speaker B: Yeah, so thanks.
00:33:48.104 - 00:33:50.450, Speaker A: And that kind of, like, concludes the presentation.
