00:00:00.570 - 00:00:40.258, Speaker A: Hello. So welcome, everybody. This is our last day of ETH online judging. This is Group Three, where we're going to do a lot more demos of all the remaining projects that we have not judged so far. And this has been an amazing month for all of us. We had over 700 hackers participating in this event, and they're coming in from 65 different countries in 19 different time zones, and we are going to be jumping into a lot of their demos. So 175 project were submitted for this month, and we saw an amazing set of projects from tackling DFI to scaling to NFD and gaming.
00:00:40.258 - 00:01:41.366, Speaker A: And we are going to be looking at a subset of them today in this call and going through some of the comments and feedback from those projects with our judges. And I want to kind of thank everybody for being here. So the quick format of how this session is going to go, each team will have eight minutes in total. They'll have four minutes to showcase their video demo, which they pre recorded to minimize any technical difficulties, and there'll be four minute Q A post demos for each team. And because we have a lot of projects going on, we'll do a short break for our judges and some of our hackers to kind of rest halfway through this point, and then we'll kind of resume with the demos. So the way each project is going to be looked at is going to be on five different categories. So we will rate projects on how technical, original, practical they are and then also on their design aspect on how kind of they fare into the UI UX as a developer experience for their projects.
00:01:41.366 - 00:02:31.382, Speaker A: And we also recognize that this is not the only way to look at a project and the only categories that may be considered. So we also have a catch all that we like to call wow factor that lets us offset a handful of the things that would have missed in the previous four categories. And before we kind of jump into our very first demo, I want to just really emphasize that people are here to learn. This particular event has 50% newcomers into the Web Three ecosystem. So the goal from our side is to allow them to experiment and kind of really showcase what they were excited about and how close they got to finishing it. And people are not aiming to be businesses. Some of them will choose to do so at their own sort of pace, but it's not something that's being either incentivized or emphasized or encouraged necessarily.
00:02:31.382 - 00:03:09.394, Speaker A: So the hackers are very much here to get feedback. And the goal for today's demo is going to be just really seeing what interesting things that matter to each of them and kind of seeing them in practice. So with that said, doing the hard job today are our three judges. I want to kind of thank Sid from Coinbase, dimitri from Bollinger Investments, and Ashley from Near Protocol for being here. They'll be our three judges for today. They'll be kind of walking through all of the projects and kind of giving their comments and feedback to each of those teams. And they're all here now, and we'll just kick this off immediately with our very first demo for today.
00:03:09.394 - 00:03:25.680, Speaker A: So I'd like to kind of welcome our first team, which is Project Mindful. So we are in the process of promoting this team now, and whenever they kind of get on, we should be able to have them share their screen and kick off with their demo.
00:03:34.930 - 00:03:37.694, Speaker B: Sorry, Karate, can you promote them for this round?
00:03:37.822 - 00:03:44.738, Speaker A: I just realized I missed something, so let me correct for that, and I have made you co host as well.
00:03:44.824 - 00:03:49.000, Speaker B: Anticipation. Perfect. Thank you. Got it.
00:04:01.700 - 00:04:02.176, Speaker A: All right.
00:04:02.198 - 00:04:03.408, Speaker B: Hi, can you guys hear me?
00:04:03.494 - 00:04:08.370, Speaker A: Yes, we can. So whenever you're ready, feel free to share your video on it.
00:04:15.960 - 00:04:17.556, Speaker B: I like where this is going.
00:04:17.658 - 00:04:31.530, Speaker A: That's a familiar face. Looks like we don't have any audio, so if you would just mind stopping that and checking the audio box one more time, that would be.
00:04:33.660 - 00:04:35.656, Speaker B: Chris, I.
00:04:35.758 - 00:04:39.032, Speaker C: Don'T have an option for that on Zoom.
00:04:39.096 - 00:04:41.308, Speaker A: There should be a sound checkbox at.
00:04:41.314 - 00:04:45.390, Speaker B: The yeah, I know. I did it earlier on. It's minimized. Now.
00:04:48.640 - 00:04:55.570, Speaker A: If if that is not working, what we can do is we can just play the video for you here with the audio. But.
00:04:57.540 - 00:05:15.456, Speaker B: It worked earlier on. I can't see this in the Zoom settings. Zoom. Why you forsake me? I can't find this. Yeah, if you could play it, that would work. It doesn't give me that option anyway. Let me try that's.
00:05:15.456 - 00:05:15.636, Speaker B: Okay.
00:05:15.658 - 00:05:16.000, Speaker C: There you go.
00:05:16.010 - 00:05:17.864, Speaker B: I could hurt it on your side.
00:05:18.062 - 00:05:19.928, Speaker A: I will just play that video for you guys.
00:05:20.094 - 00:05:21.050, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:05:23.180 - 00:05:24.090, Speaker A: All right.
00:05:34.240 - 00:06:09.748, Speaker D: We can see a cryptid degenerate in his natural habitat. He rejects Krupan SIF strategies in favor of being an ape, buying tops and selling buttons time and time again, demolishing his hard earned gains, ruining his chances of accumulating generational wealth. Training is a hard game to play. But what if you didn't have to play it? The daily lama. Once a discipline smart, contract based investment strategies lead to happiness. Undisciplined degeneracy leads to suffering. It is time to silence to a net degenerate.
00:06:09.748 - 00:06:51.360, Speaker D: Introducing mindful portfolio online meant for Dgens. Mindful was created by a team of D 5D gens. They know what it's like to get wrecked when the lizard brain takes over. With this new platform, you can adopt strategies to DCA into assets, rebalance your portfolio, and take profits without emotion taking over. Unlike other portfolio rebalancing tools, mindful incorporate, set and forget DC earning strategies and automatic profit taking. Users also collect fees from balancer by depositing funds in a chakra. And the system is completely costless.
00:06:51.360 - 00:07:22.236, Speaker D: And now, let us venture onto the platform to see how it works. This is the mindful dashboard. Here you can view all of your current chakras. Interactive charts show you the performance of your chakras over time. DCA and profit taking strategies can be edited or even paused if the user deems it necessary. You can also make deposits and take funds from your chakras at any time. However, Mindful recommends that you don't let your monkey mind succumb to FOMO trust a plan.
00:07:22.236 - 00:08:03.192, Speaker D: The Asset Breakdown tab details the composition of a chakra. Here you can see your current holdings, asset allocations and every token's price performance, a thorough history of the actions taken by your chakra strategy. It is also available so that you can examine this performance in greater detail and of course, be ready for tax season. Creating a new chakra is simple. Give it a font name and then select up to eight different assets. Remember, chakras are only as strong as their weakest asset, so be sensible. Once you are happy with your tokens, you can move on to setting up your allocations.
00:08:03.192 - 00:08:36.488, Speaker D: Your chakra will automatically maintain these ratios, so you don't need to worry about rebalancing your portfolio. Next, you will have to set up your initial contribution. You can do single asset entry or enter using the exact assets of the ratios you specify above. The final step is to set up a DCA and profit taking strategy. Specify how much you want to DCA in and how often you want to do it. Then set up the parameters for how much puffer to take and when to take it. Now you are ready to go.
00:08:36.488 - 00:09:19.248, Speaker D: Wonderful, isn't it? I can feel my chakras aligning already. So how does it all work? Every chakra is controlled via a unique balancer pool. When the conditions are met to DCA or take profits, an automatic relay executes the buy or sell transaction, receiving a 0.3% fee for their troubles. To avoid slippage our interactions with the balancer pool, use multiasset deposits and withdrawals. The Mindful proxy contract then trades these assets into the required tokens on uniswap and sends them directly to the user's wallet. As the part of their degeneracy minimizing philosophy, the Mindful team has decided not to test in production.
00:09:19.248 - 00:09:34.200, Speaker D: Instead, they plan on using any prized money from the ethnic hackathon to have their contracts audited. Now that's mindful behavior. Ready to learn more to Mindful gut cash and prepare to silence your inner degenerate?
00:09:36.700 - 00:09:39.310, Speaker A: That was our wonderful first down for today.
00:09:40.080 - 00:09:57.330, Speaker B: Maybe I'll applause for that video. How did you guys get David Attenborough to narrate it? We were on. He would join us for the video. Sorry Midias, it was very fun.
00:09:59.860 - 00:10:03.490, Speaker A: I'll let our judges kick it off with the first set of comments. Or.
00:10:06.260 - 00:10:45.730, Speaker B: So my comments. I mean, I'd love to hear what Sid and Dimitri have to think, but I'm still kind of like who did all the marketing and the meming on that? Because you guys really tuned in and over delivered there. So I think that's really great and I wanted to chat about that for a second. That'd be me and liesl. Yeah, we're kind of big on the meme front of things and did it for another project as well. Yeah, really engaging and really amazing copy and understanding your demographics. So kudos to that.
00:10:45.730 - 00:10:47.970, Speaker B: Glad you enjoyed it.
00:10:52.260 - 00:11:08.808, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe I could jump in with a question. I assume you could do this with all ERC, 20s, but what's the kind of space of assets that someone could use to create these, I guess what you call it?
00:11:08.974 - 00:11:36.930, Speaker B: Yeah. So you could use any ERC, 20 that's traded on uniswap? Pretty much. Or alternatively on balancer, these are basically like balancer smart pools, the same way that their current exchanges are set up. Now you wouldn't want to put in any tokens that have a rebalancing or rebasing mechanism. So like others Adai or like Yams wouldn't work, but that's because those aren't compatible with balancer pools in any case. But anything in which there's liquidity on uniswap would work just fine.
00:11:38.420 - 00:11:56.820, Speaker A: Got it. And do you think that the ideal assets are the ones that have a sufficient amount of liquidity? I guess. Could anything happen if it's a very thinly traded asset? And how that affect the strategy?
00:11:57.320 - 00:12:35.136, Speaker B: I mean, I think it would be similar to any kind of AMM pool where you have an asset that loses value and you end up holding that bad asset. So you don't want to be putting shit coins in these funds. Ideally it would be similar to a pool two scenario with normal yield farming where you end up just holding all of the other coin. So I would say the goal with this was really to create a portfolio of blue chip assets, but you could put some other type things in there. Like in the demo we put pickle in the fund and I think that's kind of fine, but I wouldn't want to put something that's going to get Rug pulled because then you're going to just end up holding all of that asset. Got it.
00:12:35.158 - 00:12:36.964, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:12:37.162 - 00:12:52.250, Speaker B: Thanks. And just to add to that, so we plan on integrating into the UI a sort of warning if something doesn't have enough liquidity or if it's being traded very thinly just to make sure that people are trading mindfully and making their portfolios as strong as possible.
00:12:53.180 - 00:12:59.150, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is a really interesting application of a balancer pool here.
00:12:59.520 - 00:13:16.880, Speaker C: Good stuff, folks. Amazing demo, really loved it. Everything from the memes to the product functionality. Quick question, I'm looking at the gurus feature. Did you all build that out or is that like a future roadmap item?
00:13:17.220 - 00:13:47.916, Speaker B: That was a dream item. We didn't quite get to that, so we kind of focused on the core functionality. But the idea with that is basically if you can take set protocols like copy trading, you should be able to do something similar with a distribution in a chakra. So it's like more personalized and set protocol stuff because you can still copy those initial allocations and then potentially copy the DCA entering strategies and the exiting strategies. But yeah, the initial version doesn't have that. Got it.
00:13:47.938 - 00:13:48.750, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:13:52.720 - 00:14:07.392, Speaker B: Is there kartik. I don't know, is there a way that we can kind of get access to that video or play a little bit? I'm still learning the Djin ropes myself, so I'd love to kind of dive in a little bit more as well. But yeah, that'd be great.
00:14:07.526 - 00:14:09.952, Speaker A: From your score sheet, you can click on the name and it's a link.
00:14:10.006 - 00:14:15.492, Speaker B: And it'll take you to oh, of course. You guys are so clever. Great. Awesome.
00:14:15.626 - 00:14:34.056, Speaker A: There are no more questions from the judges. Maybe I'll ask one. How do I get my next? How did you guys get the iteration working out? I want to know the service or how that happened. I just want to do that same thing for the next thing.
00:14:34.078 - 00:14:44.444, Speaker B: For Eight Global yeah, there's a website called Vocodes v O Codes, and they have, like I think it's some sort of neural net kind of thing.
00:14:44.482 - 00:14:45.336, Speaker A: They have a lot of voices.
00:14:45.368 - 00:14:48.300, Speaker B: I was debating between SpongeBob or David Attenborough.
00:14:49.760 - 00:14:51.856, Speaker A: I'm glad that you david Attenborough was.
00:14:51.878 - 00:14:59.330, Speaker B: The winner, for sure. I just saw his documentary that he just did recently. It's so on.
00:15:01.300 - 00:15:01.616, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:01.638 - 00:15:06.370, Speaker B: Yeah, there was a little bit of inspiration there might have been in the head at the time. Great.
00:15:06.740 - 00:15:07.780, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much.
00:15:07.850 - 00:15:19.050, Speaker B: Quickly, Adam, as well. Ashley, you asked about finding more about it. We wrote a Medium article as well, which you can find linked on our showcase profile if you want to read more. Awesome. Cool. Thank you. Good to see you too.
00:15:19.050 - 00:15:21.160, Speaker B: Yeah, you too.
00:15:21.310 - 00:15:33.870, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone. That was great. Thank you so much for being our first demo. And with that, we are ready to move on to our next team, and that is Project Vault Alarm. So, Romero, I know you're on the call, so whenever you're ready, feel free to share your video.
00:15:45.220 - 00:16:33.250, Speaker C: Hello, and welcome to my Ethanline 2020 project submission. This is safe vaults. My name is Ramirez Gonzalez. I'm a full stack developer from Argentina. So for this hackathon, my project was an iOS app that lets users track any vaults from the maker protocol. So my idea was to let users show information about their vaults, their positions, as quickly as possible, even try the new iOS widgets, and we'll alert users in case there's a liquidation risk. So, going to the app, basically, we show the price from some collaterals, and we let the users track any vault that they want.
00:16:33.250 - 00:18:10.110, Speaker C: It's as simple as entering, for example, the ID of the vault, and we can display the information that it might be useful. So we let the users activate or deactivate alarms, see the price, the ratio, the collateral, and the depth they have taken. So let's add for example, another one with a different collateral. So we basically try to alert the user in case there's a risk of a liquidation, having access also to the Oracles from Maker. It's also nice to let the users see all the prices for the different collaterals and not only show the current price, but also the next price as the Oracle is updated once an hour. And this is especially what I wanted to build and try and test was the new widgets so that users can, with a simple swipe, even when the phone is blocked, can see and be assured that their position is collateralized and it's not at risk. So basically I wanted to challenge myself and try the new SwiftUI that's basically what was built the app with.
00:18:10.110 - 00:18:56.590, Speaker C: Also there are some calls to the blockchain, to the main net and some public APIs and some local notifications. What I need to do next is be sure that alerts work. We don't want any users trusting too much in an app that it's not completely tested. Well, of course, publish the app, get some feedback and continue building. If the users find it worth it, maybe the app can also integrate some other protocols. So that was my project. I have fun building this small app and I hope you like it.
00:18:59.360 - 00:19:12.480, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks Romero. I'll let our judges kick off with any questions. Nice. I could kick off. First of all, I think this is a really important project to work on. I think we all need more risk management tools.
00:19:12.480 - 00:19:30.200, Speaker A: Obviously no one wants to lose money. So really like the overall focus here. I'm curious what happens when it's below a certain threshold? Is there any functionality now or plan to potentially be able to top that up, whether automatically or through the mobile UI?
00:19:30.940 - 00:20:00.530, Speaker C: I was trying to make it sound like an alarm. Basically I had some yield farming friends that wake up every 2 hours just to check their phone, just to see if price didn't went down too much. So basically, I don't know. I know it's not recommended, but I sleep with my phone as an alarm near my bed. So why don't you just make a sound whenever there is a.
00:20:02.900 - 00:20:09.300, Speaker A: Got it. And could you apply this beyond Maker? Can you do this for compound positions?
00:20:10.040 - 00:20:26.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I was also checking Ave and compound, but I knew more about Maker and also what some colleagues were recommending me to do because it was useful for them.
00:20:26.590 - 00:20:28.248, Speaker A: Yeah, cool.
00:20:28.334 - 00:20:36.524, Speaker C: But yeah, it was just a test. I was sort of hacking and I was just trying to push myself and try something new.
00:20:36.722 - 00:20:37.196, Speaker B: Got it.
00:20:37.218 - 00:20:42.696, Speaker C: Build something useful without making something completely strange.
00:20:42.888 - 00:20:44.896, Speaker A: Totally cool. Thanks.
00:20:45.078 - 00:20:49.136, Speaker B: Did you work on this yourself or did you have anyone else as a part of your team?
00:20:49.318 - 00:20:59.270, Speaker C: No, I have some friends that guide me or just the app and give me some feedback. But, yeah, I code everything by myself.
00:20:59.800 - 00:21:04.970, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. And you did the design as well, or your friends helped with that?
00:21:05.580 - 00:21:17.960, Speaker C: No, I copied a little bit some apps that already exist. But yes, it doesn't have much of a design, to be honest, but it's just as clean as possible.
00:21:18.030 - 00:21:30.220, Speaker B: It's at least straightforward design in terms of being a little bit less complicated in terms of interacting with it. Sid, I'm kind of curious, your thoughts, too, coming from Coinbase.
00:21:30.560 - 00:22:13.870, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a super useful feature. I know there's a lot of people that would really like to have a quick alarm that warns them when they're about to get wiped out. I was just curious, actually. Ramiro, great project. What was the hurdle you encountered with getting the alarm to work? So what I actually needed to do was to run some background tests, some background threads, when the phone is locked and the app is not even running, and iOS does that in a weird way. I just can't set, like, a cron work. Like, every minute update, I have to ask how many times I want to run that background app.
00:22:13.870 - 00:23:20.544, Speaker C: And iOS kind of in an intelligent way, just try to find out how it's more optimized and it doesn't make all the requests I want to do, but maybe I was trying to as the protocol updates only once an hour. Maybe just try to run it every 50 minutes. It doesn't have to be by the second background task. Yeah, sorry, I was just saying, do you have an idea of how you might change the architecture to make it work and actually get live alarms? I was just trying I did have some experience with the previous version of Swift, and as a full stack, I wanted to try something new, and I was just trying and I thought the hackathon was a nice opportunity to try to type code and see what was going to happen. Yeah, that's great. I do have to invest more time if I wanted to publish the app to make sure that if there's an optimal way to do so. Got it.
00:23:20.582 - 00:23:21.330, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:23:22.660 - 00:23:46.452, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, Ramiro. And yeah, I guess I hope you continue building this thing because I would definitely love to try this out on my phone. So, with that, we are ready to move on to our next demo. That is Team Tide's. Gas saver. So, Corbin and Team, I think you're already on this panelist, so whenever you're ready, feel free to kick off with your video.
00:23:46.606 - 00:23:47.310, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:23:48.480 - 00:23:49.276, Speaker C: Hello.
00:23:49.458 - 00:23:57.150, Speaker E: I'm flavio. I'm from Brazil, and I will show the solution that I built.
00:24:24.440 - 00:24:35.800, Speaker A: Fabi, I think you forgot to check the audio box. So we're not seeing sorry, we're not getting audio. So would you mind sharing it again with the audio?
00:24:42.940 - 00:25:34.460, Speaker E: Hello, my name is Flavio Goveer, and I will share with you the projects I built at Global Hackathon. The problem I got was the issue of gas in Ethereum transactions. This creates some problems for users. The user has to deal with unpredictable gas prices. He also needs to buy Ether for room transactions, and the high prices drive away many users. For this reason, I decided to create Tidys, a USDC gas saver. The main concept of Tidys is to enable users to save Ether on sending transfers or enable users to earn USDC calling these transfers.
00:25:34.460 - 00:26:28.430, Speaker E: Imagine the example of the Frog. Frog uses USDC and he wants to transfer his USDCs to someone else or maybe deposited on a long term DeFi protocol. He is no hurry to complete this transaction. Then he can use tides to help him save his transfers fees. Once connected, he can create an approval to be later colored by another user. To store the approval, he has to define the recipient of the transfer, the amount of the transfer, how much he wants to pay as tip, and a deadline for approval to be active. After that, he must confirm the two messages in his wallet one for the main transaction and other for the tip payment.
00:26:28.430 - 00:27:18.170, Speaker E: Once he's signed, his approval already appears on our list and can be called by another user who wants to pay the gas for the transactions and receive the tip in USDC. For each complete transfer, the user who sent the transaction receives USDC the corresponding tip for the transaction. This is done by Type Smart contract, which is responsible for receiving the types and sends it to the user who paid the transaction's gas fees. In short, it works like this the sender sing the two future transactions. After this, they are stored together in the Provost storage servers. Then, another person, the Wyo, selected as many set.
