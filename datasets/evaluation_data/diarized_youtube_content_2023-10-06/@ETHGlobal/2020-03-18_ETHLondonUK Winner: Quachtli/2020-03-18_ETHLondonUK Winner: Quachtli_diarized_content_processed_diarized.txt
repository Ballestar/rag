00:00:00.970 - 00:00:23.374, Speaker A: So we all met this weekend on Friday. The problem statement that was originally postulated was just really kind of like privacy in general. And then Tom came up with a really cool idea. He said that Sapier is a nice way to stream money to people. Let's just say I wanted to earn a salary and I wanted to earn my salary. Over time, everybody would be able to see what my salary is. And that's not really great.
00:00:23.374 - 00:00:54.842, Speaker A: It wouldn't be great to see what my colleague's salary is. It wouldn't be good to see what my boss's salary is. So the solution to this would possibly be to do it in a private manner. And so we have integrated the Aztec Protocol to create streaming private money so you could conceivably stream a salary over a period of time. So we tried it and it's pretty close to working. So here you can see that I have a balance of 600 die. I've actually locked up 125 into ZK die, which is on the Aztec Protocol.
00:00:54.842 - 00:01:30.982, Speaker A: And we can create a stream. And so to create this stream, we say how much we want to stream. So let's stream 100 die, let's decide who we'll stream it to. So let's just say this is my employee, I'm going to stream him over the next seven days, a stream of 100 ZK die. And so then we'll create this stream and we use the Aztec API to do it. And I can maybe allow Tom to explain the proof that's about to get created, its destination, and all the fun stuff that goes on in the background.
00:01:31.046 - 00:02:46.900, Speaker B: Okay, so at this point, we have created a Aztec note and sent it to the smart contract. Once this transaction goes through, that is, we then are going to send another transaction which defines all the parameters of the stream. So that's going to tell you who it's going to and how long this stream is going to go on for. Once that's done, the recipient can kind of obviously find an event on chain which tells them that they have this stream pointed at them. They can then choose to withdraw any fraction of that time frame. They just need to give a timestamp to smart contracts and it will do a dividend proof which proves that the amount of money that they want to withdraw from the note on the smart contract is equal to the time period that they are claiming over. We then kind of check that they're not claiming money into the future.
00:02:46.900 - 00:03:16.550, Speaker B: And yeah, I think that's about technical details with those two aspects along with the standard joint split proof proving that they aren't creating money out of nowhere, that throws another note over to the recipient and then the change note gets replaced onto the contracts for them to claim in future. These notes, they hide the value.
00:03:16.620 - 00:03:29.260, Speaker A: So no one ever knows what value you are transferring. Yeah, that's a good idea. All right. So private money on ethereum. Yeah. Thank.
