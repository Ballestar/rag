00:00:05.530 - 00:00:36.150, Speaker A: And I'm super excited to welcome Robert Leshner, co founder, founder and CEO of Compound. We're going to do an AMA segment here and we sourced a lot of questions from the broader global and compound ecosystem. So I'll just go rapid fire into this and hopefully we have enough to talk about for 30 to 40 minutes. If not, we'll talk about whatever Robert wants to talk about. So let's start with something easy. Robert, I've known you for a few years. We've seen so much happen in DFI.
00:00:36.150 - 00:00:55.822, Speaker A: My first question is three years ago, when you originally thought Compound would be and what it is now, is that exactly what you thought? In a good way? What is the expectation versus reality? Could you do sort of a comparison and contrast how that world was then and now?
00:00:55.956 - 00:01:42.270, Speaker B: Yeah. So first off, I'm excited to be here speaking with you all today. Three years ago, when we launched Compound, it was August 2018, I think is when the first version of Compound was launched. It was after a year of building in solitude in the upstairs attic above an advertising agency and we didn't know what to expect. There was very few things that looked or works like DeFi applications at this time. The phrase DeFi would sort of be invented around the same time that Compound launched, not by Compound, but by other folks in the community. It was a very early time and what we were telling ourselves at the time was that it would take potentially five to ten years before there would be any meaningful traction in DeFi.
00:01:42.270 - 00:02:54.610, Speaker B: At the time there were some very early experiments in DEXes from token trader to Ether delta to Zero X, later to uniswap. But at the time there was just like these very primitive examples of people trying to use smart contracts to create financial tools that sort of just ran on their own, right? And so our genuine expectation was it was going to be five to ten years, one, because it would take five to ten years for assets from the real world to start to come into crypto. Besides, just like crypto natively issued tokens, we thought that the user experience was extremely clunky and version one of Compound was so hilariously clunky and we just thought it would take forever. And I think things evolved a lot faster than we expected. The white paper for Compound at the time was like, here's this system, and eventually, and eventually to us, actually, we thought it was 510 years, eventually it will be run by a Dow, because even then the term for anything like smart contract managed was dow. Right? We said, eventually this will be run by a Dow. We thought it was going to be yours.
00:02:54.610 - 00:03:43.102, Speaker B: The pace at which things unfolded was actually much faster than I or anybody in the community or anybody outside of crypto, or really anyone inside of crypto. And that includes the most passionate believers. It all occurred faster than anyone would have anticipated. By the end of 2018, compound had like $20 million of assets in it. It was like number two behind MakerDAO, which I think there was like $50 million of assets in MakerDAO at the time. 2019, I think, was actually a really big year for DFI, because really, of the growth and adoption of stablecoins, stablecoins really weren't that popular in 2018. There were some very early examples of them, but 2019 saw tether on ethereum, it saw USD coin, it saw the growth of dai.
00:03:43.102 - 00:04:08.294, Speaker B: It was still called PSI at the time, and all of these stable coins. And this was like the sort of missing ingredient that turbocharged DeFi. In my mind. Suddenly, applications like compound started to make a lot of sense to people. No one really wanted to borrow ether. They really wanted to borrow stablecoins. People didn't necessarily want to trade an arbitrary token.
00:04:08.294 - 00:04:58.182, Speaker B: They wanted to trade a stablecoin for crypto, or trade a crypto for stablecoins. It just enabled the whole ecosystem to grow rapidly. And so everything started moving at a speed faster than we anticipated. And that actually encouraged us to take what we thought was going to be a five year journey and condense its time frame and move the governance of compound to a dow or the community and decentralize the protocol. And I actually think the thing that eclipsed our thinking was how fast we would be able to hand over controls. A lot of the steps that went into this process, compound created or designed and are now becoming like the staples of DeFi. But having a time lock contract, we wrote a time lock that's now used in hundreds of projects.
00:04:58.182 - 00:05:33.666, Speaker B: We wrote a governance system and voting token, which are used in hundreds of projects. And all these things we had to discover for ourselves and just continuously try to not just innovate on the core protocol, but the tools by which the community could use to run the protocol. And so I didn't think by this point we would have a decentralized protocol. When we launched compound, it was running on admin keys, and now it's pretty much anything but. It's a community run and decentralized protocol. And it happened a lot faster than I would have guessed.
00:05:33.858 - 00:05:57.680, Speaker A: Oh, this is incredible. Unknowingly, you've set the stage for all the other questions I had, because you touched on every single topic I have a big question on. So we'll go deeper into everything. So, no, this is definitely incredible. I think it still blows my mind that I remember last february, or actually early february, I was like, wait, d five just crossed a billion in TBL, and that feels like forever. But it was not even 18 months ago.
00:05:58.210 - 00:06:00.720, Speaker B: Yeah, the space moves so fast.
00:06:02.450 - 00:06:51.946, Speaker A: And we couldn't imagine when maker crossed 100 million in ETH deposits. And that's still not two years ago, I think. But it's great. You kind of already kind of set the stage here. So I think one of the super interesting things here is that you essentially were one of the super cutting edge but also high profile projects to introduce things like liquidity mining and governance and just all these growth tactics. And in my opinion it's a little bit challenging because you are the first ones to do this thing and find out if it's working or not. So you're just in a super interesting position which is good and bad at the same time, but kind of knowing everything now in hindsight, anywhere from new things we've invented to learnings, from trying all those things out in iterations.
00:06:51.946 - 00:06:58.050, Speaker A: If you were to launch Compound again now, what would you do something differently?
00:06:58.470 - 00:07:39.630, Speaker B: I would do a lot differently. And a lot of things that we did at the time were being done for the first time. We had to make some educated guesses. And even in the educated guesses, it was impossible to predict whether we were going to be right, wrong, too conservative, too aggressive, or what. The idea of handing over the protocol to the community without a gatekeeper was considered like an absolutely radical idea at the time. There was a few other examples of decentralized governance, but they were very early still. MakerDAO was a good example, but people thought it was crazy that there wasn't going to be a foundation directly managing a protocol.
00:07:39.630 - 00:08:26.014, Speaker B: A lot of the investors in Compound Labs thought it was crazy that we would give away half the tokens. Up until this point there was really no project that was giving away tokens at all. They were selling tokens. Right. And everyone thought that 50% of the tokens being given away was like an insane thing. And the mechanics by which we decided to actually roll out governance was also extremely experimental. People forget, but Compound governance in the voting contracts and the voting system was actually tested live for three months with like a limited token holder group before being rolled out to the entire community, which is something that I actually haven't seen since.
00:08:26.014 - 00:08:53.218, Speaker B: People go from zero to full on chain governance sometimes. Oftentimes the intermediate steps are like there's snapshots or there's a team that's vaguely in control and enforcing the community's will, but we basically went from centralized to decentralized. But the intermediate step was not like some intermediate governance solution. It was just allowing a limited stakeholder group to use the full on chain.
00:08:53.314 - 00:08:56.070, Speaker A: Tool hacky staging environment.
00:08:56.410 - 00:09:43.714, Speaker B: Exactly. And if we could do it all differently, there's a couple of things that have emerged as like standards in the communities, not just of Compound, but in crypto and in DeFi generally that I think we would have adopted, but they just didn't really exist yet. So one is, I would say, distributing tokens to historical users. When we started distributing tokens to users, it was to all present and future users. It wasn't historical looking I actually think the way Uniswap handled it was phenomenal. It's probably too late to go back and revise this, but if I could go back to beginning of 2020, we would have changed how we allocated tokens between future users and present users and historical users. That's the first thing that I think would have changed.
00:09:43.714 - 00:10:24.580, Speaker B: The second is that if I could do it all over again, I think there should have been generally more for developers. It's very easy to focus on users, but I actually think the most important part of the protocol in a lot of ways are developers. And I think that coming up with some method of allocating tokens specifically for projects built on top of compound or developers building on top of compound would have been really valuable. It's also hard to go back and change that, but I actually think the community can potentially start to recalibrate and focus more on the developer side of things, as opposed to just raw users of the protocol itself.
00:10:27.270 - 00:10:34.166, Speaker A: Are you sort of differentiating another category between a grant program equivalent or kind of what do you mean by that?
00:10:34.268 - 00:11:43.360, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's a great question. I think the way it gets developed and expresses itself now is something like a grant program, right, where you can allocate to developers. But I also think in terms of allocating tokens and governance rights to just applications, I think it'd be more interesting to look at not just how do you distribute governance to stakeholders that are building, but also applications built on top of the protocol. At the end of the day, what we wanted and didn't see play out as closely as I would have hoped, would have been tokens going to custodians and things like that, that are directly integrating the protocol. If I could have revised it, I think we would have changed the actual logic a little bit. But building a system for the first time is incredibly difficult and it's hard to plan for all these outcomes. And I think what we also could have done is if I could go back in time, it would have been setting up things like a grants committee sooner, as opposed to letting it sort of slowly develop over time.
00:11:43.360 - 00:12:13.110, Speaker B: Again, when we created Comp and when we distributed it to users, these weren't really concepts yet, but now these are concepts. So if I could go back in time to the day that Comp was released, I think we would have had in place some allocation of tokens overseen by the community, not through the protocol and the user usage of it, but to be distributed by users to other builders, to other participants, to other stakeholders.
00:12:13.690 - 00:12:43.150, Speaker A: Absolutely. If I'm parsing this right, I think a lot of this is about tightening the feedback loops the way I see it, because you get to understand and array much faster. And I think that's an excellent sort of framing as well on something you just mentioned, obviously being the first one to try things out is challenging, but what did you kind of think would happen for liquidity mining when you introduced it and anyone from concerns to what you would change now specifically around that?
00:12:43.300 - 00:13:11.978, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny because at the time it wasn't really called liquidity mining and internally we didn't think of it as liquidity mining. We just thought of it as, hey, this is the coolest thing we can do to bring users into the fold. Right. And we thought, well, the product is great. What if we make it even greater by giving comp to all the users? People love compound. Today they'll extra love compound if we just give them the tokens. And we didn't really know what was going to happen.
00:13:11.978 - 00:13:46.680, Speaker B: There was a couple of other similar approaches that other ecosystem participants have done in the past. I thought as we were designing it, we had been able to observe synthetics and some of the approaches they were taking. So people say compound invented liquidity mining. I don't really agree, but I do think we came up with a way of distributing liquid tokens to users for using the protocol directly, as opposed to incentivizing some liquidity pool. Right. Or like some uniswap pool or whatever. Right.
00:13:46.680 - 00:14:50.790, Speaker B: We also saw exchanges that have been doing there was a long time ago, there was a concept called trans fee mining that was popular for three months before the exchanges that pioneered it imploded horribly. But what they did is they would give tokens to users based on how much trading volume they had. And this was actually bad because it led to a lot of watch trading and just like useless activity. And what we wanted to avoid was people entering into useless activity. And we tried to design a system that would just reward users, not arbitrary things, and it was hard to get it exactly right. I think if anyone on this call remembers the first couple of weeks of the comp distribution, the first couple of weeks were chaotic because it was like, first of its kind changes to it had to go through governance, which was like a little bit slow and the incentives were crazy. So certain markets wound up being hilariously used when they didn't serve as much of a legitimate underlying economic purpose as people expected.
00:14:50.790 - 00:15:15.860, Speaker B: The Bat market, if anyone remembers, was like the number one market on compound. And everybody on the internet and Twitter was like, why is bat so large? And it's just because the algorithm that was used just led in this unexpected consequence to bat being the number one market in compound and people are scrambling to find bat, take it off exchanges, move it into compound. It was like such a bizarre situation.
00:15:17.190 - 00:15:45.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember all those things. Yes, it was chaotic. One last kind of question on this. You sort of mentioned that a lot of people started using a lot of the things that you came up with as part of the launch and anywhere from contracts on how to manage governance to just liquidity mining stuff. Did you take that as like a super good thing when everybody started using it? You have hundreds of projects or was that worrying? How do you kind of look at it?
00:15:45.888 - 00:16:40.054, Speaker B: I take it as a super good thing. One of the best virtues of Ethereum and DeFi on Ethereum and this applies to other blockchains as well, but one of the strongest virtues I find is that every project increases the network effect of the entire ecosystem. And if compound can build a contract that other people can use, great. Right. If projects don't have to reinvent the wheel and they can use the compound time lock code or like the comp token code or the comp governance system code, great. It means there's more things happening on Ethereum for everybody and everyone's going to benefit from it. Whether it's compound directly or compound indirectly, the more people that are able to ship things faster, it just benefits the entire ecosystem.
00:16:40.054 - 00:17:13.126, Speaker B: When we started, there was almost no code that we could use off the shelf. Right. There was almost nothing that we could refer to in terms of how to build out an application like compound. We had to truly discover and innovate a lot of the most basic concepts like compound pioneered pure to pool liquidity. This didn't really exist yet on chain interest rates. Yeah. And how to compute interest rates for an infinite quantity of users with one computation instead of iterating over a list of them.
00:17:13.126 - 00:17:24.042, Speaker B: Very basic things we had to discover for ourselves. And now if we wanted to write compound or we wanted to make a new version, it wouldn't take the year that it took the first time.
00:17:24.096 - 00:17:24.314, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:24.352 - 00:17:56.950, Speaker B: It's not that we got smarter, it's that there's more things available now. You don't have to roll your own everything. You can focus on building a core application and use certain contracts off the shelf or in lightly modified ways. And so the fact that people don't have to build out their own governance tools, I think is unbelievably valuable for everyone because you get like a more decentralized ecosystem. The fact that people don't have to do the R and D to discover basic concepts and they can just copy pieces from compound is great.
00:17:57.020 - 00:17:57.254, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:57.292 - 00:18:12.620, Speaker B: So I think in a lot of ways, whether it's noticed or unnoticed, the more people that are using pieces of the compound ecosystem, it's like a silent victory. And I think the people that do notice it's even better.
00:18:13.630 - 00:18:20.860, Speaker A: Would you then say that it's usually not a good thing to be a first mover in this space because you have to figure a lot of this out.
00:18:21.470 - 00:19:08.314, Speaker B: It's definitely harder to be a first mover. And what's really funny is when we were designing the compound governance system, the way that the token works, the way you can delegate votes, the way you actually vote on proposals, the way the system mechanically operates. When we were designing it, we would always say we have a second mover advantage because discovering it for the first time would be so hard. We got to look at makerdow, we got to look at other things that have been built. We had an opportunity to look at tezos the blockchain and how they were doing governance of their blockchain. We had a second mover advantage and I think it allowed us to spend less time building a better system. If we had to discover all this stuff for the first time and we had nothing to compare it to, it would have been really hard.
00:19:08.314 - 00:19:14.590, Speaker B: And so I give a lot of kudos to the teams that had to be the first mover on even designing governance.
00:19:14.930 - 00:19:18.160, Speaker A: Absolutely. You.
00:19:21.010 - 00:19:21.646, Speaker B: Let'S see.
00:19:21.668 - 00:19:42.280, Speaker A: So I think a lot of projects right now are very focused on getting more and more people involved as they think about anywhere from increasing their users to their community. How did you initially bootstrap the compound ecosystem in the community? And what advice would you give right now to projects that are trying to spar a community?
00:19:43.050 - 00:20:24.222, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's things that we did well, I think there's things we didn't do phenomenally well. I think the first thing that's actually important is the ability to delegate votes was built natively into the Comp Token and the governance system. I actually think this is really important because sometimes the most active participants and the loudest voices aren't the wealthiest users. Right. And what you want is a system where just anyone who's active and wants to contribute has the opportunity to have a loud say in the direction of the protocol, even if they're new or young or entering crypto for the first time. Right. It leads to more of a meritocracy.
00:20:24.222 - 00:21:28.760, Speaker B: So I think the way we built the Comp Token and the delegation system was actually a really strong tool to get a couple really active participants involved in the community. The things that we didn't do well is it's now been over a year, a little more than a year since Comp was released. And I feel like it's taken a long time for the community to start to organize around having a grants committee, having a process to directly reward contributors. We weren't able to foresee the importance of that and it led to there being like a delay before. I think a lot of people could start to get involved and compound governance is starting to very rapidly evolve and flourish and I think we're starting to see more and more participants coming in. And I think that one of the things that we could have done better originally and I think that other projects can learn from is just having a solid foundation to be able to talk to contributors, reward them, make them a part of the process and it didn't start off with that. Got you.
00:21:29.530 - 00:21:48.750, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the second falls into the first one to figure this out so others then can copy and be like, oh, we should change this thing when we do it ourselves. Changing gears a little bit. Last week an exploit was discovered on compound. Could you tell us kind of what happened and sort of how do you kind of think about making sure that this doesn't happen again?
00:21:48.900 - 00:22:24.540, Speaker B: Yeah. So this goes to what I think is truly the biggest opportunity of an open and decentralized protocol and also the biggest risk. But I'd like to start with the biggest opportunity. So the biggest opportunity is that anyone can become a core contributor to the compound protocol. There's no obstacles, there's no roadblocks. Anyone listening right now can become a core contributor. You don't have to be a member of Compound Labs and it's an open development process with a group of community members that's excited to welcome new developers into the process.
00:22:24.540 - 00:23:16.406, Speaker B: And it means that people can work on code at the heart of compound. And so there was a bug that came from an amazing contribution from a great contributor who was looking to upgrade one of the features of compound. This upgrade was reviewed by lots of the community members. It was reviewed by members of Compound Labs. It was like what I actually think of as one of the most virtuous benefits of decentralization is that you could have a community member being a core contributor, adding and improving core functionality of the protocol, making it better. The biggest risk is that there is a bug, right? And in proposal 62, there was a bug. It happened, right? Luckily there was no user funds that were lost.
00:23:16.406 - 00:24:00.150, Speaker B: What was lost was comp that was reserved for future users. So in a lot of ways it was like a bank error in the favor of, in some cases, like very randomly selected addresses. And it was the first time that there was really like a smart contract bug that led to a loss of funds in compound history. And this is a massive disappointment. Now, this one proposal, proposal 62, shows the opportunity and it shows the risk of distributed governance and distributed development. And it shows how distributed development is different than centralized development, where there's like one core team that writes all the code and then people can vote on it. Like compound goes all the way and it's decentralized development.
00:24:00.150 - 00:24:50.714, Speaker B: And so there's nothing better than prop 62 to sort of like embody this. I think it's going to be a catalyst for change within the community and within the decentralized development process because I think it's going to lead to a little bit more conservatism in a good way, where there's going to be more participants, more review, more analysis, and it's going to lead to a much stronger, decentralized development process. But compound is also one of the first projects that really develops in this fashion. Most projects, even when they have decentralized voting control, they have centralized development. There's obviously some incredible examples to learn from. Like, Bitcoin is an open development process. Like anyone can become a contributor to it.
00:24:50.714 - 00:25:19.694, Speaker B: Right. And I think compound is headed in that way where you're going to have an open source code developed by a community, not a permission team, and that's the direction it's headed. And I actually think that 62 is an amazing wake up call because it was a disaster. I mean, frankly, it's a disaster. Right. It led to a loss so far of about 220,000 comp is missing.
00:25:19.822 - 00:25:20.500, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:21.350 - 00:25:39.818, Speaker B: But it didn't lose user funds. And no one in the community is going to forget this. It's going to change the way that development occurs. It's going to, I think, clarify the minds of all of the contributors. And I think long term, it's going to lead to a lot of improvements in the protocol. There were bugs in bitcoin. Right.
00:25:39.818 - 00:25:47.290, Speaker B: That's a fact. Right. This was a bug in Compound, but if the community handles it correctly, it'll be the last bug in compound.
00:25:47.870 - 00:26:17.766, Speaker A: No, that's a very optimistic and a good note. As a summary, I think this is super interesting, I guess on the same theme. You are the CEO of Compound Labs, but a minority token holder of the compound protocol. How do you kind of see your role in this ecosystem and for the protocol and sort of what do you think that looks like compared to what the community expects of you as well?
00:26:17.948 - 00:26:51.934, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a really interesting question because I think there's more of a desire to have a figurehead than there should be. Right. I'm not actually special. Pretty much anyone listening to this call could play almost as large of a role in the compound protocol than I play. What I have is years of experience and a history with the protocol and a passion for it. But I think in order for a protocol like compound to succeed, it has to be taken up by the community. They have to take it over.
00:26:51.934 - 00:27:15.240, Speaker B: Like, Satoshi is not here to guide Bitcoin. Right. I think Bitcoin is stronger because of it. If you had a single figurehead that was in charge, I think you get a worse outcome. And so I think I'm trying to make my role more and more of a cheerleader and somebody who knows how the system works, but someone who very genuinely wants the community to take over as much as possible.
00:27:16.490 - 00:27:31.578, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't mean this in any negative or bad way, but it's just interesting to see when sometimes the crowd goes against what you're interested in if you're voting on something. And that, in a way, is a true way of showcasing that. This is working as expected.
00:27:31.674 - 00:27:35.840, Speaker B: Yeah, I've lost a couple of votes in compound governance history, and that's great.
00:27:36.450 - 00:28:00.078, Speaker A: That's a great sign. Moving on to sort of looking at the growth of the ecosystem. If you were a developer and if somebody comes to you says, I want to contribute to the compound protocol, I guess what do you think is important over the next couple of years for the way you think the community or the future should grow?
00:28:00.264 - 00:28:37.710, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. So there's really like four buckets of work that are needed in my mind. So one is building out the core protocol itself, adding features, adding new code, adding modifications. We're starting to see a community set of developers really start to gain this as a skill set. A year ago, there was one or two developers that were contributing to the core code. We're getting more and more contributors to the core code, and that's really exciting. And I think we're starting to build a muscle as a community of core contributors.
00:28:37.710 - 00:29:09.430, Speaker B: The second are applications built on top of the protocol. Right. There's huge opportunities for better interfaces for taking the open source front end forking. It improving, it adding new features that I think are underrepresented. One of the things we did a couple of weeks ago was open source and license the front end to the community and say like, hey, take this, go run it. There's a one click deploy process to IPFS. If you want to make a better version of this, it should be what everyone uses.
00:29:09.430 - 00:29:29.038, Speaker B: Right? And I think the experimentation around the front end is a little bit low, but I think there's really cool opportunities there. Like someone could build a front end that integrates compound and uniswap and does even cooler things with both of them. Or there's a lot of opportunities to make the core interface even better. And I think this is a little bit underserved.
00:29:29.214 - 00:29:38.790, Speaker A: Should that come from people's own creativity or do you think there's a handful of things that you would like to see and you want to kind of incentivize that or broadcast that and tell people to do it?
00:29:38.860 - 00:30:16.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the creativity is the limit. I'm not able to think of all the things that a front end should be, but I could see someone building a system that you can opt into sharing your email and it sends you alerts when you're borrowing. Capacity is getting too dangerous and it could be more useful. You could see a version that doesn't have that but focuses more on Dex integrations as well. There's a lot there that I think is possible. And so I think front ends are like a really underdeveloped corner of this because there doesn't have to be one front end. Right.
00:30:16.434 - 00:31:03.126, Speaker B: Someone could fix some bugs. Treasure and ledger are always having issues. Those hardware wallets, using the interface. There's so much to do that could be improved upon. That's the second. The third is that I actually think there's a big opportunity in. The community to spend more time thinking about the sort of parameters of the protocol, not like, what is the code and how does it work, but what should the liquidation variables be, what should the collateral variables? You know, Gauntlet has recently come in and started spending more time on this, but there's big opportunities to think through the interest rate models and the economic efficiency of these markets, things that are still run by humans but that are always looking for active contributors and thinkers.
00:31:03.126 - 00:32:31.558, Speaker B: So if you're someone who's not technically inclined but you are economically or mathematically inclined, I think there's huge opportunities to focus on the parameters of the protocol. And lastly, it's new projects. Like, new projects are there's a very vague and open ended category, but could there be a version of the compound protocol specifically meant for being deployed to roll ups right? Or that could work with other things? Can the compound community deploy the code elsewhere? The sky's the limit. But I think there's a huge opportunity for creative thinking and for people to volunteer and say like, hey, it would be fun to have compound on Optimism or compound on Arbitrum or compound on Solana or whatever it is, and basically adapt the core code base and the open source front end to those networks. I think the Grants organization should be able and excited to encourage this and to incentivize the success of this. And I think there's huge opportunities here. So if you're listening to this and you're thinking to yourself like, oh, it can't be that hard to deploy compound on Arbitrum, it's great, let's do it right as a community, anyone here can help expand compound.
00:32:31.558 - 00:32:35.290, Speaker B: And I think that's really exciting and really empowering.
00:32:36.190 - 00:33:43.934, Speaker A: No, it's just a great message. I do have a couple of things left, but they're all on the same theme. Before we kind of wrap today up, I think one of the most interesting things today as we looked at all the talks has been how much variety and sort of diversity there is on the types of projects that have been funded by the ecosystem. Some of them are just services that help you manage what your compound positions are, to better interfaces, to more technical projects that help you improve the design and even parameter tweaking and managing risk. It is such a big ecosystem that you can contribute in so many different ways. And one common questions, common theme and common set of questions we've gone for every of these talks has been how do I contribute if I'm not a developer? Or do I have to be really specifically perfect on understanding solidity or one of the other skill sets? Is it really kind of how you're thinking about the growth of the ecosystem? Do you want to prioritize developers right now before you move on to other sort of types of skills or what does that look like as you think about it from your perspective?
00:33:44.062 - 00:34:00.246, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. So I would describe Compound as very professional and boring anarchy. And there's an opportunity for anyone with any skill set to come in and just start participating.
00:34:00.358 - 00:34:00.874, Speaker A: Right?
00:34:00.992 - 00:34:51.820, Speaker B: Anyone could come in and just sort of like there's no protocol job applications, so to speak. But if anyone's interested in working with a core DeFi protocol, there's a million opportunities for anyone with an idea on how they want to contribute. There's opportunities to help come in as a community organizer and organize the development processes the community calls. There's roles for people to come in and spend more time on the economics of the protocol. There's opportunities for folks to focus on protocol business development or focus on marketing or focus on integrations. Whatever your skill set is, if you just come into the community and you're really excited, you just raise your hand and you say, here's what I'm going to do, how do I do this? I think there's going to be a lot of support for it. And so there's very few people that tell you no or that want to tell you no.
00:34:51.820 - 00:35:01.200, Speaker B: There's not a lot of structure in a good way. I mean, it's decentralized protocol, but whatever your skill set, there's probably something for you.
00:35:02.930 - 00:35:32.694, Speaker A: That'S perfect. So hopefully the couple of questions we got today just right now definitely address this one sort of related, but a side conversation I want to have is I think one interesting problem right now in this market is that the incentive to start something new is far greater than contributing to something existing. How do you think about balancing that? Or do you have any advice for people on when they have this choice, what should they think about long term versus short term and anything around it?
00:35:32.812 - 00:36:46.622, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. In an environment like this, systems like Compound that have been around for years are incredibly exciting for certain reasons, but they're not as new as something that you can create from scratch. I think long term simple protocols like Compound are extremely important, but I understand the sort of goals of starting something from scratch. The advantages to working in a protocol like Compound are that it's operating today, there's tens of billions of dollars in it, it's already at scale, there's a huge global user base and you can have a huge impact in a way that you don't have to take a risk on something that doesn't exist yet. But I'm someone who started Compound from scratch and so I understand the idea of entrepreneurship as well. But the skills that you build at Compound are also the skills that are necessary to create a new protocol. And oftentimes I think being a meaningful contributor to a protocol like Compound helps you on whatever journey you want to go on next.
00:36:46.622 - 00:36:49.280, Speaker B: And so in a way, you can have both.
00:36:49.810 - 00:37:00.770, Speaker A: Yeah, if anything, this could also be a way to sort of get experience understanding how to manage things at scale and use that to learn and see what you can improve or change.
00:37:00.920 - 00:37:01.620, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:37:02.070 - 00:37:27.830, Speaker A: No, that's a really good way of thinking about it. Last question, and I feel like you've answered this in certain ways, but I want to get a few more specific details here for everybody that's kind of interested in contributing to compound right now. What is kind of your wish list of things that are super interesting to you that you think the compound ecosystem needs and what is the process of becoming a contributor to the protocol?
00:37:27.990 - 00:38:11.462, Speaker B: Yeah, so to get involved you can go to Comp XYZ and join the Discord. That's where a lot of the conversations take place between those two and you can ask what needs to be built, but I think there's a lot of room to spend more time talking about things that haven't been looked at in years. Like the interest rate models. These are massively important move, billions of dollars, but no one's really looked at what the interest rate model should be in a really long time. Right. So taking a look at some of the parameters of the protocol with a very research driven approach I think is a good one. I think there's a large sort of development wish list that you can find on compoundgrants.org
00:38:11.462 - 00:38:40.578, Speaker B: through RFPs and projects that are in the works. If there's things that look interesting and haven't been worked on, great opportunity. I think focusing on the interface areas, we just open sourced the interface. I'll double back to this. There's a lot of opportunities to make the interface better. When we launched it in 2019, it was like the greatest interface that Web Three had ever seen. But that was two years ago, two and a half years ago.
00:38:40.578 - 00:39:05.242, Speaker B: And the interface really has been pretty much the exact same since. And a lot has changed. I think forking the interface and improving it is a huge opportunity. There's so many features that are available. And lastly, helping to expand compound to new markets and in new ways I think is extremely exciting. It's much harder and longer work, especially.
00:39:05.296 - 00:39:12.540, Speaker A: Because it comes from argument for a specific interface. Prioritizing a user group or is that a product feature or protocol thing?
00:39:13.150 - 00:39:40.422, Speaker B: Yeah, in terms of the protocol, like working on gateway, we're working on deploying the code base to a roll up. There's a lot of opportunities just expand the access of the protocol. So that's the fourth area that I would say to look at. But it all starts with just like raising your hand. There's a lot of people that are happy to talk to you and I would say like Comp XYZ and Discord are really great places to come. Amazing.
00:39:40.476 - 00:40:08.286, Speaker A: I think that's a perfect note to end on and I think if there's two takeaways here is go to Comp XYZ and get involved with the community and for those of you who are interested in building Compandgrants.org is the place to go to learn about how to get involved and get grants. Robert, thank you so much. Here, I want to thank everybody from the Compound Team and the Compound Grants program. I'll do this plug one more time for all of you here. Compoundgrants.org is the place to be.
00:40:08.286 - 00:40:39.014, Speaker A: You can see RFPs and apply for grants directly and get more and more involved. So with that, I want to thank everybody who tuned in today and participated. A lot of great questions, a lot of amazing projects, and a lot of links shared on how to get more pull requests on GitHub and get them to prod. So with that, I want to wish everybody happy hacking for the rest of the hackathon. We got a few more days to go before all projects are due, and we can't wait to see what everybody builds next week. So until then, enjoy your weekend, everybody. Or actually, not yet.
00:40:39.014 - 00:40:47.670, Speaker A: We're going to see all of you tomorrow for our Developer Tool Summit. So thanks again for tuning in and we'll see you tomorrow at 12:00 p.m.. Eastern.
00:40:48.250 - 00:40:49.890, Speaker B: Take care. Bye.
