00:00:05.690 - 00:00:26.150, Speaker A: Cool and we're good to go. Welcome everyone to the first day of NFT Hack 2022 workshop. So happy to have you all here and also super happy to have Leo from Harmony here who is going to give his workshop on Crosschain NFT bridge on Harmony. So with that being said, Leo, the mic is yours.
00:00:27.290 - 00:01:04.542, Speaker B: Thank you Anna. I'm Leo. I'm the VP engineering at Harmony. So I'm also driving our NFT and Metaverse initiative in harmony. So today just give a brief introduction about Harmony NFT and also cross chain NFT in Harmony. So we know we are in a MultiChain world right now and there's a lot of chain NFT being developed. Like we all know, the well known OpenSea on Ethereum and Flow is another blockchain dedicated to NFT.
00:01:04.542 - 00:01:19.560, Speaker B: NBA TOPSHOT is the top project developed on the Flow blockchain. So on Harmony there's also a very popular GameFi project developed recently called the DeFi Kingdom. So in a multi chain world.
00:01:22.890 - 00:01:23.298, Speaker C: We'Re.
00:01:23.314 - 00:02:24.586, Speaker B: Talking about the cross chain NFT. So cross chain NFT basically is to have your NFT in different chain and you can use cross chain bridge to bring your NFT to different chain. So Harmony launched a cross chain NFT bridge in December last year. So right now we support Ethereum and we are going to support BSE and the Polygon. So the NFT bridge will be able to support those Ethereum, BSc, Polygon and Harmony to have your NFT transfer across different chains. So we tended to build a tool to empower all the builders like you guys coming to build cross chain NFT utilities. So our bridge, the NFT bridge is one of the early NFT bridge in the industry right now.
00:02:24.586 - 00:03:22.538, Speaker B: So it provides high security bridge by our multi signature operators. It's a two way bridge, you can bridge from Harmony to Ethereum and from Ethereum to Harmony. I also mentioned BSc and the Polygon support ran out in progress. So it support standard ESA 721 and ASA 1155. Why do we need to build cross TN NFT? Because we believe the NFT is for everyone on different chain there are different users and ecosystem developed. So it's not just everyone going to be on the same chain. And of course when you have NFT as your identity or as your collectible in different chain, you want to make it also usable in other ecosystem.
00:03:22.538 - 00:04:25.102, Speaker B: So each chain has their own unique ecosystem so that the crosschain NFT will become utility and become a nicer choice. So also we know on different chains there could be a different fee and a higher fee or slow down the adoption of the NFT technology. So that's why we build the Crossing NFT to enable global market and direct market on different area in the world. So people may use different chain and also different use cases. So that's why when you move to different market, your NFT and your identity or your digital collectible, you want to make sure that's usable. That's why the crossing NFT becomes useful. So, some of the key strategies and some ideas we were considering to be able to enable by the crosschain NFT.
00:04:25.102 - 00:05:37.350, Speaker B: So the builders like you guys may use those idea and build the different interesting product and application using the Crossing NFT primitive. So for example derivative and the lending protocol. So you can have a premium NFT for example like the ape on Ethereum and you collateralize it and you can build the derivative on compatible chain like Harmony so that your original NFT was still on Ethereum. But you can have generate a different derivative on different chain to provide a mass market adoption. So also for example, like premium fashion brand, they can also build their premium NFT on different chain but using cross chain to be able to support other lending and derivative on other chain as well. So another utility use case could be the NFT fractionization. So NFT fractionization basically to enable crowdsourcing and market making on NFT.
00:05:37.350 - 00:06:50.842, Speaker B: And of course, don't forget about the GameFi in the metaverse. So the GameFi apparently the huge volume and the transaction make it not going to be sustainable on Ethereum but on Harmony. It's definitely something people would love to play with NFT on Harmony. So that's why the DeFi Kingdom in the GameFi project launch on Harmony gets a huge success. And we also actually working with the DeFi kingdom team to bring other NFT from other chain to make it also useful in the Harmony ecosystem. So our goal in Harmony to provide the infrastructure in the metaworth world for other creative and artists. So that due to the lower transaction fee and the higher TPS of Harmony, we'll be able to enable different use cases like streaming loyalties and gated access Harmony.
00:06:50.842 - 00:07:54.114, Speaker B: Also we intend to provide all the tool and all the middleware to enable the use case in the metaverse. So, Harmony also provide a 13 million NFT grant to all the builder and the project to be able to launch a Harmony. Recently there are quite a lot of NFT project and gameplay project launch at Harmony already. So feel free to apply for this grant in open format by clicking this link. So, since it's a workshop, so, I'd like to give a little bit more detail on how to build on Harmony. So for the Crossing NFT bridge, we do have an API document. Yeah, so this document provides the backend API that enable people to build a front end application.
00:07:54.114 - 00:09:18.380, Speaker B: But on the backend it's using the crosschain bridge to finish all the crosschain function. So the application builder you don't need to build your own backend for the cross chain application. And this is an example that the API will be able to support the utility. So here those are the endpoint for the back end of the bridge. How many horizon cross chain bridge actually build on top of the backend API as well? Some detailed description and example also provided in this document beyond the API, the SDK. Take a look at our SDK repo.
00:09:26.240 - 00:09:26.664, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:26.722 - 00:10:19.470, Speaker B: This is a bridge. SDK. So you can integrate the SDK on your own application. It's written in TypeScript. So for the builder and hacker, there's a testnet bridge that can be used to check to test your application. This is a testnet. Okay.
00:10:19.470 - 00:11:11.276, Speaker B: So the testnet works on the Harmony testnet and the Covenant Test Bridge testnet. And you can see on the testnet, we already have the binance and the polygon support as well. So on main net right now only have the for the NFT won't have the Asymmetry support. On testnet, the binance and the polygon support are already being added. Okay. So right now in Harmony, there are two main marketplace for NFT. One is called DA Vinci, and that is called NFT key.
00:11:11.276 - 00:11:34.230, Speaker B: So DA Vinci being launched on Harmony for over a year. And NFT key is a new marketplace being launched on Harmony. So on Davench, they also provide SDK so that for the NFT project team, you can build your NFT using the here.
00:11:34.920 - 00:11:35.524, Speaker C: Okay.
00:11:35.642 - 00:11:57.710, Speaker B: So all the information in the slide. So this is using the this enables the artists you don't have to build your own marketplace or build your own contract. And using the DaVinci building smart contract and tool to support.
00:11:59.920 - 00:12:00.670, Speaker C: Okay.
00:12:03.540 - 00:12:27.430, Speaker B: Yeah. So you have any question, so feel free to reach to us through we have a Developer Telegram and also Developer Discord channel. The link is provided. Okay, so I think that's all for the presentation. So let me check the questions.
00:12:29.560 - 00:12:35.770, Speaker A: It looks like Moradiv has one. Moradiv, you feel free to unmute yourself if you want to ask that question live.
00:12:36.220 - 00:13:15.236, Speaker D: All right, thanks. Yeah, I have a little question because on the discord actually, I didn't ask, but I was interested in the answer how to transfer NFTs from ETH to Harmony in both ways. And the answer we got was that it's not implemented yet, but it's going to be in the near future. But then after rereading and after listening to the intro of this talk, I'm having a doubt. Maybe he was only talking about the SDK. But the API, the bridge API is see?
00:13:15.258 - 00:13:15.732, Speaker B: I see.
00:13:15.786 - 00:13:16.004, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:16.042 - 00:13:30.140, Speaker B: The bridge itself is a functional well, and the SDK will be ready by end of this week. So right now we only have the API support, the SDK and take a little bit time to fully implement.
00:13:32.480 - 00:13:32.936, Speaker C: That'S.
00:13:32.968 - 00:14:14.630, Speaker B: Probably a little bit confusing. So actually you can see in the bridge, we also implemented a check of the OpenSea API to see if the NFT is verified on OpenSea already. It actually will show up. Mark here. Here is bridge. I can give a short demo here about how the bridge works.
00:14:18.360 - 00:14:19.390, Speaker C: You it.
00:14:29.120 - 00:14:38.144, Speaker B: So basically put the ERC 721 token address here. Okay.
00:14:38.342 - 00:14:48.570, Speaker C: Wrong networking.
00:14:48.750 - 00:14:55.320, Speaker B: Let me share a new here a new browser. Okay.
00:14:56.090 - 00:14:56.838, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:57.004 - 00:15:48.630, Speaker B: So I put it here already. So I put the address of the ESA 721 token here and the bridge will actually fetch the metadata from the smart contract under the dispute here the gas fee is so high so basically estimate how much you're going to pay for this one. So the first time yeah, this is actually 721 and token on Ethereum and you can confirm and then you can be bridged over. So all those function basically presented in the front end will be supported by the back end now and the SDK end of this week. Any other question?
00:15:50.060 - 00:16:19.276, Speaker E: Yeah, I have a question. Hi. Currently you guys have a lot of solutions and a couple of interesting people in your ecosystem. In the spirit of not reinventing the wheel if we use already presented solution to further our idea, is that still considered building on Harmony one? For example, if you're building the Dow.
00:16:19.308 - 00:17:37.640, Speaker B: And you use aragon yeah, so basically we encourage all the project launch on Harmony one so you don't have to use a cross chain API, right? So basically it's NFT hacks on you can build any NFT like launch NFT project, launch a generative art project and also even some game project would be possible. It'd be considered to build on top of NFT on mean I just present the cross chain NFT bridge which is into Harmony but not limited to the cross chain NFT here. So you can think about something that won't be possible on other chain, but you can definitely do it on Harmony. Like we recently there are some partners talking with us, they want to build a billion NFT which is not going to be scalable on other chain, also not going to be economic to mint those NFT because they're building virtual land project. Right. They want to be able to have this at least a billion NFT. So some of the projects can be durable and usable on Harmony but may not be on other places.
00:17:43.360 - 00:17:51.500, Speaker A: We have some questions in the chat as well. So Anyagu, Peter, is the SDK also not yet available for the testnet bridge?
00:17:52.720 - 00:18:08.032, Speaker B: Okay, so the SDK will be ready at the end of this week. So we are getting there. So right now only the APIs, the backend API is ready. So the SDK will be end of this.
00:18:08.166 - 00:18:08.850, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:09.480 - 00:18:17.300, Speaker A: And then Nestor asked are there any sets of data on NFT cross chain that Harmony would like hackers to address during this hackathon?
00:18:23.960 - 00:19:16.164, Speaker B: Okay, so as mentioned, actually I talk about a few ideas that would definitely be useful. For example, you can have NFT staked on Ethereum but in the meantime, since it's already staked on Ethereum, you can create a derivative on Harmony and the derivative you can have a huge amount of derivative and which you may not be economically usable on Ethereum. Right, so those are some of the idea and also for example, like a lending protocol or fractionization all those protocol would be able to do it in a mass way, which only usable on Harmony, not on Ethereum.
00:19:16.212 - 00:19:16.472, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:16.526 - 00:19:51.024, Speaker B: So those are the idea. So I don't have any specific idea I want to address, because then basically, we provide the infrastructure that's the hacker like. You guys can basically be creative and also think about something that can be done. Also actually to artists. Also, there's something interesting. How many I actually didn't talk about here is we do have a special extension of the EVM we provide called VRF. It's a random on chain.
00:19:51.024 - 00:20:14.220, Speaker B: It's a truly random number on chain that actually can be interesting to generate some of the generative Arts or any NFT prediction market or anything that can be useful so I can actually provide those information later. We do have a complete document about this on chain primitive. We provide extension to EVM.
00:20:19.360 - 00:20:21.150, Speaker A: Do you have a follow up question?
00:20:23.700 - 00:20:34.336, Speaker D: Yes. Still about the API. The bridge API. Is there a bridge between Harmony testnet to Ethereum Rinkabee, for example?
00:20:34.518 - 00:20:48.150, Speaker B: Right now we only have Covan. We don't have a Rikabi right now. Oh, you have covan. Okay, thank you.
00:20:51.420 - 00:21:04.270, Speaker A: Also, some of the viewers were asking if you can post the docs either in the chat or maybe even on Discord in the sponsor channel. That would be great.
00:21:04.720 - 00:21:05.132, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:05.186 - 00:21:05.404, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:05.442 - 00:21:18.000, Speaker B: So all those link maybe I can post on the YouTube channel or anywhere I can actually send all the link to Joanna and maybe you can post in the comment of the YouTube.
00:21:18.580 - 00:21:23.180, Speaker A: Sure. I'll post them on discord. All the viewers here will have it on Discord.
00:21:23.340 - 00:21:23.712, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:23.766 - 00:21:24.176, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:24.278 - 00:21:24.592, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:24.646 - 00:22:12.900, Speaker B: So I will actually post our VRF document link. That's something unique, Tommy, that could be interesting to explore. Yeah, I send the document for the wear and how to use it within the Smart contract. This is something also unique to Hamri and that could be interesting to explore.
00:22:20.180 - 00:22:22.230, Speaker A: Moritif, did you have another question?
00:22:26.040 - 00:22:30.020, Speaker D: No, sorry. I will stop raising my hand.
00:22:30.090 - 00:22:30.708, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:22:30.874 - 00:22:52.100, Speaker A: No worries. Does anyone else have any questions? All right, if that's all the questions that we have for today's workshop, we can end things here. Unless, Leo, you have any other things that you want to show for the next two minutes?
00:22:53.670 - 00:23:25.194, Speaker B: Okay, so as I mentioned, I need to show the page. So beyond the hacks on, I think the hacksung will be a great way to assemble the idea and the team. But we do have the $30 million grant and the Bounties on NFT. So definitely check out the page here. So some of the idea, something we would like to see, you can definitely say that will be supported by the team and would like to see on Harmony, but they're not limited to that.
00:23:25.232 - 00:23:25.386, Speaker C: Right?
00:23:25.408 - 00:23:40.340, Speaker B: You can extend that. But those are the idea we want to say. Let me post the link here to the chat. Okay, yeah, I guess that's all.
00:23:41.510 - 00:24:07.686, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. So much for taking the time to host this workshop, Leo. That was super interesting and I'm sure everyone who is watching learned A also. And the rest of the Harmony team is available on the Ethgobal Discord in the Harmony Discord Channel. So if you have any questions, please feel free to chat there or in the Harmony Discord server. And thank you so much for attending this workshop.
00:24:07.686 - 00:24:13.466, Speaker A: And once again, Leo, thank you for this. I hope everyone has a great rest of your day.
00:24:13.648 - 00:24:14.950, Speaker B: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Anna.
