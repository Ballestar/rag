00:00:00.410 - 00:00:26.520, Speaker A: It. Okay, cool. So we'll get going. I want to talk about this. It's actually a really important topic and it's probably going to be helpful, but for what it's worth, talking about surviving Crypto Winter, who's been in crypto for longer than five years. Longer than like four years, two years. Who's new to crypto? Like brand new.
00:00:26.520 - 00:00:50.154, Speaker A: My man. All right, nice. Okay, cool. Well, basically Crypto Winter is the idea that you have these bull markets, and then on the other side of it, everything goes dark, everything gets really cold. Everyone's businesses start closing and everything starts falling flat on its face. And bitcoin dies, ethereum dies, and everyone thinks the party's over. Just a quick summary for us.
00:00:50.154 - 00:01:16.230, Speaker A: We started in 2013. So this is Crypto Winter number two and a half for us. We work with really awesome companies. We've done a lot of transaction volume. We focus on bridging the gap between Fiat and crypto. So processing payments, we process payments for large exchanges, we process payments for institutions, and then we process payments for DAP developers. So the whole spectrum.
00:01:16.230 - 00:02:07.710, Speaker A: So the idea about talking about this is just surviving Crypto Winter, what it is, what it's going to look like for you guys as developers or enthusiasts in the space. And I'm just going to go through it piece by piece, and then I'm going to give you some examples of Crypto Winter and how that's affected other teams. And there might be a couple of surprising examples for you. All right, so how do people go into a Crypto Winter? People raise a shit ton of money really easily. And if you're not familiar with 2017, but I think everyone is, basically in 2017, there was over $2 billion in capital injected into crypto teams. So what happens is people start vaporizing money really quickly. So I don't know if anyone went to consensus this week, but that's actually Justin Sun from Tron.
00:02:07.710 - 00:02:42.494, Speaker A: So is anyone here a big fan of Tron? Like, raise your hand. Yep, big fan. Okay, awesome. Typically what's happening is you raise a lot of money and then you're going to spend a lot of money to buy traction. So I use Tron, but another great example is going to be Ripple. If you see Ripple has done XYZ or a pilot program with ABC Bank. Typically a lot of that comes to sort of like generate the flywheel of traction, so there's not as much substance underneath it as well.
00:02:42.494 - 00:03:17.386, Speaker A: A lot of teams that are doing really good work and they're actually building great product, they end up finding Crypto Winter very, very challenging because they've got really long sales cycles. So for entrepreneurs, we've experienced this firsthand as well. A huge company says, hey, we want to partner with you. We want to use your product, we want to use your service, whatever it is. And then they just string it along. And obviously we know as developers and people in the startup community shit moves really quick. Just like five minutes ago, someone was like, no, don't bother emailing me.
00:03:17.386 - 00:03:58.294, Speaker A: Just text me or do something. Telegram me because it's way faster. And so when you get engaged with all these really big companies, whether it's like a PayPal type or it's some big bank that's going to promise the world you're not really a priority to them. So teams end up falling down this illusion of MoUs and all these kind of other kind of acronyms that basically promise traction in the future. And it's really unfortunate because it's actually really heartbreaking because a lot of very talented people rely on this, but it's really insignificant to the big company. Then the last one is over engineering. The reality is you have got it wrong.
00:03:58.294 - 00:04:24.542, Speaker A: You are wrong and you're going to be wrong again. Don't bother over engineering it. Hack it together and figure it out. Really, really good example is who's heard of Instadap? No. Sick, awesome people I work with. Basically, Instadap is a hackathon project from last year's, ETH India. So we're at ETH New York.
00:04:24.542 - 00:05:00.022, Speaker A: This is in ETH India, and that's literally what it was. And now they're one of the most promising DApps in the space. If you look at Uniswap, which is an exchange where you swap different, ERC, 20 tokens, those guys, now it's three people, but that was one person for the longest time. And it was like a hackathon project, really. So that's because they're shipping very quickly and iterating very quickly. So that's like a super key point is don't over engineer shit. Has anyone here heard of Hashgraph? Yes? Cool.
00:05:00.022 - 00:05:32.310, Speaker A: So Hashgraph is not live yet, I don't think. Is it? Are they public? Are they live? No. Okay. Yeah, a lot of teams build brilliant products, like brilliant scientific products. But if you are over engineering it and you are too scientific about it, you're going to assume that you know every single parameter that's going to make your system work or every single want and need. And the reality is you can't predict that stuff, so there's not even a point in trying it. Think MVP and don't think overly scientific.
00:05:32.310 - 00:05:50.006, Speaker A: Okay? Welcome to Winter. What does winter look like? It's really fucked. By the way, pardon my language. Sorry for this. So basically there's a few things that come to mind. You're going to have unhappy investors, obviously. Everyone raised the people that raise money in ICOs.
00:05:50.006 - 00:06:27.640, Speaker A: They've got hundreds of thousands of investors. Some people have a handful of investors. All these people are under the illusion, or not under the illusion. They're under the promise or the dream or the vision that you're selling as a founder, as an entrepreneur. They want to see that come to fruition. So when deadlines are kicked back or pushed back, when pivots start happening, it introduces all this sort of confusion around how reliable is it going to be? So there's a really good word antisappointment. I'm extremely familiar with it because just always disappointing people.
00:06:27.640 - 00:07:03.570, Speaker A: Not really just my parents internal challenges. So when shit's going badly, everyone starts thinking all loopy. Not loopy, but just like indecision, confusion, uncertainty, everything becomes more difficult. So team members fight. Founders go part separate ways. Yeah, it just makes everything really difficult. And the worst part about it as well, you're now behind square one, so you're going to wish you had the chance to start fresh and you don't have the chance to start fresh, basically.
00:07:03.570 - 00:07:50.770, Speaker A: So those are money emojis flying into a trash can. I just realized I left those there. So just don't vaporize money, basically. So what's actually going to happen? So I just sort of touched on it. If you raise money from investors, so let's say you raise money from consensus, or you raise money from Andreess and Horowitz, or you're raising money on the public markets, you pretty much get one bullet. And if you execute extremely well, it's going to be very simple to get more bullets from them for the next venture that you want to do. But if you're wrong and you've articulated this really perfect dream because you're so sure of yourself and you're so sure of everything, then you are going to have a really hard time finding that money again.
00:07:50.770 - 00:08:25.002, Speaker A: So where do people go? People go and shake hands with the devil, so to speak, because there's no money left in town, what they do is they now have to go and speak with competitor chains, so to speak. So let's call EOS, a big evil nemesis of ethereum. But EOS has a lot of money and they want what you're building on ethereum to be moved over to EOS or to be compatible with EOS. So everyone's heard of EOS. Cool. Nice. Okay, Tron.
00:08:25.002 - 00:08:42.786, Speaker A: Imagine Tron. Justin sun wants you to move to Tron. They're like, fuck, I'm out of money. It's like, Andreessen, don't make me do it. I really like ethereum. It's like come to sort of a hypnotizing kind of way. And so it's against a lot of people or a lot of founders sort of original motivations and stuff like that.
00:08:42.786 - 00:09:05.398, Speaker A: That's why it sort of looks like they're shaking hands with the devil. Talent. Talent starts leaving. Remember when everyone's sort of topsy turvy and all shit's hitting the fan? We don't know what's going on. Uncertainty is going to find all those question marks resulting in talent leaving. I've got a picture of Balaji. He's the CTO at Coinbase.
00:09:05.398 - 00:09:38.438, Speaker A: Obviously, Coinbase is a fantastic company and they've executed so absolutely incredibly. But recently he left and he was the CTO before that. Dan Romero left and then their head of risk and payments left. And you've seen this sort of trickle out. Now, what's going on under the hood, not sure. But as competition heats up, as market uncertainty becomes more apparent and all these kind of question marks, people don't think rationally. So I mean, I'm not saying that it's an irrational move for them to leave.
00:09:38.438 - 00:10:13.966, Speaker A: I'm saying any kind of issue is amplified significantly when you're under the pump. Basically the pressure is on. And then the last one, like I just said, you're behind the eight ball, you're going to wish you could start fresh. And now you've got to kind of reclaim yourself, reinvent yourself, and then get back to square zero. And now it's an even playing field with the new entrepreneur that's coming into the space that's really excited and enthusiastic. Sorry, does that make sense? Cool. Just interrupt me.
00:10:13.966 - 00:11:02.842, Speaker A: Like literally interrupt me if there's anything that makes sense or you want to talk about something else. What's good about a crypto winter? If you avoid all the previous stuff and you manage expectations successfully or you manage your financing successfully, it actually opens up a huge amount of opportunities so that the teams that do well are actually going to be doing exponentially well. It's the time where you can basically take something that's worth one and make it worth five for your company long term. So you basically can get a lead. Winters aren't forever. The reality is crypto winter after 2013 bitcoin went to one $245 November 20 eigth in 2013. Then it basically drained down.
00:11:02.842 - 00:11:51.550, Speaker A: Tons of VC money went into the space and tons of VC money basically ended up getting vaporized. So that winter because it's a brand new technology that winter offers nothing for anyone really. Exchanges can't operate because the base layer of people trading crypto or anything like that doesn't exist yet. So they haven't even built a core base. And now that means basically it's like a crypto winter global warming equivalent. The more crypto winters you go through, the more of a base is built. So we have these crazy years like 2017, which are basically going to go $700 to a $20,000 coin and then it comes down to say, $3,000.
00:11:51.550 - 00:12:41.854, Speaker A: It's 20 steps forward, 15 steps back, so it's gradually building the base. So anyone that starts a company now they have a way bigger audience to work with than someone starting in 2014 or 2015, the total addressable market is growing and that's a natural function of technology adoption. When shit's hitting the fan, like when things are good and they're crazy, people have support tickets out the wazoo, everything is on fire. Not in a bad way, but just in a people don't even know what's going on. There's just so many things happening. So if you're in the middle of 2017, you would pray for just like a week's worth of silence on support tickets so that you could actually focus on building product and shipping product instead of focusing on cleaning up house. Sorry, yeah, okay.
00:12:41.854 - 00:13:16.010, Speaker A: That was meant to be a broom emoji, but it's not. And then got talent, basically. People are talented. I think almost every single person here, this room specifically. No, but every single person in the ecosystem or interested in the topic is talented at something. Now, even if they raise let's say they raise $100 million and the company goes to shit, or the project goes to shit and they lose all their money, it doesn't mean that they're not talented. It means that they're not talented at what their role was.
00:13:16.010 - 00:14:11.926, Speaker A: So there's brilliant engineers that find themselves who are sitting on huge amounts of money, being expected to deploy this capital successfully and not being able to do so. That doesn't mean that they're an amazing fit for another team or a CTO position in somewhere else. That's actually what happened with Bellaji, the famous guy from Coinbase who's the big CTO. He raised $116,000,000 in the company that he was at. It was called 21 Inc. And it was basically a small device that was planned to be like a mining chip for smartphones, toasters and all this shit. I don't think Toasters were actually on it, but the idea was that he was a fantastic he's a very talented person, but he wasn't the best person to bring this huge amount of capital out into a hundred X return on investment for the fund, which was Andreessen Horowitz.
00:14:11.926 - 00:14:46.470, Speaker A: And so he went as CTO and he did an exceptional job as a CTO at Coinbase. And so that's sort know the opportunities that arise. If you position yourself safely as a company, you can take advantage of crypto winters does that make sense? I feel like you had a question. Did you have a question? Trust me, you have not met me yet. So, yeah, if you've got some if you got a stupid question, feel free to fire it away or you can ask after. But it's.
00:14:53.230 - 00:15:32.370, Speaker B: So, like, what I don't understand is I don't hear about crypto like on television. It's almost like mass media has taken it away from the public proper. And I think it was Warren Buffett or somebody who just said it's a total gimmick that's going to cave in on itself. And yet here I am. I think I just got $50 from Maddox for going to their workshop.
00:15:34.870 - 00:15:53.350, Speaker A: Fucking Maddox. We're going to go over to have to talk to them in a minute. Yeah, I think your wallet's that emoji at the moment. No, I'm kidding. They're very nice people in Manico's.
00:15:55.390 - 00:16:08.060, Speaker B: I get so confused in that way. I'm so new at the crypto stuff and what's really going on? Does that make sense?
00:16:09.090 - 00:16:25.134, Speaker A: Me personally? Well, I'm pretty tired. I went out last night. No, I'm just joking. But what's really going on? Where's the actual substance to all this shit? Like, instead of people just throwing money at you and doing this and stuff like that, where's like the are they taking it seriously?
00:16:25.182 - 00:16:26.660, Speaker B: Are they scared of it?
00:16:29.750 - 00:16:47.946, Speaker A: Yeah, this is as serious as it gets, basically. Like, this is the biggest thing that they've ever seen in their life. And that's why there is so much excitement and enthusiasm from are they scared of it? They are horrified of it, yes.
00:16:48.128 - 00:16:51.370, Speaker B: It no longer becomes power controlled.
00:16:53.790 - 00:16:54.678, Speaker A: Capital.
00:16:54.854 - 00:17:05.606, Speaker B: And then it is a true, in a way, like kind of social okay, thank you. See that was kind of a dumb question.
00:17:05.728 - 00:17:36.810, Speaker A: Not at all. No, not at all. And that's the thing about this space is we are all idiots. It's so early. I'm not saying you're an idiot, okay, it's just a matter of how enthusiastic you are so newer people are going to know less. All right? Survival skills. So basically how do you prevent this shit from happening? Or how do you not be part of it? Or how do you not feel the pinch in crypto winter? Essentially humility.
00:17:36.810 - 00:18:29.894, Speaker A: Look, we already said everyone here is very smart, everyone here is intelligent in their own right. The reality is humility is the single most important skill that you can have in a space that doesn't have any answers, it doesn't have any certainty and it doesn't have a track record. So if every single person here is absolutely brilliant, but they're not humble enough to admit that they could be wrong, that means that you are going to have a very difficult time staying agile and being adaptive to what the space is doing because of the amount of unknowns. You need to be quick to say that you're wrong. So yeah, basically you are wrong, you're going to be wrong many, many more times. So just get comfortable with it. Yeah, ability, you got to have some sort of ability.
00:18:29.894 - 00:19:33.210, Speaker A: If you're working on something that's relevant to your skill set then that's obviously going to be advantageous. But ability doesn't just mean technical ability, ability can mean networking ability, relationships, experience, all this kind of stuff. It's not just a technically driven world. In fact it's probably the furthest industry from being technical only because this industry is different from startups and that whole world, the whole world of traditional startups and early stage stuff, it's all about moving quickly. Well, the difference between startups and something like crypto is crypto is network based. So networks inherently rely on relationships and the strength of those relationships is what keeps the network intact. So when it comes to technical abilities, obviously technical competency is very advantageous but everything in crypto because it's a value transfer network, it's all open source, so things are open source.
00:19:33.210 - 00:20:36.418, Speaker A: That means there is no black box special secret sauce that you're selling, you are competing for someone else against their path to distribution. So if your network, the growth of your network and the strength of the connections in your network, that's your distribution and the stronger they are and the wider they reach, the harder they become to displace. So almost that's your kind of defensibility or your secret sauce in this space. So yeah, it is very good to acknowledge multifacets of skill sets and that goes into teamwork obviously, teamwork is many hands make light work. So a lot of people, like I said, antisappointment before, there's another one of those sort of meshed, amphibious kind of hybrid words, and it's called cooperation. So it's like where you're cooperating, but you're also competitors. The best teams, then the most successful teams will always work together.
00:20:36.418 - 00:21:23.374, Speaker A: So if you look at I just put, like, that's balance, and that's an incredibly pixelated picture, basically, that says make it out. Compound Finance and Dharma and Balance is building a bank interface where it's leveraging all the other things that people have built and servicing that as a product. Have you guys heard of Revolut? Do you guys know what Revolut is? Cool. Okay, so Revolut is a digital bank. It's a digital bank aimed at being faster, smoother, slicker, cooler, friendlier, whatever, than Wells Fargo, Chase, blah, blah, blah. Revolut doesn't know shit about insurance, nor do they know anything about pension plans. They find the expert that knows about pension plans, so there's a service provider.
00:21:23.374 - 00:21:53.174, Speaker A: They find the expert that knows about cross border payments, and that might be transfer wise. And they stitch it all together because the person that you're trying to displace is so difficult to move. These are century old. Like, I mean, yeah, these are incredibly big financial institutions. You can't compete with them unless you all work together. And that's what's really important for surviving, is working together. It's not an ego trip.
00:21:53.174 - 00:22:20.018, Speaker A: So kind of tying that back with humility. It's not about your ego. It's about your position on where you stand with the technology. So are you for the technology or are you against it? And people that are for it should all be working together as much as possible, as frequently as possible, because everyone wins that way. History of wrong. So I said be wrong. It's really good to be wrong.
00:22:20.018 - 00:22:34.242, Speaker A: And that's not like a circle jerky kind of tone in that. That's like, legitimately. Just be really good at being wrong really quickly. Brian Armstrong, 2015. He said that. So Brian Armstrong. They only listed bitcoin.
00:22:34.242 - 00:23:26.234, Speaker A: They didn't have Litecoin, they didn't have Ethereum, they didn't have all the other altcoins way back in the day. That's because Brian and Fred were very adamant at the time that bitcoin would be the winner. And the network effects that bitcoin has gained over other competitive cryptocurrencies or networks is too far ahead and it's a waste of time anyway. So turns out they were wrong, and they were really good at adapting in that regard, but they had some quarrels internally, I think, where some people wanted to leave because they thought, oh, I thought this was bitcoin only, and all these kind of things, but they were wrong. They acknowledged that, and they moved forward as quick as they could. And now Coinbase probably arguably the biggest company in the world in the space. Who's heard of itbit before? Okay, nice.
00:23:26.234 - 00:24:14.254, Speaker A: Itbit is now called paxos. So if you've seen PAX, the stablecoin that's Ipit and Itbit were trying to sell their exchange business this is public knowledge, by the way. They're trying to sell their exchange business for about 18 months, almost two years, I think. And I could be wrong, but I think it's like over a year, they're literally trying to sell this exchange because they're like, oh, my God, these things, crypto Winter is busting their ball so bad that they're actually trying to get rid of it. Turns out 2017 happened, and that's the smartest thing ever, is having their exchange. And now they're incredibly, the success of the company is largely derived from the traction that they have with their exchange being in the right place at the right time, essentially. Who's heard of an app called Bourbon? Nobody.
00:24:14.254 - 00:24:45.422, Speaker A: Who's heard of an app called Instagram? Yep. Instagram was an app called Bourbon for photographing and logging beers. And basically you take a photo of your beer or your bourbon or whatever it is. And that was the original idea behind Instagram. And Instagram Pivoted to be, okay, those photos, the photos that we're taking of the Bourbon, the filters we put on them yeah, maybe just make it for everyone. Let's put them for actual people just interacting. And so, Kevin sidstrom.
00:24:45.422 - 00:25:12.006, Speaker A: I think it's Kevin Sidstrom. Basically, they Pivoted to focus purely on photography based social or, like, rich media social networking. Zuckerberg bought them for a billion. Two years later, who they were willing to pay 2 billion. And now it is worth over 120,000,000,000, which is mental. Chain. Has anyone heard of Chain? Cool.
00:25:12.006 - 00:25:44.260, Speaker A: So Chain, they merged with Stellar last year, or they sold to Stellar. They were wrong, too, and they were really embraced the wrong. And they ended up selling to Stellar last year, which was, I think it was reported like $400 million worth of Stellar, or like, it ended up being $70 million worth of US. Dollars. I'm not sure what that is, but I'm just going by headlines. Yeah. So obviously why I haven't mentioned us here, that's because we needed a whole page.
00:25:44.260 - 00:26:10.730, Speaker A: We're really good, and in six years, you get pretty used to these kind of, like, just taking the punches. We've done bitcoin payment processing. So people right now, they think the number one thing is merchant adoption. You can't spend crypto anywhere. You can't spend sorry, you can't spend ethereum anywhere. It's got no utility value. So we were doing that in 2013.
00:26:10.730 - 00:26:47.900, Speaker A: We worked with Microsoft in 2015, where people would earn Bitcoin for searching with Microsoft. Anyone here use Bing? Yeah, neither. Well, I actually forced you because there's a bug on my phone with Google. But the reality was Bing offers you incentive to search with oh, you know what's, that cool hotel in that area. If you use Bing, it ticks up a point and then you accumulate points. You can go redeem it. So we worked with Microsoft to allow Bitcoin as a redemption option, next to PayPal credits, next to Amazon gift cards, things like that.
00:26:47.900 - 00:27:32.520, Speaker A: We have done wallet management, APIs, so wallets as an infrastructure. So for the people that are trying to build their own Coinbases or their own exchanges, we've done cross border payments, and we've done literally talking about merchant adoption and, like, utility. We were so enthusiastic about it, we literally spoke to these team in China that built a custom iPad. Not a custom iPad, but a custom Android tablet that had our software baked in. And we literally went around to San Francisco. We ordered 500 of them. And we wanted to basically make San Francisco the capital of spending and receiving crypto for merchants, because we thought that would really aggressively up the ante for people to get comfortable with it.
00:27:32.520 - 00:27:54.000, Speaker A: Literally couldn't even give them away. And I'm not even joking. Like, I walk in and be like, oh, is the manager there? I'd be like, look, one of your guys came through the other day. We're fine, thanks. I'll be like, Drop this iPad with, like, stickers and swag and shit and then just run out. They're like, man, we don't want your trash. That's how much it was like that you could not give them away.
00:27:54.000 - 00:28:22.360, Speaker A: Anyway, that's us being a whole page of wrong. And I could go on, like, many, many more examples, but yeah, that is all I have on crypto. Winter. Does anyone have any questions? Does anyone have any stupid questions? I got a stupid question. No, I'll save it, my man.
00:28:23.630 - 00:28:30.060, Speaker B: How many times do you use cryptocurrency every day for your daily needs?
00:28:34.490 - 00:28:56.800, Speaker A: Define needs. Whether it's spending for food consumption or needs, as in accumulating wealth, spending it as a currency. Never. Almost never. Is that the only thing that it's good for, though?
00:28:59.570 - 00:29:01.390, Speaker B: I thought that was your goal.
00:29:03.430 - 00:29:50.720, Speaker A: Oh, once upon a time, it was. Once upon a time it was. But because we were always wrong, we had to change the goal, basically, personal level, to basically give all the mistakes that we've made, wrap it up into a product and make sure it doesn't happen again. Because if we've spent all this time making these mistakes, if we can help teams dodge those bullets in a really easy way and amplify their business, then that's what we want to do. How'd you hear about Tron, by the way? Oh, I'm a fan too.
00:29:52.450 - 00:29:59.940, Speaker B: Okay, my last question, and this is the really stupid one. What is cryptocurrency good for?
00:30:01.910 - 00:30:37.150, Speaker A: It is good for it's a good way to incentivize machines to communicate with one another, if that makes sense. Okay, let's think that laptop or let's imagine two robots, two humans walking down the street. If I wanted to say, hey, can you go chuck this in the bin for me? Here's a one dollars bill, keep it. I'm in a rush. And you're like, sure, $1 is good for me, right? You want a dollar. So you go do it. Imagine those are two robots and they can't do anything with a dollar.
00:30:37.150 - 00:30:54.990, Speaker A: They're a robot. They don't need to go buy groceries and eat for themselves. They need maybe energy, or maybe they need something else, like new parts. But they've got their own needs. As machines, they operate differently. So maybe there's probably a million other better explanations in here.
