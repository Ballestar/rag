00:00:01.290 - 00:00:18.030, Speaker A: All right. Hi everyone. It's a pleasure to stay on the main stage. Thank you very much. Ethereum foundation. Ethereum global. So what I built on this weekend, this is CDP manager.
00:00:18.030 - 00:01:56.180, Speaker A: CDP manager can be used to migrate CDP position collateral tab position of a user and can improve their usability in DeFi. You can see on the screen there one hub IO. It's actually deployed also on the main net here I have a compound position. I lent 195 die and I borrowed a little bit WBTC and I would like to move this position to Ave because it's more profitable for me to lend and borrow there. Because of the great interest rate on Ave you can do it just with a few clicks which I will not execute the transaction because it's on the main net and can take little time. After the migration to an NFT token you can actually easily migrate between different provider like compound, like MakerDAO, like Ava as well. So I will show you small architecture diagram, how it works and why I need here an NFT token ERC 721 so it solves a big problem.
00:01:56.180 - 00:03:18.650, Speaker A: Like if you have only on wallets, you are really limited on compound. You can have only a few positions there and with an ERC 721 NFT token you can have as many position you want. Yeah, I tried to build a small mini or microservice because I love and also my team from one inch loves the composability of DeFi. Just plug every available service into your own service and expose clear usable APIs to everyone so that everyone can get profits from your service and you get profits also from other service. So in this diagram you can see as a user with a normal Ethereum wallet, you can create an NFT token which would hold the position in a proxy smart contract under the hood. And I like flashlands. Yes, maybe you heard we hacked Fulcrum with flashlands white hacked in January before it started to be popular.
00:03:18.650 - 00:04:22.554, Speaker A: But this is another story. I like used to flashlights from Aave. Of course there's little fee but they do a great job with that, it's really usable. So what I did, I migrated the position from the wallet into the NFT token proxy smart contract by asking for a Flashline on Ave. I repaid the user debt to be able to migrate position and I grabbed the user collateral tokens from the user and I created new borrowing position on compound and paid back the flashland to Ave. So first of all you need the migration part and to just migrate your position from your wallet to be flexible to migrate to other services from an NFT token. And the migration works similar to the import logic.
00:04:22.554 - 00:05:32.230, Speaker A: It's the same you have already the position in your NFT token and again flash launch and actually the same. I can show you how such flash lawn looks like. This is a tool from my colleague Anton bookov. You can see the whole stack trace from Parity trace more in detail and usable also to debug. And you can see it looks like I had here more than 137. Hops in different smart contracts to just import a position. So I also used here Taurus also a great solution to login with Google or also some Zamara OAuth provider and what I heard they plan also to release a solution for free guest transactions like that.
00:05:32.230 - 00:05:40.820, Speaker A: We are going also to integrate them. I guess so. Like some cool things. Yeah. Thank you very much. That's all.
