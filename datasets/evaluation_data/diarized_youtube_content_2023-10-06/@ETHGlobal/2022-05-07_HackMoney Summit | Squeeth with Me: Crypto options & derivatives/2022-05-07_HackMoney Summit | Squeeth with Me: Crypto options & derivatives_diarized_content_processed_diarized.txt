00:00:03.930 - 00:00:18.800, Speaker A: So I want to bring on Alexis here to talk about squeath. For those of you who don't know what squeet is, I won't spoil this for you. I'll have Alexis give that intro. So without further ado, let's welcome Alexis on stage. Good to see. Alexis, how's it going?
00:00:19.410 - 00:00:25.094, Speaker B: Good to see you. Going well. Excited to squeeze well.
00:00:25.172 - 00:00:27.474, Speaker A: Perfect. Stage is yours.
00:00:27.602 - 00:00:45.770, Speaker B: Amazing. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. So really excited to be here. Excited to chat with everybody about squeath. You're probably wondering what a squeath is, and by the end of this talk, you'll know you'll be able to tell all your friends that you're squeathing.
00:00:45.770 - 00:01:35.340, Speaker B: So today we're going to kind of start off by talking about options, what they are, how they work. Then we'll dive into some of the problems with options and how squeath came to be in the first place, and then we'll talk about what squeath is and how it works. So let's dive into it. So first of all, why do people use options? Well, people typically use options for one of these three things. They're either looking to get leverage, earn, yield, or to hedge themselves. And when we built out the first options in DeFi at Open, this is what we noticed people were using options for. It wasn't just like options for the sake of options, but for one of these three specific things.
00:01:35.340 - 00:02:29.500, Speaker B: And we'll come back to this. So now what is an option? There are two main types of options. There are put options and call options. And today I'm going to focus on call options. So we'll chat about what call options are. First, talking about this kind of fancy formal definition, but then we'll really break it down, go through an example, and try to just wrap our heads around what this actually means. So the definition of a call option is something that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy an asset, which we call the underlying asset at a given price, which we call the strike price on a certain date, which is the expiry date.
00:02:29.500 - 00:03:14.666, Speaker B: That's a mouthful of a definition. Let's break it down. So let's take an example. Let's say that ETH price is currently $3,000, but I'm feeling really bullish. I think that by the end of the month, ETH is going to be $5,000, and I'm really excited about that. Then what I can do is I can buy this call option. And what this call option basically tells me is that, hey, at the end of the month, I can buy ETH for a price which we call the strike price, no matter what the price of ETH actually is in the market.
00:03:14.666 - 00:04:03.740, Speaker B: So I think that ETH is going to be $5,000 at the end of the month. So maybe I buy a call option with a strike price of $4,000. Now, what that means is, say we get to the very end of the month, and ETH is trading at $5,000. Instead of having to pay $5,000 to buy ETH, I can just use my call option and buy ETH for $4,000. So even though ETH is trading at $5,000 on the market, this call option lets me buy it cheaper than the market at $4,000. So that is kind of what is really powerful about call options. And the cool thing is, if I were to buy ETH right now, I'd have to pay $3,000.
00:04:03.740 - 00:04:47.334, Speaker B: But if I were to buy this call option, I pay some sort of premium, say that premium is like $100. Then I'm paying $100 right now for the right to buy ETH at $4,000 at the end of the month. And so I can actually just pay $100 right now to be able to buy ETH cheaper than the market at the end of the month. If I'm feeling really bullish, basically, kind of just what we talked about, I'm bullish ETH. I think ETH is going to go up beyond $4,000. So if ETH price goes up beyond that, I can still buy that ETH at 4000. So, kind of mapping that back on to the definition that we talked about.
00:04:47.334 - 00:05:19.650, Speaker B: Our underlying asset is ETH. That's the asset that we're thinking about here, the one that we are saying, hey, I think this particular asset is going to be above $4,000. $4,000 is the strike price. That's the amount that I'm trying to buy this underlying asset for. Even if the market price is greater. February 20 Eigth is my expiry date. So I can do this on February 20 Eigth at the end of the month of February.
00:05:19.650 - 00:06:08.482, Speaker B: And I actually have a choice. This is actually really interesting. So you might be thinking, okay, ETH goes up to $5,000 at the end of the month. Why wouldn't I want to buy ETH for $4,000 for cheaper than it's on the market at 5000? But what if we go the other way and have some sort of like bear situation where ETH is at $2,000? Then do I still have to buy ETH for $4,000? Am I locked into this price? And the answer is no. If ETH goes down, you don't have to use your call option. You have the choice to use your call option. So if ETH went down, I probably wouldn't use this call option.
00:06:08.482 - 00:06:49.582, Speaker B: I wouldn't buy ETH at $4,000. But if ETH went up to 5000, then I'd want to use it. So you have this nice choice, which is that right not obligation that we talked about. So what does this look like? Well, the cool thing here is you actually have limited downside and unlimited upside. So I'm paying $100 to buy this call option. If ETH goes down and I don't want to use the call option, then all I've lost is this $100. And if ETH goes up, I just keep making more and more and more as the ETH price goes up.
00:06:49.582 - 00:07:28.474, Speaker B: Say ETH price goes up to 8000 I can still buy it at 4000. So that gives us this really nice property of limited downside and unlimited upside. And we have a fancy word for this property. So if you've ever heard the word convexity, all people are trying to say is limited downside and unlimited upside. So that's what people are talking about when they say convexity, and it's this really nice property that you get here. Okay, cool. So now you might be thinking, well that's great.
00:07:28.474 - 00:08:23.518, Speaker B: Unlimited upside, limited downside. Like I want that. So who is trying to sell this to you? Who is taking the other side of this bet? Well, these are people that are actually earning premiums for selling you that really nice choice, that really nice payoff. So when you buy that option for $100, that $100 is going to this person on the other side of the trade that's willing to take on more risk. So for them, the maximum amount that they can earn is that $100. So if ETH price goes down and you don't use your option, they just get to keep that $100, they're happy. But if ETH price goes up and you exercise your option, they're forced to basically take that other side to sell it to you at $4,000 even though it's trading higher on the market.
00:08:23.518 - 00:09:29.310, Speaker B: And they earn a premium for taking on this risk. While you, the option buyer, has a choice about whether you want to use your option, this option seller has no choice. They are forced to take the other side of your trade and they get paid for that. So for people that think, hey, there's no way it's going to hit $5,000 at the end of the month, I'm willing to take on this risk, then they can earn this kind of steady premium for selling you this call option. Okay, now what are the problems with DeFi options? What have we seen so far? And there's a couple problems that have popped up that we've seen as we've been building DeFi options. One is that there are tons of different expiries that you can have for these options. So we were talking about a call option that expires at the end of the month, but you could have an option that expires at the end of the week, at the end of two months, at the end of three weeks, you could have literally any expiry.
00:09:29.310 - 00:10:06.238, Speaker B: And so that means that you need to constantly be thinking about that. You can only use your option on that expiry date and then maybe that expiry date comes around and you're like, hey, I still want this choice. Then you have to manually kind of roll over your option to the next expiry and then you have to make that choice up front. Like, do I think Eat is going to hit 5000 at the end of this month? No, maybe the end of next month. No, actually next week. And so there's kind of a lot of choices that you have to make. And if choosing expiries wasn't enough, you also have to choose your strike price.
00:10:06.238 - 00:11:06.850, Speaker B: So maybe you think ETH is going to go up to 5000, or maybe 3000, or maybe 3500, and then you have all of these different strike prices. And when you take all of these strike price and expiry combinations, those are all individual markets. So the $4,000 call expiring at the end of this week is different from the 4000 call expiring at the end of the month is different from the 3000 call expiring at the end of next month. And so you end up with liquidity fragmentation because you have all of these different separate markets that you have to build liquidity around. And that makes things really difficult. And so we were like, okay, there's all of these problems with DeFi options right now. How do we solve them? So we went to the forest, the literal forest, and we were, how? How do we solve these problems? And it was there in the forest that we found squeath.
00:11:06.850 - 00:11:50.574, Speaker B: And squeath solves these problems. Squeath is like a call option in terms of its payoff. You still have that really nice unlimited upside and limited downside, but you have no expiries, no strike prices, and that means you can have one liquidity pool. So we're building liquidity around one instrument. We're taking out all of those choices and those things that you have to think about. And you're still able to get the heart of what you're getting with a call option, but in a much more liquid and simple way. So what is squeath? Well, long squeath is very similar to a call option.
00:11:50.574 - 00:12:40.990, Speaker B: This blue line here is squeath. And you can see that you have this unlimited upside and limited downside. It's like a call option, but it's more curvy. So the call option is kind of like that, and squeeze is like even curvier, so it kind of gives you this complexity, but in a better and more perpetual form. And so that's kind of one way to think about squeep, like a call option, but with no strike price and no expiry. But there are also a couple of other mental models that can be useful to help us understand squeath. So just starting with the name, what does the squeath name mean? Well, it's squared ETH squeath.
00:12:40.990 - 00:13:25.530, Speaker B: And so this blue line here is literally the right side of a parabola. Like if you were to take x squared and plot it on a graph, that's what this blue line is. So we literally are taking ETH price and squaring it. And that's kind of this blue line that you get here, you can also compare it to something like two x leverage, and you can see that kind of compared to two x leverage. When ETH goes up, you do better with squeep than with two x leverage. When ETH doesn't move that much, you're kind of getting about the same payoff. And when ETH goes down, you get liquidated with two X leverage, but you don't with squeak.
00:13:25.530 - 00:14:17.070, Speaker B: And so another kind of way to think about it is as perpetual leverage without liquidations. So those are kind of a couple of mental models to think about squeeze. To start, to wrap your head around it, we see that it's got similar properties to the call option in terms of that limited downside, unlimited upside, got that nice curviness, which you don't get with the kind of two X leverage or perpetual swaps. You have no liquidations similar to a call option. But your payment, you're kind of paying a continuous payment, which is a little bit more similar to perpetual swaps versus like a one time premium that you pay with a call option. So some mental models about how to think about squeeze. So now you're probably thinking, okay, that's great.
00:14:17.070 - 00:15:21.342, Speaker B: Now I get this perpetual call option thing. I have even more unlimited upside and limited downside. Who's taking the other side? And pretty similar to going short a call option, the person on the other side is willing to take on some risk and a return for earning fees. So in this case, they are earning those continuous funding payments for being short, squeak and kind of taking the other side of that position. And the way this works from a mechanism standpoint is actually very similar to something like MakerDAO. If I wanted to go short squeeze, I could put down some ETH collateral into a vault, and then I could mint some squeath the same way I would put ETH collateral into a vault and mint some die. And then to go short squeath, I would sell that squeath that I just minted on uniswap.
00:15:21.342 - 00:15:55.466, Speaker B: So squeath trades on uniswap v three. If I wanted to go long squeeze, I would just buy the long squeeze, ERC 20 token from uniswap. And if I'm going short squeeze, I'm selling that same ERC 20 on uniswap. And so that's kind of how things are working behind the scenes. Now, why is this relevant? We'll get into that in just a second. So we have this Crab strategy because when you're going short squeath, like I mentioned, it's similar to MakerDAO. You're putting down collateral into a vault.
00:15:55.466 - 00:16:35.258, Speaker B: You're minting squeath. And so that means you need to be thinking about things like your collateralization ratio and your liquidation price. It's a bit more of a managed position. So to make that easier, we built this thing called the Crab strategy. And the Crab strategy is an automated strategy that uses short squeeze to let you earn funding without you having to worry about the nuances and details of your collateralization ratio, liquidation price, et cetera. So the strategy is managing that for you. And what this strategy is doing is its goal is to make US.
00:16:35.258 - 00:17:11.234, Speaker B: Dollar returns. You're trying to earn funding without necessarily taking a view on ETH. So remember how I mentioned that when you go short sweep, you have to put down ETH collateral into a vault? Well, that means that you have some ETH exposure. So what this strategy does is it hedges out that ETH exposure. So you're just trying to earn funding. And so you can deposit a strategy, earn the funding fees, and not really have to think about your liquidation price or collateralization ratio. Of course, this comes with its own risks.
00:17:11.234 - 00:17:41.950, Speaker B: Like you're going short Squeath, you're paying those rebalancing fees. But it's a much simpler way to kind of take the other side of the Squeath trade. So those are kind of some of the fun ways to Squeep. But we've got a couple more ways to Squeep. So, like I mentioned, Squeap trades on uniswap. So that means that you could be a uniswap LP for Squeath. And the main pool is the Squeath ETH pool.
00:17:41.950 - 00:18:22.142, Speaker B: And there are a couple different ways that you can LP on uniswap. So when you're Lping on uniswap, you need to provide two assets. You need to provide ETH and you need to provide Squeath. So there are two different ways that you can get that Squeath to LP with, and each way gives you a slightly different payoff. So you could buy squeeze, or you can mint squeeze like we talked about by putting down ETH collateral and then minting some squeeze. So let's start by talking about buying Squeath. You go to uniswap, you buy some Squeath, you bring some ETH, and you decide you want to LP it.
00:18:22.142 - 00:19:14.090, Speaker B: Well, what does that return actually look like? Well, it turns out that's this blue line right here and the payoff of buying Squeath and Lping, it is actually ETH to the power of 1.5. So the same way that Squeath is ETH squared buying and Lping is actually ETH to the 1.5 power, which is pretty cool. It's like, slightly less squeath. So you're earning this kind of nice leverage payoff. You're still paying funding because you're long Squeath, you bought Squeath, but you're also earning fees because you Lp'd on uniswap. So it's basically like you're offsetting some of that funding payment with the LP fees that you're earning on uniswap.
00:19:14.090 - 00:20:23.358, Speaker B: And in return, you're still getting leverage, but you're slightly less levered than normal long sweep because you're kind of paying less in the aggregate. So it's a nice way to still get some leverage, but not pay as much and kind of not have that full E squared profile, but a nice eat to the 1.5. So that's kind of what buying and Lping is. And then if you mint an LP, you actually get a very different kind of payoff where you are earning the LP fees, but you could be earning the LP fees and earning funding because in this case, you had put down your ETH collateral into the vault. You minted some Squeath, and then you put that minted Squeath and ETH into the uniswap pool. So now when you start, you actually start with a payoff that's kind of similar to long ETH. But as the pool moves and people buy and sell Squeath, you could end up with a short Squeath position, because the amount of Squeath debt that you minted could be different than the amount of Squeath in the uniswap pool.
00:20:23.358 - 00:20:59.950, Speaker B: So say I put down some ETH collateral and I minted ten squeeze, and then I put that ten squeeze and some ETH in a uniswap pool. Now, my debt is ten Squeath. Say people trade against the uniswap pool, and the amount that I have in the uniswap pool at the get go was ten squeeze. It was neutral. But now people have traded against the pool, and my amount in the uniswap pool is less. It's like five squeeze. So now I'm short five squeeze, which means I'm earning funding and LP fees.
00:20:59.950 - 00:21:38.070, Speaker B: So it's a pretty cool way to be able to earn both of those fees. Now, of course, because you do have a vault, you do have to be thinking about your collateralization ratio and liquidations. But that's like, another fun way to squeeze is minting and Lping on Uniswap. So we talked about a lot of different ways that you can squeeze. You can go long Squeath and get a nice two X leverage without liquidations kind of payoff. You have that unlimited upside and limited downside. You can go short squeeze and earn funding to take on that risk.
00:21:38.070 - 00:22:39.102, Speaker B: You can participate in some of the short strategies, like the Crab strategy, or there's tons of other really interesting short strategies that can be built. We talked about the buying and Lping and minting and Lping strategies, but there's also a lot of other fun things that you can do with Squeep. You can actually use long Squeep to hedge an ETH USD Uniswap LP position, and we have some blog posts that dive deeper into that. That's like a whole nother fun rabbit hole. You can use Squeep as a volatility oracle because Squeep kind of represents a bunch of different options condensed into one. It's like if you took the whole options chain and put it into one instrument, squeak funding can actually give you a bit of a vault oracle, which is very exciting. So we're looking at ETH VIX through Squeak funding, which is another kind of fun topic to dive into.
00:22:39.102 - 00:23:12.058, Speaker B: So basically, there's lots of interesting things that you can build with Squeath. And if you're excited about that, we've got some blog posts about those things and happy to chat more about it. And, yeah, if you want to try out Squeath, you can squeeze at Squeats open. Co if you try that out, definitely feel free to ping me with any questions or thoughts that you have. Very excited to answer questions. We're always trying to improve the Squeath. If you want to chat about Squeath or have questions, join us at discord Open Co.
00:23:12.058 - 00:23:26.400, Speaker B: And if you want to build Squeath, we are hiring at Jobs Open Co. Cool. So it was very fun squeaping with y'all. If you have questions, definitely hit us up on Discord. And yeah, thank you.
00:23:28.210 - 00:23:40.400, Speaker A: Thanks, Alexis. That was an amazing intro to how Squeat works, and I'm just looking at some of the comments on the chat, too, and this is so clever. So I'm glad that we got to do a beginner friendly version of how all these things work.
00:23:41.730 - 00:23:42.186, Speaker B: Sweet.
00:23:42.218 - 00:23:53.238, Speaker A: All right, well, if there's any other more questions, we'll relay them to directly. But one comment we did get was if we can have access to the slides. So if you want to send that to us after, we'll share that with everybody.
00:23:53.404 - 00:23:54.230, Speaker B: Totally.
00:23:55.130 - 00:23:57.650, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Bye.
