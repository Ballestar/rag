00:00:00.250 - 00:00:26.146, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Leland, and I work I worked on protocol KOLs. Some brief overview about myself. I currently work at galaxy digital, working on the investing team. Prior to this, I did a lot of freelancing work helping protocols with design work or front end engineering. And here we're going to present about protocol 100, which is a project I built that was funded by uni soft grant.
00:00:26.338 - 00:00:46.918, Speaker B: Leland I think the screen share is not working properly, so we want to just give that a shot one more time. I think we're stuck on APROs. And then, yep, everything is good.
00:00:47.084 - 00:01:28.310, Speaker A: Great. So UGP journey got a grant early last year, early this year to build out a governance dashboard. And then I happened to get a full time job. And then so as the process turns out, it's like, okay, I will work on it this weekend. I will work on it next weekend. And turns out, several months later, the entire market has moved. And at the time when I talked to Ken, he's like, hey, Ken, I really want to work on a governance dashboard that shows the current progress of proposals, like, who's voting on what, how are they voting, how's the vote changed.
00:01:28.310 - 00:02:14.120, Speaker A: But by the time I really started building it, the market had moved already. And we have companies like tally and boardroom really feel that niche. And then at that point, I realized there's no point in building another governance dashboard that just replicates what other people are building. So it's back to the drawing board, like, what new that we can build that hasn't been built before? And at the time, it seemed like these tools are really good at showing snapshots of protocols. You look at a protocol in isolation, but it's not great at combining protocols together. So the question was, what's some interesting data that we can show that aggregates protocol data together. That's how protocol kol came around.
00:02:14.120 - 00:02:46.266, Speaker A: So protocol is amalgamation of, like, a protocol plus a kol. A kol is a key opinion leader, more commonly in the US. Known as an influencer. And we slapped on 100 at the end. And the goal here is to create a list of influencers or a list of KOLs who are in the top 100. Biggest influencers within crypto or biggest influencers within crypto governance. And there's many ways to measure governance.
00:02:46.266 - 00:03:34.458, Speaker A: We can look at in terms of how active you are. We can look in terms of passivity. We can look at whether you're being active on chain or passive on chain or this off chain. And so what's interesting here is you could be very active on chain by submitting proposals, and then we can look at the engagement of these proposals, determine whether they're popular or not, and that could be a gauge of influence. We can see whether you're voting, which is slightly less active than submitting proposals. And then on the alternative side, something that's very passive is your token balance, you could have hundreds of millions of dollars delegated to you and yet you never vote at all. But you still have some amount of influence because you have a lot of latent influence.
00:03:34.458 - 00:04:49.690, Speaker A: If you wanted to vote, you would have a lot of influence, but yet you choose not to vote. And so we see in some of these protocols we have some of the top five delegates maybe only voted like once or twice, yet they still have a lot of influence by virtue of having a lot of tokens. We could also measure influence in terms of who's delegating to you. If someone, quote unquote famous is delegating to you, should that make yourself as a protocol politician more famous? A lot of university programs have been delegated by Anderson Horowitz. So the question is, should we be paying more attention to you because of like, do you have more influence? And then we can look at whether you have a lot of delegations or not. On the converse side, we can measure influence from an off chain manner. And so this could be something more passive, like are you engaging on social media, on forums? Are you participating in off chain voting? We can look at your audience size, do you have a newsletter, are a lot of people reading it? Do you have a lot of analysis? And these are a lot softer, so it's a lot harder to kind of quantify your influence.
00:04:49.690 - 00:05:59.520, Speaker A: So in terms of calculating influence, we can imagine having a very complex or well thought out methodology to determine who is more influential than someone else. For example, we could look at your success rate when it comes to submitting proposals, your votes, protocols involved in, et cetera. And we can weight these all appropriately. However, I guess I took the easy way out and it's like, okay, the actual calculation of influence we'll do here is we look at how many votes you've been delegated and we just times it by the token price. And clearly this is not the greatest of methodologies and it's probably quite horrible because some protocols have multi billion dollar market cap and some protocols are much smaller. And so if you're medium sized, delegate in uniswap, of course your weight is going to supersede and overcome smaller protocols. But I think it's a fun memeable metric that we can use, which kind of goes in hand with what I was building here.
00:05:59.520 - 00:06:11.570, Speaker A: So let's jump in. So protocol club move. Is my screen still being shared?
00:06:13.510 - 00:06:14.162, Speaker B: Yes.
00:06:14.296 - 00:06:50.734, Speaker A: Perfect. So when we load up the app here, it starts by giving you an alert along with like a legend of what's here. And so the question is, like, who are the governance influence? Who's within the top 100? And we can select different protocols. Right now we have unisop and compound selected, let's add pool together in radical. And while we wait for it to load, we can see we have some addresses that rank in the top. This is a rank. This is their name address or their name.
00:06:50.734 - 00:07:45.620, Speaker A: From Sybil, we have their quote unquote vote weight, which is tokens delegated times price across protocols. We can look at their total number of delegates, we can look at their proposal number, and then we can look at the number of protocols that they're active in. And what's quite profound is across these four protocols, it's actually quite uncommon to see someone active in all of them. And actually within the top, like 100, there's only one person who does participate in all three protocols. So it's just like an interesting data point we realize is that influence is very localized. It is localized within one or two protocols at max. So here we can drill down and look at individual delegates and see how much voting power they have.
00:07:45.620 - 00:09:01.894, Speaker A: Some other features here is we can go like, search for particular addresses, and I'll say whether they are in the top 100 or not. And we cap this at 100 explicitly. Because I think the fun part about memoble leaderboards that you need to have some amount of caps to it, otherwise your leaderboard will have thousands of people and it's less fun, in my opinion. So some interesting observations that I had when I was building this is that there really is concentration. How does this this method of weighing protocol politicians is horrible because if you look at uniswap huge market cap or so, if you look at pool together, it's much smaller. So I think ultimately, in the long run, if you want to create a good index for measuring who are these quote unquote influencers, you can't just multiply tokens delegated by token price. And we've seen other good tools that measure KOLs, but there's a lot more work that needs to be done here.
00:09:01.894 - 00:09:20.650, Speaker A: So behind the scenes, this is built using a lot of some hooks from Sybil. We pulled the data from the graph, and I guess my hope for this project is that it becomes a meme that people are like, okay, I'm ranked 20 on the protocol 100 list. Thank you, Kartek.
