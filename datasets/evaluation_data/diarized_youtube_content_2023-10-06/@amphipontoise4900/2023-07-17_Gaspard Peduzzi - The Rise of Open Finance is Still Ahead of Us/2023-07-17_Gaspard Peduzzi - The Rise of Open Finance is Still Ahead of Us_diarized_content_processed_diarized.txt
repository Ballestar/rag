00:01:12.810 - 00:01:42.350, Speaker A: Frequently busy but without um like an eventual.
00:01:49.490 - 00:01:50.970, Speaker B: Is it actually organic?
00:01:51.050 - 00:01:53.546, Speaker A: Is it, is it usable, is it safe?
00:01:53.738 - 00:01:54.554, Speaker B: What's missing?
00:01:54.602 - 00:01:58.142, Speaker A: What's missing for the next step of this ecosystem to grow?
00:01:58.276 - 00:02:00.286, Speaker B: And that's why I want to do.
00:02:00.308 - 00:02:06.150, Speaker A: A quick step by step. Why do we round.
00:02:29.810 - 00:02:30.720, Speaker B: Be about?
00:02:34.690 - 00:02:43.360, Speaker A: So when you group, when you group three, when they.
00:03:15.310 - 00:03:56.120, Speaker B: That'S the first thing. Finance as we know it is not open. But there is another thing, it's quite limited because you have one app that does many things but then if you want to have another services, it's another app, it's another provider. If you want to combine two things it takes a lot of delay, a lot of struggle to combination of application. You have a lot of limitation due to the regulatory, to the technicalities of building financial services together. It's very controlled, it's very centralized and it relies on a lot of intermediaries so you have a lot of fees basically. It's not efficient by design, it's not something that can scale in the usage in the same way that defined can do.
00:03:56.120 - 00:04:27.442, Speaker B: That's where DeFi comes. DeFi is basically creating open finance. You define a service as a protocol and then with those different protocols you can combine them with each other. It's basically money Lego as we call it. And that's what's great, that's what hyped so many people a few years ago because now all of a sudden you don't have to ask permission of ave for example, a lending market to build on top of them, to use them. You can just use them as a protocol. You can build a protocol on top of it and then a protocol on top of it.
00:04:27.442 - 00:05:54.570, Speaker B: You can combine application, combine liquidity and you can do that on a Sunday without asking the permission to anyone. So that's why DeFi started to hyper people and we started to have lots of liquidity, lots of noise around it and people were thinking that's it, finally we have a good usage for blockchain and that's good. And we have many different categories, we have stable coins, we have real world asset exchanges, different strategies, so we have a variety of potential usage but are we there yet? Liquidity grew to tens of billion, more than 100 billion back in the days and so many users but market change price started to go down and then all of a sudden we think well DeFi failed, it's not very useful. Were we actually using it or were we just providing liquidity to earn interest rates because of some reward or some protocol? Was it actually a thing? Was it actually sustainable and organical? The first thing is, when you think about it, DeFi is extremely volatile, not just in the prices of the assets, but for example in the volatility of the interest rates. And if it's very volatile, it makes it very difficultly practicable. Imagine you want to take a loan to buy something. Then if that interest rate goes from a few percent to 80% in a day, it creates uncontrolled cost.
00:05:54.570 - 00:06:15.122, Speaker B: Imagine you're trying to generate revenue. Is that? And you have. A lot of volatility. You have a lot of uncertainty over your revenues. Basically, it lost a bit of interest if you have another alternative. And so that's kind of the stage where we are, where in DeFi, where it's still very wild and very unpredictable. So you have to be at the gen.
00:06:15.122 - 00:06:45.386, Speaker B: You have to navigate through the things, and that's just about the volatility. But we all know the uncertainty and the risk that is attached to. Those protocols. Because it's not even that you're expecting your interest to be stable, but also at the same time you expect your money still to be there in a few months, which is not always the case. Interest rate. Derivative can sound very niche, but it's actually the biggest market in finance. Interest rates is the time value of money, and it's the basis of finance.
00:06:45.386 - 00:07:03.266, Speaker B: It's the price of liquidity. It's what helps you regulate liquidity and cost. Over different levels. Interest rate derivatives. They are tools. Instruments that can be allowed to speculate on the variation of interest rates, but also to edge your risk against a variation. They can be options.
00:07:03.266 - 00:07:41.898, Speaker B: Swaps future. We hear those. Terms. But that's what is making a financial ecosystem practically practicable, that's heavily used in TradFi by companies, by retail, without even knowing it. It's what helps you managing your cash flow, your cost, revenues. And that's where almost three years ago. We started building Spectra before called API, basically creating different instruments like Zero Coupon Bond like a yield market where you can trade interest rates and then building other products on top, like fixed rate borrowing and lending.
00:07:41.898 - 00:08:23.294, Speaker B: Basically to create Practicable financial environment to help DeFi grow and help DeFi becoming more mature with all the stack. So we started two years ago and I mentioned it's a middleware in the sense that and that's the beauty. Of DeFi. You have a layer of protocols doing, for example, lending, exchange, that kind of thing. And then on top of it, you can add another protocol like Spectra that is enabling you to basically supercharge your previous usage. So now you can come back to your favorite lending and borrowing protocol that had the best rates but variable and you can have fixed ones. So you can say, I want to borrow that amount for that amount of time.
00:08:23.294 - 00:08:56.920, Speaker B: I can have fixed rates. I want to lend my money, generate revenues. Through that activity, I can know my incomes in advance. And that's the first step. It's making DeFi efficient another step, is that it's? Not just about having all those combination of protocols that helps you having more and more usage, but it's also redefining the way we build finance tools and services. I will take the example of bonds. Who is familiar with the terms of bonds and traditional finance? Okay? A lot of people.
00:08:56.920 - 00:09:42.566, Speaker B: So bonds, basically it's a fixed income instrument. And it basically represents a loan between a lender and a borrower. And the principal will be exchanged at a maturity date. So to put it simply, let's say that I say I have one east and I'm lending you one ace at least. I will pay you an east in six months. We actually had kind of the situation when we had the unstaking queue of stake east that was not available yet to use. And so people were buying a stake east at a price less than east because they would speculate that eventually they would be able to get a real east, not just a representation of east staked at a particular date.
00:09:42.566 - 00:10:16.640, Speaker B: So people were buying those at, for example, zero point 98 east because they were speculating that they would be able to get their ease back so they could know actually, if they get their ease back, how much they would have earned buying an asset at a discount. Bonds are extremely used in TradFi. For example, if you take businesses like Tezo, they have a lot of cash because basically you give them dollars and they give you a presentation of a dollar. So they reserve to make. Profits out of it. So they buy bonds. They buy bonds of dollars, basically.
00:10:16.640 - 00:10:55.406, Speaker B: And for example, short term maturity. So basically buying a dollar for less than a dollar, they wait a bit, then they are able to claim that dollar back because of the bond expired, and they make a lot of profit from it. It's the basis of cash flow management in many institutions, and that's a very cool tool. But Wu here actually used bond to generate profit. And that's the thing, because TradFi is building all tools, but you have to have access to those. It's complicated. And bonds can be issued by different institutions, but you cannot make a bond by yourself right now.
00:10:55.406 - 00:11:30.890, Speaker B: If you need to create that instrument. And that's where DeFi comes into play. Because now you can create a pool, for example, with spectra and any kind of yield generating strategy. You can create bonds with bonds and coupons. So you can trade the principal, trade the interest rate, and that's just a few clicks and everyone can do it from their computer on a Sunday evening from now. A complex, simple and basic instrument actually, that lot of new about can be used by all in every one of you. And that's the biggest thing that DeFi brings here.
00:11:30.890 - 00:12:29.100, Speaker B: It's not only that composability, but it's making those instruments extremely accessible. And you can build with so that's the first point. Another thing is that we are kind of in a turning point because people were speculating a lot about will DeFi be used? The fact that DeFi people are giving money to DeFi like a liquidity provider. And it's just a closed circle but we're kind of exactly at a time where now we are even bringing traditional finance asset instruments on chain and we are trading with those so not only you can create DeFi native bonds because now you have a strategy that generates yields and you create bonds with that. But now you can actually trade them against traditional finance bond like Treasury Bill, like real estate, real estate things. And that's making that. Supercharge like finance experience and creates much more possibility from there.
00:12:29.100 - 00:12:51.360, Speaker B: And that's, I think, today where we are. So not only we make finance efficient, we make finance open, but then from the combination of all those things, we create something that was not able to be done before by creating all those instruments on Shain, thank you, if you have any question, I'll be very happy to answer them.
00:12:54.610 - 00:14:16.380, Speaker A: Thank, Sam sam. It's close.
