00:00:00.170 - 00:00:34.530, Speaker A: There's these vanity metrics like TBL or Place in the top ten or market cap. I don't really care about any of those metrics. As long as Salana is actually coordinating hundreds of millions of people's private keys transacting in the network and there's thousands of devs that are building applications. The more important metric to focus on is are we actually like touching people's lives and daily? Or the way I hope crypto grows so fast that Salon is not in the top ten, but we also are impacting like half a billion people on the planet? That would be like the biggest success that I could imagine.
