When they upgraded to proof of stake, that was like a huge achievement, which it was. But I think that Salana should have had a similar Sole 2.0 type of movement when they released, like, the isolated feed markets, click and stake weighted quality of service. Like when they released those three things that should have been like, this is Salana 2.0. We're not going to have the issues that we had before with congestion that should have been pushed, I think super hard.
