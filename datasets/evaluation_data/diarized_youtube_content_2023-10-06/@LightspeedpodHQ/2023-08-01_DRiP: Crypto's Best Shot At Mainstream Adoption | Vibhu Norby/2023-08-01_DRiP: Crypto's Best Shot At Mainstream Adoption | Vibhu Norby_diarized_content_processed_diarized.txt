00:00:00.090 - 00:00:35.490, Speaker A: Games have just built the best feedback loops, the best incentive mechanisms, the best virtual economies as well. I think they've fortnite think about World of Warcraft RuneScape. These games really have nailed sort of how to build a virtual economy. And then most crypto companies, like, especially in consumer space, just threw all those things out the window and just focused on let's just build the economy and none of the other feedback. And that just doesn't work. It just doesn't resonate with the masses. They're driven by fun and having something to do when they're bored.

Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we're joined by Vibu, the founder of Drip.
00:01:02.458 - 00:01:13.060, Speaker B: Drip, if you don't know about it, I didn't have too good of an idea just about two weeks ago. But I've been looking into it and it might be the top application and protocol on Solana today. Babu, welcome to the show.
00:01:13.430 - 00:01:14.562, Speaker A: Thank you for having me.
00:01:14.616 - 00:01:58.194, Speaker B: So as I was getting ready for this episode, I was going through some of the podcasts that you've been on. And one of the things that you said is that in the next six months, drip is going to open the floodgates and Salana may never be the same again. So that's where I want to end up and see why you said that. But I want to start off with just what Drip is and to give everybody an idea of the adoption that Drip is already having. There's been 17 million NFTs minted, and because of compressed NFTs, which we'll get into, it's only cost $2,000. And I believe this has been over is it about 800,000? Wallets received an AirDrop and they have about 300 to 500,000 active all today. So if any app has found product market fit in crypto, I think this might be it.
00:01:58.194 - 00:02:03.506, Speaker B: So yeah, it'd be great if you just gave an overview, maybe the inspiration behind Drip and what it is.
00:02:03.608 - 00:02:36.078, Speaker A: Sure. Drip started at Solana Spaces, which was a set of retail stores that were designed to onboard people into Solana. And when we were working on those stores, we just found like there needed to be a better way to introduce someone to crypto other than Tokens. So we started giving people free NFTs and free artwork, basically. And it really resonated. It was really amazing kind of retention tool. We started sending them every single week with Solana, even using the old NFT spec.
00:02:36.078 - 00:03:15.338, Speaker A: And the list kind of grew and grew and grew. And it kind of went out of our control in January. And we decided we're going to focus full time on this project. So what we do is we partner with creators and artists and brands projects. And they use our platform to send out free digital collectibles every week to a list of people. And those collectibles are all kinds of stuff. Like we have art from A typewriter with Djenpo, we have music videos from live shows from Vault Music, we have comic books with Bork, we have science like Microscope Science with McQuinn, just all kinds of stuff.
00:03:15.338 - 00:03:38.930, Speaker A: People are distributing it out for free for users and for the creators. On a regular basis, we send around 3 million NFTs a week, which is unheard of in the old world of NFTs. But with this new spec that Solana has compression, it's totally possible and it's very affordable.
00:03:40.550 - 00:04:35.960, Speaker C: So you said these collectibles that you do send out are very different in flavor. You have maybe audio, you have some actual art. I think there's some by Betdex of Sports moments, which I personally subscribe to because I'm a big sports fan. I think that's a very new mental model or framework when thinking about NFTs. Whereas before they were kind of just these JPEGs which you put on Twitter and now you're part of Tribex now I believe you've kind of termed this new way of distributing these things as content, like D to C content. Can you talk a bit more about that? Because it's such an obvious idea, but nobody really put it quite that way before, and you have, and you found success with it. Can you just talk about how you think about this?
00:04:36.330 - 00:05:59.050, Speaker A: Yeah, it's one of those things that's only obvious once you've seen it, and then it's like, okay, of course. Why can't NFTs be any types of content? Basically, our NFTs, they just don't function like normal NFTs, not in any fashion, even though some people use the same terminology. We sort of think of this as taking an object of content, a video, music file, whatever it is, then wrapping it in this composable layer, which is what the NFT is, right? What is actually an NFT? I don't think most people that trade NFTs even understand what exactly is happening. What an NFT is, is you have a storage of metadata somewhere, which is like not to get too technical, but it's basically a file that outlines the properties that are inside the NFT and also a link to where the NFT exists. Sometimes that NFT, like the file itself is on some decentralized storage provider, sometimes it's in Amazon S three. And the NFT itself that the user owns is basically a pointer to that piece of metadata saying, hey, this address has this it doesn't matter where other than ordinals which is an exception to this, everything else in NFTs basically works the same. So in our opinion, we just felt like, okay, well, that data structure.
00:05:59.050 - 00:06:11.300, Speaker A: We can stuff all kinds of stuff in there. What happens when all content is kind of open? Anyone can add to it, anyone can build on top of it, and anyone can distribute them.
00:06:12.710 - 00:06:31.160, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. You've said that Drip, you think, is the best way or the best chance that NFTs go mainstream. Why is that? What's so unique to Drip over other platforms? And as a creator, why are so many people going to Drip? I mean, I quoted the amazing growth you've had so far.
00:06:32.170 - 00:07:14.006, Speaker A: Well, let me reverse that a little bit. What of the web, two products that we have today that are at scale, would have been at scale if they started with requiring you to KYC transfer tokens, save your seed phrase, pay $100, a $1,000, whatever the mint price was to get into we wouldn't have Facebook, we wouldn't have Instagram, none of these things would survive. They would not exist today. So I think we just came at it from a very practical standpoint, which is that people first of all, most people don't have any money. Second of all, most people don't want to KYC. They don't understand the tokens. They're very scared of crypto stuff.
00:07:14.006 - 00:07:49.966, Speaker A: They don't want to lose what they have, what they've invested. So I think at a basic level, free tokenless is just the only starting place for a very big scale product. So let's put that in one bucket, I think, on the other side. Okay, well, once we solve that, what are the things that people in the world like to do? They like to watch videos. They like to listen to music. They like to look at pictures. None of those things are again, they're freely accessible on the Internet.
00:07:49.966 - 00:08:10.570, Speaker A: You just boot up TikTok or Instagram, whatever you want and just zone out right, for a couple hours. So I think we're just saying, okay, let's break the barrier on the accessibility side, and then let's just give people what we already know that they like, which is content that's engaging, and it just happens to have all these superpowers that you and I know exist in crypto.
00:08:12.110 - 00:08:38.820, Speaker C: That's a very good point, and it almost, in my mind at least, draws somewhat of a parallel to just social media, something like Instagram, where you scroll and you see videos, pictures, reels, shorts, but also just quotes as well. So different types of content. So I guess the natural question there is, what is it about NFTs that makes this different than just using a database? For example?
00:08:41.750 - 00:09:52.742, Speaker A: A lot of stuff, I think some of those things that come to mind are like things that consumers might care about, and some of them are things that developers might care about, and some of them are things that creators might care about. I want to start at creators because I think that's the place where the most inequality has sort of showed up on the Internet so far today. When a content creator posts a picture on Instagram, whether it gets seen by 10 million people or three people, the content creator doesn't get compensated for sharing that information. And that's okay, to be honest, because most of the content that's shared on the internet has no value to anybody. But the thing is that when that becomes someone's business, when a creator is using content to make money or to anchor a business that they're running somewhere else, all of a sudden it starts to become very unfair. When the content creator is producing the content, it goes into the platform. The platform is now utilizing the audience that that creator has built to serve ads and kind of capture the economics of that transaction.
00:09:52.742 - 00:11:07.406, Speaker A: And literally only in the last couple of years did most platforms realize this might be a problem, that creators should get compensated for these things. And so you've seen things like subscriptions and Instagram and Twitter and Twitch and so on, but the reality is that from day one, the economics were just really tough and almost entirely aggregating at the platform level. So I think what we've sort of stumbled upon as an opportunity is the NFT is kind of this sliver of attention that gets captured in that moment on chain where creators created something, they sent it to somebody and it went directly from then to you, even if it was done to 100, 200,000 people at time. And that sliver of attention, you kind of own it because you have it in your wallet. So if you want to keep it, if you want to share it with somebody, if you want to even sell it, that's something that's totally new. That NFTs kind of enable from the user point of view, I think it should feel the same. I think it should feel very close to subscribing to any other following someone on TikTok.
00:11:07.406 - 00:11:31.900, Speaker A: We're getting there, but the reality is that we kind of crawled up through the degenerate ecosystem a bit and so the way the product feels today is kind of a mixture of the NFT game where you like rarity and then you also have content and they're all kind of coming together in this unusual way. So we'll see where that goes. But it shouldn't feel different, I guess is where we want to be.
00:11:32.990 - 00:11:52.750, Speaker B: How did you get to the point that you got so much traction so quickly? I think you went live in October 2022. I know low cost is part of that. I'm not exactly sure when compressed NFTs went live. I'm curious if that played into the adoption that you've witnessed or how did you start that network effect and now that you have over 800,000 wallets have received an AirDrop.
00:11:53.490 - 00:12:27.338, Speaker A: Yeah, so we turned on compression when we were around 120,000 users. So we already had scaled quite a bit to that point. Yeah, honestly it's just spread virally word of mouth from very early days. We had an invite code system. You had to have an invite code to get in and the way you got invite code was from somebody else. And our early users were fanatical. Every time they got an invite code, they would share it with somebody else that they knew, whether that was an Internet friend or someone IRL or someone in their family.
00:12:27.338 - 00:13:08.454, Speaker A: And it just had this really awesome K factor from probably December onwards. And yeah, there's a lot of other things going on behind the scenes. Like, we work with a lot of Discords and Telegram groups and projects to distribute codes in different ways. But yeah, honestly, it's been totally word of mouth. And nowadays we also work together with creators to onboard their people. So many of our creators have sizable audiences elsewhere, 200K on Instagram, million on TikTok and so on. So when we bring them in, we work together to try to transition some of their existing followers over.
00:13:08.572 - 00:13:18.330, Speaker B: When you closed down Sauna Spaces and you moved to this because you saw this as the best onboarding mechanism, did you think that this would happen? Or like yeah. Are you surprised by the traction?
00:13:23.330 - 00:14:07.354, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I am surprised. I thought it would be a little bit slower, a little bit more difficult. What people don't know is how much effort we spend on multi account prevention as well, like civil resistance. So we've had this balancing act from day one of figuring out new ways to grow, new audiences, to grow into, at the same time stopping people from trying to kind of attack our systems and farm accounts. And yeah, honestly, the last couple of months have been pretty mind blowing. This is not the first time I've built a social product. I started my career in social.
00:14:07.354 - 00:14:28.180, Speaker A: I started my career at Roblox and building a company called Everyme, which was a social network. And I think, to me, the same stuff that we used to do kind of still applies. If you build a nice onboarding system, if you have referral systems in place, if people like the content and they're addicted to it, they'll tell somebody else, and at enough scale, that thing kind of has a life of its own.
00:14:29.430 - 00:15:13.550, Speaker C: So a lot of people actually don't know about your background, and I do want to touch on that a little later in the episode. But while we're talking about kind of the earlier days of Drip, one thing I'll point out is that at least on the Bird app or now the X app, this wasn't necessarily a fan favorite at first. I would say you had some critics about the idea for Drip and why are you spreading so many different NFTs? You're going to dilute my bags? Or just classic comments on Twitter? And so you had to actually overcome a pretty fair amount of adversity, I would say. Can you describe what those days were like and what was your mindset when seeing these comments?
00:15:14.850 - 00:16:31.610, Speaker A: Yeah, we still get them, so I guess I don't feel like we've overcome anything, but yeah, there was kind of this uncanny valley of growth for us, where in the early days, the size of our drops was kind of competing with art editions. And so for a lot of artists, it felt like, hey, you're giving away stuff for free, and over here, we're charging for it, and therefore you're stealing audience away from what would otherwise make them money into something that didn't cost anything. And I think for the most part, we've overcome that just with scale, because you just can't compare a Drip drop with anything else in crypto. There's nothing else out there that consistently sends out millions of NFTs every single week. So if you thought this was competing with art, now, you realize this is really competing with Instagram. And yeah, for the most part, we've gotten past that. Nowadays, the big thing that's on my mind is how much financialization to welcome into this product, because the crypto people all want to be financialized, hyper financialized.
00:16:31.610 - 00:17:27.594, Speaker A: Our team's vision is completely the opposite. But the same thing that you said about, why are you diluting my bags? I think there's just, like, some level of expectation across all people that entered crypto that even if it was free, and no matter how you kind of got in, that you're going to take care of my bags in some fashion, even if those things I didn't pay for. So we're starting to see, like, hey, I hold a bunch of NFTs. Why aren't you doing this or that for me, that kind of stuff. And it's interesting, but I've been around for a long time. We listen to our customers, but we also have a pretty strong sense for where we need to go. And the only way that Drip is kind of a massive success to me is if it really breaks through out of crypto into many, many other people's hands.
00:17:27.594 - 00:17:49.810, Speaker A: And it's something that gives a lot of people joy, and a lot of people is like, tens of millions. Otherwise, it'll be very hard to make the economics of Drip, even though the costs are small, they're not as cheap as Web Two. We just try to stay focused on where we're going. If there's FUD, let it happen. That's just kind of natural with the territory, I suppose.
00:17:50.230 - 00:18:06.758, Speaker B: Talking about financialization and speculation, I know you're not a big fan of the speculation side of crypto. It's probably, like, your least favorite part of this. It is interesting, though, because speculation really comes down to being a game, and financialization is a game, right? In many ways. Like, DeFi is almost gamified to some sense.
00:18:06.844 - 00:18:08.006, Speaker C: So you talked about how you used.
00:18:08.028 - 00:18:32.560, Speaker B: To actually work at a gaming company, and you said you've gotten a lot of inspiration from gaming, and I think it was fortnite when shaping and building Drip. So I'm curious, what do you see in gaming, which many people probably know this, but gaming is bigger than music, entertainment, and movies combined. So it's a huge industry and especially with the younger population. So I'm curious, what's been your inspiration from gaming or what do you see in gaming today that you want to bring to Drip later on?
00:18:33.170 - 00:19:45.880, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good insight. I mean, every young person grows up playing video games instead of watching TV and they're playing things like Fortnite, but also Clash of Clans on their phone like they're playing these very cheap kind of gotcha games as well. I think games, the best games are very good at reinforcing positive feedback loops and kind of training your brain to enjoy playing, but also enjoy the journey to the reward and having to balance how much dopamine you're allowing someone to have in any given moment is just an interesting thing. Right. If you played a game and let's just a theoretical game, there's a treasure chest that shows up on screen every 3 seconds and you can tap it and open it and there's a big confetti blast and you get some item in there. Right, okay, I'm releasing dopamine the first couple of times, open the chest, but it starts to get boring. Right? So you want to have sort of like a loop where I've done something, I put in the effort, I've checked once a day, I've checked a couple of times, they had done this.
00:19:45.880 - 00:20:39.480, Speaker A: Now I get a reward and makes me want to continue to do this. Games have just built the best feedback loops, the best incentive mechanism, the best virtual economies as well. I think they've fortnite think about World of Warcraft RuneScape. These games really have nailed sort of how to build a virtual economy and then most crypto companies, like especially in consumer space, just threw all those things out the window and just focused on let's just build the economy and none of the other feedback loops or the other fun features. And that just doesn't work. It just doesn't resonate with the masses. I guess they're driven by fun and having something to do when they're bored and not much else.
00:20:39.480 - 00:22:09.318, Speaker A: The product is not fully fleshed out yet, but you'll definitely see over the next six months that Drip will feel more like a game in terms of how we kind of push you from being casual to being an expert, but doing that without attaching financialization to it is a challenge. I was thinking about this today, whether financialization of crypto is a bug or a feature. I think it actually is just a feature. I think when you browse Facebook mindlessly and they're feeding all this content into your brain, we just sit there and let them use us for whatever purposes that they want. Whether that's like altering the political landscape, know, serving know McDonald's ads, whatever it is, we just let that happen. I think the fact that crypto users kind of demand that they participate in those economics is like a very beautiful thing that we do need to acknowledge and figure out, okay, can we make them equitable participants here? Make sure that Drip, the company doesn't take every single dollar out of the ecosystem for ourselves, because that's kind of how we end up back where we used to be.
00:22:09.404 - 00:22:30.206, Speaker C: Before Drip, you were actually at Solana Spaces, and before then, you had some other you actually found a company again, and you also had a pretty great blog post. I believe it was a blog post about your time at Nest and what you've learned and kind of your journey so far. Can you give us a little really.
00:22:30.228 - 00:22:57.222, Speaker A: Did your own research? Wow. Yeah. I just been doing startups my whole life. That's all I ever wanted to do was to build new things. And I think that the thread between everything I'm interested in kind of starts at this chip on my shoulder that I don't know why it's there. I think you have one too, Mert. I know you have one, in fact.
00:22:57.222 - 00:23:59.654, Speaker A: And that chip kind of just drives how I think about stuff. And my life's mission is really to take things that are inaccessible and make them open to all. What was appealing about Nest at the time was when I joined, was that they were building these beautiful products that were kind of forgotten in your home. And Tony Fidel was just tony is probably, like, one of the most empathetic product designers ever. He designed the ipod, the iPhone, so being able to sit next to him and just hear how he thought about bringing people into a thermostat was just a master class in product design. I wasn't executive, I was a software engineer. So I'm not, like, saying I was in the room with him like that, but his conference room was right next to me and he would spend hours in there, just like, breaking down the packaging.
00:23:59.654 - 00:24:31.470, Speaker A: That nest came right. And thinking about. Okay. What should the person see first when they take the box off and what should be underneath that level of detail? You just don't get to see that much. And I think I've definitely borrowed a little bit from that. And I mentioned that in my old blog post that I haven't read in almost ten years. But yeah, coming into retail from Nest was exactly very similar to Drip, just in a different industry.
00:24:31.470 - 00:25:40.360, Speaker A: What we were trying to do was take the concept of having your product on a shelf and move it from something that was only for the very biggest companies and make accessible to the smallest ones. And even though Beta, which was the name of the company, doesn't exist anymore, we had a very big impact on the retail industry. Retailers all over the world now they all have programs that allow small retailers and brands to come into their stores directly fashioned after what we did. If there's one life mission for me, it's trying to think about breaking these artificial barriers, like most of the barriers in our world were designed by people that were designed by people. They weren't designed by markets, and therefore they have the flaws of those creators inside of them. There's so much to do. Crypto is an amazing industry that if we can only get past ourselves, it will really have a big impact on how the world works.
00:25:41.050 - 00:26:15.970, Speaker B: I love how you're an engineer. When you talk, you're so focused just on building a great product and you're thinking about the users and you're thinking about creators, whereas the majority of builders in the space are on crypto, twitter, especially in maybe the ethereum ecosystem. And it's more like academic. And you're arguing about decentralized sequencers, and I've heard you talk about like, yeah, DeFi is great, but that's maybe not your thing or like token protocols and so forth. So it's really refreshing and it's also exciting to see someone like you with that attitude. Has one of the most successful products out there in crypto today. So I think that's really cool.
00:26:15.970 - 00:26:31.346, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, quick break to tell you about Jito. Jito is the number one liquid staking provider in Solana. Jito has been known for their mev software, and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem. Solana DeFi summer is heating up, and what asset do you want to use in DeFi liquid staking?
00:26:31.378 - 00:26:31.938, Speaker A: Tokens.
00:26:32.034 - 00:26:59.994, Speaker B: Why? Because with Jito, you can take your soul, stake it, and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token, Jito soul. You can then use Jitosoul throughout the Solana DeFi ecosystem while earning yields through mev rewards and staking rewards with Jito. And Jito makes staking super simple. You can take your soul, stake it, get instant liquidity, and start earning rewards all within three clicks. And not only do they make it simple, they make it secure. Jito has seven audits. They have more than a million soul stakes, and they're one of the most respected teams in all of DeFi.
00:26:59.994 - 00:27:15.234, Speaker B: Jito is for whales who need deep liquidity. It's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid staking. You have your soul, why not stake it, earn some yield, and start dabbling in Solana DeFi. So go get started today. Check them out at Slash Staking. That's Jeeto network. Slash Staking.
00:27:15.234 - 00:27:38.602, Speaker B: I'll put a link in the show notes. Use the link so they know that I've sent you and go get started today. Everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up. Start a conference with Bankless is the biggest, best conference in DFI. It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year. Yes, I know you love it. They Got Tacos barbecue Barton Springs We've got it all September 11 through the 13th.
00:27:38.602 - 00:28:07.474, Speaker B: You've been in crypto for a while. Know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Sani, Christine Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev, app chains, and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed. You're going to get a special discount. Type in discount code Lightspeed 30, and you'll get 30% off your ticket.
00:28:07.474 - 00:28:46.360, Speaker B: That's right. Just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks. All right, back to the show. One thing I wanted to make sure and touch on, because you're talking about how something like Drip enables for the long tail of creators to get distribution and be able to get their assets out there and connect with their community. But when you are in the age of AI and content creation and zero distribution costs, how do you think about aggregation or curation to help put those artists out there? Because I think that has to be one of the most difficult parts of crypto and just tech in general.
00:28:49.450 - 00:30:19.122, Speaker A: I'm actually personally very anti curation, which I think is in line with my accessibility thing. The world is full of people who want to sit in between artists and creators and broker, where those like, who should be buying what and what things matter. I think what I like about NFTs as a structure for this is that it can't be interrupted by a middleman. When one of our creators drops content to you, it literally goes from their wallet through I don't know, helios, okay, we'll throw in some tech in there, but basically it goes directly from the creator to the customer. At the end of the day, the customers are the ones that and the recipients of these drops are the ones that will curate with their dollars and with their attention and time. Right now we have to make decisions because even though it's very cheap to send NFTs, there's a lot of other costs to getting started. Like, for example, one thing that we never talk about, maybe we should, is that just onboarding a single creator into this data structure that compressed NFTs use, creating a tree costs close to $75 today, so it's not zero.
00:30:19.122 - 00:30:53.950, Speaker A: I mean, if you had 10,000 creators, now, you're spending almost a million bucks, right? Whereas you could put 10,000 rows in a database on YouTube for zero. So it isn't free. So we do have to gatekeep a tiny bit. But I think long term, the play has to be to make this just a tool to facilitate a creator building a list of followers and sending them composable assets.
00:30:54.290 - 00:31:09.220, Speaker B: So in Lightspeed, me and Mert like to pretend that we're creators or famous creators. How would we, for example, as a podcast, use Drip to create these NFTs and distribute it to the community? I guess, one, what would the selling point be and then how would that actually work?
00:31:11.190 - 00:31:36.682, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. We've talked about it. So this is not like a new idea for me. And we've definitely talked to many people at video podcasts about this. I think you kind of get a bunch of stuff rolled into one. Right. You have the ability to distribute this content freely, just like you mean the podcast spec is built on, like, RSS, right? It's like or it used to be, at least.
00:31:36.736 - 00:31:42.650, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. Yeah. We go through Megaphone, which then blasts it out to Spotify, Apple, and then we also post on YouTube.
00:31:43.150 - 00:32:43.626, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like RSS and podcasts are like the most similar, actually, model to Drip in the Web Two world because the user actually does have some ownership over that data, just because of the way that most of these apps try to sync between what you're sending out and what the user has already done or seen. Right. So, yeah, you would build a list with us, right? We'd set up a creator page for you. People would subscribe, and then we dropped in the episode every single week. It would be not fully different, but what becomes interesting is, hey, maybe there's a behind the scenes take or there's questions that didn't make it to the full version, or there's other things that you might reserve for people who donated to you or collected other editions or been there from day one. And this is very cool because people like to say, oh, I was listening to Lightspeed from the very first episode. But you can't really prove that today with Drip.
00:32:43.626 - 00:33:16.570, Speaker A: You really can. The chain doesn't lie. So if you received this content on day one, you actually were there. And that's interesting for the consumer, but also gives you, as the creator, a way to think about, okay, how could we maybe take care of people who were here early or who supported us really deeply from day one to get to some bigger stage? This is something that you don't care about right now because you guys are just getting started. But think about a year or two or three years from now, you'll have a ton of data at your disposal to build interesting programs.
00:33:17.310 - 00:34:06.170, Speaker B: Yeah, this might be a little bit wonky from, like, a podcaster's perspective, but when I thought about putting, for example, light speed on Drip, one of the things that comes to my mind is attribution, because we want to see how many downloads we get, for example, on Spotify versus Apple. And I'm curious what type of attribution a creator could get on something like Drip. I know you've tweeted in the past about how you have a large focus on UX, and because of that, you wouldn't be able to say, serve ads like you might have in Web Two, which this kind of goes into the monetization of Drip. But I'm just curious, as a creator, what type of information could you get from your audience? Do you think about that? And almost mapping audiences out, like having cookies of sorts on a blockchain. I know it's a lot of questions in one, but I'm curious what you think about getting to know your audience through data that a creator can see in Drip.
00:34:07.150 - 00:34:57.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think you have different types of data than you have in Web Two, and you could of course instrument it with normal data collection stuff like surveys and so on. But yeah, the chain has a full complete record of what other things that wallet might be receiving or interested in what they're paying for donating to imagine. Like if we had hundreds of crypto podcasts, I think you'll have a pretty good sense of what other people might be good candidates to listen to your podcast. And you can do that with zero part data. Like, we don't even have to sit in between. You also could send your podcast to someone else's audience, which is a totally brand new idea that's only possible. Web Three, hey, I don't know what's another podcast that you guys have today?
00:34:59.070 - 00:35:01.900, Speaker B: We've got Empire Bell Curve Zero X.
00:35:03.630 - 00:35:52.518, Speaker A: Yeah, you could literally send the first episode lightspeed to Empire and you could do it without their permission. Do people want this? I don't know. That's kind of the jury will be out on that kind of stuff. But yeah, attribution is a very interesting question and it's very hard to build a good ad business model without some kind of direct attribution. And I've kind of thought about this from a composable standpoint because your content is on chain sitting in the user wallet. If that user's wallet touches anything else, maybe it's something specific that you're trying to get them to do. Say you're trying to get them to also subscribe to your email newsletter and that activity is connected through the same wallet.
00:35:52.518 - 00:36:24.680, Speaker A: Now we have a link between these two things and we can build interesting incentive structures between them and you can literally pay people to do that. Right? Hey, connect your wallet and sign up for email service and we'll give you a dollar. Right? This is what many brands are already doing with Drip today. We're just observing, sitting back, watching many of the projects build out different attribution solutions, and they're all based around connecting that same Drip wallet to some other place and doing it without our permission, which is an incredible thing.
00:36:26.010 - 00:37:11.480, Speaker C: I'll just add to that because you can also, on top of everything Web said, you can also just embed cookies and whatever sorts of trackers on the NFT metadata itself, just like Web Two as well. So I would say you actually probably have better tools and really more expansive tools that you can use for Attribution and tracking. And while we're on maybe the topic of Attribution, so we've talked a lot about Drip and what it enables for users and creators. A common critique that I've heard, or I mean, you've definitely heard is the monetization aspect for Drip itself. Right? How do you think about that? How does Drip make money? Does it need to make money? I see you're already smiling, so I'll let you take it.
00:37:13.050 - 00:38:10.354, Speaker A: Every time someone asks me, I'm like, you know what? Thank you so much for your concern, they say it in a way that's like, as if we're not we don't realize that we're not making money. Yeah, we're fully aware of that. Yeah. Where I'm basing the entire feature of this business off of is the fact that the most profitable companies in the world, they all build free products. And if you just look down all the fan companies, facebook, let's talk about Google or Facebook, these guys make between $10 a user per month and $40 a user per month, depending on where they are in the world. Just from ads alone and making $100 a month off of a billion people. You're one of the very best companies that's ever existed.
00:38:10.354 - 00:38:52.806, Speaker A: So that's kind of like, can we get to that place in the future? And how do you ask for that $100? Do you ask for user to pay for that or do you ask businesses to pay for that? That's really just what it comes down to. So our direction here is let's build a big audience. Let's not reinvent the wheel of monetization. There's lots of amazing models that have been built already. Let's figure out a way at scale to help businesses or even creators or influencers reach the audiences that they care about. Using NFTs, that's the critical path. But if we overtune Monetization right now, we are just shooting ourselves in the foot for sure.
00:38:52.806 - 00:39:19.642, Speaker A: And our users want this because this is where we disagree with our users a lot, because they want this to be smaller, because then the NFTs might become more valuable, there's less supply. But it's just that going down that path is a path that takes us into just being another NFT project. We're not going to do that. Drip is going to remain free for a really long time, probably forever.
00:39:19.786 - 00:40:01.020, Speaker B: To talk about how maybe Drip is impacting the industry as a whole. I know Drip's relatively new, but clearly it has. With the volume that you picked up, you tweeted out how Drips potentially shifted the overton window to some degree from some misguided ideas that we had about NFTs and how supply is meaningless. NFTs are not investments. Free art does not mean bad art. Anything can be an NFT and audience is greater than money. I'm curious, what do you think the future of NFTs is going to be like do you think it's something that's just used for everyday items? Do you think it's going to be more of the collectibles and premium objects that you see on ethereum? What do you think the future of NFTs is?
00:40:05.010 - 00:40:44.060, Speaker A: If I were to guess, it definitely is going to be a huge spectrum. I don't think we're going to get rid of them at all. There's always going to be someone that has an idea for digital community. They want to bootstrap NFTs, but I think the middle is going to be washed out. I think you're going to have basically a lot of freely accessible or hyper accessible NFTs with big supply. And I think you're going to have much smaller communities, maybe even than 10,000, that are basically exclusive country clubs that just happen to be on the internet. That model, I can't find a fault with that model, to be honest.
00:40:44.060 - 00:41:31.530, Speaker A: In Salana we have like Google, which is a collection of only 100, and these things sell for 50, $60,000 each. There's going to be space for that kind of stuff. What I don't like about the Ten K idea, and that's kind of what I was talking about in those Tweets, is like ten K is a very arbitrary and weird number to choose. That all. NFTs decided that they're all only going to be every 10,000. It's not small enough to be only available to the wealthiest class of crypto people, but it's also not big enough to be accessible to the masses. I guess if I were to guess, it probably looks like the way our globe looks demographically.
00:41:31.530 - 00:42:21.386, Speaker A: Unfortunately, most of the world is very poor and probably the vast majority of people are going to trade in very they're not going to trade. Maybe they're going to be working with things that are free and have a lot of supply. And the middle class has been disappearing for some time, but especially in developing world, I just think it probably mirrors that at enough scale. But today I'm fairly convinced that the Ten K PFP game is done. We may see another small pump or something like that, but from where they sit in the ecosystem, I just don't get it. I can't find an argument for it.
00:42:21.488 - 00:42:53.330, Speaker C: So, Viv, you just made a very strong statement that Drip will probably be forever free, right? And you have made similar strong statements in the past. My particular favorite is this one. I'm just going to read it. This is on July 25. We will not launch on other chains. If you want free art, comics, music videos and in game assets, get a Salana wallet and join four hundred K Plus on Drip house. If you don't want to try Salana, that's fine.
00:42:53.330 - 00:43:09.260, Speaker C: You'll be missing out on the most fun and accessible products in crypto. So obviously I retweeted that. That was a very based post. And I want to ask the obvious question which is, why do you feel this way?
00:43:12.510 - 00:44:22.030, Speaker A: What is the argument exactly for switching chains other than there's a foundation giving us a grant to go and build the same thing somewhere else? There's no first principles argument for why this is something that users want. And what we need to do as Drip and as an industry is figure out how to break out of the crypto audience and find people that are not here today. And if you jump from Solana to optimism or Arbitrum, whatever it is, polygon, it doesn't matter. You are basically stating that we haven't solved for making our product interesting. All we've solved for is liquidity and trading and speculation. And you can't convince me that anyone is doing that for the tech or because they can't get something out of Solana. So I'm just focused somewhere else.
00:44:22.030 - 00:44:48.040, Speaker A: Solana has the tools to scale to a billion users right now, and that's what I want to do, that's what we want to do. And going to Ethereum, Bitcoin, whatever chain, it just doesn't solve that. So, I don't know. Everyone needs to keep their eye focused on the ball, which is making crypto a part of the rest of the world.
00:44:48.570 - 00:45:07.520, Speaker B: So, Viv, what are you cooking up over at Trip? Because this was, I think, a week ago, you said, in the next six months, you're opening the floodgates. And I think at the quote you said, salana will never be the same, talking about having in the future bringing onboarding hundreds of millions of users. So I'd love you to talk about that.
00:45:08.370 - 00:46:01.278, Speaker A: Yeah. During the 2021 bowl, we saw a couple of famous people do things in crypto that included buying or getting gifted a board ape from MoonPay. Most of them were being gifted these or dropping a ten K PFP collection that is probably worth $0 today. Those were the two things that influencers did. And what's interesting is, if you understand creators today, especially the biggest ones, and you ask them what things they care about, they don't care about making money. They're making tons of money from sponsorships. And I don't know, they walk out on the Kardashian TV show and they put their bag on the table and Louis Vuitton pays them 600K for that, right? So they're not worried about money.
00:46:01.278 - 00:47:00.580, Speaker A: They're worried about audience. They're worried about being relevant and getting their content in front of the next generation. And I think what Drip can offer here is another way to reach young people that is different. And this is why they go. This is why if you look at Instagram, TikTok, every single one of them had their moment where Twitter even had this moment where it went from people like me, who were in San Francisco, interested in sharing my thoughts, to overnight breaking through with some big influencer coming on board. And as soon as that influencer shows up, if it's the right one, kim Kardashian, whoever was back in the day, other celebrities start to show up. You start to build this healthy flywheel where the mainstream audiences are interested in seeing what's going on over there.
00:47:00.580 - 00:47:51.378, Speaker A: So my goal is to be ready for that moment, and we're not right now, to be frank, why do I say six months? It might be a little bit longer, but we need a lot of stuff that we don't have. We need a better way to sign up. There's a number of things I won't go into. And once we're there, once we feel like we've gotten to that point or a little bit away, we're going to go hard. After bringing in major content creators into the platform, and some of them are coin operated, some of them will understand the vision. It's just about finding the right ones. And on that side, it isn't so hard to reach these people.
00:47:51.378 - 00:48:34.446, Speaker A: I guess I'll just say that the right content creators today, they're investors, they're investing in a lot of startups. They're always thinking about what platforms are coming next and they're not going to dismiss an audience of millions of people who are young, wealthy, connected, and engage a lot. They're not going to want to miss out on that. So we're just prepping for that moment. And when the right person comes on board, yes, salana will change overnight because you're going to have like 510, 20 million people that we've never seen who are going to be engaging with NFTs in an interesting way. And a small subset of those people are going to find the rest of the ecosystem, too.
00:48:34.548 - 00:48:42.930, Speaker B: Do you think people are going to be doing that through like, phantom or backpack or is it going to need to be something easier where it's almost they don't even know that they're interacting on chain.
00:48:43.910 - 00:48:46.760, Speaker A: They're going to be doing that through the drip mobile app.
00:48:48.250 - 00:48:49.640, Speaker B: Is that live today?
00:48:50.010 - 00:48:50.854, Speaker A: No.
00:48:51.052 - 00:48:51.654, Speaker C: Okay.
00:48:51.772 - 00:48:55.670, Speaker A: It's not even announced, but we're definitely working Alpha.
00:48:58.190 - 00:49:28.690, Speaker C: So I think I'm going to ask probably one of the more annoying questions for a founder. At least if I were you, I'd be annoyed by this. So obviously you found something here and it works and it looks promising and you have big vision here, so it's only a matter of time before competitors start annoying you. And I think maybe this is priority happening to an extent. As a founder, how do you think about competition?
00:49:31.270 - 00:50:29.378, Speaker A: I've been thinking about the idea of founder paranoia because I know founders are very big companies as well. Every founder, you will never say it out loud, I would never say it that we care about competition like that. But yeah, I'm definitely always thinking, okay, what if there's a variation of this idea that's a little bit different, that's much better, right? And history is littered with things like that. Snapchat, as an example, was like a tiny derivation on 20 other mobile apps at the time, like Path and what I was building, but there's like something about the way that they built it that just was a rocket ship and everything else kind of tanks. So, yeah, I'm always thinking about it, but I'm not really sure what the question is. You just said, am I thinking about competition or concern?
00:50:29.474 - 00:50:31.720, Speaker C: How do you think about competition? What's your mental model?
00:50:32.410 - 00:51:23.910, Speaker A: Yeah, what I worry about is, just to be honest, one of the hard things about building a crypto company is every aspect of our data is public. You can't hide anything about our user growth, our numbers supply, all that kind of stuff. It's all out there, retention if you wanted to. Some user did an analysis the other day that was pretty amazing of how many of our users that receive a Drip NFT as their first transaction on Solana do other things in Solana. So it's interesting to have a warfield of people who can attack the business model just from a data perspective. And as a founder, like a venture backed founder like you, Mer, part of your job is to understand the narrative and control it to an extent. And you can't really do that in crypto.
00:51:23.910 - 00:52:18.914, Speaker A: And then there's this other thing, which is all of our users are wallets and all the wallets data is public and someone could tomorrow say, hey, this is Drip Two, and by the way, it works exactly like Drip, except we're going to give you points and we're going to give you tokens as a reward for collecting. And that AirDrop is going to happen in six months. And then we get blurred to death. Right? And we can't even stop it because all the data is in public. So the vampire attack is a very unique aspect of crypto that I definitely am thinking a lot about, but so be it. I've been around for a long time. What I hope is at least we make an impact on the industry and if we get to that point, I'll be disappointed but happy with competition.
00:52:18.962 - 00:52:25.130, Speaker B: What do you think Drip's biggest mode is? Is it maybe the relationship with creators or is it the brand.
00:52:27.070 - 00:53:15.340, Speaker A: It is right now, but long term it's going to be monetization for sure. That's the only thing that will keep creators around is if we can figure out how to get them paid consistently. But this is a hard question because it's very tempting. I posted this the other day. It's really tempting just to turn on features right now that just get them paid, but don't set us up for getting them paid over a long period of time. So we're very sensitive to that stuff, I promise, every single day we sit down and there's at least one idea that we discuss that's off the vision, but would be good for the short term and staying focused on the long term. It's hard, but it's something that we are doing.
00:53:16.830 - 00:54:03.370, Speaker C: So taking a step back while we're maybe on a meta founder and startups topic of competition, whatnot how do you think about obviously, Drip is a very distribution heavy platform. The name of the game for Drip is essentially distribution. But you also obviously worked at Nest and earlier in the episode you talked about how you learned to appreciate detail and product design and how that's influenced some of your thinking. How do you think about especially in crypto where you just said everything is like open source, people can see everything. How do you think about product versus distribution in crypto? What is just to say my most niche word again, what is your mental framework for navigating product versus distribution?
00:54:07.230 - 00:55:39.046, Speaker A: I think for pretty much everyone, there's this very famous meme in the founder world, which is like the term Product Market Fit. It's so popular that it has an acronym and everyone uses a PMF, PMF, PMF. And I've always been skeptical of that idea because most of the world's best products were created, created markets out of thin air, and there was no market for search when Google was know and those companies made that happen. So I think there's a lot more science to building companies than people think. I think Product Market Fit is like this idea that you're going to keep building your product and then one day it's going to fit some market and then things will really take off then. But in my experience so far, there is a push and pull at every moment between those two and you are kind of whittling away at both at the same time. And really great standalone products like standout products, they create markets from their existence and from the sheer power of the narrative and the comms that they produce.
00:55:39.046 - 00:56:47.520, Speaker A: And I think where a lot of founders go wrong is just building, building endlessly, wondering why nobody's showing up. But it's much more important in that spectrum to figure out how 50 or 100 people are going to love your product and building something just for them and then seeing where it goes. Product is just the easiest thing to do because you can just commit code to get every day right and you feel like you're making progress and why aren't things working? But nobody cares about what anyone is building in the world. They only think about what's fun and interesting for themselves or what's useful. My thought is, if I had to choose, I would build distribution before product. If you're a little bit more experienced, you kind of build those things together in lockstep and you try not to push one too far ahead of the other.
00:56:49.170 - 00:57:00.980, Speaker C: That's a great answer. Do you think there's an inherent difference because you've been a founder in both Web Two and Web Three now? Do you think there's an inherent difference between being a founder in Web Two and Web Three?
00:57:03.350 - 00:57:34.830, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a huge difference in a lot of ways. For sure. The biggest change for me was building in public, having to tweet all the time. I didn't tweet before I was in crypto, and I found out I was very good at it, but I'm not an influencer. I just speak English very well. That's sort of been the way that we kind of got into the ecosystem. And then the hours are very intense.
00:57:34.830 - 00:58:09.050, Speaker A: When I'm ready to sleep, most of the world is waking up. And so that's when it's most hot on Twitter, most hot on Discord, all of our kind of customer service channels. So you cannot work nine to five if you're a US. Citizen in crypto, you have to work like, ten to midnight, pretty much. And then weekends, too. You don't get weekends off because I don't think anyone in crypto understands that the builders behind these products have lives. They're very insistent.
00:58:09.050 - 00:58:44.494, Speaker A: They hold you to a high standard. I also think the investors are very different. Web two. Like raising money. I've raised over 100 million in Web two, and the discussions there are very focused on, what does this thing look like in five to seven years? I think crypto investors are very impatient. I think they want tokens, like, 90% of the VCs I met. They'll say a lot of things, but what they want is tokens.
00:58:44.494 - 00:59:18.014, Speaker A: And what they understand is having privileged access to a token supply at a low cost and being able to sell it on top of retail when they don't care about the vision as much as that stuff in some cases. And they're much younger. Everything in crypto is young. I don't know how old you are, Mert, but I think you and I are probably about the same age. Are you in your forty s? Forty s mid 30s? Mid 20s?
00:59:18.212 - 00:59:20.030, Speaker B: Yeah, 17.
00:59:20.610 - 00:59:53.202, Speaker A: Okay. Well, I mean, the hair, though. I'm definitely old for this industry, but yeah, it's super young, so I still feel weird. Like, on Twitter, I have no problem saying things that 19 year olds say. I can't do it in real life. I'm not going to be sitting here saying that's AF all that. No cap, right? I can't utter those words, but on Twitter, I'm just like, yeah, based AF.
00:59:53.356 - 01:00:08.400, Speaker B: You have a good Twitter. You have a really good Twitter. Hey, talking about VCs, I'm curious, what is the metric that you think matters most to, like, what are you watching? And then I do like this concept of, like, a hidden metric, so maybe you can't quantify I'm curious on both of those. What would you say?
01:00:09.970 - 01:01:27.240, Speaker A: We mostly been focused on Dau right now. Most of the stuff that we're kind of working on in the future is, like, focused on driving. Daily use to our website today is pretty strong because people come back to play this game we have called legendary lock in, where they can open a treasure chest once a day and lock in a low supply addition so, yeah, dau and then hidden thing. My brain right now is very wrapped up in civil stuff, so I've spent this is the hidden thing that we've been working on forever, is just like trying to control how many people want to game our system in different ways. I think in that way, we're very similar to video game companies because any video game that has a virtual economy has a lot of time and effort focused on trying to separate real from in, real from inhuman. So, yeah, there's Dau and then there's on the onboarding side. How many unique human beings are accessing Drip? Yeah, more difficult in Web three than Web two, for sure.
01:01:29.290 - 01:01:33.642, Speaker C: Gary, do you have any last questions or others? Otherwise, I'm just going to do rapid fire.
01:01:33.696 - 01:01:35.020, Speaker B: Let's do the rapid fire.
01:01:35.550 - 01:02:08.630, Speaker C: All right, let's do it. So, VIB, this is our rapid fire section. I just make up questions. I don't prepare these beforehand, and you try to answer them as quickly as you can. But obviously if some of the answers or questions require further insight or you want to dive into it, feel free. But yeah, we'll just keep it short and all right, so, okay, well, you just said you found out that you're good at Twitter. What are three tips to people listening to be better at Twitter?
01:02:11.610 - 01:02:24.650, Speaker A: Active voice, humanity. And keep your links out of the main post. Put them in the post.
01:02:24.800 - 01:02:27.130, Speaker B: Does humanity mean like, don't be a troll?
01:02:27.470 - 01:02:36.218, Speaker A: No, it means be human. Don't sound like a robot or like an advertiser. Yeah, gotcha that's.
01:02:36.234 - 01:02:41.854, Speaker C: A very important one, actually, especially in the age of AI. And you can always kind of tell who's using chat GPT and who's not.
01:02:41.892 - 01:02:42.480, Speaker A: Right.
01:02:43.990 - 01:02:46.260, Speaker C: If you weren't building Drip, what would you be building?
01:02:49.270 - 01:02:52.050, Speaker A: Probably a theme park.
01:02:53.190 - 01:02:55.750, Speaker B: Did not expect it. What type of theme park?
01:02:56.570 - 01:03:34.030, Speaker A: I don't know. The idea I think it'd be a really interesting challenge to build a modern theme park. Most theme parks today are very old. I've had this theory for a long time that you could start a blockchain centered around a theme park and build from there. Because the biggest theme parks in the world, they have cities that pop up around them. You need hospitals, you need hotels, housing for the workers, like Disney Springs, right, in Florida. And so you wanted to start a digital nation.
01:03:34.030 - 01:03:53.720, Speaker A: You can make the CenterPoint this hub of activity and fun and entertainment, and there's so many interesting rides and experiences that no one has ever built. So, yeah, unfortunately, those things cost like, billions of dollars and take a decade or more to plan. So I haven't found the time for it.
01:03:55.690 - 01:04:02.250, Speaker C: So actually, I remember you saying something about DeFi and having a controversial take on that. What are your thoughts on DeFi?
01:04:04.990 - 01:04:30.980, Speaker A: You know what, I'm going to be honest, I don't really understand it. I don't even understand what some of the terminology means. The complexity of some of these things. I don't know why anyone would care. I don't think any real person wants to swap things back and forth. Loans on chain are just a complete dead end. Everybody abuses them.
01:04:30.980 - 01:04:54.010, Speaker A: There's just no accountability there. None of the credit scores matter. None of the things that anyone's built have mattered there. So as much as the theory is very interesting, the only DeFi thing that I care about is swapping between the base layer token and USTC and pretty much nothing else. I don't think it's a scam. I just don't get it personally. Sorry.
01:04:54.080 - 01:04:55.530, Speaker C: That's fair. That's fair.
01:04:55.680 - 01:04:56.860, Speaker A: Do you get it?
01:04:58.750 - 01:05:13.890, Speaker C: I'd like to think mean, I like it. But I do agree that it is certainly not user friendly in any sense of the word so far. And obviously with somebody like you who's super focused on that part, I can see how you would think that way.
01:05:13.960 - 01:05:21.060, Speaker A: How often do you do anything with your bank in real life and do you enjoy it?
01:05:21.830 - 01:05:47.466, Speaker C: No, I don't. I do not. My biggest use for DeFi is using jupyter and I'll just mess around and do liquid staking to help secure the network and then I'll use that to get points on margin or something like that. But I do agree that it needs to be made much more accessible and have other use cases. So maybe I don't get it as much as I think I do, but I do think it's pretty fun.
01:05:47.648 - 01:05:47.994, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:48.032 - 01:06:08.386, Speaker B: For me, it's like I see use cases for maybe like 5% of the population. For example, getting access to USDC or US dollars in a nation that you can't do that I think is a valuable use case that we have right now. I also see it as something like fantasy football or right now I have friends that are betting on digital horses. I think they could use DeFi over that for at least. I know speculation may not be high.
01:06:08.408 - 01:06:49.214, Speaker A: Utility, but something that's kind of a bug, right? Because no normal person cares about what the underlying currency is. They just want to spend their dollars or their pounds or wherever they live. Right. It's just kind of an artifact of crypto that we have thousands of tokens that have wildly trading prices. I would never want my mother to swap US dollars into some random token. I don't know, like pepe and hold on to that for any reason whatsoever. That kind of stuff.
01:06:49.214 - 01:06:55.726, Speaker A: I don't know. I just feel like it's yeah, I.
01:06:55.748 - 01:07:26.426, Speaker C: Think that sort of stuff is maybe for the power user or the power dgen, whereas I think that maybe the mass appeal uses that you would actually tell your mother, hey, buy this shitcoin. I don't think that's really the use case. I think it'll be more like I don't want to say celsius or blockfly, but trading on DEXes and getting passive yield from that and stuff like that, that could be interesting if there's an intuitive layer on top of it. But as it stands currently, then I would agree with you. I don't think it's ready.
01:07:26.528 - 01:07:55.540, Speaker A: Well, let me put this I think what's very even though I don't understand it, what I think is very stupid is that people think that the chain only works if the DeFi ecosystem is working. That's an absolutely absurd concept. No, the chain works if real people want to use it for things that they care about point blank, like nothing else. TV, all that stuff. It's all made up stuff.
01:07:56.470 - 01:08:10.280, Speaker B: It's a good hot take. I think my last point on it, I think if somehow DeFi can help improve the efficiency and allocation of capital in whatever way that is, then that would be the end use case. But yeah, I think it'd be hard to argue that that is happening today.
01:08:11.610 - 01:08:22.540, Speaker C: I think what we should do is we should have VIB and somebody from Solana DeFi on here for an episode in a few weeks or a month, and they should battle up because I think you're making some solid points as.
01:08:25.310 - 01:08:49.240, Speaker A: Can'T I don't understand. Want to I wouldn't want to be in that situation. These founders are good people. I'm sure that they are building something that in their worldview makes sense. I just don't think it's going to solve the fundamental thing that we need to solve as industry, which is like convincing people like my mom, my younger brother to be interested.
01:08:50.650 - 01:09:12.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't disagree. And it's actually partly why I say we need much better marketing and messaging. Why should I care about Solana? Why should I care about order books and all this? We need to message this much better. Okay, back to rapid fire. Who's one CEO you look up to in the whole entire world in history?
01:09:12.340 - 01:09:27.186, Speaker A: Our world in history? Hmm. I'll give you a weird answer. Do you remember this company called Movie Pass?
01:09:27.368 - 01:09:28.002, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
01:09:28.056 - 01:09:28.660, Speaker C: Yes.
01:09:31.670 - 01:10:33.000, Speaker A: I thought that was such a he was he's such an interesting CEO. You can read about him sometime in his background. But I'm very taken by founders who have ideas that only work at a really massive scale. Those ideas have a lot of appeal to me because most of the time they don't work. But I'm happy to know that there are people out there who can see a problem at a very big scale and want to fix it at the highest level. For people that don't know, MoviePass is basically trying to Netflix the movie theater world where you could subscribe for a fixed fee and then go see as many movies as you wanted in theater and great idea. And they got squashed by the monopoly of the big theater companies who are all going out of business anyway.
01:10:33.000 - 01:10:38.214, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's probably the weird answer that came to my mind when you said that.
01:10:38.412 - 01:10:50.880, Speaker C: I actually use a similar service today in Canada. It's called Cineplex Plus or something. So Cineclub. So I actually like the idea talking about Netflix. What show is nobody watching that they should be watching?
01:10:51.890 - 01:11:28.470, Speaker A: Shows nobody watching that they should be watching? So my popcorn answer is my wife and I, we really enjoy the Circle. Have you seen that show? I don't know. Why? I don't know. Are a lot of people watching it? But I don't know, I just enjoy it. It's interesting to see how people behave in these weird experiments. Truthfully, since Crypto and Drip, there's just no time because at night we're working every night. So I don't have any interesting picks there, unfortunately.
01:11:29.290 - 01:11:40.230, Speaker B: What do you think about Doodles who started off as just an NFT collection? And I think now they may not even call themselves an NFT company, more of an IP company. Do you think that's a route that's going to work?
01:11:40.320 - 01:12:38.830, Speaker A: I'm pretty bearish on that category of companies because I think that sorry, you might hear my son in the background crying. There is a very binary moment in the traditional NFT world where the second that you ask the community to fund your project by buying your NFTs, your life will never be the same again. I've gotten to know a lot of NFT project founders. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy because now you have 10,000 or 4000 people that are wondering when you're going to give them return forever. And the thing is, we don't have a good mechanism for brands and IP companies to deliver value in the way that NFT holders want it based on the success of that entity. So you just end up in a point where you have these two disconnected things. I think you can build a great brand, of course you can.
01:12:38.830 - 01:13:29.600, Speaker A: But trying to tie that to something that someone paid money for as a digital asset without breaking the law right now is virtually impossible. So the thing that drives the prices on a tease is speculation and non delivery. There's no project that has delivered on the roadmap that has satisfied holders because you just can't, you can't satisfy mean, the worst thing you can do is deliver a roadmap. To be honest, that's why the very best founders, NFT founders, like the ones that have kept their price very high, they do very little. And the game for them is pushing the ball another step forward. Of course all of them will collapse at some point, but you can keep that going for a couple of years for sure. I'm not talking about anyone in particular.
01:13:31.650 - 01:13:32.960, Speaker C: How old is your son?
01:13:34.310 - 01:13:37.300, Speaker A: My son is three, my daughter is five.
01:13:38.070 - 01:13:40.850, Speaker C: How do you explain Drip to your daughter?
01:13:44.710 - 01:14:13.370, Speaker A: I haven't, but she does wander into my Zoom meetings a lot when I'm talking to artists and she really loves drawing. My son is three. He doesn't understand anything, but she likes looking at the art and she really likes the Klanos. So we have a pink dinosaur that I bought her, so sometimes she'll come and ask me if she can see it. I don't think she understands what's going on. It's just the picture for her. Right.
01:14:13.520 - 01:14:17.040, Speaker B: Does Drip have a one liner like how you describe the company?
01:14:17.970 - 01:14:21.630, Speaker A: Yeah. We say free digital gifts from your favorite creators.
01:14:23.110 - 01:14:30.660, Speaker C: Okay, two more questions other than the DeFi one, what do you think is your most controversial take that you believe is true?
01:14:33.110 - 01:15:41.210, Speaker A: None of the blockchains are worth their market caps today. I think they're all worth a very tiny fraction of what they are. Basically, blockchains get valued at the 50 year terminal valuation of that network and not anywhere based on the economics of those underlying networks. For all of the next gen blockchains, I have a deep concern about whether or not they will make enough money from the fees to pay for the cost of the network as it scales, because helios is something that kind of helps with this a little bit. But to me, the 50 biggest apps and the 50 biggest infrastructure companies built on something like Salana will all be significantly bigger than Salana itself. And this is like a flipping that no one will talk about until it happens. But that's partly because the apps aren't big enough and the infrastructure isn't big enough, but partly because all the networks are overvalued.
01:15:41.870 - 01:16:29.340, Speaker C: I actually think Anatoli feels the same way. It's a very under the radar thing, but I think you're right where the apps and the infrastructure companies will be bigger than the chain itself, and then thus they have an incentive to keep the chain going, which kind of really changes the economics and economic model of the chain. Okay, last question. So you're obviously a founder yourself, and you've founded companies before you've raised money, you've built products, you've done distribution. You've probably spent way too much time on thinking about things no human should be thinking about. As a founder, if you could compress what you've learned so far and give it as advice to aspiring startup founders or other startup founders in crypto, what would those sentences be?
01:16:33.230 - 01:17:33.950, Speaker A: Um, one, this will serve as a disclaimer for the advice. Don't listen to anybody because everybody is wrong. All the investors, some of your and most of your customers, sometimes your team members. There are so many external forces that want to exert what is good for them, even if they don't mean to. It just happens. So for a founder to go from the first time they've started a company to becoming Jeff Bezos, part of your personal process is becoming very centered in yourself and your beliefs. And I think that's just a very important thing to understand what has value to you and not let other people convince you otherwise.
01:17:33.950 - 01:18:21.688, Speaker A: And that includes me. Don't listen to me as well or anything I'm saying here. I think two, you know, most of like, a lot of a lot of a lot of what I think about is kind of this, like, global, local thing where you I'm sure you think about this too, where the stuff. That where you want to go. And the things that you have to do to get there feel very disconnected. And you want to kind of tie all those things together into a tidy narrative. But the reality is that the history is written by the winners.
01:18:21.688 - 01:19:06.670, Speaker A: And if you see outside some other company and they've told their story in this certain way, and it feels like this linear path, that's always a lie. Every company is twisting and turning and making mistakes and facing near death situations. Whether it's Facebook or it's Magic Leap, all those things have the same thing problems. And when you get to the top, then you get to tell the story how you want it. So I guess the point is, it's okay to experiment with things that don't fit the long term vision. It's okay to make mistakes. But I like the Jeff Bezos saying, which is make sure that all your doors are two ways.
01:19:06.670 - 01:20:09.890, Speaker A: This is why the Ten K NFT thing, when you have a really promising software product and they launch an NFT collection, you get very worried for them because that is a one way door, and you remove a lot of optionality for yourselves. Same with tokens, to be honest. The same thing with doing, like, an ICO and yeah, the third thing would be find an awesome, like, get a wife or or, like, a spouse, because you really it's really easy to it's really easy to get lost. In what you're doing and lose, especially in crypto, which is such a crazy I'm sure it's hard to talk to other normal people about the world that we are in, but I think having friends that are outside, having a support system, having family and a spouse that can keep you anchored in the real world is more important than ever today. So, Mert, are you single?
01:20:10.820 - 01:20:14.770, Speaker C: No, I actually, surprisingly, have a girlfriend of four years now.
01:20:15.140 - 01:20:18.396, Speaker A: That's great. Lock that down. Great decision.
01:20:18.508 - 01:20:40.360, Speaker B: Yeah. Mert, you don't want to go on a date and have to describe what an RPC provider is. Thank you so much for coming on today. I'm fired up about Drip and already seeing the traction you have today, and I'm going to wait for six months to see these floodgates open, so I am pumped. Thank you so much for coming on. This is a really good conversation.
01:20:41.040 - 01:20:51.900, Speaker A: Thank you, Garrett. Thank you, Mert. Thank you to helios for free. RPCs unlimited use. This is our running joke.
01:20:52.340 - 01:20:53.584, Speaker B: Everything's free.
01:20:53.782 - 01:20:55.680, Speaker C: You mean helium foundation.
01:20:56.020 - 01:20:57.984, Speaker A: Helium foundation. Yeah.
01:20:58.182 - 01:21:00.350, Speaker B: All right, guys, we'll see you next time.
