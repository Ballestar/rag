00:00:09.990 - 00:00:50.614, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. I'm glad for those of you who traveled, you came to New York during the best few weeks that the weather ever is here. But what we're going to talk about today is basically an announcement, sort of a new research conference and sort of a fellowship associated to it. It's, as you can see, called TLDR. The name can be workshopped a bit if people are not super happy with it. But honestly, I love it because it's easy to refer to. That's true.
00:00:50.614 - 00:01:39.720, Speaker A: Maybe that was our goal. But the idea behind this is classical conferences in crypto for research kind of treat DeFi as the abandoned stepchild. It maybe is a workshop where they have a section with two or three papers, but they don't have a venue that really focuses on the latest innovations. Almost all the papers are like old things that have happened. And then also, most of these conferences don't have D five forward reviewers. They don't kind of have things that are favorable, let's say. So I think I spent a bunch of time talking with a bunch of people about our gripes and also things that we would like to see in the world.
00:01:39.720 - 00:01:49.210, Speaker A: How do we take the best of things like SBC, FC, Xerx Park and put them together for DFI?
00:01:54.240 - 00:02:51.644, Speaker B: Yeah, so as part of this, we're going to have a fellowship and grants of up to $50,000 as well, just to kind of spur research in this ecosystem. And then also introducing a yearly conference in New York that'll probably be around spring next year. And this, again is going to be kind of an East Coast DeFi focused conference. There's going to be two tracks for both the conference and for the fellowships. One is going to be theoretical research, but we're also going to give both grants and space at the conference for applied work or implementation of things that people have maybe worked on research but haven't really been implemented in a real way yet. And of course, anything in DeFi is fair game. So everything from dex design to governance of DeFi protocols, auctions, of course, of course.
00:02:51.644 - 00:03:14.210, Speaker B: Anything around MEB. A lot of the stuff that is here today and fee markets and more, it so applications for the fellowship and the grants open this summer, but please sign up for our email list to stay up to date on kind of the timing of the conference, information regarding the grants, and so on. Thank you.
