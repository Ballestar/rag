00:00:05.754 - 00:00:24.780, Speaker B: How the hell would I know? It could be three years. It could be 15 years. We could get that AI. Winter I was hoping for, and it could be 16 years. I'm not really seeing 50 without some kind of giant civilizational catastrophe. And to be clear, whatever civilization arises after that would probably, I'm guessing, end up in stuck in just the same trap we are.
