00:00:00.250 - 00:00:19.534, Speaker A: Why did Bankless decide to have WorldCoin on? Well, it's a huge project. My intention of the WorldCoin episode was hey, Bankless nation. Here's an episode with Sam Altman. Discuss amongst yourselves. And then I get back like, Bankless, why the f did you host these people? And I'm like, I guess I got the vibe wrong. I could have been more critical. I don't know.
00:00:19.534 - 00:00:37.620, Speaker A: I'm asking for forgiveness. Are you really? I guess. And then there was also the critique that's like, oh, yeah, Sam Altman and Wordcoin paid Bankless to co on the podcast. Well, I take offense to that. I take offense to that one. That one? Yeah, they need to apologize for that one. Bankless has never and will never, ever take money for content.
