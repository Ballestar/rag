00:00:00.250 - 00:00:20.730, Speaker A: Is ledger safe. That is the hardware device that we're talking about. So Ledger introduced a new product called Ledger Recover, which lets you recover your seed phrase using your ID, which for the normies of the world was probably they're like, nice, great, love that. That's what I'm used to for the crypto hardliners out there. We don't want nation state IDs to be our recovery process. You subscribe to this ledger. Recover.
00:00:20.730 - 00:00:43.410, Speaker A: Your device, asks you, hey, do you want to do this thing? And you're like, yes. The ledger takes your seed phrase, shards it into three, encrypts it, and then sends it outbound to these three custodians of your sharded private key. And then if you lose your seed phrase, your nation state ID can get you your seed phrase back. The idea of software being able to pull out your seed phrase is very concerning because that is the point of a hardware wallet.
