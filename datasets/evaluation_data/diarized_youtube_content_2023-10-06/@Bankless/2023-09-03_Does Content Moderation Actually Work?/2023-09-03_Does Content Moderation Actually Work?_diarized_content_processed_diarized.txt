00:00:00.170 - 00:00:23.662, Speaker A: I've been very consistently skeptical of what we now call the content moderation regime, the thought that platforms should be arbiters of truth. To be clear, I am not a free speech absolutist. I think they should be able to ban or hyperviolent content. I've always been skeptical of it for two reasons. One, as someone who's been inside the machine and opened dashboards in which the numbers are all in the billions, I just felt it was impractical. You just wouldn't be able to do it at scale in every country in the world. It just wouldn't be possible.
00:00:23.662 - 00:00:50.140, Speaker A: And then secondly, even assuming you had some regime that sort of did it at some point, it would be ideologically captured by one side or the other. I'm not necessarily pointing figures to one side of the political spectrum, but there would be a contingent that says, you know what? This is actually good speech, this is bad speech, and it would be difficult to apply anything like an objective standard to it. And that, frankly, in my opinion, is what's happened, right? Like, ask yourselves this are politics less polarized now that facebook is the arbiter of truth? Are we better? Right? It sucks. It's a terrible idea, and it's not good, and it's not successful. And it's been a complete as.
