00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.622, Speaker A: Take, for example, a desert island of ten people, and they all find themselves there. No help is coming. If six of the people all raised their hands and voted for those six people to rule the four, I think most people would have a problem with that. They'd be like, Why did the six of you get to rule the four? But that's just democracy. If you cast it like with men and women, then it becomes even more visceral. Let's say there's four women and six men. To what degree do those six men have the right to do whatever they want to the women just because they outnumber them? Right? I think they don't have any right to do anything to the women.
00:00:27.622 - 00:00:39.940, Speaker A: It doesn't matter if a vote is taken to violate them. And to me, that seems obvious on the example of the desert island. But somehow when you expand it from ten people to 350,000,000, most throw that idea out the window and they think anything that is democratically voted is fine.
