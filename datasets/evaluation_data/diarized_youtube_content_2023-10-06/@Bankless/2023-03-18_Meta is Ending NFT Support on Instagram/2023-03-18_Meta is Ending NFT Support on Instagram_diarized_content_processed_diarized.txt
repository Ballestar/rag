00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.098, Speaker A: Meta is ending. NFT support on instagram.
00:00:03.194 - 00:00:03.546, Speaker B: Meta?
00:00:03.578 - 00:00:03.962, Speaker A: Dude.
00:00:04.026 - 00:00:04.494, Speaker B: What?
00:00:04.612 - 00:00:11.546, Speaker A: You just deployed this? We're winding down digital collectibles to focus on other ways to support creators. I'm disappointed.
00:00:11.578 - 00:00:12.398, Speaker B: By this.
00:00:12.564 - 00:00:17.054, Speaker A: I mean, they got in at the top and they're leaving at the bottom. Tourists leave.
00:00:17.092 - 00:00:24.978, Speaker B: Settlers stay. That's all I gotta say. Like they said, looking forward to support. Yeah, who using Instagram and Facebook to amplify their work? But you just took away the feature.
00:00:25.034 - 00:00:25.494, Speaker A: Sure.
00:00:25.612 - 00:00:27.890, Speaker B: They support you, though. Like, morally.
