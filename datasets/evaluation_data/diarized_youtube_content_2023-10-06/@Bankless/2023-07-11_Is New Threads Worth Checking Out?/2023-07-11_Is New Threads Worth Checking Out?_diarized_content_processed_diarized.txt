00:00:00.170 - 00:00:00.942, Speaker A: Is Threads worth.
00:00:00.996 - 00:00:09.674, Speaker B: Checking out for? Me personally, I'm really waiting for a Web three Twitter replacement. I'm not so excited about another centralized company. So you switch from Elon to Zuckerberg?
00:00:09.722 - 00:00:25.382, Speaker A: Like, wow. Twitter's been going downhill since Musk bought it. And then Threads comes along. But can it actually peel people away from Twitter? I actually don't think so, because it gives me Google Plus vibes. I don't know if people remember Google Plus. It got shut down eventually because it just didn't really do anything good. As much as, like, Threads has that massive head stuff.
00:00:25.382 - 00:00:27.780, Speaker A: It's literally a Twitter clone. It doesn't offer anything new.
