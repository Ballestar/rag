00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.182, Speaker A: The BlackRock submission of the Ishares paperwork for a spot bitcoin ETF. BlackRock is the closest thing to the government, while also not being the government, it's an extension of the government itself. And so the people with the conspiracy hat on are saying, like Gary Gensler and the SEC were just hammering the crypto native companies, right? The winklevoss. ETF denied. Right? Like all of the other crypto native ETF proposals denied. The claim is that they were just biding their time for some of the bigger players to come in. And it's just interesting that Fidelity, Citadel, BlackRock all seem to come into crypto at once.
00:00:32.182 - 00:00:34.770, Speaker A: And so just the timing on this is curious.
