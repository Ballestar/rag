00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.482, Speaker A: The problem with this uncertainty that hangs over just about everyone who's developing a protocol is they don't know whether there's going to be a knock at their door from the SEC about what they've done. The SEC has created the incentive for people to go offshore. This is terrible. It's terrible because America loses the opportunity to have its leadership role in this space. When they go offshore, they're going to go to a place that has a very lax regulatory environment. End customers are going to experience the kind of things that we've seen at FTX. So at all levels, this is a disaster.
00:00:30.482 - 00:00:46.020, Speaker A: This is why Congress needs to step in, provide the guardrails, create the clarity, and let the regulators, which may or may not be the SEC, but let whoever we authorize through legislation, objectively enforce the law and provide that certainty. It would be so helpful for this whole space.
