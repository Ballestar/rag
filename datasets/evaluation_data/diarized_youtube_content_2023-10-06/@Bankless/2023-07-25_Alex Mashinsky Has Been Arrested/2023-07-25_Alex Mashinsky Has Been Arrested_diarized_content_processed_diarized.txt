00:00:00.090 - 00:00:19.934, Speaker A: Alex Machinsky, one of the big great scammers of 2022, has been arrested on fraud and a bunch of other charges. And I want to pull out this take from Nick Carter in November of 2022. He says if we can't purge the 3 hours capitol Boys, SBF, Machinsky and Quan, we don't deserve to move on as an industry. And today, Alex Machinsky is arrested on.
00:00:19.972 - 00:00:21.242, Speaker B: Fraud and all these other charges.
00:00:21.306 - 00:00:25.986, Speaker A: Just over halfway through 2023. Kwan is in jail in Montenegro. Sam Bankman Fried.
00:00:26.018 - 00:00:26.786, Speaker B: Is under house arrest.
00:00:26.818 - 00:00:31.074, Speaker A: Machinsky's going to jail. Suzu and Kyle Davies are still on the run. They can't step anywhere.
00:00:31.122 - 00:00:32.566, Speaker B: Outside of Dubai, otherwise they would be.
00:00:32.588 - 00:00:34.850, Speaker A: Arrested. I say that we have permission to be bullish.
