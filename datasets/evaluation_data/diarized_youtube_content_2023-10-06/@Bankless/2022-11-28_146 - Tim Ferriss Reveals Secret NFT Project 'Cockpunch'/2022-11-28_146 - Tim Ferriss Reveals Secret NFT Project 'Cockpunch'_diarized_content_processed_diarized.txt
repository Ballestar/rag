00:00:02.810 - 00:00:37.986, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more Bankless. Tim Ferriss is on the podcast. He's an award winning writer podcaster with almost a billion downloads and a life hacker. He's here to give us his perspective on on crypto NFTs, and also to drop some alpha on his newest project, a project that very much involves crypto, and I think so does david is going to take the world by storm.
00:00:37.986 - 00:01:13.998, Speaker A: A few things to look for in this episode. Number one, is Tim all in on crypto? Now we ask him that question. What does he think of crypto? Tim has an interesting perspective as both an insider in the space and an outsider. A little bit of both. Number two, Tim's been head down full time on a secret NFT project for the last year or so, and it's got a bizarre name. What's this project about? When is it going to launch? Why has he spent the last year of his life on this project? We're going to talk about that in the project itself, which has a really cool approach I don't think we've seen in crypto so far. And number three, turns out Tim Ferriss had some money on FTX.
00:01:13.998 - 00:01:33.690, Speaker A: Dave and I asked him some questions toward the end of the episode about how to cope, how to deal with that type of loss, and how he moves on moving forward. Some excellent advice at the end of this episode, so make sure you stay tuned for that. David, without revealing too much about the NFT project, we'll leave that for Tim. What should listeners know going to this episode?
00:01:34.030 - 00:02:20.570, Speaker B: I think listeners should really pay attention to why Tim feels motivated to do an NFT project. And what about NFTs has captured Tim's mind. And the thing I'm really happy about is that what we're seeing here is NFTs, the technology unlocking some creative energy out of a huge, high performance individual. And listeners should know going into this episode that Tim has found a way to express himself as a creative individual, and he's using of his own volition NFTs to get that done. This is not your typical NFT drop. This is not Tim coming in and doing an NFT PFP thing. He has created a whole entire universe, and he's using NFTs as a technology to get that done.
00:02:20.570 - 00:03:06.662, Speaker B: So I think this is going to be an interesting, just like, unpacking of somebody using NFTs to just do something that they want to do. And so that being the context, I think people might appreciate what he's up to in this NFT world. Further on into the show, we spend about 45 minutes, the first 45 minutes of the show, circling the NFT project. That shall not be named just getting context and getting Tim's history. But then at some point, we just explicitly say, hey, Tim. Okay, what are the details at that moment in time? If you have kids or other sensitive ears on the show, you might suggest skipping over that part, because as you can tell from the title of this episode, it's not entirely appropriate. But I had a fun time and Ryan and I were laughing our butts off, and so you probably will too.
00:03:06.796 - 00:03:26.590, Speaker A: And of course, David and I give our full insights into the episode in an episode after the episode we call the Debrief, which is available for Premium Bankless subscribers. If you are a premium Bankless subscriber, you can access that on the Premium RSS feed. If you're not, click a link in the show notes, become one, and get access to that RSS feeds. All sorts of goodies for you.
00:03:26.660 - 00:03:31.278, Speaker B: I'm sure we're going to be saying some bad words on The Debrief as well.
00:03:31.444 - 00:03:37.314, Speaker A: All right, guys, we're going to get right to the episode with Tim Ferriss, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.

If you've been listening to Bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis, the idea that Blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution, fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the Web Three world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language Sway, and a supportive tool chain called Fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like validity, while adopting the improvements made by the Rust tooling ecosystem, letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM.

00:06:15.854 - 00:06:47.374, Speaker A: IO bankless nation I could not be more excited about this conversation we're about to have with Tim Ferriss. Tim is a five time New York Times bestselling author. Award winning podcaster. With over 900 million downloads that's creeping up to a billion, bankless has some work to do to catch up. David and he's also a prolific angel investor. He's on the cusp of talking about a secret NFT project, doing a drop here. Didn't know he was a crypto guy, but maybe he is.
00:06:47.374 - 00:06:52.366, Speaker A: We're going to discuss that and what he has planned for this drop. Tim. Welcome to Bagless. How you doing, man?
00:06:52.468 - 00:06:55.486, Speaker D: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me. Thrilled to be here.
00:06:55.668 - 00:07:14.006, Speaker A: We are thrilled to have you too. So both Dave and I were just talking. I think you got him into cooking, I think you got me into the four hour work week lifestyle. There can be something outside of the grind that society prescribes to you. So we appreciate thanks.
00:07:14.188 - 00:07:21.000, Speaker D: Oh, well, I appreciate you guys, man. Without readers, I'm not here. So I really appreciate it.
00:07:21.690 - 00:07:38.400, Speaker A: So I want to start with this question. Maybe it's on people's mind as they're going to this episode on Bankless with Tim Ferriss. Wait, is Tim a crypto guy? Now, I don't know that you have to be, but there's some kind of tribe affiliation, I guess. But describe your relationship with crypto. Are you a crypto guy?
00:07:40.210 - 00:08:45.380, Speaker D: I mean, there are some very technical, very deep experts in crypto. So I would say I'll put it this way. I began acquiring crypto in late 2012, early 2013. So I have been, I suppose, on the playing field for a decent stretch of time and continued to be engaged pretty heavily all the way through the let's just call it 2017 excitement. 2015 to 17 excitement and have stayed in. And then on the art side, I have been engaged, very deeply engaged with art, broadly speaking, since I was a kid. I wanted to be a comic book pencilr for about a decade and actually got paid as an illustrator through part of college, worked in various illustration and graphic design capacities all the way through college.
00:08:45.380 - 00:09:23.310, Speaker D: Digital art entered the scene for me when I moved to Silicon Valley and was trying to support a number of digital comic book startups. The tech wasn't quite there, but I collected comic books as a kid and still have all of my thousands of comic books polybagged and backed to this day. Digital art, as we're talking about it, probably entered the scene for me early 2021. And I owe Kevin Rose. Thanks for that. Also, Katie Hahn. So Katie Hawn had a tutorial for me on my podcast.
00:09:23.310 - 00:09:44.150, Speaker D: And then simultaneously Kevin started talking to me about, I guess both some of the early days with respect to NFTs on the ethereum blockchain, and then things went from there. So I have collected and I've been engaged with crypto and blockchain since late 2012, early 2013.
00:09:44.730 - 00:10:14.990, Speaker B: So what Ryan was trying to do right there and what I want to continue to do is everyone in crypto has kind of their archetype, their category. So I'm getting a sense of that. Not necessarily a crypto guy, but as soon as NFTs came on the scene, NFTs perhaps resonated with you a lot more. And that's really what we thought of 2021, is NFTs as a technology arrived and all of a sudden it brought in a lot more people. And it sounds like that it brought you in in that particular because of NFTs.
00:10:15.070 - 00:11:25.346, Speaker D: Is that right? I did. I would say NFTs were of interest to me and the technology layers were of interest to. So I've been engaged with that and Kevin and I always test, I shouldn't say always, but frequently test early tech. And what interested me about NFTs was, number one, I could see it being a huge catalyst for both established artists and would be artists to generate a lot of art and do a lot of experiments. So that was extremely exciting to me. Number two, JPEGs, pretty JPEGs are a very easy gateway drug and onboarding ramp to get normies involved with blockchain technologies without bludgeoning them with really difficult technical details. So I saw it also as an easy way to open the end of the funnel to get more people who are non technical muggles like myself involved with all these technologies.
00:11:25.346 - 00:11:32.874, Speaker D: So that was the primary interest, I suppose. Those were the converging lines that pulled me in.
00:11:32.992 - 00:12:04.100, Speaker B: So inside of the NFT world, there's also like two kinds of people, right? There are some people who are bullish on NFTs because of the broad general potential that it has to change a lot of the monetization model of the Internet. It's like an investable category. It's an investable industry. And then there's other people who are like actual artists who just see NFTs as a way to monetize their art. It's just a tool for them to enable them to do the things that they do. Do you resonate with one out of one persona more than the other?
00:12:04.630 - 00:13:02.920, Speaker D: I would say I'm a boundary walker here, and that may come up later. There's a great book called Trickster Makes this World or Makes the World by Lewis Hyde that I highly suggest to people but talks about these trickster, archetypes, Coyote, Raven, et cetera as boundary walkers. And I identify with that on a whole lot of levels. And here that's also the case. So I am interested in NFTs. Broadly speaking, could they replace car titles? Could they replace? Let's just say shipping around various collectibles, whereby you could have I'm making this up. But a wine collection that is enormous, that is stored in one place and people can buy and sell and trade these items using NFTs in a verifiable way, including all of the possibilities for primary and then secondary sales, royalties and so on.
00:13:02.920 - 00:13:38.660, Speaker D: I am also bullish on the artistic side. If secondaries and royalties can be sustained, if there's a race to the bottom and I understand the marketplace dynamics and the economic incentives and market share drivers that apply pressure downward on all these things, then the artists disappear. That's just a foregone conclusion. So I would say TBD on that. But I'm interested in both, for sure.
00:13:39.670 - 00:14:08.906, Speaker A: What's really interesting, Tim, about your story so far is it's kind of similar to Kevin's, right? It's like when we've talked to Kevin on the podcast a couple of times, this is Kevin Rose, of course, he's talked about, I've been in crypto for a while, but I didn't really I mean, it was okay. It was cool. I respect the technology, but I wasn't one of the money crypto type people. I was interested in Bitcoin, but the Use case didn't really appeal to me. Why? Because I have a bank account and it kind of works okay. And I don't still pretty hard to.
00:14:08.928 - 00:14:10.230, Speaker D: Buy coffee with Bitcoin.
00:14:10.310 - 00:14:46.102, Speaker A: Right? You still can't do that. And so for know, I think you said before, even though he was sort know, in from the very beginnings, it didn't capture his attention. He didn't go fully down the rabbit hole. For David and myself, it's probably a little different in that we're very excited about the Money application of crypto. But even more broadly, we think of this as like it's digital property rights for the internet, exactly. Like, wow, what did we just create? And so Money is just one app on this digital property rights system. But the whole idea of social reorganization here around things that you can value on the internet is super cool anyway.
00:14:46.102 - 00:15:10.638, Speaker A: It feels like you're kind of in the camp of coming at it from like you're interested in these applications, but you didn't go full in Body and Soul until you saw this really cool way that creators are using the medium in this fantastic way. And that's why, by the way, I know we're going to talk about your project, but it's an artist talking about this project and that's why you're in it. But yeah, what do you have to say on that?
00:15:10.724 - 00:16:19.202, Speaker D: Well, what I was going to say is that I've dabbled in DeFi, for instance, and I'm very fascinated by it, but it's not a core area of expertise for me. Finance, to begin with. Financial instruments, derivatives, et cetera, are not a core competency of mine. I mean, I'm not completely financially illiterate, but I am not a finance person and therefore I tended to stay on the edges of that. I did experiment and I've used my own money, but I didn't go whole hog. I didn't feel confident enough to do that. Whereas NFTs and more broadly and we'll talk about this, probably, but once you start to expand and look at the potential of, say, storytelling and having various layers that intertwine one layer of which or one component of which is artwork, then we start to get very quickly into a Ven diagram of overlapping strengths and core competencies of mine.
00:16:19.202 - 00:17:17.974, Speaker D: And that, I think, is what has kept me up so many sleepless nights with hairbrained ideas, I think some amazing ideas. I just can't fucking sleep. Yeah, it's been the story of the last, I don't know, let's call it nine to twelve months, and I would just wake up in the middle of the night laughing, and I would have to at the time, turn to my girlfriend and just say, she'd be like, what are you laughing about? And I'd be like, you know what I'm laughing about? And she'd be like, oh God, here we go once again. And that's exciting to me right there's bad insomnia, and I suppose any insomnia, if it's night after night after night, ultimately gets bad, but there's bad insomnia where it's stress, anxiety, and then for me there's this physiological quickening that is good insomnia where you just can't stop the ideas from coming. Related to some project you're really excited about.
00:17:18.012 - 00:17:20.102, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds like you got bit by the bug.
00:17:20.246 - 00:17:36.560, Speaker D: Yeah, I got bitten by the bug. And I also had a number of bugs from Christmas past, meaning these latent passions that I have had for a very long time that also woke up and bit me in the ass in a good way.
00:17:37.490 - 00:17:52.434, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really cool. Another piece of this, because I know you've had many people from Crypto on your podcast before, right? So you've had Katie Hahn you mentioned, right. I think you did an episode with Chris Dixon and maybe it was also.
00:17:52.472 - 00:17:54.420, Speaker D: People like Vitalik has been on.
00:17:55.110 - 00:18:54.294, Speaker A: So you've definitely heard the crypto perspective for a long time. But this is the thing that got you in. I'm also kind of looking for like, maybe one thing about bankless and I think about people who are crypto. So Dave and I have been bitten by the bug for a while and it was DeFi and money and reorganizing the Internet. But that can lead to a silo, right? That can lead to we have this bubble around us of permables, even in the wake of what just happened. Tim, like FTX and all of that, we're like, this is good for know because, like, it promotes decentralization. But I'm curious kind of your perspective as you're sort of this boundary walker, as you say, can you get us in the head of some of the things that give you trepidation about entering here? Because I sense that when I was hearing you and Kevin talk about it on the Proof podcast, I could get the sense that there were some qualifiers from Tim.
00:18:54.294 - 00:19:10.010, Speaker A: You're like, it's this type of NFT, but it's not this. And I don't want to make promises and guarantees and the speculative thing, it felt like to me you didn't want to be associated with the Scam element of crypto, which I totally understand, or maybe I'm reading things into it, but tell me about your trepidations.
00:19:10.770 - 00:20:27.862, Speaker D: Totally. I would say with respect to the many caveats that I gave in the Proof podcast with Kevin, it's not so much that I don't want to be associated with the scam elements. I'm not too worried about that, at least for anyone who has followed me for any period of time, I'm not worried about that. But I don't want people to buy my pretty JPEGs as investments and who knows what the future may hold, but ultimately I want people to view engaging with this as entertainment. All right, would you take your two kids to Disney World? Does that cost a few hundred bucks? Great. Will you potentially get that much entertainment out of this? Or two trips to Disney World, maybe? Or if you go to a Broadway show, how much does that cost with a few people? Or two nice dinners are you going to get? Or three nice dinners? Like, do I think I can deliver that much entertainment for people that will not provide necessarily a financial return? I think that's a healthy way for me to approach this rather than what a lot of people do, which is pump, pump, pump to the moon. This is going to be amazing.
00:20:27.862 - 00:21:21.714, Speaker D: Oh, my God. Take out a fourth mortgage, sell your car, forego your kids college tuition. This is going to be a thousand bagger. I don't want to in any way imply that I can predict the future. And certainly I don't think a lot of people could have predicted this past week with FTX. Some people perhaps had a window into the possibilities, but very few people who we would assume are tracking the space incredibly closely could have predicted anything like this with any type of precise time frame, right? And I do think there are a bunch of ways that this could be good long term for a lot of ecosystems that we're all involved with. But the caveats I would say sort of lead into and the hesitations come in a few different forms.
00:21:21.714 - 00:22:54.370, Speaker D: On a personal level, I will say that, let me rephrase that a lot of what was old is now once new again in the sense that people are people. Human nature is human nature and money is money on some level. And therefore we're going to see a lot of the same bad behavior that we saw in the nondigital financial markets before there was regulation or let's just say some degree of competent regulation and there are many forms this bad behavior can take. Let's just say we're going back to before any type of centralized banking where people were stuffing dollars under mattresses and putting gold bars under their floorboards. What happens? People get robbed, right? As one example. And therefore there is a part of me and this is probably going to upset a lot of people listening so I'll ask for forgiveness in advance. But there's definitely part of me that operates along the lines of thinking would I rather have Amazon see all of my purchase histories or would I rather the entire internet see all of my purchase histories? There's definitely part of me that's more comfortable with Amazon with lots of regulation, lots of internal rules, lots of policy, lots of I know internal yet centralized technology having a window into that.
00:22:54.370 - 00:23:58.140, Speaker D: And I do know people who have had wrench attacks attempted on them. And for those who don't know, it's really cheap hack. It's a $5 wrench or a crowbar and using the threat of physical violence or real physical violence or the threat of physical violence against someone you care about to extract in this case say crypto or assets that are denominated in crypto. So I am wary on some level of being my own bank. Now, it doesn't mean I will never do it. But I do think there are some risks that for a lot of people are very abstract and low likelihood for a lot of people the likelihood of them getting scammed or having their wallet drained is maybe the same likelihood of having a shark attack, getting their leg bitten off by a great white. For me or for anyone who's public facing, I think the risk is actually pretty high and therefore I'm very careful about it.
00:23:58.140 - 00:25:19.780, Speaker D: I do think there will be decentralized options that are very attractive for some people and there will be more centralized or maybe sort of medium sized centralized options that are more appealing for others. Some of my hesitations are from a security standpoint when concerns like this go from abstract for a lot of people to real, right? I've had death threats, I've had people come to conferences with guns threatening to kill me, I've had bomb threats, I've had stalkers, I've had to escalate things to the FBI. Once those types of things happen to you and your house is full of guns and so on, you just think about security risks a little differently. So those are some of my hesitations. Beyond that I would say it's primarily like look and this doesn't relate to my project necessarily, but Web Three and DFI and all of these things, crypto in general from a personal level I think about security a lot, right, multi SIG, everything you can imagine. And then on the project side, I do not want people with poor impulse control or who have somehow become intoxicated with the space to view this as an investment. I just think that's a terrible, terrible, terrible idea.
00:25:19.780 - 00:25:46.986, Speaker D: Doesn't mean it couldn't go up. It might, but there's also a chance this thing goes to zero. You can't tell in these markets and with so many not only micro factors involved but macro factors that even I mean I know a lot of top investors globally, including some of the top macro guys in the world. It is hard for them to place bets right now. Very challenging. So ted talk complete.
00:25:47.168 - 00:26:27.880, Speaker A: Thanks for like that makes sense, jim and I kind of get you on the money use case, right? So I think two things you emphasize that crypto hasn't yet solved one is like on chain privacy that's just not trackable and traceable and it really hasn't solved that. So if that's a use case that's important to you, crypto really hasn't solved that in the money realm. And then the other is good. Kind of like smart contract wallet multi SIG so that you are more immune from wrench attack where you have some sort of social recovery that's maybe like a piece of your keys with a lawyer and five other people. So that it's just like you can't be wrenched attacked something like this. But we're not there yet either. I think that's coming.
00:26:27.880 - 00:27:29.206, Speaker A: The other piece I guess I wanted to talk about though is I really respect and get from a creator's perspective that you are playing the long game and always have and so what I see in you and what I hear in you is you want to over deliver for your community anything that Tim Ferriss creates. You want to deliver more value than it costs people, right? And so that's why you don't want people to lose money, you don't want to over promise things. In fact, what I hear from you often about this project that we're about to talk about in a little bit is a downplay of just like this thing could go to zero. Like don't buy it. But let me ask you this question because this is key at some level, tim, isn't it out of your hands once this thing goes to market? That is the thing with DeFi that's the feature and the good and the bad, which is like Tim Ferriss can say all know Tim Ferriss is tweeting this NFT is overvalued. Don't buy it. This is absolutely ludicrous.
00:27:29.206 - 00:27:36.286, Speaker A: These prices don't believe me. And then somebody goes and was like, oh, Tim's downplaying it. That makes me so bullish right now. And they bid up the price higher.
00:27:36.388 - 00:27:38.158, Speaker B: How do you said the word buy?
00:27:38.324 - 00:28:24.240, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm bullish. Don't buy this. What I heard was buy. Yes, it is out of my control. Absolutely. It's 100% out of my control. Really all I want to be able to do what I really hope I don't get, and there probably will be some of these where people are like, I just took out this loan or used my last few dollars to buy this JPEG and I really hope A, B and C, right? And if it doesn't go well I know this is like the anti sales pitch, but look, I'm trying to create something awesome, to be very clear, right? I think I've already created something that is actually pretty amazing.
00:28:24.240 - 00:28:53.442, Speaker D: I'm very happy about happy with it and proud of it. But if it doesn't go well and then someone's like, oh my God, my life is in shambles. I want to be able to point back to at least me very publicly saying do not buy this unless you have 100 X the cost of this in your savings. 1000 x the cost of this in your savings. Right. Do not buy it at all, period. And do not view it as an investment, period.
00:28:53.442 - 00:29:27.470, Speaker D: Full stop. I want to be able to point back to me publicly saying that so that I at least feel like I've done what I can control. And that's just the messaging in the beginning, but yeah, once it goes to market, it's totally out of my hands with bots and day traders and whatever. I know people are going to come in to trade, but I want to feel like I have been as ethical and moral in how I've presented this thing at the outset.
00:29:27.550 - 00:29:30.082, Speaker A: Yeah. You want a clean conscience here.
00:29:30.216 - 00:30:01.146, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. And to your point, I'm also playing the long game, right? I want to be creating more art for a very, very long time. So yes. And for those who don't know me, I've been in the game for a while now, right? First book came out, 2007, five books. And like you said, the podcast close to a billion downloads. Now 600, 700 episodes. I've lost count.
00:30:01.146 - 00:30:09.374, Speaker D: Something like that. So I have been in the game for a while and I plan to be in the game for a long time.
00:30:09.492 - 00:30:16.660, Speaker B: So we're kind of circling around the details of this drop and I think we'll continue to circle at least for a little bit more because I got some more questions.
00:30:17.110 - 00:30:19.700, Speaker D: I love the tease, the foreplay is great.
00:30:20.230 - 00:30:51.174, Speaker B: One of the questions I have for you is like. Well, when you commit to making an NFT, a token is a financial asset. And so whether or not you intend on people investing in these things, the choice to make a financial asset is a choice. And so we'll kind of unpack what the utility of making these things into tokens unlocks. But we'll kick that one down the road because I still have some other what questions I want to get to. Something you said earlier resonated with me. I want you to unpack it a little like NFTs and tokens are really just like form factors.
00:30:51.174 - 00:31:31.850, Speaker B: They're just vehicles for expression. And when I see Tim Ferriss, I see a guy who really wants to express himself. If you look at your body of work, it's a bunch of different books across a variety of spectrums, like optimizations, biomechanics, bioengineering, like workplace, how to work a full job inside of 4 hours. And that's aside from all the podcast cooking. Tim is a super creative guy. And that's aside from all the artistic side, right? The drawing, the graphic design. And so I've always thought of NFTs as these new form factors to help artistic expression, cultural output.
00:31:31.850 - 00:31:42.640, Speaker B: And I'm wondering if that's also what you see and how you see NFTs and the intersection of just like cultural expression. Is that what NFTs are doing for you? And is that what you're trying to do with this project?
00:31:43.410 - 00:31:53.970, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm almost curious what your NFT portfolio looks like. A little bit like not portfolio. I'm using the wrong word, right? That's a stupid finance word. What does your collection look like?
00:31:54.120 - 00:32:52.580, Speaker D: Yeah, well, let's see. So on the creative expression side of the questions, I would say yes and yes. What's most exciting to me in my circle of friends about NFTs, I mean, there are people who've done extremely well financially and that's great, but these are generally people who are already doing pretty well financially. You can only eat so many M ms. So that's not in and of itself very interesting. What's interesting in my circle of friends is musicians, graphic artists, designers who during COVID through NFTs were able to make a living and put food on the table and sock away some savings, maybe actually continue to make art, even though they had to cancel touring with an ongoing royalty stream from art they were producing. That's interesting.
00:32:52.580 - 00:33:55.298, Speaker D: All of a sudden these folks who had maybe been dominantly in one medium were suddenly creating pieces that were multimedia for the first time and they were collaborating with people they never would have collaborated with otherwise, meeting people they never would have met otherwise. That is exciting. Just from the potential of some type of this is going to be maybe a strong statement, but some type of creative Cambrian explosion of sorts, where you have all of these emergent life forms and creative art forms that you couldn't have predicted otherwise or couldn't have predicted, period. And then on the collection side of things. I have a, I think, beautiful collection of NFTs and it's mostly inexpensive stuff or moderately priced stuff because I do not trade. I've never sold NFT aside from my own, which they're all JPEGs because there's.
00:33:55.314 - 00:33:59.580, Speaker B: Like music NFTs, there's like gifts. But like, JPEGs is mostly your yeah.
00:34:00.670 - 00:34:41.250, Speaker D: I do have music as well. But in this case I'm talking about visual, right? Like you can see behind me, I care about the visual. It's arts all over my house and it's also mostly expensive. And the reason for that is, number one, I don't trade. The only NFT I have sold is actually one I've sold through Grails and Kevin Rose, which was my first ever published fiction short story, which was part of the Grails season one. But of my personal collection, I've never sold anything. And I would say a few that come to mind for me that I really have enjoyed.
00:34:41.250 - 00:35:39.590, Speaker D: Meridians, I think, are stunning. Some of them in particular, the ones that have ended up looking something like Chinese watercolor landscape paintings are just, I think mesmerizing Clonex caught my attention very early and opened my mind and my eyes to what could be potentially done with 3D art and me bits prior to that. But I don't own any mibits and there are many others. They are almost entirely things that pass a sniff test for me. And this is going to sound so primitive, the sniff test is, would I ever take this and blow it up to several feet by several feet and stick it on a wall in my house where I look at it every day? Would I do that? Yes or no? Pass or fail?
00:35:40.090 - 00:35:46.054, Speaker B: Tim, do you know that I have a five foot by five foot crypto punk blown up on my wall in my apartment?
00:35:46.102 - 00:36:09.022, Speaker D: Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, that's a great example. Crypto punks. I mean, look, larva labs and just from an innovation perspective and guys who have set trends in motion that were never maybe intended to be trends. Holy shit. I mean, they've done amazing, amazing work. So I track what they do, but those would be a few examples.
00:36:09.022 - 00:36:11.298, Speaker D: It's all stuff that I like to look at.
00:36:11.464 - 00:36:22.614, Speaker A: So it's all visual for you, Tim. You're not like looking at the community or are you also doing, I don't know, investigation on the like, whether artists or is it purely just the like?
00:36:22.652 - 00:36:40.762, Speaker D: I like this studied I've I've studied a lot of the artists and have been lucky enough to spend time with people like Tyler Hobbs. I think Fidenzas are fucking gorgeous. I don't know if I'm allowed to curse. Hopefully, I'm from Long Island. I apologize. You can bleep those out if necessary.
00:36:40.826 - 00:36:41.760, Speaker A: Crypto my.
00:36:43.650 - 00:37:16.114, Speaker D: Right? Yeah, that's right. Not the right business to be in if you don't like lots of acronyms and lots of cursing. So I am interested in the artists. I've spent time with a bunch of artists and have gone to now, the first and second Marfa, Texas meetups hosted by Snowfrow and Artblocks and have spent a lot of time with artists. So am interested in that. But I'm not primarily. The art has to be good for me, right? I mean, I've designed every one of my book covers outside of Tools of Titans.
00:37:16.114 - 00:37:19.010, Speaker D: Like, I sketched and Handrew out. I laid out all the specs.
