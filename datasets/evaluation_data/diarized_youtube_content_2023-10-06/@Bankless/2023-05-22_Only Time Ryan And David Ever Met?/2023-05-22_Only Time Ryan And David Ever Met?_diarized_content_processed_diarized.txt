00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.070, Speaker B: This is a picture of us at permissionless one year ago.
00:00:03.140 - 00:00:08.480, Speaker A: As of today. No way. The first time we met was at this conference. And the only time I will.
00:00:09.330 - 00:00:11.886, Speaker B: Haven'T seen you since. It's been a year since I've were.
00:00:11.908 - 00:00:17.902, Speaker A: You worried that when we did that, were you like, oh, I might not like this guy in real life. What if he smells bad? What if the vibes are off?
00:00:17.956 - 00:00:20.778, Speaker B: So I guess I'm bullish on another year. I'll see you in September.
00:00:20.874 - 00:00:21.900, Speaker A: I'll see you in September, man.
