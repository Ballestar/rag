00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.894, Speaker A: Google AdWords, right? If you enter a query, that unleashes a whole wave of computation to match a set of ads that targeted that query and those queries literally have prices to them. So for a while, there's this form of lung cancer called mesothelioma. Back in the day, you clicked on anything with mesothelioma. Somebody paid a $100 for that click. But the cool thing is that you've got like a piece of human thought and attention, which is, oh, do I have mesothelioma? That gets auctioned and sold off like a can of tomatoes or like a share of Google, right? An open market. And then it all happens billions of times a day, right?
00:00:27.932 - 00:00:30.294, Speaker UNK: Wait, that's the interesting methamata. Like a piece of.
00:00:30.332 - 00:00:32.742, Speaker A: Human attention gets auctioned and.
00:00:32.796 - 00:00:33.606, Speaker UNK: Sold off to.
00:00:33.628 - 00:00:48.660, Speaker A: The highest bidder. That is wild. It's not just on search. Every time you load Facebook, literally requests go out and say, this human is here. What do you know about them? All these databases spin into gear, machine learning models, all the rest of it. They return with a bid and a piece of ad creative, somebody wins the auction and boom. And then it happens billions and billions of times.
