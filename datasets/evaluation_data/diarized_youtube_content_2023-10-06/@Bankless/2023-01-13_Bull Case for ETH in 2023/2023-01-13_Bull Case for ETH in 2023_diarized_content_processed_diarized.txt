00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.170, Speaker A: Project sign in with ethereum. It is something I'm bullish on and it's something that I think is also going to be very, very helpful with putting Ethereum on the map. When it comes to mainstream adoption. Sign in with Facebook, sign in with Google, or sign in with your private keys, which you minted yourself and you control. And being able to log into a website without having to do email and password and other identities, I think is going to be a big catalyst for just people accepting into their lives. As there's a higher fidelity relationship between your Ethereum address and your identity because of the poaps you collected or the attestations that you have or the things that you have done, your Ethereum address can represent more and more about you that you control. As Ethereum identity grows, sign in with Ethereum also becomes more useful.
