00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.302, Speaker A: What does your portfolio look like today? So this is summer 2023. What are you doing?
00:00:04.356 - 00:00:16.750, Speaker B: I don't change a lot, so it's still 80% ETH. Bit of salana, small bit of bitcoin and a tail of a few things that I bought that I'm not tied to. So basically it's the same bet that I've had and I don't really change it. I put money in when I could.
00:00:16.820 - 00:00:19.562, Speaker C: Have you increased or decreased your net exposure to crypto?
00:00:19.626 - 00:00:23.530, Speaker B: So I haven't sold anything. And then I added 30%, 40% in June.
00:00:23.610 - 00:00:24.240, Speaker A: Nice.
00:00:24.610 - 00:00:25.620, Speaker D: You time to do that.
