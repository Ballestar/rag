00:00:00.170 - 00:00:47.814, Speaker A: Why we should be optimistic about the future of the Internet. Because if we're pessimistic, we can't possibly build the better Internet that we want. We get to build another timeline to not have a centralized platform, making decisions that provide reach to specific ideas and not others. When you have a centralized platform, putting something out to millions and millions of people, it's tacit endorsement, right? Scrolling through a feed and seeing, oh, look, my uncle just got a new job and oh, look how cute my niece is, and this vaccine is putting a microchip into my brain. That context matters because that context is normalizing stuff and providing reach, tremendous reach, that is creating really harmful impacts on our society. I know those toxic parts of our society are still going to be there. They're always going to be there.
00:00:47.814 - 00:00:58.330, Speaker A: But we will not be reliant or victim to a handful of platforms making decisions about what belongs and what doesn't. And I actually think we're all going to be better off for it because it's going to be a chance to reset.
