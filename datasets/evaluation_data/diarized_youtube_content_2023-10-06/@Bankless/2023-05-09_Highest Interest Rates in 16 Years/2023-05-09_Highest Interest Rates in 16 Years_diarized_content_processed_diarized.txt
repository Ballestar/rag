00:00:00.090 - 00:00:20.522, Speaker A: The Fed just raised interest rates by 00:20 5% 5.25%. That's a 16 year all time high. The reason Powell is raising rates is because he's trying to fight inflation. I kind of feel like Powell is choosing maybe the worst of both worlds. Like, so we're gonna end up with high inflation anyway and also bank failures.
00:00:20.586 - 00:00:26.130, Speaker C: We gotta raise rates because inflation's still up. Right. And then when the bank failures occur, the fed is surgically.
00:00:26.210 - 00:00:26.882, Speaker A: More surgical.
00:00:26.946 - 00:00:35.842, Speaker C: And then they are catching distressed banks on the way down. So it's not a impact. They're just cradling the bank failure into the ground. And it's.
00:00:35.906 - 00:00:36.900, Speaker B: Working so far.
