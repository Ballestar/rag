00:00:00.170 - 00:00:51.790, Speaker A: What are their specific concerns with crypto being a legitimate asset class? So if you're a central banker of a major continental economy with a reserve currency to protect the euro, the pound, the dollar, a big concern about Bitcoin is its potential to unseat those reserve currencies. If you're a central banker with a monopoly over wholesale payment systems, you're worried about Stablecoins taking that monopoly. If you are in charge of AML KYC procedures at, say, a treasury, then you're concerned about payment rails that are outside of that control. And tokenization is very scary to those who are the overseers of account based money systems. Correspondent banking is right in the crosshairs of digital assets. It's a huge rent collecting that sucks up one or 2% of global GDP just to move money around the world. Think about how Kodak must have when digital photography came about.
00:00:51.790 - 00:00:56.570, Speaker A: Well, in the same way, if you're running a correspondent banking, you've got to be really afraid of Stablecoins.
