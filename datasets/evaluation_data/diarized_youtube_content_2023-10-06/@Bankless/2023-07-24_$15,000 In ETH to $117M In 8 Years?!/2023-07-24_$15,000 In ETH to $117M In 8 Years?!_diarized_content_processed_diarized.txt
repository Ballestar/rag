00:00:00.250 - 00:00:29.490, Speaker A: This address awakened after eight years and just moved $116,000,000 to Kraken. Imagine investing in the Ethereum ICO and not making a single transaction. And the next thing you do is you send it to Kraken to sell it $15,000, wait eight years, and then you send it to cash out at 116,000,000. Wow. That is a patient investor right there. They never glowed up their life in eight years when they had access to hundreds of millions of dollars multiple times. Patience? Who knows?
