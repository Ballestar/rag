00:00:00.090 - 00:00:08.654, Speaker A: When we'll see another bull market of some sort breaching all time highs, what would your guess be? I mean, do we have to wait ten years or does this happen every four years? Always?
00:00:08.692 - 00:00:11.946, Speaker C: It won't be ten years. And I wish I could pretend that me and my crypto.
00:00:11.978 - 00:00:21.774, Speaker B: OG friends don't talk about when the bull market will return, but we do. We have our barbecues and we talk about we're just always wrong. It's so hard.
00:00:21.972 - 00:00:24.446, Speaker C: It won't be ten years. Like, if it takes ten years for.
00:00:24.468 - 00:00:25.206, Speaker B: The bull market to.
00:00:25.228 - 00:00:26.086, Speaker C: Happen, probably the.
00:00:26.108 - 00:00:26.914, Speaker B: Whole thing failed.
00:00:26.962 - 00:00:29.782, Speaker C: Yeah, I would guess it's sometime in the next, like, six months to three years.
00:00:29.836 - 00:00:39.702, Speaker B: It also has a lot to do with the macro environment. So as long as interest rates are held high and monetary conditions are tighter, it's going to be a headwind that'll start changing in early to mid next year.
00:00:39.756 - 00:00:41.126, Speaker C: I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin was.
00:00:41.148 - 00:00:43.974, Speaker B: At like, 40K by the summer. That wouldn't surprise me at all.
00:00:44.012 - 00:00:52.142, Speaker A: There you have it, guys. Some thoughts from Eric Voorhees. Even got some price predictions. Yeah, you heard it here. Guaranteed by 20, 20, 26. We'll have a full steam ahead. Bull market.
00:00:52.142 - 00:00:54.540, Speaker A: Eric Voorhees. Just kidding, guys.
