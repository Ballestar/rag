00:00:00.170 - 00:00:18.842, Speaker A: You have a side, you pick a side. Anybody who's ever been in a Tesla, you'll think differently. A lot of people don't actually understand how revolutionary the car itself is. Like, he basically turned a piece of mechanical hardware into a software, which is stunning. So I respect him from a baseline entrepreneurial level. That said, he's making some mistakes. I think Twitter blue is a huge mistake.
00:00:18.842 - 00:00:49.140, Speaker A: I'm a fan of creating some sort of twitter for enterprise product. Basically tiered pricing based upon the number of followers that you you have and then the number of tweets that you may want to send out, paired especially with, like, a customer service function. If you ever have a problem with a company, what's the best way to get in touch with them? You tweet at them and then American airlines or whatever tweets back at you. Why do they get to do that for free? The best real time customer service software ever existed. It's like you should charge them for it and then build them, like, a CRM customer relations thing on the back end, and they could pay a load of money for that and probably would. That's the first good, original take on Twitter that I've heard in a long time. Thanks, man.
