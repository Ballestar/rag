00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.730, Speaker A: You just said this could kill the need for cookies. There's some nuance to it, but yes. We wouldn't need cookies in this model. If you've ever been to an EU website and you know, it says, allow all cookies or just the ones we need? Well, just the ones we need are typically used to maintain sessions, so when you revisit the website, you're still logged in. I'm saying it's possible to shift to a system where you just show up with your keys again and you can sprinkle a little power into a session key, and that can prove who you are with any of your interactions without them having to remember you every time you just sign and bam. It works. Kind of like sending a transaction to Ethereum.
