00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.082, Speaker A: Binance accused of commingling customer funds. So mixing customer funds and company revenue, I'm sure CZ would call this FUD.
00:00:07.146 - 00:00:14.842, Speaker B: Best case scenario is that it's just a big accounting. No, no. I think one of the reasons why this is news is like, the last time that we saw commingled customer funds, it was FTX.
00:00:14.906 - 00:00:20.074, Speaker A: And the last founder CEO said, oh, that's just FUD as well. Remember that guy? His name is SBF.
00:00:20.122 - 00:00:33.300, Speaker B: Yeah, but they found no evidence that client money was taken. But the idea is, like, in the FTX stories, like, yeah, customers'money wasn't taken or stolen. They was just liquidated because they were trading. So it doesn't really do anything to help the narrative of Binance as a big black box.
