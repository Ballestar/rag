00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.174, Speaker A: The WorldCoin Project is now live. So Sam Altman tweeted this out, but you see this line kind of forming. I don't know where this is. And the caption from Sam Altman is day three of WorldCoin launch. Crazy lines around the world. One person getting verified every 8 seconds. Now, why are.
00:00:16.212 - 00:00:21.102, Speaker B: People scanning their eyeballs? Because you get 25 World for just doing it. And then one world.
00:00:21.156 - 00:00:21.630, Speaker A: A week.
00:00:21.700 - 00:00:25.494, Speaker B: WorldCoin is $2 right now. People are waiting in line for $50.
00:00:25.612 - 00:00:33.250, Speaker A: $50 right now. But I guess number could go up. And Sam calls one person every eight. I don't think number is going to go up at this valuation.
