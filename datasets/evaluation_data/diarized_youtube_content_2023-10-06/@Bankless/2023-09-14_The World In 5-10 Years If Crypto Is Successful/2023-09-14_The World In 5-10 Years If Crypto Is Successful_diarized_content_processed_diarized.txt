00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.470, Speaker A: If crypto is successful, what does the world look like in five to ten years?
00:00:03.540 - 00:00:33.170, Speaker B: My own personal objective is actually make the underlying rails really efficient, really open, really interoperable, and enable more people to have access to them.

You want, like, a check and balance and alternatives that are really solid for people, a technological angle of unlocking all of these capabilities for people while enabling good governments to do their work. And I think that's where I stand personally.
