00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.518, Speaker A: Twitter's biggest sin in a lot of ways, I think, was a follow graph. We have a lot of interesting people on twitter, but the only way to get them discovered is you have to get other people to follow them. So you kind of had these people who had a million plus followers, and.
00:00:09.524 - 00:00:10.846, Speaker B: They got locked in, so they were.
00:00:10.868 - 00:00:12.986, Speaker A: Like the genie coefficient. The wealth inequality.
00:00:13.018 - 00:00:15.182, Speaker B: Of Twitter started, like, expanding more and more.
00:00:15.236 - 00:00:36.550, Speaker A: And if Twitter had figured out to constantly bring in new stars because, one, you're bringing new talent, second, you're keeping the older folks on their toes. You're like, hey, you're not participating. You're gone. I think every healthy social network constantly needs to elevate new people to stay fresh. And so my hope is, who was the start of Farcaster? Today is different from the Farcaster two years from now and five years from now, and one for every country.
00:00:36.620 - 00:00:37.574, Speaker C: You can just kind of really go.
00:00:37.612 - 00:00:38.180, Speaker A: Run wild with this.
