00:00:00.250 - 00:00:29.302, Speaker A: Suzu and Kyle Davies, formerly of Three Arrows Capital, are raising $25 million for a new crypto exchange. And they're calling this g TX. The reason why they are calling it GTX is because G comes after F. That is literally a slide in their pitch deck. After FTX comes GTX, an exchange to trade claims on all of the insolvent companies of 2022. Sell Celsius claims, FTX claims, Fiera's Capital claims. Yeah, probably.
00:00:29.302 - 00:00:47.780, Speaker A: I'm getting suddenly very bullish because who has better experience with insolvent companies, right? The exchange offers depositors the ability to transfer their FTX claims to GTX and receive immediate credit in a token called USDG. So we're back to printing funny money. And that's the deal, man.
