00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.398, Speaker A: Tim.
00:00:00.484 - 00:00:02.640, Speaker B: What the hell is it? What's going on?
00:00:03.010 - 00:00:07.230, Speaker A: I'm so childish. So the name of this project is cockpunch.
00:00:07.650 - 00:00:08.734, Speaker B: No, it's not.
00:00:08.852 - 00:00:34.610, Speaker A: Yes, it is. The full name is the legend of cockpunch. All of the known characters who inhabit this realm are roosters. So the roosters are the NFTs. The roosters are the NFTs. And why is it called cockpunch? At one point in the realm's history, there was a warring states period where civil strife ruled, and it was chaos from all four corners of this realm. And then there was a means of peacekeeping.
00:00:34.610 - 00:00:56.874, Speaker A: There is an arena in this arena, you have one on one battles. Are we cock fighting? We're cock punching and cockfighting. Yeah. You have two cockpunchers march out, and they meet in the middle on an elevated platform, and each of them have, like, power gauntlet, and they punch the out of each other. And they have different strategies. They have different strengths. They have different weaknesses.
00:00:56.874 - 00:00:59.180, Speaker A: It's absurd how much time I've put into this.
