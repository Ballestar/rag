00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.642, Speaker B: The worst thing that you can do is to actually create securities regulations about these things that are designed to be decentralized.
00:00:05.706 - 00:00:34.742, Speaker A: The issue is that we are taking positions that maximize our jurisdictional reach. Right. If most tokens are securities, it means that most platforms where tokens trade are going to be entities that we regulate. And the other thing is, no one outside of Washington cares whether the securities laws apply. What they care about is making the world a better place by applying regulation. It's sometimes hard to take a step back and say, wait a minute. By protecting people, you're actually preventing people from getting access to products and services they want.
00:00:34.742 - 00:00:47.540, Speaker A: It's really hard to get through a process that's just not designed for your asset class, but for a regulator. We're like, we're looking at our regulatory checklist, and if you don't exactly tick every box on there, then we're protecting investors by telling you to leave.
