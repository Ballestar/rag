00:00:00.170 - 00:00:33.090, Speaker A: What would you say where the value of Treasuries is actually coming from? I would say the economy and capital markets are the number one thing with military being a second. There's roughly 180 currencies, and they have a barter problem. How does Nigeria trade with South Korea? They don't trust each other's ledgers necessarily. They all kind of look at the United States and say, well, we'll use dollars. Right? Because the United States is big, relatively stable. It's kind of a multidecade network effect of one biggest economy in the world, two reasonably strong property rights, rule of law, depth of capital markets. It's kind of viewed as almost like neutral territory with tons of depth and stability.
