00:00:00.250 - 00:00:08.490, Speaker B: We now have Game of Thrones NFTs. As if the show didn't already jump the shark, now they're getting on the NFT bandwagon. What do you think of these NFTs, David?
00:00:08.570 - 00:00:11.150, Speaker A: Man, does it look like a cheap mobile game?
00:00:11.220 - 00:00:13.038, Speaker B: Did you see this tweet here? David yeah, it.
00:00:13.044 - 00:00:28.310, Speaker A: Says Funky Donk saying I bought this for .07 ETH. Why, might you ask? Do you hate yourself? Funky? No, it's because I know art when I see it. And these fingers, that's art. Crazy spindly. Tempting to grab this spear. Kind of feels like a Kevin moment.
00:00:28.310 - 00:00:29.170, Speaker A: You remember Kevin.
00:00:29.250 - 00:00:31.906, Speaker B: I remember Kevin. But how are they selling? David.
00:00:32.098 - 00:00:34.580, Speaker A: They sold out, dude. Of course they did.
