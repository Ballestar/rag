00:00:00.170 - 00:00:11.294, Speaker A: Do you think that some countries might decide to leapfrog what Crypto is attempting to do with a tokenized T bill and roll out its own central bank digital currency that also has a yield instrument and a T bill attached to it?
00:00:11.332 - 00:00:35.250, Speaker B: This is already happening in Brazil. Brazil is designing an EVM deployed token, which is going to be their central bank digital currency. The challenge is, if you do this, you're doing a death blow to your whole banking system. Who's going to bank at a regional bank if you have the risk of that falling? They're paying you 0% and the Fed is zero risk and they're paying you the same risk free rate. So I think getting from where we are to that in the US is going to be very challenging.
