00:00:00.090 - 00:00:44.130, Speaker A: The art market has always been a securities market. When you invest in a work of art, what you're really investing in is the belief that a particular artist, that their brand, is going to be more valuable in the future than it is now. It's the dirty canvas and the lumpy rock that we thought people were investing money in when they bought something in the art market, but that was always false. The dirty piece of cloth or the lumpy rock is just a physical token that represents ownership of a ledger. Entry was not designed to regulate the art market, which is why I think it's so important to realize that when we say, is it a security? We're asking the wrong question. The question is, is it the kind of thing that the SEC believes it has the expertise to regulate? But that hurts, too, because now we need to get into Gary Gensler's brain.
