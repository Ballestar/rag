00:00:00.330 - 00:00:41.954, Speaker A: This clip might be the worst take of the year. Why do you believe FTX failed these two behemoths that own the unregulated market together and grew these incredible businesses in terms of growth? That's Binance and FTX and one put the other out of business intentionally. Binance is a massive, unregulated global monopoly now. They put FTX out of business? No, they did not. Sam Bankman Freed put himself out of business. If SBF and FTX actually had the funds that they claimed to have, if they weren't playing around with depositors money, a run on the bank wouldn't have been successful. No one forced Sam bankman, Fried, to steal depositors'funds.
00:00:41.954 - 00:00:45.970, Speaker A: That wasn't like some competitor playing dirty games. This was all Sam.
