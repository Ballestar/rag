00:00:00.170 - 00:00:19.082, Speaker B: Ethereum price prediction. We've got the base 2030, case 11,849. We've got the bear case, but $343 for the price of ETH. And we've got the bull case of 51K all the dates there by 2030. What are the dials in this model? And take us from $300 ETH to, like, 50K ETH.
00:00:19.146 - 00:00:43.140, Speaker A: The biggest principal components to this is the understanding of what the underlying markets will do in terms of adopting crypto. So the first level just be what's, the adoption of those underlying businesses? The next is what kind of revenue will ethereum get from those places? The next level down is what percent of the crypto market is ethereum? And so for each of the Bull, Bear and Base cases, we tweak ethereum's market share to reflect that outcome. That's kind of like the idea for how it works.
