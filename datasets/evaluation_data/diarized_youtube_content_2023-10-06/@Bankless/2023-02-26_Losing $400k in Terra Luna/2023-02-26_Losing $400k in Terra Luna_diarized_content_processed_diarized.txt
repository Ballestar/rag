00:00:00.170 - 00:00:14.874, Speaker A: The SEC case against Sara Luna. Here's the punchline. A pharmacist in California borrowed $400,000 against the value of his home to purchase UST and lost his entire investment. Oof. Don't do that. You have to have an investor mindset. If you start feeling of, like, get rich.
00:00:14.874 - 00:00:30.562, Speaker A: I need it now. Yeah, like, buy bye bye. You should always cast doubt on that feeling. Go for a jock, take a hot shower, wait three months, and see if you still feel that way. No one can protect you, gary Gensler can't protect you. That's on you. And my hope is that people just develop better instincts and better defense.
00:00:30.562 - 00:00:31.410, Speaker A: That's the only protection.
