00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.542, Speaker B: SBF no longer has power. New CEO John Ray came in. He writes some scathing reviews of what was going on.
00:00:06.596 - 00:00:46.630, Speaker A: This new CEO says, I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience. I have been the chief restructuring officer or CEO of several of the largest corporate failures in history. Enron, he's setting himself up for a punchline, and here it is. Never in my career have I seen such a failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trust. The financial information as occurred here, from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated, and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented. This is the guy that oversaw the Enron restructuring saying that this situation is unprecedented. Oh, my God.
00:00:46.700 - 00:00:52.940, Speaker B: My man's been doing this for 40 years, and he's like, this is the worst I've ever seen in my whole career of seeing terrible things.
