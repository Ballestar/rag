00:00:00.170 - 00:00:25.462, Speaker A: Elizabeth Warren tweets out this image. Elizabeth Warren is building an anti crypto army, triggering the entire actual army of crypto. Twitter this is actually going to be popular with her base, given that right now a lot of people outside of crypto don't have a positive view of crypto. People don't like to stand for things in opposition of something. What do you believe? I believe in the anti crypto movement. Like that's. That's what you stand for.
00:00:25.462 - 00:00:34.290, Speaker A: She also just gave us the very easy opportunity to make this meme, which is bankless is building a pro crypto army, and we just got as many likes as Liz with Warren, so I'll count that as a victory.
