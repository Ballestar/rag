00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.614, Speaker A: Decentralizing coinbase over time. What does that mean to you?
00:00:03.652 - 00:00:33.220, Speaker B: The mission of the company is to increase economic freedom in the world. My belief is to do that we really need to get a crypto economy that's global and decentralized. That's how we're going to get the innovation potential of it. We're also starting to build the more decentralized pieces of the economy with self custodial wallet like Coinbase wallet, things like base like Coinbase NFT we'll probably build more of our own DApps over time. We want to make sure we're contributing to the open protocols. It's easy to look at Coinbase and say, oh, it's just a centralized crypto company, but it's actually more nuanced than that. My hope is we can become more and more decentralized over time.
