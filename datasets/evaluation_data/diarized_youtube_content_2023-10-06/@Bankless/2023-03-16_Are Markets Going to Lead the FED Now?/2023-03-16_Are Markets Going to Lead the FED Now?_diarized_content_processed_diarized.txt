00:00:00.170 - 00:00:35.010, Speaker A: The Great Depression was not caused by 1929 crash. It was caused by a bank run. It's also why policymakers overreacted to 2008 with ultra low interest rates. So in a way, we're paying the consequences of the significant deflationary shock of a banking crisis in OA. So now the question is are markets going to lead the Fed going forward? The Fed so far has been leading the markets and the markets haven't puked when the Fed has continued their rate hike campaign. If the Fed stays the course and the markets are calling for a Pivot or expecting a Pivot, how does that disappointment translate into risk assets pricing?
