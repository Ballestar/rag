00:00:00.330 - 00:00:18.474, Speaker A: What is an ETF? I think I know. The acronym Exchange traded Fund, is that correct? 100% correct. An ETF is a traded vehicle. The ETFs were invented after the SEC wrote a report in 187. There was this big crash. A lot of it had to do with futures and derivatives. And the SEC said basically they wish they had something that was more physically backed rather than derivatives.
00:00:18.474 - 00:00:39.860, Speaker A: This guy Nate Most came up with the idea for what is now an ETF. The key thing that makes an ETF work and why it's super efficient is because you can always access those underlying stocks. So in the SP 500 ETF, you can always trade in shares of the ETF and get back the underlying stocks. ETFs have that mechanism where you can create shares and redeem shares because always the underlying can be exchanged for the shares of the product. Right.
