00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.058, Speaker A: CryptoPunk NFTs discord screenshot. This was in 2017.
00:00:04.154 - 00:00:26.994, Speaker B: This account named Cyborg says in the discord, I'm about to do something either extremely stupid or wonderfully smart. Wish me luck. And then just a few moments later, the crypto punk bot shows up and goes a zombie punk was sold for a whopping 1.89 Ether for $564. And some other person in the discord goes, whoa. Because that was a big sale for a JPEG. For a JPEG.
00:00:26.994 - 00:00:36.740, Speaker B: $560 for a JPEG. Who's spending this much money in 2017 on JPEGs. Of course, that zombie punk is probably worth 1000 times more in Ether terms. Yeah.
