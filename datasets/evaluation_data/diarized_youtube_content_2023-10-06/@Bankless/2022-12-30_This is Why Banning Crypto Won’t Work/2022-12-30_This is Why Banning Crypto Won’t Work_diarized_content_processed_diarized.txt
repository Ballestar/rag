00:00:00.250 - 00:00:18.110, Speaker A: So this is the Senate Banking Chairman says when asked about banning cryptocurrency, maybe could be a good idea. Not too sure. Here's a quote from him. Maybe banning it. Although banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore. A message to Sherrad Brown. Let me give you another reason it's going to be difficult because we will fight you the entire time.
00:00:18.110 - 00:00:31.186, Speaker A: These are our digital property rights, Senator Brown. These are important. This is not only difficult because it will go offshore. It's difficult because this is a breach of our constitutional rights to own these sorts of assets and to preserve our privacy.
00:00:31.298 - 00:00:40.086, Speaker B: Also, I got news for you, Senator Brown. It's already offshore. If you ban it here, you're just banning your own citizens from accessing something that already exists. It's not going to go.
00:00:40.108 - 00:00:40.950, Speaker A: Offshore.
00:00:41.530 - 00:00:42.594, Speaker B: It's on the Internet.
00:00:42.642 - 00:00:42.998, Speaker A: Bro.
00:00:43.084 - 00:00:45.202, Speaker B: I think some of this thing is just being uneducated.
00:00:45.266 - 00:00:46.230, Speaker A: About how this works.
00:00:46.300 - 00:00:53.340, Speaker B: Maybe we'll ban crypto because I'm a regulator and I can do whatever the hell I'll just ban that. Oh, you like that? I'll ban it. No, bro, like, not how it works.
