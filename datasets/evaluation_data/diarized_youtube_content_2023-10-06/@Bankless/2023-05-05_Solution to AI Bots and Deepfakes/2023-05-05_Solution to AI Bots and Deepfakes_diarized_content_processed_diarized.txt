00:00:00.090 - 00:00:10.386, Speaker B: Twitter has this massive problem. I'm like Elon Musk. He's like battling the bots all the time on Twitter. And it seems like Crypto has a solution for this. Why haven't we been able to kind of penetrate it?
00:00:10.388 - 00:00:32.420, Speaker A: It takes a startup that's well networked enough with these platforms and be able to convince them to join this protocol where digital signature is required to sign messages. I think that's the only reason why the solution is not being implemented yet. This whole deepfake thing is going to play a massive role in next election. But I think we only have one more election for this to happen. Because by the 2028 election, solution will be ready.
