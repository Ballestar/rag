00:00:00.250 - 00:00:14.014, Speaker A: PayPal is launching a stablecoin on Ethereum. It's called p y USD. It's a fully backed US dollar stablecoin. Public stats are 450,000,000 active user accounts on PayPal. This is issued by Paxos, the bank machine behind it.
00:00:14.052 - 00:00:26.500, Speaker B: Paxos. They had to give up BUSD binance stablecoin. And I'll pull in a Harry Potter quote for all the Harry Potter fans trading a nut for a Galleon, giving up binance in all of its regulatory gray areas and gaining PayPal out as a client definitely a win.
