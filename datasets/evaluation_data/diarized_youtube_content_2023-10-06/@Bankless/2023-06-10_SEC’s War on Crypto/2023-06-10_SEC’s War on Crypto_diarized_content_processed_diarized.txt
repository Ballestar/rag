00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.714, Speaker A: SEC sues coinbase. SEC sues Binance. SEC is suing the two largest crypto marketplaces that we have. This is an attack on crypto. They declared specific tokens, a security. When you name specific tokens and you declare them securities, sol, Ada, Matic, Atom, AXS that, to me, is a direct attack on crypto. I trust Binance more than I trust SEC, and I don't put a lot of trust in Binance.
00:00:24.714 - 00:00:39.666, Speaker A: David. You know what I mean? This agency, they've not provided clear guidelines. Instead, they're taking this kind of rogue enforcement action. And it seems like Gensler's on a war path to try to kill it in the US. And that is why this, to me, is an all out assault on crypto.
00:00:39.698 - 00:00:40.580, Speaker B: And it couldn't be more clear.
