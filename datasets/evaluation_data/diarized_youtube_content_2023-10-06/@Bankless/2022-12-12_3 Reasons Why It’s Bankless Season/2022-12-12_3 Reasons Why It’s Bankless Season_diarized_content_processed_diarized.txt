00:00:00.090 - 00:00:22.906, Speaker A: I think crypto really needs to rebuild and go back to its roots, go back home to its fundamentals. The thing I'm pretty bullish on this week coming out of this is specifically more tools that help us. Go Bankless. I feel like we took so many shortcuts in 2022. We trusted centralized intermediaries and there are a lot of reasons for that. But I don't think we will be rebuilding on centralized tools moving forward. I think it's kind of like it's Bankless season.
00:00:22.906 - 00:00:38.662, Speaker A: Like the entire next year. Is that's how we're going to rebuild? I think we have a triple threat that make me believe this. This time we have veterans who know what they're doing in this space. We have some recent pain. I'm just reminded that pain is a teacher. We touch the stove and it's hot. Bankless UX is getting better.
00:00:38.662 - 00:00:52.300, Speaker A: That was part of the problem last cycle. Why people gave their funds to centralized intermediaries is because it was just one click, one button, so easy. And the UX was easy. And I didn't have to think, I didn't have to learn about private keys and self custody. All this complexity. Well, we are ramping up and getting better.
