00:00:00.090 - 00:00:23.066, Speaker A: So, Ethereum, in 2032, you have a node. Your node runs on your phone every 12 seconds, or 32 seconds, or whatever number we agree on. You download three six megabytes of data. You hash it, you do a couple of elliptic curve equations to check a Snark. That's it. You know, the block is valid, wait 12 seconds, get 33.6 megabytes of data, hash it, do some elliptic curve operations, verify the Snark, and valid 12 seconds later, data, hash, elliptic curve check, valid.
00:00:23.066 - 00:00:43.650, Speaker A: Right? So the whole process just becomes incredibly sleek and as seamless to the point where literally a phone could even do it, right, because it's incredibly light on computation. The only thing that it's heavy on is data. And data just happens to be the thing that phones are increasingly getting insanely good at and will get even better at over the next ten years, right? So that, to me, is what I see. The final goal being, from a protocol standpoint.
