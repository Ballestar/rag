00:00:00.090 - 00:00:04.526, Speaker A: Whenever you experience success, you start to get haters. Right? What was that like, to be on, like, the receiving end of.
00:00:04.548 - 00:00:33.060, Speaker B: That stuff that I see on Twitter? I just take it for granted as this is just people being on Twitter, but when I talk to people that are in the ETH community, I never felt there was hate, especially not from, like, Vitalik or Justin or Doncrat or any of the core dev. They've been awesome and super helpful. Stuff that's I think valuable that comes out of that is like arguing about decentralization, like actually getting to the nuance of trustlessness. My conversations with Doncrat have influenced Solana's design. That's awesome.
