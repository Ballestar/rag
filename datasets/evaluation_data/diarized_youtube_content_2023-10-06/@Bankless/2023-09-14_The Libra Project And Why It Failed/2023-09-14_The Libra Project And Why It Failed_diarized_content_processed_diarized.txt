00:00:04.660 - 00:00:28.740, Speaker B: So Libra was actually to try to bring to the world an open protocol for payments or money on the internet, build really good tech for real time net settlement of money on the internet. So the whole package was actually a technology, a blockchain that was basically the Libra blockchain and a stablecoin.
