00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.046, Speaker B: What are you seeing on the horizon colliding with Web Three? Like where the rubber is going to meet the pavement as we start to.
00:00:06.068 - 00:00:47.506, Speaker A: Understand more and more utility restaurants using it as exclusive membership or golf course to get in. But then you start thinking about what we can do, even if it's just allowing people access to online communities. We know that communities already and reddit is a great precedent for this, where there is no incentive other than we have a community, we have a culture, you're part of it. We know that those work at scale massively. Well, seeing the infrastructure gets built up around enabling communities in Web Three is one of the things I'm most excited about over the next year or two. Things I'm betting on are the things that are creating this kind of infrastructure around community or these communities themselves. We will see real utility evolve, we'll see technologies that will make it even more valuable to own NFTs with robust communities.
00:00:47.506 - 00:00:55.770, Speaker A: Again, if we know it works, real ownership, then by adding that really important element, it should grow even faster and even stronger.
