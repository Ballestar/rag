00:00:00.250 - 00:00:26.438, Speaker A: 2022 was good for crypto. The way I justify saying something like that, Eric, is the counterfactual of, like, what would have happened if crypto got to $10 trillion asset class? It got to three. What would have happened if FTX had grown five x ten x larger? What would have happened if luna got that much bigger and then blew up? The counterfactual is actually scarier to me than what happened in 2022. Is it a good thing that we went through this?
00:00:26.524 - 00:00:45.300, Speaker B: I think counterfactual would have been very scary. To have had crypto create real financial stability issues for the global economy would have been devastating. And I think as it stands, there were some deep embarrassments and humiliations, but it didn't infect the broader economy and it didn't infect the financial system, and that's really important.
