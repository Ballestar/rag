00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.202, Speaker A: I consider ETH a volatile asset, I do not consider it particularly risky. People often mistake volatility and risk. They can go down. That means they're volatile. But if you held, did you actually lose anything? Cash is now a risk asset, right? For me, treasuries are much more risky than ETH. Volatility becomes risk when one, you use leverage, or two, your time horizon is short or unpredictable. That's totally how volatility becomes risk.
