00:00:00.170 - 00:00:01.066, Speaker B: Coinbase is suing.
00:00:01.098 - 00:00:01.646, Speaker A: The SEC.
00:00:01.748 - 00:00:03.246, Speaker B: Or as David would say, we.
00:00:03.268 - 00:00:05.760, Speaker A: Are suing the SEC. We're suing the SEC.
00:00:06.130 - 00:00:19.402, Speaker B: Paul the chief legal officer at Coinbase. He says, today we filed a narrow action in the US circuit Court to compel the SEC to respond yes or no to a rulemaking petition we filed with them last July asking them to provide regulatory guidance for the crypto industry.
00:00:19.466 - 00:00:31.074, Speaker A: Coinbase is suing the SEC to get them to just say yes or no to this petition. The SEC is required by law to respond to petitions, quote, within a reasonable time, but they have not yet responded to our petition from last July.
00:00:31.202 - 00:00:31.782, Speaker B: Cool.
00:00:31.916 - 00:00:36.340, Speaker A: I mean, it's not that big of a deal. Like it's just a yes or no lawsuit. But the implications of that are large.
