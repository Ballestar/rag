00:00:00.170 - 00:00:17.466, Speaker A: Why did you guys decide to move again? There's stories in that. Polygon paid Utes collection $3 million to leave Salana. We felt a little bit like we were capped and we were. Big experimenters. One of our core mottos with the community is fiwb, which stands for it. We ball. And so we were getting offers, honestly, from a lot of chains.
00:00:17.466 - 00:00:37.650, Speaker A: Post FTX, Polygon was definitely not the largest number that we were offered, but I'm all about transparency and so I think we're like the first team to actually like Ounce, like, yeah, this is how much we got in our grant. I didn't really care at the time. I still don't care. People know the behind the scenes or the financials behind it, but the honest answer was every blockchain was offering us something. And I think it's the deal of a lifetime, honestly, for Polygon.
