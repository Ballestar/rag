00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.158, Speaker B: If you were a diabetic 50 years ago, pigs would be slaughtered for food.
00:00:04.244 - 00:00:05.194, Speaker A: And the insulin.
00:00:05.242 - 00:00:10.266, Speaker B: In their pancreas would be sold to people who had diabetes. Now, your insulin, it's.
00:00:10.298 - 00:00:12.554, Speaker A: Human insulin, but it doesn't come from humans.
00:00:12.602 - 00:00:13.306, Speaker B: We're not harvesting.
00:00:13.338 - 00:00:18.766, Speaker A: Humans, not in this country. It comes from process called fermentation, the.
00:00:18.788 - 00:00:21.914, Speaker B: Same process as we get from a craft brew.
00:00:21.962 - 00:00:33.014, Speaker A: Well, it turns out you can program that DNA now, and that's what Gin Tech did. They changed the genes so that instead of making alcohol, they made enzymes that made insulin. And so that's, at its core, what.
00:00:33.052 - 00:00:34.018, Speaker B: Synthetic biology.
00:00:34.114 - 00:00:39.060, Speaker A: Is about being able to read, write, edit the DNA. And now you have this amazing production platform.
