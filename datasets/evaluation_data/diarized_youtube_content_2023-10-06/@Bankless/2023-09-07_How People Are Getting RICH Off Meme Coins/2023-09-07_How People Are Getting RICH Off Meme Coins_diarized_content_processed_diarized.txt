Market Cap ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the world of shitcoins, a Djen layer of casino games and pump and dumps hidden deep within the depths of ethereum. Ethereum is permissionless, which means anyone could come along and spin up tokens that anyone else can trade. And the free market a hell of a drug. That means you have awesome grassroots protocols like Uniswap, also the wild west of Unregulated.
00:00:24.346 - 00:00:51.262, Speaker A: Tokens you may have of a token called Dogecoin, the Doge father, if you would OG meme coin, which currently sits at a market cap of $9 billion. That's more than the GDP of 60 countries. So what's the point of these tokens? Well, it makes people laugh, and some even have cute dog logos. Should you FOMO into these tokens? Well, probably not. There's no difference between these coins and a casino. But there are lessons here in market psychology. Why does one project get so much bigger than the other? Is there some cool new tech driving it? Usually it's just memes, but what actually makes a good meme, we call this the social layer, and it's the invisible layer that's even more powerful than code.
00:00:51.262 - 00:00:59.900, Speaker A: Ultimately, it's the people and culture that define what we are. While it's fun to gamble and joke about memes, there is also a lot to learn. So next time you're up at 02:00 a.m. Trading, think to yourself, why is this coin going up? And if you can't figure it out, look out below.
