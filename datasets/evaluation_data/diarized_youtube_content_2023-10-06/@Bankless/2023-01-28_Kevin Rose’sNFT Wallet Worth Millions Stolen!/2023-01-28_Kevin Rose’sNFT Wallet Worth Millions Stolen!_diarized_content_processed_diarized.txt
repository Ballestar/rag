00:00:09.066 - 00:00:17.630, Speaker B: The way that this worked is fraudulent website. He proved a transaction. That transaction bundled up all the NFTs and then sent them outbound from Kevin Rose's wallet all in one go.
00:00:17.700 - 00:00:35.318, Speaker A: This is my take on it, David. I said it looks like Kevin Rose just had millions of dollars in assets stolen because he clicked the wrong transaction. Imagine if sway your credit card at the coffee shop put you at risk for getting your entire bank account drained. I think, David, this is really bad. UX. Honestly, this could happen to anybody in crypto. How do we solve this?
00:00:35.404 - 00:00:44.020, Speaker B: There are things that you can do today to make sure that you never fall victim to this. And it's just a matter of taking the extra time and energy to do the thing.
