00:00:00.090 - 00:00:06.538, Speaker A: We've had two cycles of the Meme ETH killer. Something is going to come. Kill Ethereum. Is that dead now? Are we going to have another ETH killer cycle?
00:00:06.634 - 00:00:19.742, Speaker B: Now? Everybody realizes it's not enough to kill ETH. Because the fees are high. It's not enough to kill ETH. Because it's proof of work. Or it has this looming technical upgrade that's a bunch of smoke and mirrors and this perpetual motion machine. That's the roadmap. Like that's done.
00:00:19.742 - 00:00:38.340, Speaker B: So you're going to have to compete on fundamentally new use cases. So would some of these move oriented blockchains, right? The ones that spun out of the Facebook DM project, like Aptos and Sui, are they going to introduce some interesting applications? Is Solana going to introduce some interesting applications that just run better, faster, cheaper, and you just can't do them on Ethereum? Maybe.
