00:00:00.090 - 00:00:19.660, Speaker A: I'm absolutely a libertarian. I happily embrace that label. I think a lot of people on the left or the right, if you ask them, like, what it means to be on the left or the right, they don't quite have a consistent answer. And it's interesting to watch people on both sides of that spectrum take conflicting views that don't actually adhere to a single principle. My principle is that people should be peaceful with one another. Everything that I believe comes down to is sort of trying to fit it to that.
