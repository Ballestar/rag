00:00:00.170 - 00:00:29.782, Speaker A: The concept of nation state militaries at large. It would be great if we could invest in infrastructure and education and child mortality and nutrition, and we do invest in those things, but how much we invest in military far dwarfs that. Let's start with a blank slate. And we have two agents in this game, and each one's a nation state. Whichever nation state invests more into their military can gobble up the other one. And then we end up in the state that we are today with, like, enough nuclear warheads to blow up the world ten times over. And they're all at like, there's just a button away.
00:00:29.782 - 00:00:36.034, Speaker A: And it's also why we can't have nuclear de armament, because no one wants to be the country without the nuclear weapons.
00:00:36.082 - 00:00:43.410, Speaker B: You can't just check out the game if you want. Be like, oh, okay, we're going to become radically hippie country. You're just going to get invaded. That's the trouble.
