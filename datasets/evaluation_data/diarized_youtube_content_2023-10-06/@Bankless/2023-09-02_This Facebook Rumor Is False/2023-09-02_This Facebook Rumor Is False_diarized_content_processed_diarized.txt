00:00:00.090 - 00:00:04.094, Speaker A: There's so many things kind of wrong with the way I think the public perceives Facebook. One is that, like, your Facebook data.
00:00:04.132 - 00:00:04.842, Speaker B: Is so valuable.
00:00:04.906 - 00:00:10.442, Speaker A: It is in some very high level and second order ways, but in the very simplistic way of, oh, they're gonna target the thing I did on Facebook.
00:00:10.506 - 00:00:11.358, Speaker B: No, it is not the.
00:00:11.364 - 00:00:15.918, Speaker A: Persistent rumor that Zuck is listening to me through my phone. Okay, even assuming that's true, which, by the way, you would see on the.
00:00:15.924 - 00:00:20.094, Speaker B: Network bandwidth, because you'd have this constant call going to Zuck, like, it's impossible. They're not listening to you all the time.
00:00:20.132 - 00:00:24.106, Speaker A: Leaving that aside, how often do you actually say, oh, by the way, I'm in market for a flight to Boston.
00:00:24.138 - 00:00:27.142, Speaker B: Leaving February 3 and me back February 6, and I don't want to pay more than $600?
00:00:27.196 - 00:00:34.980, Speaker A: When the do you ever say that? You never say it in this whole business. I talked to Ruth Carat with my girlfriend, and I saw cat food. Yeah, because you looked up cat food literally an hour before that. That's why, right?
