00:00:00.250 - 00:00:32.626, Speaker A: What is happening is a progressive erosion of freedom. Very quietly, without anyone particularly thinking about it. New York has yellow caps, and you hail them off the street, jump in, and they take you and give them $20, and you get out, right? And the only way someone can stop you from doing that is by arresting you. There's no actor, including the state, can say, hey, Ryan, you're not allowed to use a taxi anymore. Right? That's just not a thing. Now, what is needed for Uber to say, I don't want Ryan using my service anymore? Absolutely nothing. And so if the CEO of Uber wakes up and says, I don't like the look of that guy's.
00:00:32.658 - 00:00:33.540, Speaker B: Face, you're off the platform.
