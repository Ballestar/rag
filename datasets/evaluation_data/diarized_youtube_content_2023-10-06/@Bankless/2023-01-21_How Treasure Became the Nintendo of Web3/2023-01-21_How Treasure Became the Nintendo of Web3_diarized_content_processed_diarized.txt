00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.222, Speaker A: What does this mean? To be the Nintendo of Web three. And how do game cartridges fit into this whole thing?
00:00:04.276 - 00:00:18.634, Speaker B: Coming at this from how kind of treasure started. It was a derivative of loot. It was a fair launch. Free Mints. We distributed magic. We distributed the initial NFTs. That led to free mints, that led to small brains, that led to Bridgeworld and legions.
00:00:18.634 - 00:00:40.930, Speaker B: And so that was our approach of this interoperability thesis. Like a Nintendo. There are first part Beths and IPS, but at the same time, what Magic sort of unlocked for a lot of people was the ability for other games to come into Treasure. My aspiration is that we no longer have to refer to this moniker of the decentralized Nintendo in a few years and we just call it treasure.
