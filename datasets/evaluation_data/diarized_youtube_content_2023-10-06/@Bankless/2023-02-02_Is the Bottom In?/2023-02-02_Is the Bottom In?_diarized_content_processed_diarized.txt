00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.082, Speaker A: Have we already seen the bottom for at least assets like Bitcoin and ETH?
00:00:03.146 - 00:00:28.290, Speaker B: ETH and Seoul have seen their bottoms. I think there's a small chance BTC could revisit its bottom. Seoul's three X off its bottom, and ETH is two X off its bottom, BTC's 50% off its bottom, and BTC's the first to be like majorly influenced by a bad situation in macro land. Even though I expect things to continue to ameliorate year, it wouldn't surprise me in the second half of this year to have some major shock.
