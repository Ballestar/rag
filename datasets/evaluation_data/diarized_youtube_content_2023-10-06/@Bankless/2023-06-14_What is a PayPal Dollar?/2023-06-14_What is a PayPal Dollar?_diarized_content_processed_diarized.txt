00:00:05.060 - 00:00:11.242, Speaker A: It is electronic money. So when you have a dollar in your PayPal balance that is backed by funds that are held in bank accounts.
00:00:11.306 - 00:00:17.662, Speaker B: Every dollar in PayPal is backed one to one with a dollar somewhere in a bank account. Is that correct? What banks does PayPal use.
00:00:17.716 - 00:00:30.690, Speaker A: As a company? We operate in 200 markets. The banking relationships that we have is international. I couldn't tell you at the top of my mind the names of the banks. We are active globally. And again, I think that we are one of the few financial institutions that I know that is active in 200 markets.
