00:00:00.170 - 00:00:45.940, Speaker A: I have a $36,000 monkey, and that's my pass to get into some kind of elite new york city nightclub. It's like, if I were to go to a new york city nightclub, I'd almost want to let's see, what would I want out of a new york city nightclub? One is that I would want it to open at 04:00 a.m. Instead of closing at 04:00 a.m., because I think people who have the discipline to wake up in the morning are probably are possibly more interesting. I would want to possibly exclude people who have a monkey that cost more than $30,000, pretty much the exact opposite of what the new york city monkeysian is doing right now. Right. So you're just not going to get a great culture when you have people that just don't have problems for themselves personally, that cryptocurrency can solve other than getting rich off of other people's problems.
