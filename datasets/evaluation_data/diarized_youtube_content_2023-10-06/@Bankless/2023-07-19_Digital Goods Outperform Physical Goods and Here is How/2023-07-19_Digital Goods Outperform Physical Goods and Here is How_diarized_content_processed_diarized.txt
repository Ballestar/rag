00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.426, Speaker A: Let's say you're going to buy a $200,000 Patek Grand Complications and it's on your wrist. How many people are going to see it on your wrist? Like maybe 10,000 people. And so that's effectively $20 CPA per conversion of person that sees it. And now you get their social capital. If instead you buy and spend $200,000 on digital items, whether that's Skins and Fortnite or NFTs on your Twitter profile, a million people could see it. You have one tweet that goes viral and a million people will see that tweet and they see your picture. So it's effectively $0.20
