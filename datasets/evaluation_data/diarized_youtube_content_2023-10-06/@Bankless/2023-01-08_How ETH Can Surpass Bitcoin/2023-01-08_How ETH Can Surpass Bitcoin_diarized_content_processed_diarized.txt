00:00:00.090 - 00:00:24.126, Speaker A: I think ether versus bitcoin can go up way faster than what people expect, because we are in proof of stake with EIP 1559, like we are in a new paradigm of ether price action. And so, like, the previous coupled relationship that we had with bitcoin from proof of work, I think, is much more broken. And so I tweeted out this tweet. The lappening is going to be ten times easier than the flipping. What's? The lappening, David. Oh, I'm so glad you asked your private meme. Yeah.
00:00:24.126 - 00:00:50.380, Speaker A: And so the flipping is when Ether flips bitcoin in market cap. The lappening is when Ether is worth two X. What bitcoin is, what I'm saying here is that it's taken a ton of work to even come remotely close to the flipping. We're, like, less than 50% of the way there. Although I do think we're closer than we actually perceive it to be. What I'm saying is, once we do flip bitcoin, when we get to two X bitcoin, that is going to be ten times easier than getting to the flipping. Because once you flip bitcoin, it's so easy just to do it again and again.
