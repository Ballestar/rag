00:00:00.090 - 00:00:04.090, Speaker A: A project that's seriously trying to build a new country for Africa using crypto.
00:00:04.170 - 00:00:39.890, Speaker B: What gives you guys the confidence to say that, hey, we're going to found a new country and change the shape of Africa first? We are descendants of people who did more with less. So it's like we owe it to ourselves to do more with more. One of the inspirations for us was when Balaji said because the brand new is unthinkable, we fight over the old. That just seems as a quote that encapsulates how we feel as Africans. Net enables us today to really dream that big because it acts as an equalizer. We're still getting laughed out the room now, but we're not getting laughed out as much because of the tools that exist today. So I think that it's just the right timing and the tools do exist for us to be able to build for that digital nation.
