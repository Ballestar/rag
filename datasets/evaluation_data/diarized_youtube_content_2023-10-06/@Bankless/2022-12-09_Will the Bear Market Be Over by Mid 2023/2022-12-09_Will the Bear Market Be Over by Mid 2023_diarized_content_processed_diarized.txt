00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.630, Speaker A: I'm thinking like 2024. 2025 is when I'm planning my bull market.
00:00:03.700 - 00:00:12.350, Speaker B: I think it's going to be sooner than that because the second the market sniffs it out, the market usually prices these things out six to twelve months before the reality actually even happens.
00:00:12.420 - 00:00:16.542, Speaker C: So market continues to go down for a while, but then starts to turn in 2023.
00:00:16.596 - 00:00:28.882, Speaker B: I think the turn happens in 23. Yeah. If you ask me, I think around mid 23 potentially is when things happen. We've been in a bear market now for a year. Usually bear markets don't lasts more than 18 months. It all kind of lines up. Even in a tough recessionary environment.
00:00:28.882 - 00:00:38.054, Speaker B: I mean, stocks could go 20% lower from here, but nonetheless, that would put it within an average 40% decline. Is not crazy for a recessionary. Bear market mid.
00:00:38.092 - 00:00:42.950, Speaker C: 2023. And David, if crypto has front run that by six months, then we already bottom.
00:00:43.020 - 00:00:43.906, Speaker UNK: I just want to say, Ryan.
00:00:43.938 - 00:00:46.050, Speaker A: You'Re running out of time to get your three digit ether brother.
