00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.114, Speaker A: Vitalik was hacked.
00:00:01.162 - 00:00:14.154, Speaker B: Vitalik got SIM, swapped, and that's how they got access to his Twitter. I think $691,000 and a couple crypto punks from some OGS got drained. OGS fell for this? Because maybe they're just not on Twitter. It's a Twitter skill, not a web. Three skill.
00:00:14.202 - 00:00:28.820, Speaker A: Vitalik's Twitter account published this tweet. It's basically to celebrate Protodank Sharding. You can mint an NFT. If you go to try to mint this NFT, there's some malicious code that will actually drain your wallet. Yep, some crypto native people actually fell for this because it's Vitalik's official account.
