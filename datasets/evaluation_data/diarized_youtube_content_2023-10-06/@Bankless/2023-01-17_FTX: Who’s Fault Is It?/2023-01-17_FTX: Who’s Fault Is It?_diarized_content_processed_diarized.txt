00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.438, Speaker A: Who is at fault for the FTX fiasco? Actually.
00:00:03.524 - 00:00:37.060, Speaker B: Well, I think you have to blame the governance structure at FTX. Above all, it's remarkable to me how few sob stories have come know. Probably a fair amount of it was pretty wealthy people. And if you put a lot of money in a non US regulated exchange that deliberately located in the Bahamas, I don't want to say it's your fault, but to me it's sounds a bit like saying, well, you lost a lot of money betting on NBA games. Like, a lot of the time you win, a lot of the time you don't win. And if you're putting money in a crypto exchange in the Bahamas, even without fraud, you should be prepared to lose that money.
