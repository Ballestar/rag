00:00:00.170 - 00:00:33.602, Speaker A: The first benefit is UX if wallets can identify the exact format they're expecting for a sign in message. If this is just the standard across all DApps and wallets can just recognize this format and it literally looks like a login button. That's a much nicer user experience for people. The second thing is security. If the wallet can inspect the data inside that message to be signed, we can add guarantees. If example wants you to sign in, the wallet can identify that message structure and make sure that we're being served this by example proper over a secured connection. It's called domain binding.
00:00:33.602 - 00:00:38.290, Speaker A: The wallet will just give you a big red flag. Like if you go to a website with a bad certificate.
