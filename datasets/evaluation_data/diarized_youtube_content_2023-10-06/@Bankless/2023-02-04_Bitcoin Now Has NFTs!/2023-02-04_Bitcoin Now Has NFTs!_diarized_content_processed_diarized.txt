00:00:01.386 - 00:00:11.162, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's this new protocol called Ordinals. Allows you to mint and store data on the bitcoin blockchain with no external dependencies. These NFTs are on the bitcoin blockchain forever.
00:00:11.226 - 00:00:20.202, Speaker B: So it's not like in IPFS or Rweave. This is actually on the bitcoin blockchain. You have to pay fees in order to store this data on bitcoin blockchain.

00:00:21.482 - 00:00:25.462, Speaker B: Gas bitcoin is now entering NFTs. I'm sure everyone was really excited about this.
