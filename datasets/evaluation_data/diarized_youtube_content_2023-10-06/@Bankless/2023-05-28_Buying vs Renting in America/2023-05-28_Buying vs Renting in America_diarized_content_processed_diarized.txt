00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.902, Speaker A: A chart on buying versus renting in America today. We've got a yellow line. The cost to buy right now, 2700 per month for a mortgage versus the cost to rent is 1850. This just looks like asset price inflation. People are in their twenty s in their early 30s, never purchased a home. And they're like, I can't afford it. I'm just going to be renting for the rest of my life.
00:00:21.956 - 00:00:30.530, Speaker B: The cost of rent is also at an accelerating rate too. Both are up. It just is a graph of like man, the cost of living sucks right now. It is hard to be alive.
