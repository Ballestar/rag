The problem is, is when rates go up, bonds are inversely correlated to rates. So the price of Treasuries went down, but the Fed holds a lot of Treasuries. So the Fed, too, lost $42 billion. Not that it matters.
00:00:17.882 - 00:00:21.226, Speaker B: You'Re saying, well, the Fed is also a bank. They also had that on their balance sheet.
00:00:21.258 - 00:00:21.966, Speaker A: But it's also just not.
00:00:21.988 - 00:00:23.582, Speaker B: A problem because they can print money. Correct.
00:00:23.636 - 00:00:25.060, Speaker A: When you create your own currency, it doesn't matter.
