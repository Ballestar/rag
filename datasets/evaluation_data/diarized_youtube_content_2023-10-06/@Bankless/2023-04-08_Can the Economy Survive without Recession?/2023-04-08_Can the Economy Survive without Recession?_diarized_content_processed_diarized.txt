00:00:00.250 - 00:00:28.770, Speaker A: If inflation does come down quickly because of the banking crisis and the Fed is able to pivot and unemployment doesn't increase, then that could be saved in time. That is the needle that needs to be threaded. That's exactly right. If the Fed pivot happens before a recession is actually starting, if inflation comes down fast enough, liquidity improves, et cetera. It's extremely bullish for risk assets. So the big question is, can the economy survive without going into a recession by the time the Fed pivots? Because the Fed will eventually pivot. The question is, does the Fed pivot? Too late.
