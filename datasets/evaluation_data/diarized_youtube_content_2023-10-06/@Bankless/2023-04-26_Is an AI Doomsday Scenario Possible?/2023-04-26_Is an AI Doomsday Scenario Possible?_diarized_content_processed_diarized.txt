00:00:00.250 - 00:00:06.410, Speaker A: What is your percentage likelihood of the full out doom scenario where we're all gonna die from the machines?
00:00:06.490 - 00:00:14.302, Speaker B: I think maybe there's something like a 1020 percent chance of AI takeover. Many most humans dead really.
00:00:14.356 - 00:00:14.670, Speaker A: High.
00:00:14.740 - 00:00:15.230, Speaker B: I agree.
00:00:15.300 - 00:00:17.342, Speaker A: Better than a hundred, David. Just better than hundred percent.
00:00:17.396 - 00:00:30.180, Speaker B: So because other ways that the development of AI can be rough, you can have access to new destructive physical technology and that adds up to at least another 10% over all. Maybe you're getting more up to like 50 50 chance of doom shortly after you have systems that are at human level.
