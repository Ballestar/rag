00:00:00.090 - 00:00:33.890, Speaker A: And what's the significance of saying spot bitcoin versus just bitcoin ETF? We have bitcoin futures ETFs. Most of them hold, like the front month futures contract. You enter an agreement to either buy or sell bitcoin at the end of a month, and you can trade that right via futures contracts. Holding these futures can be bad, detrimental long term returns. The holy grail here would be to have a physically backed spot bitcoin ETF, meaning the bitcoin is stored in cold storage somewhere, and you have the shares of the ETF are a right to the underlying asset. In this case, spot bitcoin. Whereas in the futures ETFs that the SEC has approved, you have a right to those futures contracts.
