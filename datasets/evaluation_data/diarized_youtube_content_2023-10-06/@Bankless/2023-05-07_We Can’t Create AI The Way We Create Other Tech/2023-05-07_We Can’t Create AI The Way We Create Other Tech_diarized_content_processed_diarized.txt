00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.754, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on AI these days? We should be scared of existential risk here. It's not necessarily wise.

We have to not create this thing the way we've created all the other things. V one is buggy. We now have a buggy god on the planet.
00:00:21.754 - 00:00:29.810, Speaker A: Somehow we need to spread enough fear that people start saying it is the only way to build AI is to do it ethically and to do it with a ton of AI safety research alongside.
