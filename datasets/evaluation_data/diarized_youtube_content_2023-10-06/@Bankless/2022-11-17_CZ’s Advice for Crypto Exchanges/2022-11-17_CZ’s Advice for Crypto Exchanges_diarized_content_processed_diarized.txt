00:00:00.090 - 00:00:32.034, Speaker A: I would recommend most businesses have at least ten years of runway, ten years of cash if they have zero income, very few traditional companies can achieve that. But in the blockchain world, it's actually not that hard to achieve. The finance coin is about $40 billion market cap. We have the team portion we never used and we do commit to burn that, but we also have income like even the team portion was double digit billion dollars. So most crypto companies, if they manage wealth, they could be sitting on this really large cash reserve also in the crypt to business they are very clear, very simple business models. You should have revenue. And because we're dealing with crypto money, we're dealing with this industry.
00:00:32.034 - 00:00:34.580, Speaker A: It's actually not difficult for good businesses to make money.
