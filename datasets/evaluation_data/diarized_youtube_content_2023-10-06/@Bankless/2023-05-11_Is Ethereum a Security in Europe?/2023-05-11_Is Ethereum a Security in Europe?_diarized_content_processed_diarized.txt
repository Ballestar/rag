00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.006, Speaker UNK: If I went to a governance body in Europe and.
00:00:03.028 - 00:00:04.846, Speaker A: I asked, is Ether a security?
00:00:04.948 - 00:00:05.774, Speaker UNK: What would the answer be?
00:00:05.812 - 00:00:30.020, Speaker A: They would basically say, we want to know is this an existing financial instrument or is this something new? And so in kind of European terms, you would say, is this a MiFID instrument? So is it an existing financial instrument that fits in there? Or is it a Meeka instrument for which we've got new rules? The direction of travel, if you ask this question in Europe, I think, is very clear. Ether would not be an existing financial instrument. It would be an other financial token to which the rules under Meeka apply.
