00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.414, Speaker A: Aren't you just talking about digital money? Why is this crypto money different or important?
00:00:04.532 - 00:00:35.750, Speaker B: The use case is medium scale investments and charity donations, quickly routing money to medical organizations, investing in startups. These are all cases where cryptocurrency is actually significantly more efficient. China launches DCEP, and that could easily get a lot of adoption in China. But would people be willing to use it in Vietnam or singapore? I don't know. Whereas cryptocurrency has very international reach already, even today, having 10% of your national economy carried out in cryptocurrency. Is much less scary than 10% of your economy suddenly being carried out in US. Dollars.
00:00:35.750 - 00:00:57.100, Speaker B: Right, because in the second case, the US. Government has power over you because of its neutrality. Cryptocurrency has an advantage. There are places where existing fiat financial systems are very unconnected, where the banking system doesn't necessarily even wants to connect, because just almost no incentive for them to. Those are the kinds of places where a cryptocurrency just has clearer use cases even today.
