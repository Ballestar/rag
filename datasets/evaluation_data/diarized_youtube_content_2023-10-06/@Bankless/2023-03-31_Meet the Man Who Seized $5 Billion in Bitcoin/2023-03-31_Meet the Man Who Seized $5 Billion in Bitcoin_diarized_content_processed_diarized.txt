00:00:00.170 - 00:00:13.642, Speaker A: The arrest of the founder of the Silk Road, Russ Albrecht, resulted in the largest seizure of bitcoins to date ever. It was something like 133K bitcoins, which is worth $4.2 billion as of the time of recording.
00:00:13.706 - 00:00:21.118, Speaker B: You sort of undersold me a tad. It was 177,000 bitcoins. Once we got the the bitcoins off of Ross's laptop, too.
00:00:21.204 - 00:00:25.510, Speaker A: Could you ever imagine that ten years later, this would be worth billions of dollars?
00:00:25.580 - 00:00:27.940, Speaker B: No. I would have predicted the crash of bitcoins after that.
