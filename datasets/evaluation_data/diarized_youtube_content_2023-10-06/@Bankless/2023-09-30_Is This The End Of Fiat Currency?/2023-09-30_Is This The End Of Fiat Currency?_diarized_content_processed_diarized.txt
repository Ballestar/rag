00:00:00.090 - 00:00:11.130, Speaker A: Rates are going to stay high because the time of Fiat is drawing to a close. And I actually think that the business model for on chain Treasuries is also an indication of the long term close of the Fiat era.
00:00:11.210 - 00:00:13.726, Speaker B: I don't know if the Fiat cycle is to an end.
00:00:13.908 - 00:00:15.166, Speaker A: Multiple decades, very.
00:00:15.188 - 00:00:42.420, Speaker B: Long term, I think governments are gonna issue their own stable coins on chain, right? So Argentina is going to issue Argentum on chain. Right now there's conversations about dollar rising in Argentina. So taking out the central bank because we clearly don't know how to handle a currency. I think that it's insane inflation. Argentina is over 100% now. Instead of going to the dollar, can you go to your own ERC 20 with a cap supply or with a fixed emission and automate that central bank and some countries where the central bank is not credible, I think that's where it's going to start.
