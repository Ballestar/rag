00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.574, Speaker B: Mark Cuban's wallet got drained for almost a million dollars. What are we looking at here?
00:00:04.612 - 00:00:18.010, Speaker A: We are looking at Mark Cuban's wallet getting drained. That's what it is. So the wallet was inactive for 160 days. And I think maybe Mark Cuban just decided to do some spring cleaning. But in that time, it looks like he downloaded a malicious form of MetaMask. And as soon as he typed in his password, then boom.
00:00:18.090 - 00:00:26.998, Speaker B: It's bad. So this is what Cuban said, his direct quotes. I went on MetaMask for the first time in months. They must have been watching. I'm pretty sure I downloaded version of MetaMask with some shit in it.
00:00:27.084 - 00:00:27.620, Speaker A: I'm sorry, Mark.
