00:00:00.090 - 00:00:02.794, Speaker A: What are the first thoughts that come to mind when you hear the word macro in recession?
00:00:02.842 - 00:00:27.426, Speaker B: I've heard all the takes. Earnings might go down, the recession might be bad. There's a lot of evidence which suggests usually stocks bottom before the economy actually does. I don't find any of the macro doomer predictions too compelling. There are a lot of people who thought the world was going to end last year, that oil was going to 300 and we were going to be trading sticks of butter for like wood. But that just didn't come to pass. And I think now with interest rates hopefully having peaked, we're on the other side of a market that's driven by liquidity and interest rates.
00:00:27.426 - 00:00:32.290, Speaker B: And that's how I think about macro. I mean, macro doesn't need to be super favorable, it just needs to be like not entirely hostile.
