00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.300, Speaker A: The owner of twitter handle at x tried to sell it for $1 million. And minutes ago, twitter or x elon took it away from him and transferred the old at twitter account to it and the owner received $0. Point is like your handle on x, you don't own this is elon's app. When I tweet, I am tweeting on elon's private property. I am a serf for lord elon. And as a user, you don't necessarily have rights all this platform, you don't have any assets that you own.
