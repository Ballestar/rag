00:00:00.090 - 00:00:19.546, Speaker A: The Federal Reserve is the only institution in the world that can create new U. S. Dollars out of thin air. When the Fed creates new dollars, it's like putting water into a swimming pool. And that swimming pool is called the monetary base. It's like how many original new dollars the Fed has created. So when the Fed creates more dollars, that monetary base grows.
00:00:19.546 - 00:00:43.830, Speaker A: And when the Fed basically sucks dollars out of circulation, the monetary base shrinks. For the first 995 years of its existence, the Fed kind of gradually and steadily created more dollars. It expanded the monetary base to be about $900 billion. And then between eight and 14. Okay. In about five and a half years, the Fed created three and a half trillion new dollars. That's 303 x.
00:00:43.830 - 00:00:48.820, Speaker A: More than three X, the way I put it is more than three centuries of money printing in about four and a half years.
