00:00:00.090 - 00:00:09.406, Speaker A: When the judge asked, what do you plead Sam Bankman freed? He said not guilty. I'm innocent. I know there's been some conspiracy. Maybe he has some get out of jail free card. What do you think about this?
00:00:09.508 - 00:00:17.262, Speaker B: The plea deal that he got was so bad that he was like, damn it, I'll just fight this. They basically gave him zero compromises on his plea deal.
00:00:17.316 - 00:00:32.790, Speaker A: Well, this is an interesting opinion piece read in CoinDesk. Basically, the idea that maybe Sam Bankman Fried actually is so deluded that he thinks he's innocent. He thinks that he is the victim. And I think that's the case with Sam Bankman Freed. What's the probability that Sam goes to jail this year?
00:00:32.860 - 00:00:35.318, Speaker B: I think it would be rational to bet my net worth.
00:00:35.404 - 00:00:37.000, Speaker A: Yeah, your net worth.
00:00:37.530 - 00:00:38.246, Speaker B: It would not be.
00:00:38.268 - 00:00:40.740, Speaker A: Rational because there's no upside. David, you don't have to do that.
