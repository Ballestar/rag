00:00:00.090 - 00:00:21.774, Speaker A: We're looking at a log east chart. What am I doing here? The bull market of 2021 had two tops. There's a double top. The bear market had a double bottom. And so I have loosely lined up the double top of the bull market with a double bottom of the bear market, and they kind of line up. The point is, it's about the same amount of time we are here. The bull market and the bear market are about right now, the same length at some time.
00:00:21.774 - 00:00:26.050, Speaker A: We're done being bearish. And so I'm saying you have permission nation to be bullish.
