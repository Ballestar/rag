00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.422, Speaker B: DC. What if we made somebody so bullish? They're like, oh, second mortgage. I'm YOLOing in. They're just like, all in. Is that the way to do this?
00:00:07.476 - 00:00:32.674, Speaker A: First of all, I'd say definitely don't borrow money to buy cryptocurrency. Certainly not at a bottom. I mean, because you never know where the bottom is. Rather than give advice to you, I'm going to tell you what I'm doing. I'm accumulating a bigger addition to my Ethereum holdings over the course of the next at least one year, probably up to two years. If you're looking at this and you're saying, hey, I'm really excited about Ether, I would say start dollar costing averaging in. The important thing, I think, is being consistent.
00:00:32.674 - 00:00:54.574, Speaker A: As Justin said, over the ten year time horizon, the full case for digital assets being ownable is absolutely massive. I was talking to my neighbor and he was telling me how his daughter prefers to be paid in Ether when she babysits. She's like 14 years old. And so I really think that paradigms are changing. Changing. That doesn't happen overnight, but it will happen over time. You want to be here for that.
00:00:54.574 - 00:00:57.020, Speaker A: Don't make the mistake. Now is not the time to walk away.
