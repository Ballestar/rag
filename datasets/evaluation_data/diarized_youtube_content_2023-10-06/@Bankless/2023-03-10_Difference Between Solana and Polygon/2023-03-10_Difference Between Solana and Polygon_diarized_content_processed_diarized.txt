00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.850, Speaker A: What's the difference between solana and polygon? The Polygon ecosystem feels today is just a lot less built out, honestly, than where Solana is at, because Solana has been forced to just rebuild everything that existed on ETH in terms of a lot of infrastructure. So I think the biggest trade offs at a high level are just polygon feels a lot earlier today in terms of the community and culture side of the PFP ecosystem, where Solana's definitely gotten its own brand. And I think on Solana, projects focused more around utility, more around builders has definitely been the main narrative.
