00:00:00.090 - 00:00:27.826, Speaker A: The Department of justice wants to charge Binance with fraud, but they're not going to out of fear that it will cause an FTX style run on the bank. Either CZ and Binance are completely solvent. DOJ doesn't understand how to tell the difference between FTX and Binance, or Binance does have a hole in its balance sheet and the Department of justice does know something. And so this is a real concern. I'm going to go with the former because I've heard about 5000 finance Fuds.
00:00:27.858 - 00:00:30.182, Speaker UNK: But CZ's response, as usual, is what?
00:00:30.236 - 00:00:30.694, Speaker A: Four?
00:00:30.812 - 00:00:31.510, Speaker UNK: What does that mean?
00:00:31.580 - 00:00:35.234, Speaker A: Four is his shorthand for ignore FUD fake news and attacks.
00:00:35.282 - 00:00:36.326, Speaker UNK: So nothing going on here?
00:00:36.348 - 00:00:37.540, Speaker A: Just four? Yeah. No matter what four.
