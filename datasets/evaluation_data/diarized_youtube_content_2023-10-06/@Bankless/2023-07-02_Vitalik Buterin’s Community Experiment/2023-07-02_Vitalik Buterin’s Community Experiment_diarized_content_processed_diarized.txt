00:00:00.090 - 00:00:09.454, Speaker A: In the last two months. I was in Montenegro at this thing called Zuzalu, a brainchild of vitalic. Butyrin Zuzalu a two month long experiment in a temporary community.
00:00:09.572 - 00:00:37.220, Speaker B: The way that I think about the experiment is conferences have thousands of people and they last for a week, right? And those already exist. Hacker houses last for a very long time, but they only have up to ten and 20 people. Well, what about something that has 200 people? So more than a hacker house and lasts for two months, so more than a conference, and it has both of those at the same time. Basically bring people together from a couple of different communities with some medium level of organization and just see what actually comes out of that.
