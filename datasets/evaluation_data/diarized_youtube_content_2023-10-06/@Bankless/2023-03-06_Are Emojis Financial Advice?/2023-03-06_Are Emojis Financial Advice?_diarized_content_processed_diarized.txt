00:00:00.170 - 00:00:35.026, Speaker A: This is from the NBA TOPSHOTS legislation. The judge says this the rocket ship emoji, stock chart emoji and money bags emoji objectively mean one thing a financial return on investment. If you are doing the rocket emoji or the moneybag emoji, david, you are giving financial advice on Twitter, according to this judge. Like, you can't just say an emoji is financial advice, can you? I mean, they're not wrong. That's why they're putting the emoji in there, though. If you don't want to buy a freaking movie of an NBA top shot, don't buy it. I think people have to have a bit of responsibility.
00:00:35.026 - 00:00:37.234, Speaker A: You're not going to filter the internet.
00:00:37.282 - 00:00:38.180, Speaker B: From these sorts of things.
