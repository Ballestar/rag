00:00:00.250 - 00:00:02.090, Speaker A: How do you define Molok?
00:00:02.170 - 00:00:31.940, Speaker B: It's a force of game theoretic incentives that leads agents within a competitive system to sacrifice more and more of their other values in order to win. So it's kind of like winning for winning sake, but its outcomes tends to be destruction of the wider ecosystem that is containing that game. It's the god of unhealthy competition. It's not the god of competition. Competition is a neutral thing. Competition can be used for good and it can be used for bad. Moloch is when competition is used for ill.
