00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.010, Speaker A: When Eliezer Yitkowsi says we're all going to die. What do you make of that? Do you think we're all going to die?
00:00:06.090 - 00:00:30.580, Speaker B: I want to describe the particular scenario Elieiser has in mind as a very particular scenario where you have to pile on a whole bunch of assumptions together to get to a particular bad end. And I want to say those assumptions seem somewhat unlikely, and piling them all together makes the whole thing seem quite unlikely. But nevertheless, you just think about a long term trajectory of civilization, it may well go places. That would scare you if you thought about that.
