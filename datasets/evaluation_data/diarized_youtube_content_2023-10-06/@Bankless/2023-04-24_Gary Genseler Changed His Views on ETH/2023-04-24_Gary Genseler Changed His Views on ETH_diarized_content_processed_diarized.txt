00:00:00.090 - 00:00:05.086, Speaker A: Remember that line of questioning from Patrick McHenry asking Gary is ether security? Is etha security.
00:00:05.188 - 00:00:15.246, Speaker C: And speaking to the tokens, there's ten to 12,000. I'm asking about one public. I said this in private. This should be no shock to you. I'm asking this question. I told you.
00:00:15.268 - 00:00:15.806, Speaker B: I was going to do this.
00:00:15.828 - 00:00:19.482, Speaker C: Ether a commodity or a security. And again, it depends on the facts.
00:00:19.546 - 00:00:20.538, Speaker B: He's not going to feel like he doesn't.
00:00:20.554 - 00:00:21.294, Speaker C: He knows he's not.
00:00:21.332 - 00:00:28.902, Speaker A: This is a clip from 2018 when he was a professor at MIT and he's giving a lecture on cryptocurrency and ethereum. Let's see what he has to say.
00:00:28.956 - 00:00:40.982, Speaker B: 2018. The securities and Exchange Commission has said regardless of what it might have been in 14, it's now sufficiently decentralized that we'll consider it not a security. Seemed pretty.
00:00:41.036 - 00:00:42.180, Speaker C: Chill with it back then.
