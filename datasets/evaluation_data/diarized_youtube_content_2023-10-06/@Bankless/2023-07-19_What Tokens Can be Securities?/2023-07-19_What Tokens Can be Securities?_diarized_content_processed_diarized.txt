00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.598, Speaker A: Tokens like Matic Atom cardano are securities. How can that possibly stand up now that XRP is ruled not a security?
00:00:07.684 - 00:00:34.450, Speaker B: Well, I think as to the tokens themselves, no difference. The logic holds. Judge Porris was clear in distinguishing Tokens from transactions involving the Tokens. So, to be clear, could there be transactions involving those assets that you listed that might be deemed securities? Yeah, for sure. But on the exchanges themselves, I don't think there is any credible way for anyone to argue that these other Tokens are securities when XRP is not in that scenario.
