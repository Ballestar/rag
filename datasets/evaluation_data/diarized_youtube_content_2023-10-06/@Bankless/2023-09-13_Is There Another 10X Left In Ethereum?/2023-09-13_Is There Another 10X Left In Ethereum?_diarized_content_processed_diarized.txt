00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.702, Speaker B: Do you think there's another ten X left in Ether? Price of e?
00:00:02.756 - 00:00:13.626, Speaker A: Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. But the thing is that, like, it's not gonna happen for a while, right? And these people, they don't want to wait years for a ten X. They want a ten X in, like, a week, which you can still get, mind you. But that's gambling. That's not investing.
00:00:13.626 - 00:00:20.702, Speaker A: You're throwing money at a meme coin hoping for a ten X. That's like throwing money at the casino, hoping for, like, black or something, right? It's the same thing.
00:00:20.756 - 00:00:29.140, Speaker B: Ten X is great. Who cares if that takes, like, three to five to ten years? Where else can you get that at this kind of risk minimized sort of state that we're in?
