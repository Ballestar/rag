00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.130 - 00:00:02.954, Speaker B: Hey, Dawson.
00:00:03.002 - 00:00:03.786, Speaker A: What's? Earnify?
00:00:03.898 - 00:00:11.834, Speaker B: Earnify is the AirDrop checker? Earnify is a Web three notification tool that will let you know of all the things you have to go claim for your wallet.
00:00:11.882 - 00:00:13.262, Speaker A: Claim for your wallet? What does that mean?
00:00:13.316 - 00:00:21.850, Speaker B: So claiming for your wallet is things like Airdrops Whitelists NFT mints. Earnify will check you for all these and let you know instantly what you have to go claim.
00:00:21.930 - 00:00:22.654, Speaker A: Why do I need it?
00:00:22.692 - 00:00:32.466, Speaker B: You need it because without Earnify, you don't know when you have unclaimed assets. This is tens of thousands of dollars sometimes that are just out there waiting for you for your wallet.
00:00:32.498 - 00:00:34.338, Speaker A: Specifically, how many people use Earnify?
00:00:34.434 - 00:00:38.562, Speaker B: There are over 250,000 people who trust Earnify for notifications.
00:00:38.626 - 00:00:44.378, Speaker A: Okay, so with Earnify, I plug in my Ethereum address, and it tells me what Airdrops I can collect, right?
00:00:44.464 - 00:00:49.110, Speaker B: Exactly. It allows you to do that for not just one address either. You can do it up to ten addresses?
00:00:49.190 - 00:00:52.170, Speaker A: Up to ten addresses. And so how much money have you made, people?
00:00:52.240 - 00:00:58.558, Speaker B: There are over $150,000,000 worth of Airdrops that have been found through Earnify since launching two years ago.
00:00:58.644 - 00:01:09.906, Speaker A: $150,000,000. So people have put in their Ethereum addresses, multiple of them, into Earnify, and Earnify has helped them claim $1.5 million.
00:01:10.008 - 00:01:13.250, Speaker B: Not just 1.5 million, $150,000,000.
00:01:13.320 - 00:01:19.954, Speaker A: Oh, excuse me. $150,000,000. That's amazing. Why did you make earnify? What inspired you to make it?
00:01:19.992 - 00:01:32.422, Speaker B: You know, I'm a crypto Dgen, just like all of you. I found that I had unclaimed Airdrops that I didn't know about, and so I made this tool originally for myself to check my wallets. And then it turned out that a lot of other people wanted the exact same set of features.
00:01:32.486 - 00:01:33.862, Speaker A: So is it just airdrops?
00:01:33.926 - 00:01:50.810, Speaker B: It is much more than just airdrops. So Earnify began originally from a hackathon two years ago as the AirDrop Checker. And now Earnify has expanded to pull up Tokens NFT Mints, Whitelists, and many other things, like pull up Raffles for just all the free things that you don't know about yet for your wallets.
00:01:50.890 - 00:01:52.602, Speaker A: So what do I get if I sign up for Earnify?
00:01:52.666 - 00:02:06.962, Speaker B: If you sign up for Earnify, you're going to be able to check your addresses right now, but you will also be signed up for email notifications when you match a new claimable asset in the future. So this means that when an AirDrop goes live, you can be the first to know that your wallets are in that AirDrop.
00:02:07.026 - 00:02:10.530, Speaker A: But you can also pay for Earnify. Right. What do you get if you pay for Earnify?
00:02:10.610 - 00:02:25.750, Speaker B: If you're a serious DFI user, you should pay for Earnify, because you'll be able to watch more than just two addresses. You'll be able to watch up to ten. And that means that you will get these email notifications for up to ten of your addresses. So you'll know more about all of the addresses that you have and all the assets that you can go claim.
00:02:25.830 - 00:02:29.178, Speaker A: How is Earnify different from any other AirDrop notification service?
00:02:29.264 - 00:02:55.602, Speaker B: AirDrop is much more than just an AirDrop notification service. AirDrop is the highest quality there is. Zero spam allowed. Everything is manually reviewed, tested and checked to make sure that it's worth your time. Not just your time, but also your money. Because I believe, just like everyone else who is on the bankless journey, that we should stay safe and avoid some of these spam issues, some of these bankruptcy issues that we've been seeing over in the CFI world.
00:02:55.656 - 00:02:58.014, Speaker A: What are Earnify's plans for the future? Is there a roadmap?
00:02:58.062 - 00:03:28.046, Speaker B: Earnify has huge plans for the future beyond just Airdrops. Earnify is going to be checking you for all the things that your wallet can have. So when New NFTs Drop, you can be notified of that when your ENS names are about to expire. You can be notified of that when anything happens on chain. You need to be enabled to respond to that with something like Earnify to notify you right away to go take action. Maybe your DeFi loans are about to get liquidated. Maybe the ENS name you've always wanted is about to go up for auction and you can bid on it.
00:03:28.046 - 00:03:30.220, Speaker B: Earnify will notify you of all these things in the future.
