00:00:00.090 - 00:00:19.870, Speaker A: We like to save the industry as much as possible, but not all projects are worth saving. If the projects are badly run, badly designed, other problems that are hard to fix. It's generally not good to put good money after bad money, right? You don't want to bail out companies that are mismanaged, but we do want to help the majority companies that have a little bit of a liquidity crunch to go through this cycle. And we're talking with 50 plus of them.
00:00:19.940 - 00:00:27.590, Speaker B: Wow. 50 plus of them. I think people are taking bets. And who's going to bail out more of these crypto companies? Is it SBF for CZ? I guess that remains to be seen.
00:00:27.660 - 00:00:38.290, Speaker A: Bakeless Nation, another emergency episode for you today. We are 24 hours after learning about the collapse of FTX, and a lot has happened since our last livestream.
