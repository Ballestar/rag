00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.462, Speaker A: David and myself whether we consider ourselves bitcoiners. We do. But it's been harder in recent days. I'll say the past year and a half actually say that publicly. There was a time, 2018, when no one cared if I called myself a bitcoiner, if I called myself a bitcoiner in, like, 2022. You're not a bitcoiner, you're a shitcoiner. No, I actually like bitcoin months.
00:00:16.462 - 00:00:27.090, Speaker A: My first asset. I have never sold a bitcoin that I have, and so you'll lose some fundamentalists along the way, but I think you'll broaden the tent in a way that is actually good for this movement that we all call bitcoin.
