00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.338, Speaker A: I know it's corny, but, like, we're.
00:00:01.354 - 00:00:02.366, Speaker B: Going to build our way out of it.
00:00:02.388 - 00:00:09.022, Speaker A: And now the amount of signal that we're going to have over what's being built over the next six to 18 months is going to be so high.
00:00:09.076 - 00:00:10.366, Speaker B: All of the hot air is out.
00:00:10.388 - 00:00:12.302, Speaker A: Of the industry, which just lets everyone.

00:00:21.796 - 00:00:23.630, Speaker B: I didn't like it. We got our wish.
00:00:24.450 - 00:00:30.100, Speaker A: Everything washed out too much. I mean, we're on the other side. And so now there's only signal. And so I am thankful for that.
