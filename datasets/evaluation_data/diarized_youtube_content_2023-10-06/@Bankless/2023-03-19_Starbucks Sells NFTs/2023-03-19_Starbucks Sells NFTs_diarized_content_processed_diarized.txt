00:00:00.250 - 00:00:12.538, Speaker A: Starbucks sold 2000 NFTs in 20 minutes. This is pretty big. What happened here? 2000 digital stamps. Look at this floor price of $650. Oh, they're very, very pretty. It's like the Starbucks mermaid. Different manifestations.
00:00:12.538 - 00:00:23.180, Speaker A: Yeah. What do they get you? Starbucks clout. Something about a Starbucks odyssey. I mean, Starbucks doesn't have great coffee, but hey, they got great NFT. Too much of a coffee snog to buy this Starbucks NFT. Yeah.
