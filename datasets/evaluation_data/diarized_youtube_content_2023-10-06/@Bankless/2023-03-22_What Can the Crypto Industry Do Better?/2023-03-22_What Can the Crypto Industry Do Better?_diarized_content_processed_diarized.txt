00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.602, Speaker A: What? Could people in Crypto be doing better? Well, look, you need to be asking whether something seems too good to be true. You need to be demanding transparency from centralized entities. Right, and then identifying bad actors and telling the regulators about those bad actors. You don't need to come crying to the government always for help. Sometimes a privately designed solution can be more effective. Telling the government about use cases is important. In the process of this, don't lose sight of those first principles.
00:00:27.602 - 00:00:32.100, Speaker A: We don't want the government to be involved in everything that happens on chain. Right.
