00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.114, Speaker A: The idea behind Crypto is really open source community products that are permissionless and anybody can kind of use them, build on them and take them to the next level. And you're not relying on some specific team. The team might play an important role and contribute, but they're not the single efforts that you're looking to to drive value. And so I do like to distinguish kind of these network assets that are really distributed and decentralized. And you can't point to any single person in the middle, as Gary Gensler would say, that's driving value. But that's really the distinction. I think it's a product design choice.
00:00:32.114 - 00:00:48.340, Speaker A: You can say like, we're going to decentralize this project as far as it can go and we're going to open it up, or we're going to go very much like security esque products where you get a distribution. Maybe you have to make periodic disclosures and offer prospectus and comply with the securities laws in that world.
