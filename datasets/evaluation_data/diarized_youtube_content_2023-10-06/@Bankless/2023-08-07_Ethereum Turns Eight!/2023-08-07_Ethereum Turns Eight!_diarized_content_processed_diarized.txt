00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.034, Speaker A: It's Ethereum's birthday. Ethereum turned.
00:00:03.082 - 00:00:24.962, Speaker B: Eight on July 30 is when the first proof of work block got minted by Ethereum in 2015. Eight years, man, that's what, like, second grade? $400 billion in secured value, 3.6 billion in annualized profits, and a total of 17.8 million blocks. That's not too bad for an eight year old. Not bad? Better than me at eight years old, that's for sure. Happy birthday, Ethereum.
00:00:24.962 - 00:00:25.060, Speaker B: Am.
