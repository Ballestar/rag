00:00:00.170 - 00:00:10.990, Speaker A: Bitcoin might have a run up to $40,000. Ether might have a run up to $3,000. People say the bull market's on and the bull market's not going to be on and people are going to try and trade it and they're going to, on net, lose money.
00:00:11.060 - 00:00:14.190, Speaker B: Is it a fallacy to think that every bear market plays out the same way?
00:00:14.260 - 00:00:28.450, Speaker A: I remember going through the last bear market and everyone was like, oh, next cycle, next cycle, next cycle. Like, doesn't that mean if everyone's saying it's not going to come, and then it totally came. And so I think that you just assume that it's going exactly how people expect it to with another cycle.
00:00:28.530 - 00:00:44.100, Speaker B: Crypto just plays out in fractals. This is the next fractal. We're just at higher numbers on the highs and higher numbers on the low, and now the cycles might lengthen. There might be kind of different timelines involved. I think the base guess is probably the right guess, which is just playing for another fractal. It's going to happen in the way it has in.
