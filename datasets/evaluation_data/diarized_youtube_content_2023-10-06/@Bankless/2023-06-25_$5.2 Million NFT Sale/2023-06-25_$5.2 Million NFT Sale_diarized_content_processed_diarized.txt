00:00:00.090 - 00:00:11.066, Speaker A: The goose, which is a ringer. One of the more famous art block collections has been sold for $5.4 million. It got sold to Punk 6529 previous podcast guests.
00:00:11.098 - 00:00:22.718, Speaker B: I look at this and I don't really feel Anything. It's not Something that I would even buy for like, $10. Right. But that's just me. I think What this says is really that NFTs are here to stay.
00:00:22.804 - 00:00:38.660, Speaker A: The goose is famous because of thuros Capital. Like, they bought it and then they got liquidated. But having a ringer be bought at $5.4 million in the middle of a bear market, I think absolutely cements art blocks as valuable. Like, these things aren't going to zero. There's always going to be a market for these.
