00:00:00.090 - 00:00:21.102, Speaker A: What do you think about Vitalik? What's your take on the guy? He's a genius. Everybody agrees. When I first met him, he showed me a python tool that he'd written to make Bitcoin multisig. This is back in 2013. I'd actually never seen multisig before. And he was the one who first showed me, like this command line tool to do that. I recognized right away that he was ahead of the curve on maybe what's possible here.
00:00:21.102 - 00:00:28.180, Speaker A: I also think that he's like a missionary. He really just cares and wants to invent new things and wants to improve the world.
