00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.198, Speaker A: Is Genesis going to take the entire crypto industry down?
00:00:03.284 - 00:00:09.182, Speaker B: Can you tell us the story of DCG Group Genesis Grayscale, and what we need to know at this point in time?
00:00:09.236 - 00:00:37.430, Speaker A: Almost a year and a half ago, barry Silbert, who's the head guy at Digital Currency Group, he tweets out there's a daisy chain of borrowers and lenders in the crypto space. Most well capitalized, but some are not. Lots of leverage still in the system, including some non obvious places important to understand counterparty risk and where the weak links are in the chain. Wow. Does that tweet hit different now, as it turns out, it would take a year for all of that daisy chain of liquidation events to show up. Genesis is the final piece of that puzzle.
00:00:38.010 - 00:00:39.474, Speaker B: We're calling the final domino.
00:00:39.522 - 00:00:53.130, Speaker A: We're calling the final domino. It is the foundation of everything. It is probably the biggest lending desk in all of crypto. It is the only prime brokerage for all of crypto. And so the fact that we have arrived here at Genesis is indicative of, like, this is the last domino.
