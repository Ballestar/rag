00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.382, Speaker A: What is Coinbase's plans at a high level to expand internationally? What does that look like?
00:00:04.436 - 00:00:21.002, Speaker B: We tend to look at international in two ways. One is the go deep markets and the other are the go broad markets. If you look at Europe, UK is our biggest international market. And then we have France, Germany, Italy, spain, Netherlands and Ireland. We're kind of going deep. Australia and Singapore, Canada and in Brazil as well. We're equally going broad.
00:00:21.002 - 00:00:32.050, Speaker B: We have interesting conversations with regulators in the Middle East and places like India in Tunisia as well. Ten major go deep markets internationally and then some other markets that we're going to cover more from a kind of go broad perspective.
