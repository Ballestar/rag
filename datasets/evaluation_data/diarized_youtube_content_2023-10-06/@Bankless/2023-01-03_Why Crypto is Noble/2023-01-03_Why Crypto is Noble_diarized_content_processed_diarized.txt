00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.334, Speaker A: All three of us here have a pretty good level of confidence that eventually society will ultimately become coordinated around crypto protocols. That future state of the world will align with the values that I see embedded into these things. So it's a little bit of just like a waiting game for adoption to slowly win out.
00:00:16.372 - 00:00:20.346, Speaker C: And the nice thing, David, is because it's opt in, we only get that adoption if we deserve.
00:00:20.378 - 00:00:21.214, Speaker A: It, right?
00:00:21.332 - 00:00:22.730, Speaker C: People have to choose crypto.
00:00:22.810 - 00:00:40.194, Speaker B: Yeah. That's what makes this a noble cause, is that none of it is based on coercion. No one holds bitcoin who doesn't want to hold bitcoin. It is not forced on any person. They opt into it and they can opt out just as easily at any time. If it doesn't further their interest, they can leave. That's what's so cool about it, and that's what puts it in stark contrast to fiat.
00:00:40.194 - 00:00:47.410, Speaker B: If your idea is so good that you have to force people to use it, that might be an indication that it's not that great. And crypto never has that. It has to win every single user.
