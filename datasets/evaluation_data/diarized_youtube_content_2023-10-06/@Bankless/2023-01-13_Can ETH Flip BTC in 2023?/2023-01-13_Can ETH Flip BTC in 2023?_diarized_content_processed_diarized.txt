00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.726, Speaker A: And remind me where's the flipping? Where are we now and where's the flipping? So right now we're at 0.776, and.
00:00:07.748 - 00:00:08.522, Speaker B: Then the flipping.
00:00:08.586 - 00:00:09.662, Speaker A: Is about here.
00:00:09.716 - 00:00:10.670, Speaker B: We need to get here.
00:00:10.740 - 00:00:18.894, Speaker A: ETH price just needs to double. So if ETH price hits, what, 3000 or something while bitcoin stays stagnant at this price, then we flip in, is that right?
00:00:18.932 - 00:00:27.202, Speaker B: Yeah. We need to hit zero. We need if bitcoin stays exactly the same price, we need ether to be $2,700. And we will flip bitcoin.
00:00:27.266 - 00:00:28.502, Speaker A: That doesn't seem that far away.
00:00:28.556 - 00:00:29.140, Speaker B: Doesn't seem that far.
