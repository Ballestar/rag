00:00:00.090 - 00:00:10.430, Speaker B: Millennial generation gen Z. How are they going to afford a home? We have, like, rapidly increasing fixed price mortgages and asset prices for the houses really haven't gone that down very much.
00:00:10.500 - 00:00:26.390, Speaker A: Yeah. So on the right you can see the mortgage rates, which, to your point, mortgage rates are now at about 7%. Very high. Right. We haven't seen that since before the global financial cris. But at the same time, housing prices have gone up a lot and they haven't really come down that much. And buyers can't afford basically stepped out of the market.
00:00:26.390 - 00:00:30.086, Speaker A: And you can see that here. There's no sales. Sales are virtually at zero.
00:00:30.188 - 00:00:38.054, Speaker B: I've heard buyers can't buy because of obvious reasons. Prices are still too high and mortgage rates are too high. Sellers also can't sell because they're locked into their super.
00:00:38.092 - 00:00:39.430, Speaker A: Low rates.
00:00:40.010 - 00:00:42.834, Speaker B: So they're fixed. So the housing market is just frozen.
00:00:42.882 - 00:00:52.650, Speaker A: That's exactly right. I think the stalemate is going to continue until the unemployment numbers pick up. So it all depends on the jobs market. If you want to really see prices falling en masse, you need the labor market to deteriorate.
