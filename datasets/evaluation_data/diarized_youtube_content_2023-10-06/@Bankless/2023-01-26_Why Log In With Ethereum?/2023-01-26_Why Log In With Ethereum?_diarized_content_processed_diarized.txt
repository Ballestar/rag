00:00:00.090 - 00:00:34.758, Speaker A: Why isn't this then login with Bitcoin or login with Salana? There are a lot of technology components specific to the Ethereum ecosystem that we really thought were constructive in building decentralized identity ecosystems. On top of the Ethereum builders have a certain expectation about how you sign messages. To begin with, we use EIP one nine one, which is personal sign from Ethereum. Bitcoin doesn't really have something like that. We wouldn't be able to solve custody the same way that an ecosystem of wallets can solve custody. Being able to zoom in on which tech stack we're able to do, we're able to have a lot of problems.
00:00:34.844 - 00:00:35.700, Speaker B: Just solve for us.
