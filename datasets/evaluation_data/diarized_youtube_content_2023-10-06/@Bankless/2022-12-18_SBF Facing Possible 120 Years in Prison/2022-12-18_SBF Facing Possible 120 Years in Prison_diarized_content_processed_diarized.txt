00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.614, Speaker B: SBF is in jail. How's that make you feel?
00:00:01.652 - 00:00:19.598, Speaker A: I was surprised. What doesn't make sense to me, David, is the whole, like, awe shucks. I didn't know anything about this speaking tour that he's been on. Good morning, America. And I was like, what does this guy know that we don't? You have some kind of a get out of jail free card. Surprised, but also, like, relieved. You actually can't escape from accountability after stealing $10 billion.
00:00:19.684 - 00:00:23.722, Speaker B: Look at that guy just getting escorted into a car by a bunch of Bahamian policemen.
00:00:23.786 - 00:00:25.302, Speaker A: That's where he was arrested, right?
00:00:25.476 - 00:00:26.534, Speaker B: In the Bahamas? Yeah.
00:00:26.572 - 00:00:28.918, Speaker A: This is footage. Look how many people they sent.
00:00:29.004 - 00:00:31.442, Speaker B: Yeah, they sent a lot of policemen.
00:00:31.506 - 00:00:32.486, Speaker A: What did they expect?
00:00:32.588 - 00:00:43.158, Speaker B: SBF has been charged with wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering. That's a lot of things. That is life.
00:00:43.244 - 00:00:44.980, Speaker A: Something like 120 years or something like this.
