00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.874, Speaker A: Is crypto worth it when you have greater surface area for the frauds and the scammers, and anyone can launch their own coin and send it to the moon? What do you think about this argument?
00:00:08.922 - 00:00:32.340, Speaker B: Well, I don't think you can send your own coin to the moon anymore. It was a bad state of affairs when you could. On the issue of scammers, I view it this way because of the internet plus AI, the supply of scams is now infinitely elastic. Now, crypto is a kind of intermediate step in the amazing proliferation of scams, so you can blame crypto for that. But with or without crypto, it was headed toward infinitely elastic supply anyway.
