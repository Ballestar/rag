00:00:00.250 - 00:00:28.786, Speaker A: Do you know how many times I've been told crypto is a scam? Like, I value my average non crypto views. Views on NFTs. Literally absolutely nothing. They're completely clues. What cracks me up is that people who use ethereum or maybe DeFi sometimes try to convince me that NFTs are a scam. I'm like you looked yourself in the mirror. Do you have any slightest self awareness of what industry you're in? Literally every single person says has said the exact same thing about every stage of crypto development from the time they've heard of Bitcoin.
00:00:28.786 - 00:00:36.020, Speaker A: It's all a scam, a bubble, a pump and dump. It's over, it's done, it's dead. I am a hardened veteran of being yelled at.
