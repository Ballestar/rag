00:00:00.250 - 00:00:09.166, Speaker A: So rumors got circulated that the DOJ was going after an exchange that started with the letter B. I don't know how that letter B rumor got out there, but it definitely did. Alright, so what was it?
00:00:09.188 - 00:00:10.094, Speaker B: What did it end up being?
00:00:10.132 - 00:00:26.982, Speaker A: Crypto exchange bitlazo. The founder was arrested. Do you even know what this exchange is? Dude, that was the big B. So this showed up in the chart. So this is what caused Ether to go from $1600 down to like, 1490. And then this news came out. It just like pumped right back up to like 1550.
00:00:27.036 - 00:00:28.918, Speaker B: The bits lotto news. Does it change anything?
00:00:29.004 - 00:00:32.882, Speaker A: I mean, what even is it? This isn't even a thing. So nothing's changing.
00:00:32.946 - 00:00:40.580, Speaker B: I think what we might see is more of the trend of more agencies coming out with kind of these theatrical performances of who they're going to kind of go after next.
