00:00:00.250 - 00:00:06.510, Speaker B: What about 2024? Who's gonna be running? Who's gonna win? Is this a Biden versus Trump thing again? Most likely, yes.
00:00:06.580 - 00:00:08.190, Speaker A: I don't see a current way.
00:00:08.260 - 00:00:09.354, Speaker B: Out of that predicament.
00:00:09.402 - 00:00:12.234, Speaker A: I believe, like, status quo. Right now, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
00:00:12.282 - 00:00:15.358, Speaker B: Will be the nominees of their major parties and will be headed up against each other.
00:00:15.444 - 00:00:17.662, Speaker A: What are the odds that if Joe Biden is.
00:00:17.716 - 00:00:19.210, Speaker B: Elected that he dies?
00:00:19.290 - 00:00:32.390, Speaker A: Take a look at an extra royal table, my friend. Not good. Look, there are a couple of ways out of this. One is either, man dies. Second, Trump is indicted and convicted. Although it's not without president that you can run for president from prison. So that could set up interesting.
00:00:32.390 - 00:00:37.270, Speaker A: What? That would be interesting? A socialist candidate did it in, like, 1920 something.
00:00:37.340 - 00:00:37.794, Speaker B: I forget.
00:00:37.842 - 00:00:38.420, Speaker A: I forget his name.
