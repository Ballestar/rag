00:00:00.090 - 00:00:04.362, Speaker A: How would you summarize what the actual PayPal strategy is for hooking into these blockchains?
00:00:04.426 - 00:00:33.140, Speaker B: We believe payments and commerce will move to digital currencies, so, cryptocurrencies, Fiat, back, stable coins, even CBDCs. What I'm the most interested in is programmable fast, low cost payment. If you are able to run transactions at transaction or one 10th of a cent per transaction, then there is a bunch of stuff that you could not do in payments before, that you can't do now. You can do micro payments, you can do business models that were not possible with the old traditional financial breaks. And that's the reason that we were so intrigued by it.
