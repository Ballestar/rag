00:00:00.170 - 00:00:19.178, Speaker A: Question for you. How many Americans do you think own crypto right now? There are 330,000,000 Americans. 520 million. 10 million more. Five X. That 50,000,001 in five Americans own crypto right now. That is five X more Americans than own an electric vehicle.
00:00:19.178 - 00:00:32.454, Speaker A: That's a weird stat. They're putting the crypto users into, like, political cohorts. So here's another one. 3.5 x more Americans own crypto than belong to a trade union. 2.75 X more Americans that attended an NFL game.
00:00:32.454 - 00:00:45.700, Speaker A: This is two X more than American families who hold stock. That's unbelievable. I can't maybe who directly holds stock? So not through mutual funds. And this is more Americans than use Uber. Crypto is more popular than Uber. That's kind of cool. That's what coinbase says.
