00:00:00.090 - 00:00:48.326, Speaker A: I think there's a huge amount of opportunity, right? Like, if you can make a wallet that a billion people use, that's a huge opportunity. If you can make a stablecoin that can actually survive anything up to and including a us. Dollar hyperinflation doge forbid the US. Dollar hyperinflation actually ends up happening, then that's a huge opportunity as well. If you can create something that can actually be a lifeline for everyone going through that situation, if you can get sign in with ethereum to work, and you can unseat facebook and google and twitter as the kind of login overlords of the internet, that itself is a huge opportunity. There are still huge things that are left unclaimed that still can be built, but they're harder to build, right? Like, you can't just build obfuscated casinos and get people to throw $13 million in and just have a fairly quick path to victory. That's the place where I think the space is in now.
00:00:48.326 - 00:00:52.940, Speaker A: And I think the people that are going to be more success for are the people that are actually willing to put that kind of hard work in.
