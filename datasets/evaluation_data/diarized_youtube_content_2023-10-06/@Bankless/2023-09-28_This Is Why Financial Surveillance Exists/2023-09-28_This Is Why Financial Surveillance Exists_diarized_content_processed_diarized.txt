00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.186, Speaker A: Prior to, like, the 1970s, am I right to say there wasn't much financial surveillance? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's correct. And then in the 1970s, the US came out with a bank secrecy act, and this started the financial surveillance apparatus. And this is the reason, when I go to, like, transfer money or take out a large deposit from my bank, the bank teller will say, what are you doing with that? How are you using that money? They ask these questions. I'm always like, Why do you need to know this? It's almost couched, as if we want to protect you from frauds and scams.
00:00:27.186 - 00:00:40.530, Speaker A: Maybe that's part of it. Seems like more of it is kind of this financial surveillance apparatus. So that's why I have to present an ID. That is why they are asking questions like, what are you doing with the money? And can you tell me more about the source of the funds? And it all emanated from this legislation.
