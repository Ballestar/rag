00:00:00.170 - 00:00:17.214, Speaker A: A bear market. Buddy Crypto is hard enough. It's mentally exhausting. Your relatives think you're crazy. You're down bad right now in bear markets when everyone's feeling grumpy, my solution there is Bear Market Buddy. Alright? You need people who are going to like, call you on your BS. That for me, is actually the secret right now.
00:00:17.214 - 00:00:27.718, Speaker A: Honestly David, I wouldn't be doing this podcast without you. Feelings, there's no chance. So find your bear market buddies and just hang on. Could be months. Maybe. Hopefully it's just months, years. I don't know.
00:00:27.718 - 00:00:28.260, Speaker A: We don't know.
