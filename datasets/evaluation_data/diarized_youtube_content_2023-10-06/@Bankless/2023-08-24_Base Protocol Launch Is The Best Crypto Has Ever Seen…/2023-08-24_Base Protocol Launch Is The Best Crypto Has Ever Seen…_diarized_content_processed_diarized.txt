00:00:00.170 - 00:00:19.402, Speaker A: This was the best protocol launch that Crypto has ever seen. Wow. Zero hiccups bridging was seamless. Like, no one has had any problems UI UX of interacting with base is great, and there's a ton of apps. The first time I went on base, I ended up minting, like, five NFTs inside of two minutes. Really? And I redeemed one for a hat which is sitting on my wall over there. It's on chain hat.
00:00:19.402 - 00:00:30.194, Speaker A: It just says on chain. I like that. On chain hat. That's a great hat. You ready for this? 136,000 active wallets on the network. What? Yeah. Total number of 142,000 unique wallets.
00:00:30.194 - 00:00:30.900, Speaker A: Great success out of.
