00:00:06.522 - 00:00:14.062, Speaker A: The full loop is now available to do for anyone. You can take your Ether, you can go and stake it, and then you can withdraw the same day.
00:00:14.116 - 00:00:16.346, Speaker B: Would there be a run on all of the staked?
00:00:16.378 - 00:00:27.410, Speaker A: ETH $36 billion is now able to be withdrawn. And so there's a queue. $115,000,000 at current Ether prices can be deposited or withdrawn inside of a 24 hours period.
