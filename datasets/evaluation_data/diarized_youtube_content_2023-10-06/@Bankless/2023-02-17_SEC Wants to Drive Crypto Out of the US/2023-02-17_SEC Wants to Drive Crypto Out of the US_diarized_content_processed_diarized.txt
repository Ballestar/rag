00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.698, Speaker A: Is gensler and this administration not in net effect driving this business offshore.
00:00:04.794 - 00:00:29.462, Speaker B: That's exactly what's happening here. There's progress towards crypto laws and regulations overseas. We don't have that here. There was some momentum and FTX kind of blew everything up. Right. And so we don't have any sort of legislation that's being seriously considered without that legislative package. The regulators are just they're following the administration's general antagonism towards crypto and they would just want to beat it down over and over again until it's gone.
00:00:29.462 - 00:00:31.650, Speaker B: And of course it's not going anywhere except for overseas.
