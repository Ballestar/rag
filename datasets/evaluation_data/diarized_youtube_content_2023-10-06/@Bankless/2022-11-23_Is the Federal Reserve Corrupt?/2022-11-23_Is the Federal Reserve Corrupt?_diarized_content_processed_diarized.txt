00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.690, Speaker B: Kind of reinforced my view that elements of it have become corrupted. Maybe corrupted by the politics, maybe corrupted by Wall Street as well. So what do we do with this institution?
00:00:07.770 - 00:00:39.922, Speaker A: It cannot be overstated how much they have driven the wedge between the richest of the rich and everybody else. It's been stunning. And that is one of the most destabilizing factors in American life today. Just full stop. So what do we do with this institution? I do think it's been corrupted. It's this much broader institutional framework of whose the Fed's actions are benefiting and why it keeps taking these actions again and again in spite of the negative side effects. What comes next? I am not in the school of abolishing the Fed.
00:00:39.922 - 00:00:53.450, Speaker A: I have a very hard time seeing how we manage things without a strong central bank to create and manage a national currency for which there's a lot right on the US dollar reform is critical.
