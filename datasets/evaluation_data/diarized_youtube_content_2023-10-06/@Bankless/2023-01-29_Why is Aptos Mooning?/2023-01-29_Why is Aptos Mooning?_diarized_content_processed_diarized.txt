00:00:00.170 - 00:00:18.842, Speaker A: Did you know the fully diluted valuation of Aptos right now? 18 at 18 and $.6 billion, that is, did you know? Did you further know the fully diluted valuation of coinbase is 12 billion? Who the hell is buying this? This is a six X from January 8 real. It is an empty blockchain.
00:00:18.906 - 00:00:20.062, Speaker B: There's nothing going on there.
00:00:20.116 - 00:00:38.500, Speaker A: If you do that math of total locked value divided by fully diluted valuation, that means app Aptos is 53 X more in terms of its value in the market than Ethereum. I'm having trouble understanding why I'm not one to be so foolish to short anything in crypto. You just hate money, man. Is that really an enticing short?
