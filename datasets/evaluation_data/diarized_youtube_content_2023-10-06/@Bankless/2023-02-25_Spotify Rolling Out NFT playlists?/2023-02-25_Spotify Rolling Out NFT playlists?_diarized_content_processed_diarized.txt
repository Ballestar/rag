00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.734, Speaker B: Is Spotify rolling out token support.
00:00:02.852 - 00:00:18.590, Speaker A: What we are looking at is sign in with a wallet inside a Spotify mobile experience. Wow. Once you connect your wallet, apparently it changes the behavior of Spotify and unlocks certain experiences. Token Gated access to music content. Spotify. That's awesome.
00:00:18.660 - 00:00:33.090, Speaker B: For Android users only. Maybe it's not going to be available for Apple. They want to do their 30% tax on all NFT transactions. These sort of stupid gatekeeping just cannot stand because a competitor will just be like, fine, if you want to charge, we'll just support Android and then maybe I'll get rid of my iPhone.
