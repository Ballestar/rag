00:00:04.570 - 00:00:51.034, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. And today, on this episode of our Zuzalu series, we are exploring some new frontiers, new frontiers in new technologies, all of which are poised to completely revolutionize the world and change everything about the operating system that society is currently running. On this episode, we are exploring the frontier of synthetic biology, or Sinbio for short. Understanding synthetic biology is hard. Learning synthetic biology is a little bit like learning crypto. First, it's very confusing, and then you have an AHA moment, and then you see things like you've never seen them before, and there's no going back. So I'll do my best to first give you a primer before we enter our conversations with three of the biggest leaders in the synthetic biology world, including Drew Endy, the father of modern synthetic biology.
00:00:51.034 - 00:01:37.274, Speaker A: So, here we go. Synthetic biology combines biology, engineering, and computer science to design and construct new biological systems. With synthetic biology, you can manufacture biological components using biology. So synthetic biology is all about manipulating and reprogramming the DNA of living organisms to create new functions or traits that do not occur naturally, yet are still produced with organic means. We all know DNA as the instruction manual for living things. Simply put, synthetic biology is the act of rewriting DNA so that we can write our own instruction manual, like how we would write our own computer code. DNA is a Turing complete computational platform.
00:01:37.274 - 00:02:23.722, Speaker A: So the products that come out of synthetic biology are quite literally limitless. We can do anything. It's just a matter of how do we get the biological components to actually ingest the new DNA that we write like computer code? There are simple and down to earth applications of synthetic biology, such as engineering bacteria to produce medicines more efficiently. We can modify crops to make them more resistant to pests or drought. But the real reason why synthetic biology gets so crazy is that it is a brand new computational and manufacturing platform in which its limits start to quickly approach our own imaginations. Biology is a general purpose technology, and synthetic biology unlocks an entirely new frontier of technological production that we've never had before. So, Bankless Nation, take a moment to look around you.
00:02:23.722 - 00:03:16.598, Speaker A: Do you see all the material goods that you have? I have a desk here. There are some lights behind me. I drove in a car today. These are all physical materials that are produced in some factory and will all ultimately decay to reach the end of its lifespan and reenter the outside world, possibly, perhaps most likely through a landfill. With synthetic biology, instead of having a laborious, resource intensive manufacturing process, much of the material goods that we use and consume on a frequent basis can be grown, not manufactured. With synthetic biology, the dichotomy between human produced material goods and nature grown organic material really starts to blur. And our extremely inefficient analog methods of manufacturing can be replaced by systems that are hundreds of times more efficient and 99% less resource intensive.
00:03:16.598 - 00:04:18.970, Speaker A: So if you believe in the future of synthetic biology, we will be able to grow new cities and everything inside of them. While there are immense challenges and obstacles to getting to this point, the magnitude of abundance that is unlocked has attracted the efforts of some of the brightest minds on this planet, some of which you are going to hear from right now. Bankless Nation I would love to introduce you the three leaders that you are going to hear from the synthetic biology world, starting with Drew Endy, the father of modern synthetic biology, followed by John Cumbers, founder and CEO of Sinbio Beta, and finished up by Jennifer Holmgren, the CEO of LanzaTech. Drew Endy is going to continue this introduction into the broad landscape of synthetic biology and will continue to open up your imaginations about the world that could be if only we had synthetic biology. We'll talk about the emergence of Wetware, as in hardware, software, and now Wetware. We'll talk about the read and write functions for DNA and progress towards the programmability of cells. And then we'll zoom out and get into the world in which we can grow buildings, planes, cars.
00:04:18.970 - 00:05:15.220, Speaker A: And if Drew Nd is correct, this is all happening in our lifetimes. If you're on the younger side, then we'll get to hear from John Cumbers, who will continue the conversation after Drew and give us more specifics about the technical details about how this all works, how everything starts with Fermentation. Why nature from first principles is massively more efficient than anything we can manufacture with our own hands or even with robot hands. And how we actually get to the point of programming multicellular organisms. And then lastly, we're going to hear from Jennifer Holmgren, the CEO of Lonzitech, which is perhaps the largest in production efforts of synthetic biology. Lonzitech is a company that depends on an additional facility to a carbon emission source, like a steel mill or a landfill. And Lonzitech captures the emitted carbon, and using Fermentation, that pollution is converted by bacteria into very simple composable chemical Legos that can be produced into almost anything.
00:05:15.220 - 00:06:01.134, Speaker A: During Jennifer's presentation at Zuzalu, she pulled out three Adidas jackets that were made in partnership with Adidas that had all been manufactured using emitted carbon emissions coming from like a steel mill or some sort of carbon emission source. And so they captured the carbon and they turned it into a jacket, three of them. One of them was given to Vitalik. It's a black and white jacket. And when Jennifer gave it to Vitalik, he immediately put it on because everyone was watching. But then Vitalik saw that it was actually reversible, and instead of having black and white on the outside, you could have this purpley rainbowy pink color. And I was watching Vitalik do this, and I realized that he didn't know that it was reversible because knowing Vitalik, he would immediately put on the colorful side.
00:06:01.134 - 00:06:22.854, Speaker A: And I saw his face light up as soon as he saw that he could make it, like pink and purple and light. It was a very classic Vitalik moment. Anyways, small little snapshot of life at Zusalu. So let's go ahead and hear from our leaders of the synthetic biology world, starting with Drew Andy, the father of modern biology. But first, before we get there, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.

00:07:43.738 - 00:07:52.526, Speaker D: We are here at Zuzalu and I'm talking to Drew Endy, who I've been told is the father of modern synthetic biology. Do you accept this title?
00:07:52.558 - 00:07:53.330, Speaker A: Is that right?
00:07:53.480 - 00:08:05.798, Speaker E: When something gets going, there's many parents, so I could be one of and some of the things that are happening with stem cells, by the way, you can have interesting parentage these days. Sure.
00:08:05.964 - 00:08:36.660, Speaker D: So we're going to try and go down the synthetic biology rabbit hole, which is a domain of knowledge which I did not know how incredibly expansive and revolutionary it can be. And I think the listener base will know how optimistic I am about the world of crypto. And now I am slowly getting pilled by the world of synthetic biology, if you will. Drew, I'm sure you've explained synthetic biology to 10,000 people at 10,000 different times. How do you explain it in the fewest number of words possible?
00:08:37.350 - 00:09:08.822, Speaker E: So get rid of one word right away. Get rid of biology, focus on synthesis and go back in time. And let's use the Greek version, synthesis with a U. What does that mean? It means composition or a putting together. So synthesis is about putting things together. When we put that word in front of biology, you get synthetic biology, which is putting biology together at a fundamental level. It involves research to improve our ability to compose living systems.
00:09:08.822 - 00:09:43.510, Speaker E: Does that make sense? As a start, yeah. So a lot of times when people encounter biotechnology, it's very much as an emerging technology, a doorstep of last resort. Like, you have a horrible disease, you can't cure it by going to the hardware store and buying nuts and bolts. You can't cure it with AI yet. Right. It's like, well, maybe we could cure it with biotechnology. Normally, when people think about biotechnology, it's like, what can you use it for right now? The medicine, the food, the fuel, the shelter.
00:09:43.510 - 00:10:35.222, Speaker E: And what that's led to over the last 50 years is genetic engineering and bioeconomy, which we could talk about. But just to come back to it, what's been missing is lower level work to make it easier to engineer biology, to put biology together. And so synthetic biology, starting 20 years ago, is really throwing some elbows in the cultural political space to say, hey, wait a minute. We've got to develop a more solid foundation for working with living systems to solve problems. And to do that work, we have to take a big step back from the application layer and just get down underneath and say, how do we compose living systems? And so that's what's been going on. And then because of that, it's becoming easier to compose living systems. And so if you're not paying attention to what's underneath the surface, you don't see anything.
00:10:35.222 - 00:10:40.954, Speaker E: But then suddenly all these apps start popping up. It's like, oh, something's changed, but you don't know what it is.
00:10:41.152 - 00:11:42.294, Speaker D: So it sounds like to regurgitate some of this back at you, I'm getting ideas of building blocks, right? And it sounds like we're going very, very deep in the biological stack to be able to kind of produce building blocks that can assemble themselves. And the applications of this seem kind of endless when we go down to the very building blocks of what makes biology and understanding and going through the learnings of some of these talks, really, it sounds like synthetic biology. Has found a way to use modern day technology computers, code, perhaps even AI. To actually create the building blocks that we need to compose living systems. In the crypto world, we use this idea of money, legos, as in building blocks of money and finance. And it sounds like what synthetic biology is, is with technology, finding ways to get down to the basement level of what makes a cell a cell and be able to turn that into building blocks that we control. Is this a fair summary?
00:11:42.342 - 00:12:21.970, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a fair way of representing it, but I want to give everybody a sense of where the frontier is. Right? So we're doing that work. We're about 20 years into it. It's not a done deal. So there's been significant progress, which you can quantify to say, how much better have we got at composing living systems from the inside out, from the molecular to cellular scale? We can come back and talk about out some details or examples, but we're not done. Right? So, for example, biology is a general purpose technology. Anywhere you are, you could look at what biology is doing and it's like, well, could I partner with biology to do more of that or something different? Think of a leaf on a tree.
