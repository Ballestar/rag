00:00:00.090 - 00:00:05.194, Speaker B: Elon Musk's ex obtains license to store, transfer and trade bitcoin and crypto.
00:00:05.242 - 00:00:25.446, Speaker A: Maybe we step back a little bit here and give some context. Elon did payments in bitcoin for Tesla, right? That went nowhere. No one wants to use their bitcoin as money. Well, then has Elon learned from that? Maybe he has. And what are they going to integrate into this payments kind of platform when it comes to crypto? Exactly. Stablecoins PayPal just announced their own stablecoin. I definitely think that stablecoins are the more likely ended here.
00:00:25.446 - 00:00:29.990, Speaker A: Maybe you will be able to do bitcoin as well, but I highly doubt people are going to be using their bitcoin for payments.
00:00:30.410 - 00:00:43.620, Speaker B: Your bitcoin community is so funny. They've told us how valuable bitcoin is. Never sell your bitcoin. And then they also want bitcoin to be used to buy a Tesla. I don't encourage anybody to spend their ETH on anything. It is a store of value asset. All right.
