00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.622, Speaker A: How is the dollar looking from a reserve currency status? Dollar is still strong as far as global reserve currency because a lot of the lending that takes place is in US. Dollars, and it's a self fulfilling kind of loop. 60% of foreign exchange reserves are still US. Dollars, but those numbers have declined slowly over time. I think one of the risks to the dollar as a reserve currency is literally what we're seeing right now with Russia and Ukraine. Russia doesn't like it at all. China doesn't like it.
00:00:22.622 - 00:00:42.182, Speaker A: The more sanctions the west puts on countries like this, the more incentivized they are to find workarounds around the US. Dollar as a global reserve currency. And typically when these reserve currency status is lost, it's very rare that it's know it's Monday. The dollar is the reserve currency Tuesday. Okay. It's not. It's a very gradual process that might take decades, so you won't even realize that it's happening while it's happening.
00:00:42.182 - 00:00:50.460, Speaker A: There'll be more and more use of other things over time until at some point, the dollar is always going to be important. But is it going to be the only currency we're transacting is probably not.
