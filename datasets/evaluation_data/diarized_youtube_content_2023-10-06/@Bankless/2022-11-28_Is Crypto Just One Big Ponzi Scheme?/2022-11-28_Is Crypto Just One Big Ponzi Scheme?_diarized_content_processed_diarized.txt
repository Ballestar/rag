00:00:00.090 - 00:00:14.394, Speaker A: Every bull market is a Ponzi scheme under the guise of new token distribution models. 2013. This is David a proof of work fork and fair launch. We printed proof of work coins in 2013. 2017. ICO mania. We minted ICO tokens.
00:00:14.394 - 00:00:17.642, Speaker A: 2021 yield farming. We issued governance tokens.
00:00:17.706 - 00:00:41.702, Speaker B: The bitcoiners really like this one because they're like, oh, David's finally figuring out that anything outside of bitcoin is just a big Ponzi scheme. But then I would actually like to go to exhibit to a my next Tweet, which is a platform that is for finance is synonymous with a platform for ponzies. Money is real. Finance is perceived. ponzies are just the extrapolation of that on steroids, right? Perceived money, hot air money. So this is really how bull markets in crypto start. We create something cool.
00:00:41.702 - 00:00:56.620, Speaker B: In 2013 was like, oh, we can fork bitcoin a bajillion times. Let's do it. The ICO Mania was like, oh, we can just mint a token. Let's do it. And then in DFI yield farming, it's like, oh, you can just have these governance tokens and do yield farming to produce yield and attract investment. Let's do it. And then it just gets mutilated, right?
