00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.162, Speaker A: Did you see the Vox article?
00:00:01.226 - 00:00:03.162, Speaker B: Is this the one with the text back and forth?
00:00:03.226 - 00:00:22.526, Speaker A: Yes. There's this reporter at Vox, Kelsey Piper. SBF knows that this person's a reporter for Vox. And SBF just DMs pages and pages and pages of communications, just talking about everything, all of these things that you would just, as a lawyer, would not want your client to say, like, the effective altruism was just, like, a PR move. For example, this.
00:00:22.548 - 00:00:25.154, Speaker B: Is someone who is also a pathological liar.
00:00:25.242 - 00:00:37.462, Speaker A: So here's one. I effed up big multiple times, but you know what was my biggest single? F up. And then Sam goes chapter Eleven. So of all of his regrets, it was filing for bankruptcy that SBF regrets the most.
00:00:37.516 - 00:00:46.710, Speaker B: Also, if you read more of the text messages, he actually still thinks there's a chance. He's like, I didn't want to go bankrupt because I can still raise $10 billion. Like, right now.
00:00:46.780 - 00:00:48.194, Speaker A: That is lunacy.
00:00:48.242 - 00:00:51.500, Speaker B: This is not the type of person you want to entrust your money to.
