00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.446, Speaker A: The CIA has a hedge fund? Annie of.
00:00:02.468 - 00:00:03.994, Speaker B: Course they do. It's called InQTel.
00:00:04.042 - 00:00:25.910, Speaker A: InQTel was founded in 199. As the global technology evolution is underway, the Internet is widely available and the CIA and government agencies recognized they were missing out. Apparently, they don't want to miss out on this technology. So this appears to be less about returns on investment capital and maybe more a way to kind of forge alliances and perhaps recruiting to some of the most innovative tech technology in the world.
00:00:25.980 - 00:00:30.850, Speaker B: The agency, it has to be ahead of other intelligence organizations.
