00:00:00.090 - 00:00:17.402, Speaker B: Grayscale just won a monumental legal victory against the SEC, and we've got a lot of cause to celebrate. This was the fight for a bitcoin spot ETF in the US. This was a major step forward for Grayscale and crypto to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the US. Lots of jurisdictions have one. The US. Doesn't.
00:00:17.466 - 00:00:49.606, Speaker A: Why so? I think in recent times, it's because the SEC has just waged this war on crypto. They typically have kind of cited concerns around market manipulation and things like that, which I don't think that holds much water. They would kind of cite concerns around custody. But we have Coinbase as a custodian who has been operating like that for over ten years now and has never been hacked. So really, I don't think there's any reason for them to be denying these things outside of personal bias and just not wanting to see this happen. And that is pretty much, I think, what the judge has actually said here as well.
00:00:49.708 - 00:00:52.970, Speaker B: Yeah, the judge used these words arbitrary and capricious.
