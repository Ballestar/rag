00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.286, Speaker C: Somebody says, hey, I have my money on Coinbase or Gemini, I would just.
00:00:04.308 - 00:00:06.894, Speaker A: Like to take self custody of your assets. Like, where do you start with that?
00:00:06.932 - 00:00:50.300, Speaker B: First of all, you want to make sure it's a reputable account, like a coinbase, maybe a Kraken I'd put there. And then you kind of have to weigh it, David, because you have to weigh the risk of one of these exchanges going under versus your relatives'risk of losing their own keys if they mess up a setup. And this is really important. I actually don't love going through the process of teaching friends and family unless they are kind of coming to the table with their knowledge and their learnings, and they're asking me more specific questions. Right, because if you kind of do the work for them, then they weren't really ready to hold on to their own keys and self custody. You kind of have to just like, hey, you can leave on exchange until you're ready to move it off, and then I'm happy to give you some help or pointers or that sort of thing. But making them do it themselves is kind of a key because that's like an acid test of are you ready? You're not?
