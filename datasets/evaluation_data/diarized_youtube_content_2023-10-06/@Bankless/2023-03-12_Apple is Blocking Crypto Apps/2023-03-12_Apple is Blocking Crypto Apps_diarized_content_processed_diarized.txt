00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.522, Speaker A: Has Apple been actively blocking Uniswap from deploying its wallet?
00:00:04.586 - 00:00:16.078, Speaker B: We're in dialogue with Apple. It's not a purely blocked thing. Many other DApp developers in this space have also run into similar issues with Apple. It almost feels like we're playing by a rulebook that we can't read.
00:00:16.164 - 00:00:20.110, Speaker A: Which of the features inside of the Uniswap wallet do you think has offended Apple?
00:00:21.090 - 00:00:30.130, Speaker B: Great question. It's the unicorn, isn't it? To be honest, we don't exactly know. We've gotten actually different answers almost every time. It's confusing.
