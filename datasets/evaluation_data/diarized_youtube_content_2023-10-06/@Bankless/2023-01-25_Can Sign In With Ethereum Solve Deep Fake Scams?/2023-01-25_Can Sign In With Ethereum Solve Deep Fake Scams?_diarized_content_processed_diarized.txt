00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.550, Speaker B: A fake David and Ryan. Somebody spun this up with an AI and put out a YouTube video and told us to buy whatever scam coin. This is a huge problem. Can it solve deep fake problems?
00:00:09.620 - 00:00:38.180, Speaker A: So there's one mode we're experimenting with for sign in with Ethereum, where you can spawn a new random key and you can use sign in with Ethereum to give it some powers to create credentials. We call those session keys. If you used a session key to issue a data license that says, hey, I, Ryan, say that this is definitely not a deepfake. They can check that there was a root of trust in that Ethereum account and it authorized that content to come out. Anything else could just have more scrutiny versus the stuff that you attributed as genuine content.
