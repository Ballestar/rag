00:00:00.170 - 00:00:15.930, Speaker A: We this week got to see what Donald Trump holds in his Ethereum wallet. We believe this ETH address is Donald Trump's ether address. This is supported by information from his financial statements. August 14. So this is what he's holding. David, what do you think of Trump's portfolio?
00:00:16.010 - 00:00:17.274, Speaker B: It's just an A plus portfolio.
00:00:17.322 - 00:00:18.990, Speaker A: It actually is. It's great. It's great.
00:00:19.060 - 00:00:29.762, Speaker B: He's got 1.5 thousand Ether worth $2.8 million, and then he's got 16 E, 3.4 Maddox, and twelve USDC. So it's 99% ether.
00:00:29.906 - 00:00:39.842, Speaker A: There you go. The only thing I've ever heard him say explicitly about crypto was this from a Fox Business interview in December 2021. You should do this in your Donald Trump accent.
00:00:39.906 - 00:00:48.610, Speaker B: I have never loved it because I have always loved the dollar. I was never a big fan. But it's building up bigger and bigger, and no one's doing anything about it. But I want our currency called the dollar.
