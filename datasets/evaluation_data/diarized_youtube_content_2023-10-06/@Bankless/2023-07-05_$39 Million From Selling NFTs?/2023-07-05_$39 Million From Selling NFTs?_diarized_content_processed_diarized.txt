00:00:00.250 - 00:00:20.522, Speaker A: Azuki. What happened? Sometimes NFT PFP projects, they do further mints because we need another idea. Let's do another mint. I don't know. They're doing Azuki elementals. And so 20,000 NFTs 10,000 of them were airdropped to Azuki holders. The remaining 10,000 elementors were sold out at two e $38 million was raised.
00:00:20.522 - 00:00:35.026, Speaker A: That's a big number. It's a very big number. And so on the left, these are the Genesis collection. And then if you swap to the right, these are the elementals. Very similar. They are the almost identical. And so as a result of this, the Azuki elementals minted at two are now trading below the two ETH mint.
00:00:35.026 - 00:00:36.260, Speaker A: The community not happy.
