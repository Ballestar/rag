00:00:00.250 - 00:00:29.570, Speaker A: How do we responsibly deal with powerful technology? The last time we had a new level of powerful technology, we did drop two nukes on purpose. It's going to be much worse when we're dealing with Agis and Aon especially. Like, imagine if these things are open source. Imagine if every person in the world had a nuke during the Cold War. I expect we would have gotten nuked. There is currently more regulation on selling a sandwich than there is to building unprecedented AGI level technology and really sing it to the general public. How would you expect this to go? Well, at this current pace?
