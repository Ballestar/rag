00:00:00.090 - 00:00:47.860, Speaker A: But what are you bullish on spite of all this? David So, DC investor, put out a tweet and said, do you think the people that bought Ether at $120 are inconsolably upset that they did not buy at $80? No. Source me. Ether bounced between 100 and $300, like four times between 2018 and 2020. So I say all of my sub $300 buys between 2018 and 2020 just blur into that one big dip I bought. And what I am bullish on, Ryan, is that same thing happening all over again between one and $2,000. I think Ether will bounce between one and $2,000 perhaps a couple of times over the next 1218, god forbid, 24 months. But then that period of time will just blur into that one big dip that we all bought as we all stuck through the bear market together before Ether goes to finally $10,000 and beyond and.
