00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.022, Speaker A: Is it even possible for regulators and lawmakers to kind of choke crypto out? What's your take on that?
00:00:05.076 - 00:00:29.910, Speaker B: I don't think the US can choke off crypto globally, no matter what it does. The US. Is the world's Financial center, along with London, parts of China, tiny bit Singapore, and you want your world's financial center in some way to integrate with what might be a significant innovation. So the US. Could, de facto drive enough crypto out of the United States so that doesn't happen. It's not that it all can be banned. We could eradicate the US.
00:00:29.910 - 00:00:35.380, Speaker B: As a place where crypto innovation happens and is adopted that our regulators could do globally. No.
