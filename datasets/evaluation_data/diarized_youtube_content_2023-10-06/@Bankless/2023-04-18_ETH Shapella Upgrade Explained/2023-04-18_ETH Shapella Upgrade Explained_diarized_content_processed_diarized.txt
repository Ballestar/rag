00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.442, Speaker A: What is the CHAPELLA hard fork? What does it do for ethereum? And why is it significant?
00:00:04.506 - 00:00:32.100, Speaker B: The most obvious thing that CHAPELLA brings is the introductions of withdrawals on the Beacon Chain. Today, if you launch a validator on the Beacon Chain, you're basically depositing your funds into a smart contract, but then there's no way to actually get your funds back out on the execution layer. So the main thing we're introducing with CHAPELLA is allow allowing validators the ability to withdraw their stake. There's a couple of other small changes that we're introducing as well, but this is really kind of the big one.
