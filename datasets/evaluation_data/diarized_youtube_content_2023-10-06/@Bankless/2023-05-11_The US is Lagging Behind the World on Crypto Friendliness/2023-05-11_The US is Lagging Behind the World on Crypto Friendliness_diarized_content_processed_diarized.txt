00:00:00.170 - 00:00:25.810, Speaker A: Europe, 27 countries came together to agree. Hundreds of pages of very complicated text, multiple different languages. But they managed it. We want to have clear rules, not regulation by enforcement. There hasn't been transparent rulemaking, but we have seen that in the UK, we have seen that in Europe, we've seen that in Japan, we've seen it in Brazil, we've seen it in Singapore, we've seen it in the Middle East, we've seen it in Australia, we've seen it in Canada, the list goes on. But we have not seen that on the US side. So I think from that perspective is they are lagging.
