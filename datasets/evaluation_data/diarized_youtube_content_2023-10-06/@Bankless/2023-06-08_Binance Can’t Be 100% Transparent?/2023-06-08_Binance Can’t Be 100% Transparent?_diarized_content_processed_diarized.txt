00:00:00.250 - 00:00:07.694, Speaker A: It's actually kind of hard to see inside of the black box of Binance. If you could reflect on what strategies have developed as a result of everything that we've learned in the last year.
00:00:07.732 - 00:00:39.700, Speaker B: If you use a centralized platform like Binance, we want to be as transparent as possible, but there are limits. As a private company, we also need to make sure our privacy is protected. So if we publish all of our wallet addresses that we use, you'll be very clear which vendors we use, and those vendors may be attacked by hackers, our SMS providers, our email providers. We're not a public company. We may not want to open our books so that our competitor knows exactly how much we spend on HR security, our marketing. We have done our part to be transparent, but the businesses have limitations on how transparent we can or will be.
