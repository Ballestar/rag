00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.354, Speaker A: Lessons for the bull markets and bear markets that many of us missed.
00:00:03.402 - 00:00:34.514, Speaker B: This lesson that people keep needing to learn is the dangers of custodial exchanges. This is not a new lesson. Anyone who's in the industry for a little while and learns about some of this stuff needs to understand how to use basic self custody. MetaMask has actually done the most to help people into self custody of anyone, and they do it without talking about self custody. They just made a great product and got millions of users into self hosted wallets. That's fantastic. If the major majority of crypto funds reside with Intermediaries, a we will never escape the regulation that this stuff is meant to escape, and b we will never escape the need to trust humans.
00:00:34.514 - 00:00:51.930, Speaker B: And like, if we look back at Bitcoin white paper and Satoshi's writings, he made a very important point, which is that the problem with traditional finance is all the trust that's required to make it work. Bitcoin removed trust from money itself, and that principle is so core for every blockchain and that message above all and needs to continue to be repeated.
