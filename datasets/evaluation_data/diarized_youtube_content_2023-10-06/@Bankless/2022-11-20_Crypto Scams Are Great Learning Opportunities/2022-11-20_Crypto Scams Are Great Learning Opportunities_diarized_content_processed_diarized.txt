00:00:00.090 - 00:00:33.846, Speaker A: Back in 2013, we learned not your keys, not your crypto, because of malcox. We haven't learned something like that for a long time. As bad as 2018 was, there wasn't anything that crazy there. It was just like unsustainable business models with ICOs in 2022. It got bad because we had so many scammers rug us left and right. But the learning lessons is like I think we as an industry will be able to call out the early warning signs and the red flags a lot better now because of the less lessons that we've learned in 2022. So I think it is going to be a lot harder to scam this industry and defraud this industry moving forward because we've seen it before.
00:00:33.846 - 00:00:34.980, Speaker A: We've had it happen to us.
