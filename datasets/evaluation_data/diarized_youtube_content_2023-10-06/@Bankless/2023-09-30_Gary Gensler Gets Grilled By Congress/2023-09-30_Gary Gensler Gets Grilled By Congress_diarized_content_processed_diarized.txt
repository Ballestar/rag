00:00:00.090 - 00:00:05.582, Speaker C: Gary Gensler under pressure this week in front of Congress. This is my favorite clip. Maybe the clip of the year.
00:00:05.636 - 00:00:11.150, Speaker B: Suppose I were to purchase a Pokemon card. Would doing so constitute a security transaction?
00:00:12.530 - 00:00:18.634, Speaker A: You can purchase a Pokemon card. I don't know what the context is, but if you're just purchasing a Pokemon.
00:00:18.682 - 00:00:21.658, Speaker B: Card if I purchase a Pokemon card, is that a security transaction?
00:00:21.754 - 00:00:22.638, Speaker A: That's not a security.
00:00:22.724 - 00:00:32.386, Speaker B: Okay. If I were to purchase a token tokenized Pokemon card on a digital exchange via a blockchain, is that a security transaction?
00:00:32.498 - 00:00:33.960, Speaker A: I'd have to know more.
00:00:34.330 - 00:00:45.414, Speaker B: Okay, so, for you, the process of tokenization is what transforms a non security transaction into a security transaction? I thought you were technology neutral. Oh, wow. He asked the.
00:00:45.452 - 00:00:51.130, Speaker C: Question, David, that we've always wanted to ask. How about baseball cards? How about Pokemon cards with these securities?
