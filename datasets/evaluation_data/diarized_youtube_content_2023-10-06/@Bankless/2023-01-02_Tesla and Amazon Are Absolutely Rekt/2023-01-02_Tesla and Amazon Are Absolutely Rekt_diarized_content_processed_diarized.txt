00:00:00.090 - 00:00:11.838, Speaker B: We got Tesla and Amazon absolutely wrecked. Amazon is back at the same price it was at the bottom of the March COVID lows. Tesla coming in at $123 when it used to be almost 500.
00:00:11.924 - 00:00:36.982, Speaker A: Everything that happened during the COVID period was just funny money. If ETH was back at its March 2020 bottom, it'd be $90. We are like 13 X from there. And Bitcoin went back to 4000 or something. Crypto, I mean, Ethan BTC have done remarkably well because if you look at stocks, Amazon is a big ass company, but their stock price did nothing the last two years. Now, Tesla's a different story. I think Tesla got way, way overvalued for where it was supposed to be.
00:00:37.036 - 00:00:49.110, Speaker B: If you weren't going to be a crypto investor, the other asset class that you probably would have invested in is like, high growth, high risk tech stocks. And so they also got wrecked too. So if you're feeling like, wrecked by crypto, it's almost the same.
00:00:49.180 - 00:00:55.420, Speaker A: Ethan BTC are relatively, like, doing so bloody well compared to these other stocks. Right? It's just crazy. 100%.
