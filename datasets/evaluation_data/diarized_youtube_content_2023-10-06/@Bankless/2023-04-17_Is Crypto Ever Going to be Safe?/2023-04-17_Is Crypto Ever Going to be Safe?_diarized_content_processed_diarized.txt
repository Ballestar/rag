00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.530, Speaker A: Are we ever going to graduate to something that feels a little more safe?
00:00:03.610 - 00:00:33.602, Speaker B: Sad to say, I don't really have a silver bullet here. How do we prevent this? Well, one part is, of course, just education simultaneously. There's, like, ways to win in this space. You get airdrops, you get to invest in things that you otherwise wouldn't have gotten to invest in. The kids that are raised with this financial system are going to become extremely fluent in this natively, whereas people that are older that have to learn this thing, we are the more vulnerable people. There's also innovation to talk about. This is a problem, and problems inspire problem solvers.
00:00:33.602 - 00:00:34.740, Speaker B: But sadly, it just takes time.
