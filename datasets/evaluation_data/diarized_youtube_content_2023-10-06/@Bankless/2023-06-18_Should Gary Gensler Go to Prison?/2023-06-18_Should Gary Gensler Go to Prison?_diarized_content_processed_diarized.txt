00:00:00.170 - 00:00:15.502, Speaker A: This is your take me earlier. I want Gary Gensler out of office. Me now. I want Gary Gensler in prison. Well, he's not gonna come on the podcast now, David. Thanks a lot. Why do you feel this way? Because he's exclusively playing the political game of climbing up ladders of power.
00:00:15.502 - 00:00:36.420, Speaker A: But you said you want Gary Gensler in prison. He's using the authority of a public office to elevate himself and tear down an entire industry of hundreds of thousands of people. Just because you don't like somebody, it doesn't mean like, I don't like this guy. Go to prison. I think that if you looked hard, there would be evidence of corruption here. And I think that's what you are reacting to.
