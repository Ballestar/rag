00:00:00.170 - 00:00:48.930, Speaker A: What do you mean when you say, of course NFTs are securities? Why of course? There's a test for whether or not something is a security. Very famous case called Howie established the criteria for what would constitute an investment contract. The Howey test is so broad that any investment can be a security, because all the Howey test says is that something is an investment contract. An investment is a security. If it constitutes an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be devised, that's literally any investment whatsoever. So when you ask this question, Is it a security? That's the wrong question. The real question is always, is it the kind of thing SEC thinks it should be regulating? You need to think about how do you explain to the regulator what you're doing and how the regulator can add value to the ecosystem?
