00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.982, Speaker A: Why do you think that the AI automatically hates us? Why does it want to kill us all?
00:00:04.036 - 00:00:23.260, Speaker B: The AI doesn't hate you. Neither does it love you. And you're made of atoms that it can use for something else. It's got something that actually does care about, which makes no mention of you. The reason you're not in its utility function is that the people who built the AI or the people who built the AI that built the AI that built the AI did not have the technical knowledge whereby you can control in detail what that thing ends up caring about.
