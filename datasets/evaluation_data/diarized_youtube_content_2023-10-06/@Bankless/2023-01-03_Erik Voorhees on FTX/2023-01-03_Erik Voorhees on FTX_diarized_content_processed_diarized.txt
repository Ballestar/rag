00:00:00.090 - 00:00:05.610, Speaker B: What was that like for you, watching all of this fallout happen just so recently after you had this debate with SBF?
00:00:05.690 - 00:00:32.322, Speaker A: This was the biggest calamity that has ever befallen crypto. The speed with which this unfolded was really profound. I had no suspicion that anything untoward was going on with that exchange. During that debate, I was going to try to tear Sam apart on the principles and then to learn just like, a week later that he's actually the one causing the biggest fraud ever was real. And during the debate, I was like, Man, I'm really getting him. And I was taking a little bit of pleasure in that, but I guess a lot of it might have been because he was sitting on a $10 billion fraud.
00:00:32.386 - 00:00:48.418, Speaker B: He had the microphone, like, 90% of the time of that debate, and you were only saying one or two or three very sharp sentences. It felt like watching a soccer game where one team had the possession of the ball for, like, 90% of the time, but the team that had the possession of the ball for ten minutes scored, like, eight goals.
00:00:48.514 - 00:00:58.220, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that's, like, how you get a good message across has to do with the message and in how few words you can do it. He was struggling because he didn't have any foundation of principle on which he was arguing for these things. Yes.
