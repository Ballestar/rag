00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.066, Speaker B: You've been in crypto for a long time, 2010. What is the next ten years going to hold for us if you zoom all the way out there's?
00:00:07.098 - 00:00:45.330, Speaker A: The fast case and the slow case so the slow case is that the quality of crypto systems, the user experience, the scalability, the privacy gradually increases. And I think when the industry crossed 200 billion, there was no turning back. So the crypto industry is not going to go anywhere. The fast case is more Silicon Valley Bank, more Credit Suisse, more big monumental failures that may not be able to be muted by governmental intervention and which may lead to significant financial pain for society, significant political tension, significant international problems, because the fundamental promises of the system are not sufficiently backed.
