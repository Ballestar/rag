If you think about what happened in crypto with, say, Three Arrows or any of these other blow ups, there were no regulators you would expect in essentially a non regulated market with people who didn't have decades of financial experience, there are going to be some really big blow ups. And it just the market cap got so big that that happened, they appeared catastrophic. But it doesn't surprise me that you had these outcomes at all.
