00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.890, Speaker A: Friend Tech. It's a new application on base, opened up Friends app. And I'm given a Base wallet and a brand new Ethereum wallet that is non custodial. I link my Twitter account and all of a sudden I have my Friend's profile and then people start buying shares of me. Why are people buying shares of me? Yeah, why? I'm a valuable friend to own shares about. I think it is a Ponzi game for influencers. Part of the incentive is that you get 5% of all share trading fees.
00:00:27.890 - 00:00:43.206, Speaker A: And so I have accumulated 1.4 Ether from trading fees. What? Yes. I have committed to distributing all of my trading fees that I accumulate in seven days, starting on Sunday, to one of my shareholders. I'm just going full ponzi. So go buy my shares. Wow.
00:00:43.206 - 00:00:45.810, Speaker A: That is worth a disclosure. Trust me, bro. Um.
