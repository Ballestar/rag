The jail is a level, like floor one, floor two, floor three, floor four, like going down once a day when this platform with a bunch of food on it descends down the jail. If you're in like, floors one through 50, it's a good spot to be. You're going to have plenty of food. 50 to 100 there's like food there, but it's kind of the food below 100, it starts to get real scarce.
