00:00:10.340 - 00:00:11.530, Speaker A: Step two is refute.
00:00:11.610 - 00:00:24.870, Speaker C: Can this oligarch make it harder to trace his money if he hops from one blockchain to another? If he deposits those tokens into a couple of wallets that don't require him to provide identifying information?
00:00:25.060 - 00:00:26.278, Speaker A: Step three is name calling.
00:00:26.364 - 00:00:28.934, Speaker D: Sometimes I call it crypto crabble, and sometimes I call.
