00:00:00.170 - 00:00:41.382, Speaker A: A US court has ruled that XRP, the asset, is not a security. In the words of the judge, ripple sales of XRP do not constitute an offer of investment contracts. XRP not a security. This is absolutely huge because if XRP isn't a security, then nothing in crypto is a security. Now that's a little bit hyperbolic. Of course it's possible to tokenize a thing that is a security and issue a security on chain. But what it does mean is the SEC's overreach their regulation by enforcement their allegations that Coinbase is an illegal securities exchange.
00:00:41.382 - 00:01:25.186, Speaker A: Their court filings indicating that Solana, that filecoin, that Matic, that Adam, that cardano, that all of these are securities. Well, how can they be securities if XRP isn't? How can ETH be a security if XRP isn't? This is important precedent that was just set and I think puts Gensler back on his heels. It's a setback for Gensler and for anyone in the SEC who thinks that this regulation by enforcement activity can continue. It's a check on their power. And all of this came about, of course, from a multi year court case between Ripple, which is the company that originated XRP, and the SEC. We haven't talked about it much because it's been on the back burner for so long, but now here it is. This is a tweet from Bill Hughes.
00:01:25.186 - 00:01:53.350, Speaker A: He is a crypto lawyer. He says this the SEC versus Ripple. In brief, here's what you need to know. Ripple putting XRP on exchanges for trading and funding their operation with those sales is not an investment contract and therefore not a security. That's what the court said. Also, Ripple paying people in XRP is not an investment contract and therefore not a security. An XRP is not a security in and of itself, even when offered through a securities transaction.
00:01:53.350 - 00:02:35.134, Speaker A: So this turn of phrase, investment contract, XRP is not an investment contract when it's on an exchange if you pay people with it or even when it's offered through a securities transaction. That's what the court ruled. However, the court did say that Ripple's original selling of XRP directly pursuant to contracts was an investment contract and thus a security. So originally XRP was a security and became not a security at some point in time. Bill also says I'd be shocked if the SEC doesn't immediately appeal this to the second court because of course this is a big setback for the SEC. I also agree with Adam Cochrane's take here. He says overall this is a huge win.
00:02:35.134 - 00:03:09.386, Speaker A: XRP is one of the more centralized foundations with a key figurehead who has had standard sales via exchanges and formal distribution programs. If those aren't securities, nearly nothing sold via exchange is. We also have some weigh in from politicians. This is Representative Tom Emmer, Majority Whip. He's been on bankless before. The Ripple case is monumental development in establishing that a token is separate and distinct from an investment contract. Did you hear that SEC? The token is separate and distinct from the investment contract it may or may not be part of.
00:03:09.386 - 00:03:46.962, Speaker A: Now, he says, let's make this law. Wants to take this court precedent and make it law generally applicable. Representative Richie Torres on the Democrat side, also weighs in on all of this with an attack against the SEC, saying the SEC is acting like an overzealous traffic cop, arbitrarily ticketing drivers while keeping the speed limit a secret. It prefers to communicate by enforcement rather than by rules or guidance, but that's no way to regulate digital assets. I'm calling for an investigation of the SEC. So some heat from that as well. Some of the major exchanges, including Coinbase, also issued.
00:03:46.962 - 00:04:22.478, Speaker A: Within hours, Coinbase will be re enabling trading for XRP on the XRP network. They say I suppose they feel safe in doing this, given that the US court system has ruled that XRP is no longer a security. So that's what just happened. I'll end with my take here, which is this doesn't really matter what you think of XRP, the asset, or ripple the company. I personally think XRP is an overvalued project, riding on some vapor, riding on a passionate, some might say a shilly community. And I never thought I'd be saying this.
00:04:22.564 - 00:04:23.474, Speaker B: All right.
00:04:23.672 - 00:04:40.662, Speaker A: Thank you, XRP. You stopped Gary Gensler's onslaught against Crypto. Because if XRP isn't a security, then almost nothing is. I'll end it there. We're going to discuss this in more detail on Bankless in the coming days. I'm sure there's some things I missed here. This is breaking news.
00:04:40.662 - 00:05:00.710, Speaker A: As I said. There's questions of whether Gensler and the SEC can appeal this. There's questions like, is it clear skies ahead for security regulations in the US? I imagine there's some subtleties there. I imagine there's still some work we have to do. We'll get to all of those details. In fact, later today, I'm recording with Mike Selig. He's a crypto lawyer.
00:05:00.710 - 00:05:30.966, Speaker A: And we're going to explore this in some more detail. But today, for now, on the Roll Up this morning, we get to celebrate this win. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but thank you, XRP. Bankless Nation. It is the second Friday of July, and it is time for, of course, the Weekly Roll Up. I have Anthony Cisano from the Daily GWe with me for the second week in a row while David is up exploring some mountains. And we got some topics to cover this week.
00:05:30.966 - 00:05:32.600, Speaker A: Anthony, how are you doing this morning?
00:05:33.290 - 00:05:35.990, Speaker B: I'm very good. I'm very bullish today, actually.
00:05:36.140 - 00:05:44.540, Speaker A: Wait, you woke up bullish? That's a thing you say on the Daily, right? Like, so what constitutes Anthony waking up bullish versus all of the other days of the year?
00:05:45.630 - 00:05:56.510, Speaker B: I think I wake up bullish every day, to be honest. Doesn't matter what the price is doing. I just wake up and I do my usual check Twitter routine, and I'm just like, you know, what? I love this industry so much. I'm so bullish.
00:05:56.850 - 00:05:59.840, Speaker A: So you still have faith in this industry you haven't given up on?
00:06:01.570 - 00:06:15.842, Speaker B: I mean, look, crypto to me is a broad term, right? I obviously focus mostly on ethereum. But no, I mean, everything that I'm seeing in the ethereum ecosystem just every day, it's just crazy. I honestly can't keep up with it anymore. There's too much.
00:06:15.976 - 00:06:47.374, Speaker A: Well, guys, if you want that bullish energy injected straight into your veins, this is the place to get it. This is the weekly roll up where we cover everything going on that you need to know about crypto. A few topics of the week. Number one, we're going to talk about this new marketplace for doxing crypto addresses. Is everyone in crypto about to get doxed? Some controversy surrounding a new bounty program that rewards people for doxing crypto addresses. We're going to get into that. Also, the Google Play store, they just did an about face on their policy in a good way.
00:06:47.374 - 00:07:05.122, Speaker A: Now NFTs are unbanned. They are allowed. We're going to discuss that as well. Ave is about to launch its new stablecoin as well. It's called go. And is this the stablecoin we've been waiting for or is there another? Anthony, I want to pick your brain on that. As always, you got to make sure you like subscribe rate and review.
00:07:05.122 - 00:07:34.874, Speaker A: If you're on YouTube, subscribe. If you are listening to this on a podcast player somewhere, give us a rate and review and let's propel this thing to the top of the charts. So much to cover in markets this week, Anthony. But before we do a quick shout out, we are going to the permissionless conference that is the bankless nation, David and myself, that is coming up on September 11 through the 13th. So we're almost all the way through summer in the US. And it's time to book your ticket, guys. And I think the bear market is the best time to go to a conference.
00:07:34.874 - 00:08:04.214, Speaker A: This is an opportunity to network, to meet all of the settlers who stayed during crypto winters and to find your bear market buddy, as David and I like to say, a fire lineup. There's 120 speakers. We're expecting 6000 attendees, 1500 different crypto projects, and it's all in Austin. If you're a bankless citizen, you get a 30% discount. There is a link in the show notes to go do that. All right, Anthony, let's get to the markets. Thanks to Kraken Pro for showing us these charts today.
00:08:04.214 - 00:08:13.378, Speaker A: Bitcoin price. We're about flat since the last time you and I talked about this. About 30K on the week. Any takes on Bitcoin this week?
00:08:13.564 - 00:08:38.114, Speaker B: I mean, similar takes to last week, right, where I basically said that I thought that the market was trading just purely based on narrative, that ETF narrative. And I didn't expect any wild moves from here because of that because there doesn't seem to be any new money coming in and I think that's basically been playing out over the past week. But it's only been a week, right? Next week we could go up 10%. That's the volatility in crypto. So, yeah, I think just more of the same, really, over the last week.
00:08:38.232 - 00:09:08.170, Speaker A: Well, ETH is more of the same as well. Kind of down a little bit, but pretty much flat. I'm just going to call it flat 1880 at the time we're recording this, which means, of course, the ETH to bitcoin ratio is flat. The good news here is crypto market cap is over a trillion dollars. I don't know about you, Anthony, but that's kind of a meme number for me. Are we above a trillion or below a trillion? Of course, there are a lot of tokens in this market cap that maybe should be worth a lot less, but it feels good to be above a trillion. We are at 1.3
00:09:08.170 - 00:09:32.706, Speaker A: trillion on the week. Well, if there's nothing going on in the short run, or at least not much, we're waiting for the next price action. I want to zoom out a little bit and I want to talk to you about three things in this market section. One is bonds. The second is staking in ultrasound money. And the third is real world assets. So let's start by talking a little bit about the bond market.
00:09:32.706 - 00:10:28.562, Speaker A: And I want to do almost like a tale of two bond markets here, because we've got the Fiat bond market and then we have the crypto bond market and the ethereum bond market. And I think there's an analogy that fits that spans across both of them that I want to implant in listeners head and get your thoughts on here. First of all, when people say bonds, a lot of times it just sounds like this obscure financial instrument. But what is a bond? Actually, a bond is just a form of debt. So when you buy a US bond, that would be a treasury, something to that effect, you're essentially lending money to the US government. In the same way, when you buy a liquid staking token, we call these LSDs, or when you stake your ETH, you are lending ethereum, the ethereum protocol, some money. So that's why we call Staking ETH or staked ETH a bond.
00:10:28.562 - 00:11:02.990, Speaker A: Essentially, it's an ethereum bond. I don't know if you've seen this infographic, Anthony, at any point in time, but this is what the global bond market looks like. And I'm going to describe some of this for listeners who are listening on the podcast. This is all of the sovereign bonds. It's about a $60 trillion market. So these are all of the bonds that nation states issue. So call these nation state bonds, if you will, and 60 trillion worth of that 51 trillion is the US.
00:11:02.990 - 00:11:50.858, Speaker A: Actually, these numbers are a little bit larger, so maybe this is 70 to 80 trillion, 20 trillion or so is China and you can see all of the other nation states encompassing this pie. That's the size of the sovereign bond market. So I want to contrast the nation state bond market which is about $60 to $70 trillion or so, to the network state bond market which is only about 70 billion right now. And of course Ether, the asset, the bond composes the vast majority of that about 40 billion or so. And then we've got Salana, we've got Cardano, we've got some other chains here of course. So we've got a tale of two bond markets. And I was reading this report from Pantera earlier this week, Anthony, about the US bond market and Pantera's perspective.
00:11:50.858 - 00:13:00.278, Speaker A: Obviously they've been in crypto for a very long time but their perspective is that the US. Is totally screwing up its bond market like turning it into a complete Ponzi scheme. And one way you can see that is this metric called the real Fed Funds rate. Okay? So the real Fed Funds rate so what you can see on this chart is the Fed Funds rate is basically the interest rate set by the Fed that's sort of in yellow, that's this yellow line here and then you see CPI. So core CPI, that is Consumer Price Index, that is the measure of a measure of inflation is this dotted line everywhere where you see kind of red, the Shading pattern of red, that's where the Fed funds rate is below the core CPI rate. It's basically like you're buying a US bond, a sovereign bond in order to get a yield, say yield of like 5% but CPI, but inflation is like 8% in which case how much are you making in real returns in real Fed Funds rate? Well, negative 3%. So you're kind of losing money on that.
00:13:00.278 - 00:13:53.320, Speaker A: And it's very interesting. You see like post 2008, the great financial the financial crisis here, it's been red basically ever since and up until it hit a high point, I believe the lowest point of the year of negative 6.3%. That's the lowest in the last 50 years. That the real return on bonds have been on essentially this fed funds rate, which is pretty crazy. So you can start to see the case that this sovereign bond market is not actually producing a real rate of return. I want to pause here because next we're going to contrast that with what's going on in crypto and maybe we'll take a peek at the Ethereum bond market in some detail. But what's your take on this Anthony? Who in the world is buying bonds? Right?
00:13:54.970 - 00:15:03.280, Speaker B: Mean, I got to preface this and say obviously I'm not an expert on this kind of stuff, definitely more of an observer. But it seems to me that the COVID I guess response and COVID generally has distorted a lot of this because you can see it in the chart, right? It seems to have distorted a lot of this and also post 2008 as you were pointing out how rates were so low for so long but then you can see that they were kind of trickling back up and then COVID happened and then back down again. Right. And it's kind of funny how similar a lot of these charts look with COVID There was the COVID dump, I guess initially in stocks, right, and crypto and then we went up after that because the rates were basically at rock bottom again and then the rates started going up and everyone got scared and I guess risk on assets kind of went down. But yeah, just generally when you're talking about buying bonds and getting that real return, I think that if you weren't in a bond and just in cash, obviously, and that's not cash in like an interest bearing account or something like that, you're losing even worse off. Exactly. So it's kind of like, yes, you might be losing whatever it was 0.3%,
00:15:03.280 - 00:15:50.106, Speaker B: but you're much better off still doing that than just leaving cash lying around. But at the same time it's all about the appetite of investors, right? Like buying a sovereign bond, especially the US bond, is like the least riskiest thing you can do because you have the full weight of the US government behind that. Right. Literally you're buying into the US government essentially. So it's considered the least riskiest thing you can buy. But at the same time, is it really worth not taking on a little bit of extra risk to just get much more return potentially with your dollars with some risk assets such as a BTC or an ETH right, or even a Gold, which has done comparatively well. So yeah, it certainly begs the question, it's like who is buying the bonds right over these other things?
00:15:50.288 - 00:16:16.354, Speaker A: Well, what's interesting is part of the answer to that question is in a big way, banks. So central banks are buying their own bonds. That's why Pantera is calling this kind of like a Ponzi scheme. So central banks own about 50% of the sovereign bonds that are out there. That's what quantitative easing is. So many of these modern central bank policies actually do is they buy bonds on the open market. So that has kind of a distorting effect as well.
00:16:16.354 - 00:17:03.394, Speaker A: But it's really interesting when you start to look at real returns, which is, okay, what's the yield of the underlying bond? But you have to look at the yield minus inflation, right, that gives you your real return. Now let's contrast that to ethereum, which I think is kind of interesting here. So remember, ethereum is very much like staked ether is like a bond. You are lending ether to the protocol of ethereum. And Anthony, when you were saying the risk free rate, it's kind of the lowest risk type of financial asset you can have is owning US bonds or US Treasuries. Staked ETH is the highest yield. It's almost like the risk free rate of ether as an asset, right.
00:17:03.394 - 00:17:43.022, Speaker A: You can't deposit your ether anywhere else and expect to receive a return of any size at lower risk. So it almost represents the risk free rate here, which is kind of cool. And the contrast here is this to me looks a lot I'd call it healthier because you don't have the Money printer the algorithm doing open market operations and purchasing staked ETH like LSD tokens in the open market. That's what central banks do. It's completely transparent. So you can see it kind of block by block. There aren't arbitrary decision makers who are adjusting the dials up or down.
00:17:43.022 - 00:18:42.386, Speaker A: It just kind of follows the algorithm. And if you look at kind of I guess maybe the comparison is the real rate of return. And since the merge, the real rate of return has been, what, like something between four and six or the actual rate of the nominal rate of return has been about between four and 6%. And then if you take the burn there, then you have to kind of add that so you're at like the burn since the merge has been 0.3%. And so the real rate of return looks far more attractive on staked ETH versus sovereign bonds versus something like a US. Treasury. And I just think this contrast is so stark and so interesting and does beg the question of like if you are looking at any sort of time horizon, you have some extra capital and you're looking at a time horizon that's longer than like a year, let's say.
00:18:42.386 - 00:19:16.826, Speaker A: Why would you hold these sovereign instruments that are bleeding effectively? Like your real rate of return is going down when you can own an asset like ether, where, I mean, it's it's a positive rate of return. Now, people say, but that's ETH denominated, right? That's not like real money. But I don't know, I kind of go back to look over the longer time horizon. One ETH is one ETH. What are your thoughts on this and this comparison in general? Anthony yeah, so, I mean, there's generally.
00:19:16.858 - 00:19:44.742, Speaker B: A lot of things I could say about this. Maybe the denomination thing is somewhere good to start. So, yeah, when people say, oh, but it's ETH and it's not US dollar, so it's completely different. The way I think about stability generally is that, as you said, one ETH equals one ETH, $1 equals $1.01, AUD equals one AUD. But the thing is that it's stable relative to itself. So if you start comparing a US dollar to your grocery bills, well, over the last two years, us.
00:19:44.742 - 00:20:36.294, Speaker B: Dollar hasn't been very stable compared to your grocery shop, right? Your grocery shop has gone up because there has been inflation and because of just prices generally going up because of supply chain constraints and all those sorts of stuff that happened because of COVID And the same is true for any asset. You can compare any asset to any other asset. And that's where we come to things like stores of value. Like where do you store your wealth in order to protect yourself in the most kind of like, I guess risk free or riskless way, so that you're not taking on a massive amount of risk like investing in a brand new company that has a 5% chance of succeeding or something like that. And traditionally it has been obviously the strongest currency USD, which is the world reserve currency, or it has been gold for a very long time. And then over, I guess, like the last, I want to say ten years, but probably less than that in terms of BTC and ETH being considered stores of value. You can say five to ten years.
00:20:36.294 - 00:21:03.662, Speaker B: I guess it's been those assets, right, where people say, well, I can store my wealth in these crypto assets. I mean, I do it, you do it. We store our wealth in ETH and then we stake the ETH of course as well to get that return. And you were mentioning how it's a real return. So when you stake your ETH, there are really, I guess, three parts to it. You get a new ETH issuance that gets paid out to you as a reward. You get the E bet that gets paid out as fees as a reward as well.
00:21:03.662 - 00:21:53.246, Speaker B: Anything that's not burned, of course. And you get mev related payments to if you're running the mev boost software, which most people do, I think it's up to like 95% of validators are kind of talking to that software. So the later two parts, the unburnt fees and the mev, that is not new issued ETH, that is existing ETH that already exists in the ethereum economy that is paid by users to do whatever on the network. The only new ETH that is issued is on that consensus layer side rewards, which is the new ETH that is printed. But the thing is that we're burning more ETH than is issued, and we've been doing this for quite a while now, especially since the merge, which means that the net result, as you mentioned, is that since the merge, we are at negative 0.3% inflation rate or issuance rate for Eth@the.net rate.
00:21:53.246 - 00:22:45.310, Speaker B: And on top of that, it is much harder to print new ETH than it is to burn it because you have to basically outrun the burn. So even if the burn is really low, even if gas fees are quite low, and the burn isn't actually at high amounts, it doesn't matter because you're still burning almost the same, if not the same as what's being issued. So the issuance isn't actually increasing from that, it just basically stays flat. And that's what we've seen at periods of time. You can actually see this on the chart. For the last few weeks, we remained relatively flat with increasing slightly, but then we started burning more ETH again. Over the last, I think, couple of weeks or so, you can see over the last 30 days, you can actually see how it worked out here and then we're just going straight back down because it's much easier to burn ETH than it is to issue it.
00:22:45.310 - 00:23:08.982, Speaker B: Now, of course, issuance changes as more ETH is staked, there's more ETH issued. But still, I feel like the more that gets staked, the more activity is happening on the network because people are using that staked ETH for different things, like restaking such. So the fees will probably level that out. And yeah, all that just culminates in such a nice real yield on your staked ETH and a very attractive asset as a store of value.
00:23:09.116 - 00:23:28.780, Speaker A: Totally. So you woke up bullish. Anthony I woke up bullish on staked. Like, it's just incredible. You got to look at the real return here and the real return of an asset like ether when it's staked, when it's bonded, is just incredible. I want to ask you another question because people listening to this section might also get kind of.
