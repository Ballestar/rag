00:00:00.250 - 00:00:20.794, Speaker A: We now have BRC 20s. They're copycatting the name. They're not like the ERC 20s. But the idea is, using the Ordinals protocol, we now have shitcoins on Bitcoin. It's more like the semifungible of ERC one one five token standard. There is now a UniSat IO marketplace. In order to access the marketplace, you had to mint 20 new BRC 20 tokens.
00:00:20.794 - 00:00:25.380, Speaker A: And so, in order to even enter the marketplace, you had to supply 20 new tokens in into the market.
