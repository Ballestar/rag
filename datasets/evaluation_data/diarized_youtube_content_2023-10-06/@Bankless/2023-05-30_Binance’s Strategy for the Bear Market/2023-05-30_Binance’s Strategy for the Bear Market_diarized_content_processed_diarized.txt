00:00:00.090 - 00:00:12.282, Speaker A: This famous quote from that one Brazilian race car driver you can't overtake 15 cars in sunny weather, but you can when it's raining. The idea is that in a bear market, it's easier to progress. I'm wondering what's finance's strategy in the bear market to pass 15 cars during rainy weather?
00:00:12.346 - 00:00:13.758, Speaker B: Actually, in the bear market, if you.
00:00:13.764 - 00:00:15.150, Speaker C: Can just drive normally?
00:00:17.970 - 00:00:18.698, Speaker B: So in bear.
00:00:18.714 - 00:00:19.454, Speaker C: Markets, it's basically.
00:00:19.492 - 00:00:22.250, Speaker B: About survival, right? So I think that's basically our strategy.
00:00:22.330 - 00:00:24.382, Speaker C: There was a massive bank run on us.
00:00:24.436 - 00:00:25.334, Speaker B: People withdraw like.
00:00:25.372 - 00:00:28.886, Speaker C: $14 billion within a week. There was basically no issues. We didn't really.
00:00:28.908 - 00:00:33.430, Speaker B: Intend to overtake 15 cars. We just said, look, let's find a path that we can drive and stay on the road.
00:00:33.500 - 00:00:34.260, Speaker C: That's all we did, really.
