00:00:00.250 - 00:00:01.230, Speaker C: What is money?
00:00:01.300 - 00:00:15.950, Speaker A: I'm gonna pull out a quote from Yval. Noah harare money is probably the most successful story ever told. It has no objective value. But then you have these master storytellers, the big bankers, the finance ministers, and they come and tell you a very convincing story.
00:00:16.020 - 00:00:17.022, Speaker B: Look at this piece of paper.
00:00:17.076 - 00:00:23.358, Speaker A: It's actually worth ten bananas. And that story works. Try telling that story to a chimpanzee. It won't work.
00:00:23.444 - 00:00:34.980, Speaker C: I love it. It takes a collect of group of humans all thinking the same thing about money for a money to actually manifest. And if suddenly we all stop viewing a certain piece of paper as money, then it ceases to be money.
