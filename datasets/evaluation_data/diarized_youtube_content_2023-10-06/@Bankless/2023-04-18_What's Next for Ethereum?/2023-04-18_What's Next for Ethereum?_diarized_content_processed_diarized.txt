00:00:00.250 - 00:00:27.010, Speaker A: What is next for Ethereum? We've started to work on EIP 4844, introduces a data availability layer which will reduce data costs for rollups and those savings kind of get passed on to users in the form of lower transaction fees. The other big thing I will mention is changing how self destruct works right now on Ethereum. If you deploy a contract, you can basically delete it. Self destruct as it exists today, what will not work, how possible it is to, like, deploy something and place it with something else. That's going to be changing.
