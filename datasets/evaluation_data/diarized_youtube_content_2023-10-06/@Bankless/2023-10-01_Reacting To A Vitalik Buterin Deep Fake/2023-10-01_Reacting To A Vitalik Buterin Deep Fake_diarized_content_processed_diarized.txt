00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.000, Speaker A: Everyone remembers when I sold billions of shiba inu tokens back in the day. Do I regret it? Well, I didn't. That is, not until I heard about Shib exchange. Shib exchange is pretty revolutionary in the crypto space. Making shiba inu the quote token is just genius. If I still had all those shiba inu tokens, I know exactly where I would take them. Let's fucking go.
00:00:22.610 - 00:00:26.230, Speaker B: The let's fucking go is end this thing.
00:00:26.300 - 00:00:27.590, Speaker C: What do you think that is? Out of ten.
00:00:27.660 - 00:00:34.610, Speaker B: This is one of the best quality defakes I've seen in a while because he's got the relatively natural body movements, even though they're a little bit repetitive.
00:00:34.690 - 00:00:35.922, Speaker C: And the voice was closest.
00:00:35.986 - 00:00:36.294, Speaker B: Pretty good.
00:00:36.332 - 00:00:37.622, Speaker C: It's not quite there, but it's close.
00:00:37.676 - 00:00:41.318, Speaker B: Ish vitalik. Will never, ever say let's fucking go. But I.
00:00:41.324 - 00:00:44.660, Speaker C: Mean, with a different script, I think I would give it like a seven or eight out of ten.
