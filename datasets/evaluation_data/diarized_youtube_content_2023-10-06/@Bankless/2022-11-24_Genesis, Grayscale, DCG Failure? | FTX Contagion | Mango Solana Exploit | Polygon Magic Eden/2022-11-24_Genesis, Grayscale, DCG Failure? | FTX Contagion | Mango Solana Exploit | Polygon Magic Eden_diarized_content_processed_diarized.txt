00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.440, Speaker A: Is Genesis going to take the entire crypto industry down?
00:00:05.970 - 00:00:15.982, Speaker B: Bankless nation. Happy third, not Friday, thursday of November. Happy Thanksgiving to you if you are in the US. And enjoying the holiday. David, what time is it?
00:00:16.036 - 00:00:33.798, Speaker A: Oh, Ryan, it's the Thursday bankless weekly roll up, where we cover the entire well, not the entire week. Four days in crypto, which is still an ambitious endeavor, even though we're missing a day. So we persevere into the frontier nonetheless. With coffee, among other things.
00:00:33.884 - 00:00:36.502, Speaker B: Great modifications, David. People are really going to appreciate that.
00:00:36.556 - 00:00:38.390, Speaker A: I had to do that on the seat of my pants.
00:00:38.970 - 00:00:44.938, Speaker B: Maybe turkey, too, I don't know. Look, do you think anyone's actually listening to this on Thanksgiving? Maybe they're on their way.
00:00:45.024 - 00:00:45.434, Speaker A: They are?
00:00:45.472 - 00:00:56.618, Speaker B: Yeah, to a Thanksgiving meal with their family and they're wondering what the heck they're going to say when their friends and family ask them about crypto.
00:00:56.714 - 00:01:02.366, Speaker A: That Sam bankman freed. That complex, controversial Sam bankman freed character. Yeah.
00:01:02.468 - 00:01:09.922, Speaker B: So how's it going in crypto these days? We know you love it, we know you're into it. What's happening? I bet that's going to be a question.
00:01:10.056 - 00:01:16.578, Speaker A: We're going to prepare you for that question, too. I'm going to ask Ryan how he's going to prepare for that question, and I'm sure he's going to ask me the same.
00:01:16.664 - 00:01:19.526, Speaker B: David, what are your Thanksgiving plans? You going somewhere, I know you are.
00:01:19.548 - 00:01:34.038, Speaker A: But tell me more after we record this roll up. Go take a long cab to Newark, fly home, get to see my one and a half year old nephew, see how much he's turned into a chatterbox. Apparently. I keep on joking with my family. I'm going to turn him into a podcaster.
00:01:34.134 - 00:01:39.546, Speaker B: Do you know what's awesome, though, is being able to spend some time with normal people for a while.
00:01:39.728 - 00:01:40.586, Speaker A: It's rare for me.
00:01:40.608 - 00:02:03.218, Speaker B: Let me tell. I know you moved to New York to hang out with crypto friends and such, and I hang out with, I guess, virtually a lot of crypto people as well. It's just like crypto talk, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? Just to talk about regular things for a while, especially after the month that was November. So far. That's actually going to feel pretty refreshing to me. Anyway, what do we got this week coming up?
00:02:03.304 - 00:02:34.502, Speaker A: Oh, my God. So we of course, have to talk about the Genesis contagion. Is Genesis going to take the entire crypto industry down? We'll talk about that FTX. Of course, there's still plenty to talk about FTX there. This news has, of course, gone on to Capitol Hill where there is a bankruptcy hearing going on. And third, a Dex hack on Solana leads to an exploiter shorting curve using Ave. And then that exploiter getting liquidated because of a short squeeze, leaving bad debt in Aave.
00:02:34.502 - 00:02:57.460, Speaker A: What the hell are we going to do about that? We'll get into that story and more. But first, please, like and subscribe because Ryan and I, like we always say at the beginning of the show, persevere into the frontier nonetheless. And sometimes it really just helps to get those likes and reviews and those subscriptions. So if you are watching on YouTube, please subscribe. If you are listening to the podcast, please give us a five star review so we can get to the top of the charts and make it through this bear market.
00:02:58.230 - 00:03:15.274, Speaker B: Absolutely. And we're thankful for you, Bankless Nation, for tuning in. We have a lot in store in 2023. We're not going anywhere. In fact, we are doubling down, tripling down on content. In fact, there will be a few ways to get involved with that. Some alpha that will drop in the episode today.
00:03:15.274 - 00:03:54.562, Speaker B: Some deals coming up coming out of Bankless too. But before we get there, David got to talk about our friends and sponsors over at Infura. Infura, of course, they run archival nodes for Ethereum, among other smart contract networks. If you've ever used something like MetaMask, for example, they are an RPC client. So that means they provide some of the historical data node architecture that serves up your MetaMask transactions. And the cool things that you're doing in probably maybe you know about Infura, maybe you don't. What you might not know is they are taking steps, moving forward to decentralize their infrastructure.
00:03:54.562 - 00:04:12.022, Speaker B: Okay, previously this has been quite centralized, including a centralization vector. But if we're going to rebuild on the other side of this bear market and during the bear market, we need to rebuild it on decentralized rails. So how can folks get involved in what Infura is doing? And how should they tap in? David?
00:04:12.086 - 00:04:47.430, Speaker A: Oh, I think they should just go ahead and click the link in the show notes, Ryan, where you can join the early access program for Infira's new decentralized infrastructure network. So how do we take the service and products that Infira has and turn them into a network, a protocol, a permissionless system that anyone can join? That is the frontier that Inferra is taking on. And if you want to join in that journey into the frontier man, I'm really milking this metaphor today. You can click the link in the show Notes to sign up and get your expertise and your information for Tuanfira so they can coordinate.
00:04:47.930 - 00:05:06.878, Speaker B: All right, David, speaking of coordination, I guess price markets, what is that? It's just a coordination game. So let's get to the markets. All right, let's talk about Bitcoin and the price. And I was told, by the way, our editors might throw in some music here and it's going to be sad music if we manage to do that. It's going to be sad music this week because what, David, are we up or are we down?
00:05:06.964 - 00:05:21.218, Speaker A: We are down. We are down. Well, actually, I would say Bitcoin is inside of the flat range, down 1.3%. So started at 16,500, ending at 16,300. You're just kind of flattish at that.
00:05:21.224 - 00:05:22.946, Speaker B: Point, some green candles toward the end.
00:05:22.968 - 00:05:30.614, Speaker A: Of this, some recovery candles at the very end to make it not so bad. But I mean, we're still, like at the whole yeah.
00:05:30.652 - 00:05:32.786, Speaker B: Look at this. Look at November.
00:05:32.978 - 00:05:35.014, Speaker A: November is still a bad month.
00:05:35.132 - 00:05:43.158, Speaker B: This is the FDX drop, right? Sam Bankman, thank you very much for that one. I appreciate you. Okay. How about ETH? Up or down?
00:05:43.324 - 00:05:50.780, Speaker A: Down, actually. Down. Started the week at one $210. Currently at $1,150, down about 4.8%.
00:05:51.890 - 00:06:00.430, Speaker B: Okay, so still above in the four digit mode, actually. In fact, fairly well.
00:06:00.500 - 00:06:02.110, Speaker A: So you haven't bought yet then, huh?
00:06:02.850 - 00:06:14.318, Speaker B: I am planning some buys, but I'm tempted just a little bit. Okay. But I'm still also waiting for triple digit. I think triple digits coming. David, I could be wrong, but, I.
00:06:14.324 - 00:06:24.246, Speaker A: Mean, you said time you said it, I was like, Get the hell out of here. And then you turned out to be right, and this time I'm like, Get the hell out of here. I think we're done with triple digits. I think it's over.
00:06:24.268 - 00:06:26.150, Speaker B: You think we're done with triple digits?
00:06:27.370 - 00:06:33.786, Speaker A: If it didn't happen just now, like yesterday with the DCG news, then I don't know how here's the thing.
00:06:33.808 - 00:06:56.526, Speaker B: You're talking local crypto, though, all right? We still got macro ahead. We haven't talked about macro, and I think we've got some tailwinds on the macro front that could send us down. Also, we're still getting attention. I mean, even though bad things are happening, we've got eyeballs on the space. Anytime you get eyeballs on the space, you get some price action. Sometimes it's negative, sometimes it's positive. But the worst possible time for markets.
00:06:56.638 - 00:06:59.150, Speaker A: Is the doldrum period when no one cares.
00:06:59.230 - 00:07:00.190, Speaker B: No one cares.
00:07:00.270 - 00:07:04.722, Speaker A: So you could be waiting for triple digits at, like, Q three or Q.
00:07:04.776 - 00:07:22.810, Speaker B: Four, not a spike. Down triple digits is Apathy, my friend. Yeah, look, I think apathy liquidation candle. Yeah, but call us, all right? The David versus Ryan bet, it's on. We headed to triple digits or not. How long can David last? We will see. To be continued.
00:07:23.230 - 00:07:27.046, Speaker A: David makes another bottom call. Great. Fantastic.
00:07:27.238 - 00:07:28.870, Speaker B: The contra indicator.
00:07:29.030 - 00:07:30.582, Speaker A: Add another one to the closet.
00:07:30.646 - 00:07:32.314, Speaker B: We'll see. You might be right on this one, though.
00:07:32.352 - 00:07:34.750, Speaker A: But if I keep on calling them, eventually I'll be right.
00:07:34.820 - 00:07:43.698, Speaker B: I for 01:00 a.m. Thankful for David bottom calls because they give us some historical perspective here. What's this one? ETH bitcoin ratio. Any bottoms you want to call here?
00:07:43.784 - 00:07:51.220, Speaker A: Yeah. Ignoring that. 3.5% down on the week to .706.
00:07:52.870 - 00:07:55.138, Speaker B: Okay. Total crypto market cap. Give us numbers.
00:07:55.224 - 00:07:59.862, Speaker A: We lost $10 billion. We are down to 850,000,000,000 in total crypto market cap.
00:07:59.996 - 00:08:22.234, Speaker B: All right, still well decently below a trillion. You know what? Let's zoom out for a minute because there are some other people that are like my friend David here, and they are calling the bottom right now. There are other bottom callers, not the other. And by the way, I am calling a bottom ish see, see, David, I like the hedge. I like to be in all camps.
00:08:22.362 - 00:08:23.678, Speaker A: You're saying we're close to the bottom?
00:08:23.764 - 00:08:32.286, Speaker B: I'm saying please also call me a bottom caller. But approximate bottom caller, I'm not going to put a number on it. I still think it's triple digits, but we're in the zone my friends plus.
00:08:32.308 - 00:08:33.758, Speaker A: Or -10% or something that's what I.
00:08:33.764 - 00:08:57.614, Speaker B: Think and this is one of my favorite charts to look at it's sad, but it's the chart that I was like it's not a chart. It's a percentage. It's a metric that I was glued to in 2018, 2019 previous bear cycles. And this is percentage down from all time high. I really like this as a metric during the bear market. It's a painful metric, but you can also see the precedent that we've set before. So just some context.
00:08:57.614 - 00:09:21.758, Speaker B: These numbers are burning into my brain. Bitcoin last bear market, down from all time high, about 83%. Something around this range, ethereum down 94% into 95. I think you got like, if you round it, it's like 95%. I thought we were stopping last cycle at 90% and I was like, there's no way we're going to 95. And we did okay.
00:09:21.844 - 00:09:32.946, Speaker A: And also to drive that point home, the difference between going down 90% and 95% is another 50% drop. It is not five more percent, it is 50 more percent.
00:09:33.128 - 00:09:35.998, Speaker B: And boy, that last 50 hits, it really hurts.
00:09:36.174 - 00:09:37.874, Speaker A: That one is the knife of the heart, man.
00:09:37.912 - 00:10:00.858, Speaker B: All right, so let's look at where we are right now in the percentage down from all time high is a proxy for pain to me. Yes. How much pain are we in? Duration is another one because that brings the apathy. But like raw pain that you're feeling in the pit of your stomach right now, bitcoin is 76%. Down from all time high. Compare that to 83% last time bottom. Ethereum down 76% as well.
00:10:00.944 - 00:10:01.954, Speaker A: Yeah, that's impressive.
00:10:02.022 - 00:10:17.762, Speaker B: Crazy that these two assets are down because bitcoin was supposed to be the king asset. When there's a bear market, there's a flight to safety, there's a flight to Stablecoins, a flight to bitcoin, and we're seeing ethereum hold up the same.
00:10:17.816 - 00:10:28.100, Speaker A: And that is after Ryan, the FTX exploiter hacker sells a bunch of ether for bitcoin, which you know, is a one time sell event and.
00:10:35.290 - 00:10:55.710, Speaker B: Not a ton of pain in these two ecosystems. To be honest, compared to what we've seen, certainly ethereum only 76%. Like, whatever, that's just a flesh wound, my friend. Right. Why is Tether down 20% from that's got to be anomaly, never mind BNB. Look how the CZ Empire is holding up. 57% down from all time high.
00:10:55.780 - 00:11:03.550, Speaker A: And this is because of the buyback and burn mechanism in BNB, which I will remind listeners, is the same similar mechanism as EIP 1559 and ethereum.
00:11:03.630 - 00:11:28.626, Speaker B: It's also because the CZ Empire has held very steady yes. During this so far. And he's just knocked out a few competitors. But other decentralized networks let's talk about Cardano, for instance, 90% off 90%. All right. Last time they went to, like, 98, 99% from all time high, right? Dogecoin 90%. Polygon, 71% layer, two token hang.
00:11:28.658 - 00:11:31.750, Speaker A: Wow, that beat both bitcoin and ethereum, didn't it?
00:11:31.820 - 00:11:47.866, Speaker B: Polka dot, 90%. This is also the proving ground of, like, how many holders do you have? And you see this in the numbers. Like, people don't have faith in polka dot right now in comparison to polygon. Litecoin, 81%. God only knows what that means. Who's holding litecoin? I don't know. Salana.
00:11:47.866 - 00:11:50.670, Speaker B: David, look at this. 95%.
00:11:50.820 - 00:11:59.870, Speaker A: And this is what I've been saying. Salana community, from what I've seen on Twitter, is still around and they are still pretty bullish on their ecosystem.
00:11:59.950 - 00:12:00.686, Speaker B: That's impressive.
00:12:00.718 - 00:12:15.030, Speaker A: I am not necessarily interested in salana the technology, but I am impressed that the community around Salana is still holding out and they are down as bad as we were Ryan, back in 2018. And so that interests me.
00:12:15.180 - 00:12:27.514, Speaker B: That is interesting. If a community can survive this, that is an interesting thing. Like, the Cardano community survived this, and regardless of what you think of the network, the community survived, and that led to a more bullish return.
00:12:27.632 - 00:12:27.962, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:12:28.016 - 00:12:34.798, Speaker B: The last one I'll read out is Avalanche. That's down 91% from all time high. But Adams, on the other hand, I.
00:12:34.804 - 00:12:39.790, Speaker A: Don'T know where the Avalanche community is. I haven't heard a peep out of any AVAX person in my Twitter mentions in a while.
00:12:39.860 - 00:12:52.450, Speaker B: It's been real quiet, like their equivalent ICO. They're having kind of their ICO exit. All the locked coins get unlocked anyway.
00:12:52.520 - 00:12:55.422, Speaker A: All of the 3 hours capital locked apax tokens.
00:12:55.486 - 00:13:01.058, Speaker B: Yes. So that's where we are. All right, who's calling the bottom, though? Bottom caller number one. Who's this, David?
00:13:01.154 - 00:13:23.902, Speaker A: Kathy Wood goes on coinbase and GBTC buying spree. I'm not sure if you're calling the bottom with that, but it's just implied. Kathy Wood of Arc Invest. She buys well, Arc, excuse me, buys 1.3 million shares of Coin, coming in at $56 million. And she also bought 315,000 shares of GBTC, basically the Grayscale bitcoin trust at $2.5 million.
00:13:23.902 - 00:13:26.158, Speaker A: So Kathy Wood going to the market.
00:13:26.324 - 00:13:33.310, Speaker B: There you go. Not afraid to call the bottom. Kathy's also not afraid to buy the top as well as, I think, a little bit.
00:13:33.380 - 00:13:35.134, Speaker A: Kathy's such a buyer, and that's why we like her.
00:13:35.172 - 00:13:35.634, Speaker B: There you go.
00:13:35.672 - 00:13:50.450, Speaker A: Dollar cost averaging here's. Kobe. Kobe is calling the bottom in fantastic Kobe fashion. Kobe tweets out. The way I see it, it's up to us now. Probs can't sit around on the benches anymore. To the Is for those that don't speak Kobe.
00:13:50.450 - 00:13:52.040, Speaker A: This is Kobe calling the bottom.
00:13:52.410 - 00:13:53.958, Speaker B: You think he's called the bottom?
00:13:54.124 - 00:13:54.886, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:55.068 - 00:14:09.242, Speaker B: I can't sit in the benches anymore. To the arena. You have to read a lot into that to be like, that's a bottom call, but that's what you're yeah. All right. So that's happening. And of course, we talked about Chris Berninski last time. He's been calling the bottom.
00:14:09.242 - 00:14:19.418, Speaker B: We put out a podcast on that last week. Well, let's talk about another thing that's happening in the markets, and this is the journey towards people going bankless.
00:14:19.594 - 00:14:55.366, Speaker A: I love bankwards. We are looking at Ryan people going bankless. So this is a chart of the amount of assets AUM of all centralized exchanges. And so right before the FTX demise, we were coming in at basically $130,000,000,000 of money inside exchanges. Then the FTX happens, and we are now clocking in at just above $100 billion. So we almost have $30 billion of people taking well, we also lost some capital, so there's that. But also, people have taken a lot of that money off of exchanges into self custody.
00:14:55.366 - 00:15:02.314, Speaker A: If it's not on a centralized exchange, it's in self custody. So we are watching people in real time take custody over their assets. Cool. We like that.
00:15:02.352 - 00:15:05.754, Speaker B: Is that okay, David? I mean, they're doing it out of fear rather than love. They're going bank.
00:15:05.802 - 00:15:08.222, Speaker A: That's fine. It doesn't matter. That's fine.
00:15:08.276 - 00:15:18.338, Speaker B: We'll take them fear or love, either. Whatever the motivation is, we'll take it. This is some interesting motivation, some metrics coming out of Polygon on Uniswap as well. What are we looking at?
00:15:18.424 - 00:15:40.314, Speaker A: Yeah, Polygon, the Uniswap implementation on polygon hit its all time high in volume numbers with ten days to go in November. So this is monthly volume. And November has already beaten all previous months. In terms of all time high. At the time that this was Tweeted, we still had ten days to go. So Polygon uniswap on polygon, putting in some massive numbers. I think that's wow.
00:15:40.314 - 00:15:53.614, Speaker A: Is that $3.3 billion so far in the first 20 days of November? So congrats to the Uniswap implementation on polygon. Never congratulated a specific implementation of a protocol before, but here we go.
00:15:53.732 - 00:15:59.790, Speaker B: Congrats on the version update to iOS software to Apple. Fantastic.
00:16:00.130 - 00:16:00.814, Speaker A: Well, it's cool.
00:16:00.852 - 00:16:21.922, Speaker B: I mean, Uniswap on main chain hit all time highs, too. Not all time highs. Excuse me, but we're just crushing it in terms of volume. Last week we were talking about that. I think this is my favorite chart right now in all of crypto. It's the only chart that makes me bullish, I guess. What are we looking at here? This is a chart from Token Terminal.
00:16:21.922 - 00:16:35.114, Speaker B: And it is, I think, something that I hope has been impressed upon regular bankless listeners heads, a concept that we've been talking about from the very beginning. But why don't you explain the chart and then we can talk about the significance here.
00:16:35.232 - 00:16:58.114, Speaker A: Okay, so on this chart, we see two things. We see the purple line, which is the ETH price chart. I'm sure no one really needed that because we all know what the chart looks like. Probably the green area, which largely corresponds with the actual price chart. When there's spikes in the price chart, there's definitely spikes in the green area. The green area, there's two different axes. Here you have, of course, the ETH price or the ETH market cap.
00:16:58.114 - 00:17:01.940, Speaker A: And then you also have revenue. And that is what the green thing is.
00:17:02.390 - 00:17:05.290, Speaker B: The green thing is profit, I believe. Actually, it's earnings.
00:17:05.390 - 00:17:08.994, Speaker A: Oh, it's earnings. Excuse me. Okay, so net revenue, right? Net earnings.
00:17:09.042 - 00:17:18.830, Speaker B: Yes. And how do we calculate? So the way we calculate earnings is we take revenue minus cost effectively fees.
00:17:18.930 - 00:17:32.282, Speaker A: Transaction fees minus block reward issuance. So how much people spend on a transaction aggregated into a block minus how much Ether that block issues.
00:17:32.416 - 00:17:38.366, Speaker B: Yes. And so, as we've said, I hope this is nailed into people's heads. What do blockchains sell, David? What do they sell?
00:17:38.388 - 00:17:41.630, Speaker A: Blockspace. They sell blockspace, Ryan. That's the only thing that they have.
00:17:41.780 - 00:17:57.654, Speaker B: The thing that they sell is blockspace. All right, so blockchains sell blocks. Blockchain sell blocks. This is the profit on the sale of blocks for Ethereum. You're seeing that in green. And by the way, this is an all time history chart for Ethereum all the way back. And so what are we seeing in the green, David, from the early days.
00:17:57.692 - 00:18:39.058, Speaker A: Up until now, up until now, when the price of Ether goes up, the loss of Ethereum, the negative earnings goes up. And this is the fundamental problem with proof of work, is that as Ether goes up, the size of the block reward goes up. Right? So Ether started at like $10, and then in 2017 it got up to one $400. So the revenue that was coming, the issuance coming out of Ethereum for every single block did a 14 X, right? That was just sold. That wasn't captured, that was just sold. That's loss. Because that is what people Ethereum is not collecting enough transaction fee revenue to offset the amount of Ether that they.
00:18:39.064 - 00:18:41.614, Speaker B: Are issuing, basically selling its product at a loss.
00:18:41.742 - 00:18:42.082, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:42.136 - 00:18:43.154, Speaker B: The higher the price goes.
00:18:43.192 - 00:18:45.794, Speaker A: And it's worse in bull market, it's not better.
00:18:45.912 - 00:18:46.594, Speaker B: Exactly, yes.
00:18:46.632 - 00:19:23.754, Speaker A: And so the higher transaction fees under a proof of work paradigm, the higher the price of Ether, the more the loss Ethereum has because the US dollar amount is sold. If you controlled for Ether, this would be a different story. But this is what we're looking at in dollars at the very end of this chart, if you zoom all the way into the very end where there's the merge, you can see that all of the lost goes away and there's little bits of profit. Little bits of profit. You can see small little spikes to the upside. But of course, if we went to ultrasound money, you would see how much we have been able to recapture via the combination of EP one five nine and proof of stake.
00:19:23.802 - 00:19:23.966, Speaker B: Okay.
00:19:23.988 - 00:19:29.874, Speaker A: Anyways, the point is that Ethereum is now profitable. Profitable in the green for the first.
00:19:29.912 - 00:19:32.354, Speaker B: Time ever in all of crypto, the.
00:19:32.392 - 00:19:38.726, Speaker A: Entire industry, the first profitable blockchain that happened with the merge, and now we are seeing some data on it.
00:19:38.728 - 00:20:03.414, Speaker B: It's happening in a bear market when people aren't looking. Do you know what this reminds me of a little bit is, do you know Amazon during the.com bust? People like it's over, dot coms are over. Amazon goes down 95% during that time. It was absolutely crushing it in terms of market, in terms of the core metrics for people who are looking, but no one noticed. Why? Because websites were dead. Like dot coms were dead.
00:20:03.414 - 00:20:35.270, Speaker B: Amazon was never coming back. These are the sorts of silent metrics we should be looking at here. And only people who are in the space and who haven't left, only the settlers, not the tourists, are paying attention. Because this is, by the way, the first blockchain in history to ever go profitable. And it's not happening during a bull run when it's easy. It's happening during the bear. And I think, David, you have some extrapolation on these numbers because you somehow slipped this in.
00:20:35.340 - 00:20:43.180, Speaker A: I put in my research hat and my data analysis hat, and I made an extrapolation for the next bull run, and I put that into this chart here.
00:20:44.670 - 00:20:49.578, Speaker B: Explain to me how you extrapolated the profit in the next bull run.
00:20:49.744 - 00:21:05.838, Speaker A: So what I did is you actually might notice that the shape of the green revenue chart on the right looks for me is the same shape as the green loss revenue in the 2017. And I flipped it and I made it way bigger. And that is my projection.
00:21:05.934 - 00:21:19.334, Speaker B: David is roughly projecting that all of this loss turns to profit on the other side during the bull market. And we all know who are the recipients of that profit. Who gets that? The upside on this?
00:21:19.372 - 00:21:22.370, Speaker A: That's a good question. Is it ether holders?
00:21:22.450 - 00:21:32.378, Speaker B: I think it might be, David. I think it might be. Anyway, look, that's happening in the background. It's a chart that makes both David and myself optimistic. Stupid bullish again.
00:21:32.464 - 00:21:40.826, Speaker A: God, imagine Ryan, if it was going in the opposite direction, if it was negative. And all this bad news be like, sweet. There's like literally nothing that's cool about crypto right now.
00:21:40.848 - 00:22:01.614, Speaker B: Guys, I just want to say this is not the story for all chains. This is the other thing, right, is like you have to decide if you're going to hold through this bear market. You have to decide what assets you're going to hold, what you have conviction on coming out of this, this story that's generating revenue. You can't see this story in other chains. You won't see this. Nothing against other communities and such, but except for BNB.
00:22:01.662 - 00:22:08.838, Speaker A: Except for BNB, because that's what's in burn chain. BNB chain has this similar mechanism. It's manual, it's fine.
00:22:08.924 - 00:22:30.410, Speaker B: Sure. In bottom line, what does this mean is the block space that we're selling. The product that we're selling is profitable now, and it hasn't previously been until now. I think we've beaten that dead horse. Here's something cool, though. All right, so this is Thursday when this episode is released. But on Friday, bankless is doing a Black Friday deal.
00:22:30.410 - 00:23:19.706, Speaker B: Okay? And so we have this thing if you've never gotten into kind of the newsletter side of things or the membership side of things, we have this thing we call a Bankless Premium membership. All sorts of great perks the newsletter, you get the premium podcast feed, you get all sorts of which has no ad stress. Yes. And you also get our AirDrop reports, you get all kind of our token ratings reports, all sorts of things. And this is actually because it's been such a crazy bad month and because it's Black Friday, this is the most discounted we've ever offered a Bankless subscription. I'm looking at a draft email here, but it's set to go out tomorrow morning, friday morning. So if you want to get the 25% discount, the way you do it is you go to newsletter Banklesshq.com
00:23:19.706 - 00:23:31.450, Speaker B: and sign up. You will get this email delivered to you and you have the opportunity to upgrade to Bankless Premium for 25% off. This will only be like a Black Friday thing. I think it expires.
00:23:31.530 - 00:23:33.818, Speaker A: Have we ever done a discount before, Ryan?
00:23:33.994 - 00:23:51.286, Speaker B: We have done discounts in the past, but never this high. This is a 25% discount. And when we do discounts, it's always a very time limited window. And this is the biggest one time limited. So anyway, if you've been looking for an excuse to upgrade to Bankless Premium, see what the oh, by the way, I didn't even yeah, there is a.
00:23:51.308 - 00:23:54.054, Speaker A: Huge excuse to upgrade to Bankless Premium. Why?
00:23:54.092 - 00:23:55.270, Speaker B: What are we doing next year?
00:23:55.340 - 00:24:30.418, Speaker A: Because you might notice some interesting new branding, some new images going out into what we are calling Bankless 2.0. We are migrating from substack onto our own platform, got our own website, own designers. It looks so good. And we now have Bankless's own self sovereign hub for cooler and neater things. And so Bankless during the last bear market, went from zero to one, as in we didn't exist and then we existed. And now we're going from one to ten. It feels like wait, you said this.
00:24:30.424 - 00:24:32.930, Speaker B: Was 20, but it's a ten x improvement.
00:24:34.150 - 00:24:41.910, Speaker A: It's about one order of magnitude of growth. And this is part of that story. Bankless is going to look brand new very soon.
00:24:41.980 - 00:24:48.230, Speaker B: It's going to be great. We're going to incorporate collectibles. We're going to incorporate the POAP badges. Anyway, that's not here yet.
00:24:48.300 - 00:24:52.890, Speaker A: That's like but you get 25% off when it comes.
00:24:52.960 - 00:24:55.322, Speaker B: Yeah, you're not going to get 25% when everyone wants it.
00:24:55.376 - 00:24:56.074, Speaker A: Yes, exactly.
00:24:56.192 - 00:25:12.158, Speaker B: All right, that's the point. We might be reminding you once or twice as well about this, the course of the show. We really want you guys into this. I think it'd be cool to kind of grow the nation this way. All right, we got some stuff coming up next. David what are we going to talk about?
00:25:12.324 - 00:25:58.490, Speaker A: Is Genesis going to take down the industry? Ryan that is what everyone is worried about. The FTX story continues all the way to Capitol Hill. And like I said, Ave is left with bad debt after someone tries to short curve and then sucker punch that curve shorter by releasing a new stablecoin product and liquidated. Yeah. Anyways, we're going to tell those stories and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless the Brave Wallet is your secure multi chain on ramp into Web Three and is built directly into the Brave privacy browser.

00:27:23.318 - 00:27:46.626, Speaker B: IO the question on everyone's mind going into this Thanksgiving will Genesis fail the Barry Silbert empire? Grayscale genesis, is this the next point of contagion? David we've got some things that are developing this week. Can you tell us the story of DCG group Genesis? Grayscale and what we need to know at this point?
00:27:46.648 - 00:28:12.066, Speaker A: In time all the way back in June of 2021. Ryan almost a year and a half ago, barry Silbert, who's the head guy at Digital Currency Group who's very informed, been in OG, been around since like 2012, 2013. He tweets out. And if you remember, June is right after that big liquidation candle from Ether's, all time high at the time, from $4,300 down to like one $700 bitcoin goes.
00:28:12.108 - 00:28:14.186, Speaker B: Barely remember that, but yes, right.
00:28:14.288 - 00:28:48.658, Speaker A: It was the first big drawdown after the bull market started. And Barry Silbert says he tweets out right after that happened. There's a daisy chain of borrowers and lenders in the crypto space, most well capitalized, but some are not. Lots of leverage still in the system, including some non obvious places important to understand counterparty risk and where the weak links are in the chain. Wow, does that tweet hit different now? As it turns out, it would take a year for all of that daisy chain of liquidation events to show up. And Ryan, that is the video that you and I made yesterday. So it was an hour and 50 minutes long video.
00:28:48.658 - 00:29:17.790, Speaker A: This was me. I was Charlie from Ollie Sunny doing the whole conspiracy thing, starting with going all the way back to 2020 when the GBTC trade was on and how 3 hours capital leveled up on that. And then they went long on Bitcoin and Ether, and then they went long on Soluna AVAX, and then they got liquidated and that got liquidated Riveting tail. It's pretty crazy, honestly, that people are going to anyways, Genesis is the final piece of that puzzle.
00:29:18.450 - 00:29:19.914, Speaker B: We're calling the final domino.
00:29:19.962 - 00:29:47.682, Speaker A: We're calling the final domino. And that is why everyone is so worried about Genesis, is because it is the foundation of everything. What is Genesis? It is probably the biggest lending desk in all of crypto. It is the only prime brokerage for all of crypto, facilitated so much of the basal levels of yield across the space, the Gemini earn program, et cetera. And so the fact that we have arrived here at Genesis is indicative of like, this is the last domino.
00:29:47.746 - 00:30:12.922, Speaker B: This is appropriately named arrived at Genesis. Right, I've been thinking about that. There's almost something biblical Genesis, right? Okay. So just for people who don't know what a prime brokerage is, just think of it as like a regular brokerage except for big institutions. What I mean by regular brokerage, maybe you've dabbled in stocks and this sort of thing. So maybe you have an E trade account or Fidelity account or Charles Schwab account. It's like that only for mega institutions.
00:30:12.922 - 00:30:49.242, Speaker B: And in Genesis's case, a mega institution would be like a large hedge fund like Ethereum's Capital, for instance. And it also has some advanced features that they don't generally provide the retail, but some brokerage accounts do, like the ability to go margin long on some sort of collateral. So I've got this stock here, I've got this crypto asset here, and it's worth $100,000. Right. Can I borrow against that and go do something with that leverage with that borrow? And of course, the institution, the brokerage, can liquidate them all sorts of things. Anyway, that's all it is. It's actually pretty simple.
00:30:49.242 - 00:30:56.398, Speaker B: It's just not something that regular Average Joe people in crypto can access. It was the big institutional yeah.
00:30:56.564 - 00:31:20.322, Speaker A: Anyways, people start to get worried about Genesis just because how related they are to every other lending desk in the space. And also on November 9, they tweet out, we took a $7 million haircut when we liquidated a bunch of collateral involving some of the contagion involving Alameda. Only $7 million. Tiny. Not that bad. Not that big of a deal. They're just saying that, hey, we took a haircut.
00:31:20.322 - 00:31:36.742, Speaker A: But the next day, they announced that they actually had $175,000,000 in locked funds on the FTX trading account. But then they said, this does not impact our market making activities. Six days later, Genesis halts withdrawals in the wake of the FTX collapse.
00:31:36.806 - 00:31:37.942, Speaker B: Not going in a good direction.
00:31:38.006 - 00:31:50.490, Speaker A: That's bad. That's a bad trajectory. And then, of course, anyone that's plugged into Genesis, like Gemini Earn, also can no longer facilitate withdrawals. So Gemini Earn has to stop facilitating withdrawals.
00:31:50.570 - 00:31:52.814, Speaker B: That does have retail exposure right there, right?
00:31:52.852 - 00:32:33.594, Speaker A: And now, people, this is Max Fear crypto. Twitter was in a state of max fear all of this week, to the point where Grayscale, which is part of Digital Currency Group, part of the same subsidiary that Genesis is. Although these are separate entities in of themselves, grayscale felt compelled to tweet out, in the wake of recent events, our investors should know that the safety and security of the holdings underlying Grayscale Digital Asset Products are unaffected, saying, hey, we still have all the assets under the balance sheet. Just because Genesis has a hole in their wallet doesn't mean that our assets are affected. These are unrelated. And then on November 20, it leaks that there was an undisclosed loan from Genesis to Digital Currency Group. Again, nothing to do with Grayscale.
00:32:33.594 - 00:32:52.846, Speaker A: And I'll just plant this flag. Grayscale is totally fine. There is no further news. Grayscale is totally fine. This is just between Genesis and the larger Digital Currency Group, the thing that owns Genesis. There was an undisclosed loan from Genesis to Digital Currency Group, and that perked a bunch of people's ears. Like, all right, well, these are owned by the same umbrella.
00:32:52.846 - 00:32:55.710, Speaker A: Why are they, like, loaning each other money anyways?
00:32:55.790 - 00:33:00.082, Speaker B: And given recent events, people are probably hearkening back to FTX and Alameda.
00:33:00.146 - 00:33:00.566, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:33:00.668 - 00:33:01.266, Speaker B: Self dealing.
00:33:01.298 - 00:33:14.186, Speaker A: Exactly. Yes. Anyways, that was a very fast timeline. Just to recap, november Eigth, no material net credit exposure. November 9, we lost at a million dollars. Okay. November 10, we lost $175,000,000.
00:33:14.186 - 00:33:38.190, Speaker A: November 16, sorry, no new withdrawals. We don't have any money for you. November 17, okay, we need $1 billion. November 21, which was two days ago. Okay, we'll go bankrupt without the money, so we need to fundraise a billion dollars. And so then Frank Shaparo out of the block. He disclosed that he reveals that sources tell the block that Genesis has been struggling to raise emergency capital.
00:33:38.190 - 00:34:02.246, Speaker A: They wanted to raise a billion dollars, but they are lowering that to $500 million because it faces potential bankruptcy without funding. Oof. Not looking good. Everyone's PTSD from the week prior is getting triggered. Barry Silbert, the owner of Digital Currency Group, the guy that owns everything, the guy that tweeted out the Daisy chain of borrowers and lenders, basically the Sam.
00:34:02.278 - 00:34:11.126, Speaker B: Bankman sorry, I shouldn't say that Sam Bankman freed because that has negative connotations. Barry Silbert is not Sam Bankman Freed from a kind of scammer perspective, but he is the leader.
00:34:11.158 - 00:34:11.638, Speaker A: He's the leader.
00:34:11.654 - 00:34:18.526, Speaker B: The leader, the godfather, the major owner behind Digital Currency Group, which is Genesis and Grayscale and associated companies, right?
00:34:18.628 - 00:34:51.110, Speaker A: Yes. Barry writes and sends out a letter to all Digital Currency Group investors to clear up some of the details. And someone this Twitter account, TradFi Whale, put in a nice summary thread, which we will go ahead and read here, starting with a Tweet. Number one, Barry states that DCG has three loans a $350,000,000 revolver, a line of credit. Two, a $1.1 billion loan from Genesis, which is due on June of 23. 23? That's a typo.
00:34:51.110 - 00:34:52.454, Speaker A: Is it a ten year?
00:34:52.492 - 00:34:53.482, Speaker B: I think it's a ten year.
00:34:53.536 - 00:35:12.202, Speaker A: Okay, that's probably a ten year. That's probably right. And also another $575,000,000 loan due May of 23. That's a 23 loan. I dot. So what does this mean? A revolver is a short term credit facility that a company generally pays an upfront fee to have to help with cash flow issues. It usually has a high interest rate and restrictive covenants that need to be maintained.
00:35:12.202 - 00:35:38.178, Speaker A: Generally, revolvers are used as stopgaps for working capital or as a last resort in times of stress. This is not a great sign that DCG has this revolver, but then again, that's why it is there. The second loan, $1.1 billion, due in June of 2032. This is where it gets very sketchy. Basically, when Three Arrows Capital went under, genesis had a large hole in its balance sheet. I think Three Arrows Capital blew something like a 200 to 400 million dollar.
00:35:38.194 - 00:35:39.718, Speaker B: Hole in June of this year.
00:35:39.804 - 00:36:11.586, Speaker A: June of this year, yeah. They were insolvent, and in order of Genesis was insolvent, and in order to solve this, they did this. A little bit of magic accounting while also putting DCG, the parent company, at risk. So DCG took on the liability of Genesis, the whole in Genesis balance sheet, but they didn't have the cash to give Genesis for its hole in the balance sheet. So they took out a $1.1 billion ten year loan from Genesis, and then they gave the money back to Genesis to fill the gap. But up in a whole totally plugged, right?
00:36:11.608 - 00:36:26.322, Speaker B: Ryan it's totally crazy how many people were just swimming with no pants back in June and we didn't know. And it was all because of the Doequan blow up and three years capital blow up. And these were one of them. It was kind of tenuous at that time for DCG.
00:36:26.466 - 00:36:54.410, Speaker A: So the $1.1 billion came from the lending book gemini Earn and other retail yield products that use Genesis. Oof. So retail is paying for this. Essentially, Genesis borrowed from their own deposits to fill the hole, but used digital currency group as the go between to make it legal. Also, there's another 100 and $575,000,000 loan due in May of 23, so that's not that far away. So this explains why investors are balking with DCG.
00:36:54.410 - 00:37:28.102, Speaker A: This is clearly not fully above board. What next? Genesis has a liquidity shortfall of 1.65 billion right now to the depositors of the lending book it needs to file for bankruptcy. I suspect that they were trying to get someone to buy out DCG's ten year bond at some discount to give liquidity to depositors, but no takers DCG grayscale business, the grayscale business from DCG is extremely valuable. So here's what they did. Genesis was insolvent. DCG bailed it out, and so the equity holders of DCG are now at stake.
00:37:28.102 - 00:37:40.830, Speaker A: The other thing that is in DCG is grayscale. And so since it was basically the equity of DCG that plugged the Genesis hole, but the equity of DCG is involved with grayscale.
00:37:41.490 - 00:38:06.482, Speaker B: Grayscale is minting money. By the way, I think you have a chart later on that's like, what Grayscale? And by the way, the grayscale products are what ETH that you can buy in a trading account to trust and Gbtcs. This is where you can kind of buy proxy trust type ETF products. Not ETFs, but those types of products inside of your retirement account. How much was that minting?
00:38:06.546 - 00:38:09.158, Speaker A: David hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:38:09.244 - 00:38:24.426, Speaker B: Okay. And that's just like this year. I think there's a chart we have about that later. So that is a totally healthy, very profitable business. Completely solvent. The problem is that's bundled up with this whole Genesis thing, I guess the problem for DCG is and so they're using some of that funding to try to bail out DCG.
00:38:24.538 - 00:38:25.200, Speaker A: Right?
00:38:25.650 - 00:38:26.858, Speaker B: Bail out Genesis.
00:38:26.954 - 00:38:40.546, Speaker A: Right. So the value of grayscale the company is backstopping the value of DCG, the equity. And DCG's equity is basically what's plugging the hole in Genesis. Yikes. Yes.
00:38:40.648 - 00:38:41.202, Speaker B: Okay.
00:38:41.336 - 00:39:10.374, Speaker A: Contagion. Contagion. Yeah. And so, to resume DCG's grayscale company extremely valuable. DCG does not want to fire sale this, so they will likely let Genesis go under DCG. And DCG probably should have no problem raising 575,000,000 by May of 2023 to pay back that loan. The question is whether they spin off Grayscale and sell some equity at a depressed valuation, or they fire sell Perry Crypto tokens and raise equity or long term debt as a DCG entity.
00:39:10.374 - 00:39:34.178, Speaker A: It looks like to me that DCG will not file for bankruptcy. Grayscale is easily worth over a billion dollars. So TLDR Genesis borrowed from depositors to fill the hole in their balance sheet. Damn, I've heard that one before. By using DCG as a go between entity, genesis likely filing for bankruptcy. I think creditors will eventually get most of their money back and DCG will survive with a black eye and a marred reputation. And that is the story.
00:39:34.344 - 00:39:39.560, Speaker B: Wow. You know what this looks like, David, is not quite SBF level.
00:39:40.090 - 00:39:43.800, Speaker A: No, there's no fraudulence here, I don't think.
00:39:44.810 - 00:39:56.410, Speaker B: Question mark. This kind of thing is sketchy. Borrowing, filling holes, go between to make it legal from DCG Grayscale. This is some questionable things, some sketchiness here. Okay.
00:39:56.480 - 00:39:59.802, Speaker A: It's questionable. In contrast to FTX, which was just.
00:39:59.856 - 00:40:01.754, Speaker B: An absolute fraud show.
00:40:01.872 - 00:40:10.558, Speaker A: There's no question could there be a bigger fraud. This is all like you could probably take them to court, but you could definitely argue that this is above board.
00:40:10.644 - 00:40:34.166, Speaker B: Maybe, yes. But what's going to happen from this is this person predicts that DCG will survive with a black eye and a marred reputation and Genesis will probably get some of its money back in some way. So people aren't like creditors to Genesis aren't completely sunk. I don't know how all of this resolves, but we'll come the market liked it.
00:40:34.188 - 00:40:39.234, Speaker A: So the market, when this news came out this is not as bad as FTX.
00:40:39.282 - 00:40:40.006, Speaker B: Not even close.
00:40:40.108 - 00:40:45.914, Speaker A: Ether went up $100. Bitcoin went up like almost $1,000. So when this news came out, the market was like, okay, this isn't so bad.
00:40:45.952 - 00:40:52.542, Speaker B: This is a huge black eye to the Barry Silbert empire, though one of the OGS was just taking down a whole bunch of notches after this.
00:40:52.676 - 00:40:58.142, Speaker A: For those that don't know, DCG also owns CoinDesk. So that is also part of the.
00:40:58.196 - 00:41:01.280, Speaker B: DCG Group fire sale of Maybe.
00:41:01.650 - 00:41:03.214, Speaker A: No, I don't think so.
00:41:03.252 - 00:41:18.242, Speaker B: It's all part of the same. You could sell anything if you have to. Okay, so that's what's happening. Do you have any update for people like retail? Has money stuck in Gemini Earn for me? David, do you have any updates for me? Any good news, please?
00:41:18.376 - 00:41:29.194, Speaker A: Well, I'm happy to let you know, Ryan, that Gemini put out a Tweet thread updating their Earn customers with what's going on and they said that there is no update. Okay, sorry.
00:41:29.312 - 00:41:51.258, Speaker B: I have heard through back channels that maybe some people are getting their G USD out. Not quite sure about this, but just the I don't know if that hasn't been totally confirmed, so I don't know about that. All I know is any crypto that I had in Gemini Earn is still stuck. I do know this and they're not really updating.
00:41:51.434 - 00:41:57.454, Speaker A: We issue Poaps for every instance of Ryan law. No, only if we issue a PO.
00:41:57.492 - 00:42:10.120, Speaker B: App for David's bottom calls, then it will call it even. Big secondary market for bankless. Bad call. PO apps here. What's this take on the SEC?
00:42:10.810 - 00:42:40.254, Speaker A: I thought this was useful. A lot of the Contagion of 2022 is underpinned by the GBTC negative premium. So, in theory, one GPTC is backed by one bitcoin. Yet there's a discount of 42%, as in the GPTC asset is actually priced 42% below what is the net asset value of all bitcoin in grayscale. And that is because they can't turn the damn thing into an ETF because the SEC won't let them.
00:42:40.292 - 00:42:54.974, Speaker B: I'm going to look at a chart real quick, while you're just explaining that. If you want to see the chart, it is basically if you buy GBDC in your brokerage account and buy this GBDC trust, you're getting it at a 43% discount. Right.
00:42:55.112 - 00:43:00.582, Speaker A: Cheap bitcoin. It is cheap bitcoin. But there's no assurances that that discount is going to go back to zero.
00:43:00.636 - 00:43:06.466, Speaker B: Yes, and that's why it's bitcoin TM.
00:43:06.658 - 00:43:07.490, Speaker A: Bitcoin.
00:43:07.650 - 00:43:17.900, Speaker B: Ben hunt our friends. It's very much bitcoin TM. It's some bitcoin covered. It wrapped in a trust, wrapped in a proxy price thing. It's not a real bitcoin spot ETF, is it?
00:43:18.270 - 00:43:43.774, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, so back to the Tweet. I just thought this Tweet was great. By failing to create an ETF for bitcoin, the SEC allowed the grayscale to GBTC trade to rip retail for five plus years. That's the reason why the discount is there is because other people are able to milk retail out of their holdings because they're diluting retail and something selling into the market also charging 2% for just holding bitcoin.
00:43:43.822 - 00:43:45.470, Speaker B: That's why grayscale is so profitable.
00:43:45.550 - 00:44:10.554, Speaker A: That's why grayscale is so profitable. The net value of all assets under grayscale, grayscale charges 2%. That is an absurd fee if compared to an ETF. But we can't have that ETF because Gary Gensler doesn't let us. Anyways, the SEC also forced most trading outside of US jurisdiction, which allowed for the Contagion to go rampant and also let FTX's fraud hit millions of Americans. It couldn't. Anyways, I just thought that was good tweet.
00:44:10.602 - 00:44:21.230, Speaker B: Yeah, protecting retail. Question mark. That discount, by the way, is the record discount, 43%. I wonder if this is kind of a bottom call.
00:44:21.380 - 00:44:21.790, Speaker A: Yes.
00:44:21.860 - 00:44:24.220, Speaker B: I mean, are you bullish GBDC at the end?
