00:00:00.090 - 00:00:04.622, Speaker B: What advice do you have for the people that are putting on a builder's hat in 2023?
00:00:04.676 - 00:00:26.674, Speaker A: Don't be in it for the glamour. Like, build something if you like building stuff in this industry. If I stopped getting invited to fancy conferences or New York Times wrote something mean about me or whatever, I tried not to let it bother me, because that's not really the reason I got into it. I don't really care what other people think. I just want to work on stuff that I think matters and helps the world. Basically, anytime you're doing something that is innovative, you have to be willing to be ridiculed for it a little bit. That's kind of the nature of disruptive innovation.
00:00:26.674 - 00:00:31.060, Speaker A: If you're working on something that everyone thinks is a good idea, that's actually probably a bad sign. It means you're about to have a correction back.
