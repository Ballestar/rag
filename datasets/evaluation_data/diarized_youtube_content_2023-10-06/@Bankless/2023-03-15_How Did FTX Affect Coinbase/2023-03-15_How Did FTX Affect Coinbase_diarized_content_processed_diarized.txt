00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.358, Speaker A: How has the FTX collapse impacted Coinbase? As a business?
00:00:03.444 - 00:00:33.540, Speaker B: We had an incredible finance team who built a risk function within Coinbase, and they were essentially underwriting every counterparty where we were storing funds during the crisis. We were actually underwriting some of these things daily. That was one of the first things, but I guess just zooming out. How can we actually counteract this? One thing is to say, look, we agree with it, right? People in DC who still to this day believe that everybody in crypto essentially doesn't believe in regulation. How could this be true? Because for ten years we've been working on this. We've been saying this, just even repeating the very basic messages like that on the East Coast or in DC. When we interact with folks, you can't kind of underestimate the power of that.
