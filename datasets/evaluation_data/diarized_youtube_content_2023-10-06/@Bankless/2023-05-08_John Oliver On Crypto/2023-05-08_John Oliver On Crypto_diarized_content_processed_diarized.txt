00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.530, Speaker A: John Oliver on his show covered crypto. We should play some clips.
00:00:03.610 - 00:00:12.714, Speaker B: Three of the biggest collapses over the past year. In theory, they were supposed to be our next dollar, our next bank of America, and our next stock exchange. But in reality, they are fiascos.
00:00:12.762 - 00:00:13.486, Speaker A: He's not wrong on.
00:00:13.508 - 00:00:14.094, Speaker C: These takes.
00:00:14.212 - 00:00:16.922, Speaker A: These are the exact takes that we had. Let's play another clip.
00:00:16.986 - 00:00:24.702, Speaker B: If you are running a scam, you will be drawn to crypto. You are running a confidence game, and crypto offers the most efficient market for turning confidence into money.
00:00:24.756 - 00:00:28.070, Speaker A: The he's also right about that. Let's finish with the conclusion here.
00:00:28.140 - 00:00:40.242, Speaker B: Calling for more regulation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea here. Regulation might give this sector more legitimacy. It'll make a risky investment look safe when it is clearly not. Right now, this is all still a casino.
00:00:40.306 - 00:00:41.698, Speaker A: You regulate it so you get rid.
00:00:41.714 - 00:00:44.290, Speaker C: Of the scams and volatility. John Oliver's audience.
00:00:44.370 - 00:00:45.522, Speaker A: All the crypto haters.
00:00:45.586 - 00:00:48.038, Speaker C: That got bitter that their crypto friend made a bunch of money, I'll call.
00:00:48.044 - 00:00:49.190, Speaker A: Them fart smallers.
00:00:50.370 - 00:00:52.720, Speaker C: Are watching this show and being like.
00:00:53.650 - 00:00:54.426, Speaker A: Yeah, that's.
00:00:54.458 - 00:00:55.040, Speaker C: Great.
00:00:56.450 - 00:00:57.500, Speaker A: That's totally what happened.
