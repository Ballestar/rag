00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.142, Speaker A: We have no idea of the potential of attackers. If you go on zerodom.com, for instance, this is a market where you can buy and sell critical vulnerabilities. The most expensive one should be zero click and zero day remote code execution on Android or on iPhone and I think it's around 2 million. And this kind of vulnerability allows any attacker to get the full control of your mobile phone without you doing anything. And there's vulnerabilities are sold like not every day, but very often we see attackers leveraging this kind of vulnerability simply to do money or to spy on people. And with crypto, if ever as an attacker, I'm able to drain all the software wallet of every single users in the world just by buying a vulnerability, then 2 million is nothing.
