00:00:00.170 - 00:00:10.522, Speaker A: This is timeline from 2002 all the way to 2023. For every bank failure, there is a circle. And the size of the circle represents the number of assets in the bank that failed.
00:00:10.586 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker B: There's like 300 dots in there.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:13.626, Speaker A: What happened to these dots?
00:00:13.658 - 00:00:17.834, Speaker B: David omnom. Nom, nom, nom, nom. They got gobbled up by the bigger banks.
00:00:17.882 - 00:00:37.220, Speaker A: What we're looking at is a mountain of snowballs in 2008 versus a snowman in 2023. We just got big circles and it slightly smaller circle and then kind of a head circle. That's what we're looking at. And this represents the second, third and fourth largest bank failure in US history. All happened this year. This doesn't look good. Question is, what happens next?
