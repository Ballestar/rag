00:00:00.090 - 00:00:29.362, Speaker A: Do you actually think this industry can self regulate? I don't think complete self regulation in the long run is enough. Let's let people experiment more and sit tight and wait. That is somewhat underrated. It's psychologically a difficult thing to do, but often it's better to wait. And I feel right now we're in that situation. Do I think we should wait forever? No. I think there will come a point where the demands of legitimate institutions for regulation, regulatory clarity will be more important than keeping it completely unregulated.
00:00:29.362 - 00:00:31.300, Speaker A: But I don't see that we're close to that point today.
