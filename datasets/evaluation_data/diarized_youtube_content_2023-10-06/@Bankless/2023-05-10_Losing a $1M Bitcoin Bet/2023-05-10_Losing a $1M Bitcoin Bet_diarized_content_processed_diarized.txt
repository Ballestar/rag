00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.254, Speaker C: Bology. Do you remember the 90 day bitcoin bet? Yeah, he's capitulated on it.
00:00:04.292 - 00:00:22.654, Speaker A: Bology tweets out. I just burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions. The million dollar bet is now closed by mutual agreement. I made $1 million improvable on chain donations, which you can verify. He's basically saying the whole, like, bit signal was a marketing stunt to broadcast that they are going to print a trillion dollars.
00:00:22.772 - 00:00:26.230, Speaker C: Balogy says it's still gonna happen. It's just in 90 days.
00:00:26.300 - 00:00:27.414, Speaker B: And so then, of course, the question.
00:00:27.452 - 00:00:36.758, Speaker C: Is, okay, but when? My guess is 10% months. 70% years. 19% decades. 1% centuries. He's giving a much more probabilistic bet here.
00:00:36.844 - 00:00:41.206, Speaker A: 10% in months. Sounds like there's a 10% chance that bitcoin hits $1 million this.
00:00:41.228 - 00:00:42.214, Speaker D: Year over the long run.
00:00:42.252 - 00:00:43.810, Speaker C: I'm definitely not betting that. Biology.
