00:00:00.170 - 00:00:29.380, Speaker A: Is crypto the solution for banking crisis? There's a positive story here for crypto. The 2008 Cris would not have happened if you settled securities on chain. So there's an incredible opportunity for crypto to strengthen our banking and financial markets. But DFI was an institutional grade, so we need more engineering, more technology and we need a policy environment as well as a positive vision for crypto. The values for crypto censorship resistant, lower transaction costs. Those are noble qualities and they improve the quality of life for ordinary people.
