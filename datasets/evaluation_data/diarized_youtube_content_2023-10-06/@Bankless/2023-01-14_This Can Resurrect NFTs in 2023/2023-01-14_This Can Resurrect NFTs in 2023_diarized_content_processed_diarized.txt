00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.830, Speaker A: Is that the resurrection of NFTs, that NFTs add some sort of utility? I think that's right. Board Apes, Azukis, each one is going to provide utility for its community to buy them and own them. My claim for 2023 with the world of NFTs is that NFTs are the closest prototypes to Belagi's Network State thesis. So Bellagi's Network State is really about getting like minded people together and then physically instantiating the world somewhere. I think that's going to be largely similar with NFTs. Not necessarily in the real world, but also not that, like, there are cool cats meetup. I've been to a cool cat meetup in La.
00:00:31.830 - 00:00:39.940, Speaker A: The board apes have parties all the time, but then there's also going to be similar vibes inside of virtual lands. And I think that is starting to look and feel like Bellagi's Network State idea.
