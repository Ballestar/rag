00:00:03.002 - 00:00:25.574, Speaker B: I would say it's not just America, it's the whole Fiat banking system. Because while America is the worst example of this, it's in Europe, it's in China, it's in everywhere. Everybody said, I'm going to borrow from the future to fund stuff today, because that gets me elected. That was the game everybody played. The game future's over. Unless we're going to discover some new source of energy that's extremely dense, then we got to pay this debt and it's going to come in the form of inflation and zero to no growth for very, very long time.
00:00:25.612 - 00:00:30.660, Speaker A: So the answer to the question who's taking the L? Is not just the US dollar, but it's the entire Fiat regime. Exactly.
