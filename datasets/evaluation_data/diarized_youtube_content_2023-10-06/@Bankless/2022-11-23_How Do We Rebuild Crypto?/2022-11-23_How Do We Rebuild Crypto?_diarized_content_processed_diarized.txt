00:00:00.170 - 00:00:36.982, Speaker A: How long will it take to rebuild? Where do we go from here? But the good thing about the ecosystem now, and this wasn't the case back in 2014 with gox, that, you know, we're we're much more developed now. We have DEXes, we have many other exchanges that have gone through several bear markets that seem to be reliable over time. So I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of, like, where are people going to go trade and like, you know, what alternatives they have. It's going to take some time, I think, to recover from kind of like the political damage that has been done here. Obviously, there's maybe $10 billion of client funds that are still trapped in FTX. That's going to take some time to recover from. Obviously, the prices are depressed as a result of all this as well.
00:00:36.982 - 00:00:50.940, Speaker A: So I think we're going into an even deeper bear market. Winter we don't have another bitcoin having until march 23, I think, so it's going to be some time, and I think that's sort of like the next big event that might cause us to kind of out of a bear market.
