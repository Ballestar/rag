00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.820, Speaker A: We got the AirDrop Hunter that we launched this week. What does this thing do? It helps you hunt airdrops. It's in the title. We now have a product team and also AirDrop hunters who are filling out like all these different possible protocols that might have an AirDrop, how to use them, what to do inside of them to maximize your footprint for receiving an AirDrop. So if you are already a bankless citizen, go hunt some airdrops. I think we have 31 airdrops and we're gonna just add more and more and more.
