00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.750, Speaker A: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pumping bitcoin. Here he is on Fox business.
00:00:04.820 - 00:00:18.618, Speaker B: I do believe the role of crypto, it is digitizing gold. Bitcoin is an international asset. It's not based on any one currency. It can represent an asset that people play as an alternative.
00:00:18.714 - 00:00:39.410, Speaker A: Larry Fink he's talking about the virtues of cryptocurrency being a non state store of value. And very interesting as well, when you contrast that to what he was saying in 2017, bitcoin, an index of money laundering. It went from an index of money laundering to this beautiful non state store of value to protect us from government supply inflation.
