00:00:00.090 - 00:00:14.398, Speaker B: For bitcoin ETF. Some new participants have thrown their hat in the ring, one of which is BlackRock. Is that different? They've done, like, over 500 different ETF applications, and they only missed once. Is there something new here, or is this more of the same?
00:00:14.484 - 00:00:32.690, Speaker A: BlackRock is the only new entrant. Everybody else has already tried this, but BlackRock is so big. They have so much distribution. They have so much marketing power. We didn't think they were going to waste time just fighting with the SEC to get this thing launched. We figured it would get approved, and then BlackRock would file and they would be ready to go. Once they filed this, we knew that everyone else was going to file after them because it's just the way things have worked historically.
