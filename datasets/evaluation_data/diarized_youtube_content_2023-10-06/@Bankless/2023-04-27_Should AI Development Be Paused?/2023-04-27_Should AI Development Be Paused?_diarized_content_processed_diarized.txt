00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.910, Speaker A: There has been an open letter. Elon Musk signed it. Andrew Yang the open letter states that we should pause all AI development for six months. Have you signed this letter? Do you think it's a good idea?
00:00:08.980 - 00:00:26.980, Speaker B: I didn't sign the letter. The six month pause does not actually help that much. I think the main thing we need to do is get in a position where we are prepared to slow down based on risk and then be ready to slow down potentially much more than this. Potentially six months. Potentially, like whatever it takes. But I think slowing AI development by ears would probably leak, would come with a kind of tremendous human cost.
