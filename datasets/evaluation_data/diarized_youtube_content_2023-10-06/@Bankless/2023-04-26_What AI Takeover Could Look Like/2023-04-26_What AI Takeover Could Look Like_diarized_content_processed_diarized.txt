00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.340, Speaker A: If there is something like an AI takeover involves like not AI comes out of the blue and kills everyone, but involves we have deployed a lot of AI everywhere. You're like, you get food delivered to you from like Amazon. By Amazon we mean a bunch of machines that are orchestrating a bunch of other machines and you have some money and that money is managed by AI advisors investing in AI firms. Okay, I can see how we get there with that. A country who's fighting a war against a country that has probably deployed AI and obviously we're going to have our AIS defend us. You just ask the AIS to please defend you from the other AIS and maybe they're like, nah, I don't really feel like doing that again. Most likely I care about the other risks, but like the median outcome where we die I think looks like this.
