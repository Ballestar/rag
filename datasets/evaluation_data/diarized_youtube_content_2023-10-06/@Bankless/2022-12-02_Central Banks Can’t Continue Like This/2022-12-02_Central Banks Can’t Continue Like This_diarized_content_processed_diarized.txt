00:00:00.090 - 00:00:06.174, Speaker B: You say this money is too important to be left to central bankers? What do you mean by this? And why did you say it?
00:00:06.212 - 00:00:37.282, Speaker A: Money is as much a social construct as it's a government construct. Money reflects societal estimates of its worth. Governments can issue all of the paper they want. They can issue all the polymer notes they want. But if society doesn't confirm the value of it, if society doesn't believe in it, if society is worried about its inflation every impact, society will find other means of money. Governments cannot issue money willy nilly without concern for the trust of society. Trust is in many ways what's driving the whole crypto revolution.
00:00:37.282 - 00:00:49.570, Speaker A: A generation that lost trust in the existing financial system and the overseers of it during the last crisis are experimenting with trustless systems. Trust is at the heart of this whole new innovation.
