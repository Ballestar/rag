00:00:00.250 - 00:00:05.594, Speaker A: The Future of Life organization released an open letter calling for the pause of all general AI experiments.
00:00:05.642 - 00:00:06.426, Speaker C: A few people signed.
00:00:06.458 - 00:00:08.554, Speaker A: It elon Musk, steve Wozniak.
00:00:08.602 - 00:00:09.326, Speaker C: Would you sign this.
00:00:09.348 - 00:00:10.126, Speaker A: Letter, or are.
00:00:10.148 - 00:00:10.858, Speaker C: You against signing.
00:00:10.874 - 00:00:11.354, Speaker A: This letter?
00:00:11.402 - 00:00:35.350, Speaker B: If we had a six months pause at the end of that, we really wouldn't know much more than we know now. I would see this as basically, do you vote for substantial technological change or not? I get why many people might think, look, we're rich enough. We're doing okay. Let's not risk the future by changing stuff. I would rather we continue to improve our tech and grow. The US. Now has a commanding lead, and the main effect of a delay, if it's not global, would be to take away the US lead.
00:00:35.350 - 00:00:37.970, Speaker B: And this just looks like a hard technology to ban, honestly.
