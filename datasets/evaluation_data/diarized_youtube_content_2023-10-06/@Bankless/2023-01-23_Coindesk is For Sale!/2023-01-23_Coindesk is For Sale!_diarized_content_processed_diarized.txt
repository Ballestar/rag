00:00:00.090 - 00:00:29.298, Speaker A: CoinDesk is up for sale. What if someone like CZ buys it? How about Bloomberg buys CoinDesk? That'd be great. That'd be awesome. How about blockworks group buys CoinDesk? That would be Chad Is. That'd be so Chad. So CoinDesk is for sale because the parent company DCG is underwater. So CoinDesk broke the original story of FTX about the Alameda balance sheet, which caused CZ to tweet about that, which caused the FTT dump, which caused Alameda to get liquidated, which caused the insolvency of FTX.
00:00:29.298 - 00:00:46.930, Speaker A: At the end of this loop of contagion is Genesis going under, which is a DCG product. So CoinDesk pricked the bubble that ultimately led to the unbundling and sale of their parent company. That is just good journalism. Well done. But also we're sorry. It's not your fault. This industry.
