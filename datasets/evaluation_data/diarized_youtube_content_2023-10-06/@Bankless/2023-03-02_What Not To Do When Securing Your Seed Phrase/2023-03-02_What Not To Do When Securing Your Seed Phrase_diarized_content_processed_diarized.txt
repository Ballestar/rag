00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.030, Speaker B: We need to write down our seed phrases. Can you talk about the mistakes that people make? Because I can't remember 24 words of a specific order.
00:00:06.100 - 00:00:29.366, Speaker A: The common mistake we see is people want to digitize this 24 words. They are taking a picture of the 24 words with their phone. Sometimes you install some random application and they ask you to grant access to your photo. You say yes. As soon as you say yes, that means this application, which is completely random, can get access to your 24 words. So this is a common mistake. Another one is to write your 24 words in an email.
00:00:29.366 - 00:00:47.730, Speaker A: Again, if there is a malware on your computer, if someone has an access to your mail, there are plenty of ways to access those 24 words or to write them down in your note or in your file, on your computer. All these cases, you end up with the same security if you were using a software wallet. This is completely not secure against the malware.
