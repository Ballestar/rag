They get people who run for office and basically America has this kind of self healing system. Imagine how bad it would be if we got someone anti crypto and they were dictator for life. At least we can just wait four years or eight years in the worst case, and then get a new crop of people in.
00:00:22.894 - 00:00:27.650, Speaker A: Crypto is going to outlast any administration, any official. As long as we keep building, I think we'll get there eventually.
