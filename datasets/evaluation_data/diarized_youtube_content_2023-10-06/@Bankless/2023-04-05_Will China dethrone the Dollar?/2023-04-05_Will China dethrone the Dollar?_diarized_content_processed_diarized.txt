Or is there any position for crypto monetary systems here? The gold trend is probably going to continue. The wan is starting from a very small base, but I think it's generally going to increase somewhat. It has been for the past few years. I don't think it'll be anywhere near the dollar anytime soon. As far as digital gold bitcoin, for example, and the issue is that it's still too small in terms of global oil. Trade is over $2 trillion a year, and we're talking about an asset that's hundreds of billions of dollars. As it gets bigger, that does become more interesting, but I think that people expecting that to happen in a year or two or three.
00:00:35.238 - 00:00:45.140, Speaker A: It's premature. What timeline we look out at depends on, one, the evolution of technology over time, and then two, political decisions of whether or not they want to promote certain things or whether they want to pull back.
