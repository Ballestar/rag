00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.434, Speaker B: How worried should we be about Chat GPT that this is going to turn evil and enslave the human race?
00:00:05.482 - 00:00:11.790, Speaker A: Chat GPT itself. Zero. It's not smart enough to do anything really wrong, or really right either, for that matter.
00:00:11.860 - 00:00:14.030, Speaker B: And what gives you the confidence to say that? How do you know this?
00:00:14.100 - 00:00:35.380, Speaker A: Excellent question. It moves ahead sufficiently short distances. It's like making small movements, and to take over the world, it would need a very large movement. So there's going to be, like, some untapped potential in there. But I do feel quite confident that the upper range of that untapped potential is insufficient to outsmart all of the living humans and implement the scenario that I'm worried about.
