00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.702, Speaker A: Millennials, they see free speech and they say, well, this just enables hate propaganda. Sure, free speech allows bad ideas to be spoken, but the only alternative is basically some ideas are not allowed to be said and some ideas are. Now, who decides? The people with the most cultural power. They get to decide what's true and what's good. It's not fair. And I would use the example of interracial marriage. 96% of people thought it was immoral in 1959.
00:00:24.702 - 00:00:40.340, Speaker A: To day, the number is 94%. Think it's fine, right? So that is, the entire country has changed its mind. And so the kind of underlying assumption when people today think free speech allows dangerous ideas to flourish, is this idea that, well, all the people in the past, they had bad ideas, but today it's all clear. We figured it out.
