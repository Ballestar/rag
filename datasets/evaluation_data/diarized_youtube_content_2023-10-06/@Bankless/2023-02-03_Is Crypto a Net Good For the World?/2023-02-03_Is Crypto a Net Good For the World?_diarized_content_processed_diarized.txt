00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.082, Speaker A: Is crypto a net good? And are we on track to achieve that? If not, blockchains.
00:00:05.146 - 00:00:38.450, Speaker B: As an open data substrate that allow for verifiable computation inevitably make it such that this will be a net good for the world. And then it's up to the builders and the investors and the early participants to kind of dial the knob to maximum impact within this net good substrate. I, weirdly, am most optimistic about crypto in bear markets and most pessimistic about it in bull markets, and it's incumbent upon each of us to turn the dial towards maximum societal impact as opposed to maximum personal impact.
