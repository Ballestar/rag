00:00:00.250 - 00:00:15.982, Speaker A: China is actually Finance's largest market by far. 20% of their trading happens in China. And I thought crypto was illegal in China, but this is crazy. Do you know, even if Finance totally pulled out of the US. And Europe, they'd still be the largest crypto platform in the world in terms of trading volume. That's how big Asia is.
00:00:16.036 - 00:00:22.238, Speaker B: It's pretty hard to state how big Finance is. Like 70% to 80% of all crypto trading volume and Coinbase is not 15.
00:00:22.324 - 00:00:23.450, Speaker A: We'll have to see how that evolves.
