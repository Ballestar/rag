00:00:00.250 - 00:00:10.430, Speaker A: What's more likely, a single, monolithic, super intelligent AI. Does the leaser thing or we have robot human conflict, war.
00:00:10.500 - 00:00:30.770, Speaker B: So that second one seems far more likely to me. You know, we form coalitions and fight each other. And there's always the question, what is the basis of the dominant coalitions? So you could have a gender based, you know, the men fighting the women. You could have an age one, the old people fighting the young. Humans versus robots is one possible division on which future conflicts could be based. That's completely believable.
