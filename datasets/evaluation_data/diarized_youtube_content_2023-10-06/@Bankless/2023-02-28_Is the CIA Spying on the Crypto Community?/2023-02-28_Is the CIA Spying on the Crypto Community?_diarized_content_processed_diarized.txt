00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.214, Speaker A: Are they in our discords? Are they in our telegrams? Do they walk among us? Is anyone spying on my co host David, like, he thinks, well.
00:00:07.252 - 00:00:32.900, Speaker B: Okay, so if there's an intelligence community or a federal agent inside of a crypto community, they're not after, like, David's personal information or Ryan's bookshelf. They are looking for someone from the Lazarus Group. It would have to be a national security operation, and it would be very sensitive, and it would in concert with the FBI, because the CIA cannot perform in the United States. You have to have a lead FBI agent. That's what they would be looking for.
