These concepts are used to protect the privacy of training data and prevent the disclosure of participant identities in federated learning frameworks. Masking techniques and cryptographic methods are also employed to obfuscate gradients and prevent malicious parties from drawing conclusions about the data set.",

The LVR is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the appraised value of the property. It is expressed as a percentage. A higher LVR indicates a higher risk for the lender, as it means the borrower has less equity in the property. Lenders often have maximum LVR limits for different types of loans.",
