The V0LVER protocol aims to minimize LVR by aligning the incentives of users, the pool, and block producers. It achieves this by requiring block producers to adjust the pool price to match the external market price, reducing the potential for LVR extraction. However, LVR protection is still an area of ongoing research (McMenamin, Daza, and Mazorra).",

This ensures that all participants have a consistent view of the transaction order.

Finally, the finalized transaction sequence is written onto the L1 chain, serving as the permanent record of the transactions (source: recent content).",

First, there is the user who has the intent to transact and expresses this intent to a wallet. The wallet then turns the user's intent into a transaction. Next, the transactions are picked up or manipulated by searchers who turn them into bundles. These bundles are then passed on to builders, who select the transactions to be included in the next block. The selected block is then sent to miner validators, who attest to its validity with proof of work or proof of stake. Finally, the validated block is added to the blockchain (source: recent content). The introduction of MEV has led to challenges and complexities within the supply chain, with builders needing to identify and extract MEV transactions, manage risk, and utilize trading skills. This has resulted in a desire for vertical integration within the supply chain, with various parties attempting to move further up to gain more power. However, the need for an open auction system and the economic incentives for actors to participate in such a system are still under question (source: recent content).",

MEV Auctions: One approach is to introduce MEV auctions, where miners or validators are required to submit their MEV extraction strategies and compete for the right to include transactions in the block. This can help reduce the incentive for front-running and create a fairer and more transparent process for transaction ordering (source: recent content).\n\n2. Private Transaction Ordering: Another solution involves introducing privacy-preserving techniques for transaction ordering. By obfuscating the order of transactions, it becomes more difficult for attackers to front-run or execute sandwich attacks. Techniques like zero-knowledge proofs or secure multi-party computation can be employed to achieve private transaction ordering (source: recent content).\n\n3. Delayed Execution: Delaying the execution of transactions can help mitigate front-running attacks. By introducing a random or deterministic delay between the submission of a transaction and its execution, the opportunity for front-runners to exploit the transaction is reduced. However, this approach may not be suitable for all types of transactions and can introduce additional complexities (source: recent content).\n\n4. Fee Market Improvements: Enhancing the fee market mechanism can also help mitigate front-running and sandwich attacks. By introducing more sophisticated fee models that consider factors like transaction size, execution time, and priority, the incentive for front-runners to profit from transaction reordering can be reduced (source: recent content).\n\nIt's important to note that these solutions are still under active research and development, and their effectiveness and practicality may vary depending on the specific blockchain system and use case (source: recent content).",
