        "LLM_response": "L2 sequencers function by receiving transactions from users and deciding their order based on a specific policy. This ordering policy is crucial as it determines the sequence of transactions that are then posted onto the Ethereum network. The sequencer plays a significant role in the extraction of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). In a roll-up scenario, there is a direct communication channel between the user and the sequencer, eliminating the need for a gas protocol. The response a user receives from the sequencer, and its timing, depends on how the sequencer has ordered the transactions. Sequencers can be either centralized or decentralized. The transition from a centralized to a decentralized sequencer involves an agreement with the chain, where the participants in the decentralized committee are paid for their work. If they fail to perform, they can be fired. The selection of these participants is based on trust, and they are likely to be known entities (\"Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \u201923\", Flashbots, 2023-09-04, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ); \"MEVeconomics in L2 - A Closer Look at the Sequencer's Role and MEV - Patrick McCorry\", ETHGlobal, 2023-03-28, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb8nY2-Osjc); \"L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\", Flashbots, 2022-05-22, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY))."

        "LLM_response": "The Miner Extractable Value (MEV) supply chain is a complex process that begins with a user initiating a transaction. This transaction is converted into a specific format by a wallet. Some transactions are identified or manipulated by entities known as searchers, who transform these transactions into bundles. Other transactions bypass this step. The next entity in the chain is the builder, who selects the transactions to be included in the next block and forwards this block to a miner or validator for confirmation.\n\nThe competition among miners and validators is a crucial aspect of public blockchains, providing users with assurances such as resistance to censorship and market power. This competition prevents a single entity from controlling the selection of transactions for a block.\n\nHowever, there is a concern that the entire supply chain could collapse into a single vertically integrated entity, a scenario referred to as MEV Dystopia. In this situation, a single party would create all blocks on public blockchains, eliminating all user guarantees.\n\nThe builder and the miner or validator are distinct entities. Traditionally, mining pools have served as builders, selecting transactions and organizing them into a block. The miner or validator then validates this block with a proof of work or proof of stake, giving it economic weight in the fork choice rule.\n\nBuilding was simpler in the past when all a mining pool needed was a good view of the mempool and the ability to select the highest paying transactions. However, MEV has complicated building because it's not just about running a simple algorithm to extract MEV. It involves identifying MEV transactions, executing these transactions, possibly maintaining a coin inventory, and managing risk.\n\nIn the future, it is anticipated that individuals will attempt to move further up the supply chain to gain more control. However, this is challenging due to already entrenched interests. The goal is to make it economically feasible and rational for actors to give up their order flow and participate in an open auction (\"SoK: Cross-Domain MEV\", Conor McMenamin, 2023-08-08, [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04159v1); \"It\u2019s My MEV and I Want It Now - Tom Schmidt\", ETHGlobal, 2023-03-28, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHsU2hSNNcM); \"State of the MEV Union - Jon Charbonneau\", ETHGlobal, 2023-03-28, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-STbGjZc_OU); \"Multi-block MEV\", Johannes Rude Jensen, Victor von Wachter, Omri Ross, 2023-03-08, [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04430v2); \"The threat of MEV centralization: an anatomy of the transaction supply chain - Hasu (Flashbots)\", Flashbots, 2022-05-22, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmBqoBr6yl4); \"Why your blockchain needs an MEV solution - Hasu (Flashbots)\", Flashbots, 2022-05-22, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYFuFLe9kp0); \"Flashbots Research Workshop #7: Cross-domain MEV AMA\", Flashbots, 2021-12-23, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR0Z0nWXeFU); \"MEV.WTF Summit\", ETHGlobal, 2021-07-02, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3nACF7uVZw))."
