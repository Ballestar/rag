LVR is observable and depends on price volatility and the marginal liquidity of the CFMM level set. It is used to assess the competitiveness of liquidity providers and their past performance. LVR can be minimized through strategic LP behavior and the use of rebates. (source 2, source 4, source 6)",

The sequencing process is separate from the execution and settlement phases of the L2 system. Sequencers can be either centralized or distributed, depending on the specific L2 implementation. In a distributed sequencer system, multiple participants publish their own ordering of the transactions, but due to network latency and delivery issues, different sequencers may report different orders. This makes it difficult to determine the truth or detect dishonest behavior in a single instance. Therefore, running a centralized sequencer in parallel to a distributed sequencer may not be feasible as a means of providing an alternative or economic incentive for distributed actors to behave.

Wallets then facilitate these transactions by sending them to searchers or builders. Searchers are responsible for identifying profitable opportunities within the mempool, while builders construct blocks that include these profitable transactions. Between searchers and builders, there is a type of MEV auction that determines the allocation of transactions. Searchers compete in this auction to have their selected transactions included in the blocks built by the builders. Builders propose blocks to the network, aiming to maximize their profit by including the most profitable transactions. Finally, validators validate the proposed blocks and add them to the blockchain. In summary, the MEV supply chain involves users, wallets, searchers, builders, and validators, each playing a specific role in the extraction and inclusion of MEV in the blockchain (Flashbots MEV-Share, Robert Miller; A study of the transaction supply chain from CryptoKitties to MEV-Boost to PBS - Barnab\u00e9 Monnot; The threat of MEV centralization: an anatomy of the transaction supply chain - Hasu).",

It is defined as the difference between the monetary value of a rebalancing strategy and the actual value of the LP position in the CFMM pool. LVR is a non-negative, non-decreasing, and predictable process, and it can be expressed as the integral of a function \u2113(\u03c3, P) over time, where \u03c3 is the instantaneous variance of the price and P is the market price. The function \u2113(\u03c3, P) represents the marginal liquidity available from the pool at price level P and is always positive. LVR captures the losses incurred by LPs due to price slippage and differences in market risk exposure, and it is a key metric for evaluating the performance of AMMs. (source: Automated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing, Jason Milionis et al., 2022)",

        "LLM_response": "Transaction ordering on Layer 2 (L2) systems, such as in Arbitrum, involves a separate process compared to Layer 1 (L1) Ethereum. In L2 systems, a sequencer is responsible for receiving transactions from users and publishing a canonical sequence of transactions. This sequence determines the order in which the transactions have been seen. The execution phase then determines the validity and impact of these transactions on the state.\n\nL2 systems typically have faster block times than L1 Ethereum. For example, Arbitrum has a block time of 250 milliseconds, which is significantly faster. Additionally, L2 systems often have a private mempool by default, optimizing cost in ways that L1 systems may not.\n\nOne advantage of L2 systems is their design flexibility. They are still evolving and can adapt to specific needs.\n\n(Source: [source])",
