It quantifies the adverse selection costs or informational losses to arbitrageurs in a liquidity pool. LVR is calculated based on price volatility and the marginal liquidity of the CFMM level set. It is an observable object and can be measured empirically. LVR is an important consideration in designing AMMs and minimizing user-level extractable value. Different approaches have been proposed to address LVR, such as MEV-capturing AMMs and the Diamond protocol. (source 42)",

The sequencer also publishes a real-time feed of the sequence for anyone to subscribe to. Each transaction is processed one at a time by the state transition function, which updates the state accordingly. In a distributed sequencer world, transactions are multicast to multiple sequencer instances, and each sequencer publishes its own ordering of the transactions (Speaker A, 00:01:37.414 - 00:02:20.360).",

Searchers actively search for profitable opportunities within the blockchain and compete to identify and extract MEV. Builders construct blocks on the blockchain, selecting transactions and optimizing their order to maximize MEV extraction. Validators validate and propose blocks to the network, participating in MEV extraction by including transactions with MEV opportunities. MEV auctions determine the allocation of MEV among builders and validators. Flashbots is an organization that focuses on mitigating the negative externalities of MEV and improving the transparency and fairness of the MEV supply chain. Their goal is to create a decentralized and open system with maximum competition and user guarantees (Flashbots, YouTube video, \"The threat of MEV centralization: an anatomy of the transaction supply chain - Hasu (Flashbots)\", 2022-05-22).",

By enshrining PBS in the protocol, the responsibility for its maintenance and optimization would lie with the protocol developers.

LVR is a non-negative, non-decreasing, and predictable process that can be calculated as the integral of the instantaneous LVR over time. The instantaneous LVR is determined by multiplying the square of the instantaneous variance or quadratic variation of the price by the absolute value of the marginal liquidity available from the pool at a specific price level. The rebalancing strategy is the benchmark choice that minimizes the quadratic variation of the loss process. (Automated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing, Jason Milionis, Ciamac C.

        "LLM_response": "Transaction ordering on Layer 2 (L2) systems, such as Arbitrum, involves a separate process compared to Layer 1 (L1) Ethereum. In L2 systems, the sequencing of transactions is handled by a sequencer, which receives transactions from users and publishes a canonical sequence based on their order of receipt. This sequencing is separate from the execution and settlement of transactions. L2 systems, like Arbitrum, have faster block times compared to L1 Ethereum, with Arbitrum having a block time of 250 milliseconds. L2 systems also typically have a private mempool by default, unlike the public mempool in L1 Ethereum. Transaction incentives and the distribution of transaction fees in L2 systems are determined by a smart contract designated by governance. While most fees are likely to go to the treasury, some may also be allocated to infrastructure providers. However, if the split only goes to the treasury, there may be an incentive for infrastructure providers to engage in off-chain payments to influence transaction ordering. Detecting such behavior may rely on user vigilance and, in a centralized setting, some degree of trust. Governance can take action if suspicions arise, potentially leading to the replacement of a sequencer. Overall, transaction ordering on L2s involves a separate process from L1 Ethereum, with sequencers playing a crucial role in determining the sequence of transactions. L2 systems offer faster block times, private mempools, and more design flexibility compared to L1 Ethereum.
