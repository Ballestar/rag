It quantifies the adverse selection costs or informational losses to arbitrageurs in a liquidity pool. LVR is calculated based on price volatility and the marginal liquidity of the CFMM level set.

LVR is a non-negative, non-decreasing, and predictable process that can be calculated as the integral of the instantaneous LVR over time. The instantaneous LVR is determined by multiplying the square of the instantaneous variance or quadratic variation of the price by the absolute value of the marginal liquidity available from the pool at a specific price level. The rebalancing strategy is the benchmark choice that minimizes the quadratic variation of the loss process. (Automated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing, Jason Milionis, Ciamac C.

In L2 systems, the sequencing of transactions is handled by a sequencer, which receives transactions from users and publishes a canonical sequence based on their order of receipt. This sequencing is separate from the execution and settlement of transactions. L2 systems, like Arbitrum, have faster block times compared to L1 Ethereum, with Arbitrum having a block time of 250 milliseconds. L2 systems also typically have a private mempool by default, unlike the public mempool in L1 Ethereum. Transaction incentives and the distribution of transaction fees in L2 systems are determined by a smart contract designated by governance. While most fees are likely to go to the treasury, some may also be allocated to infrastructure providers. However, if the split only goes to the treasury, there may be an incentive for infrastructure providers to engage in off-chain payments to influence transaction ordering. Detecting such behavior may rely on user vigilance and, in a centralized setting, some degree of trust. Governance can take action if suspicions arise, potentially leading to the replacement of a sequencer. Overall, transaction ordering on L2s involves a separate process from L1 Ethereum, with sequencers playing a crucial role in determining the sequence of transactions. L2 systems offer faster block times, private mempools, and more design flexibility compared to L1 Ethereum.

So we can think of a scenario that, yes, it's true that, you know, in an ideal world, where there is, you know, double coincidence of wants meaning that at any point in time, a given variable taker and a given fixed taker happen to be on the protocol at the same time and happen to have the same need for 100 notional yes, in that scenario we would be able to immediately pair them. But in scenarios where that's not possible, we need to have market makers, we need to have liquidity providers who are constantly happy to engage in both sides of the market, meaning that they're able to keep the markets liquid active and keep the volume high. Meaning that as a trader, you don't need to kind of wait for if you're a fixed take, you don't need to wait for a variable taker to come in and trade with you. You can.

V0LVER is the \\ufb01rst AMM to align\\nthe incentives of the three, typically competing, entities in AMMs; the user,\\nthe pool, and the block producer. This is done by ensuring that at all times, a\\nblock producer is incentivized to move the pool to the price maximizing LVR.\\nWhen the block producer chooses a price, the block producer is forced to assert\\nthis is correct, a technique introduced in [13]. Unfortunately, the protocol in\\n[13] gives the block producer total power to extract value from users, due to\\norder information being revealed to the block producer before it is allocated a\\ntrading price in the blockchain. To address this, V0LVER is built on an encrypted\\nmempool. Modern cryptographic tools allow us to encrypt the mempool using\\nzero-knowledge based collateralized commit-reveal protocols [11,3,12,20], delay\\nencryption [5,7] and/or threshold encryption [2]. We assume the existence of\\nsuch a mempool within which all sensitive order information is hidden until\\nthe order has been committed a price against the AMM. Given these encrypted\\norders, we demonstrate that a block producer forced to show liquidity to such an\\norder maximizes her own utility by showing liquidity centred around the external\\nmarket price (bid below the price and o\\ufb00ered above the price).4\\nAs such, the external market price is the price point maximizing the block\\nproducers LVR extraction (due to the replicated LVR protection of [13]), around\\nwhich pro\\ufb01t is maximized when forced to trade against some (varying) percent-\\nage of indistinguishable orders. This strictly incentivizes block producers to move\\nthe price of a V0LVER pool to the external market price. This provides users\\nwith an AMM where the expected trade price in the presence of arbitrageurs is\\nalways the external market price, excluding fees, and the LVR against the pool\\nis minimized when these arbitrageurs are competing. Although batching orders\\nagainst AMM liquidity has been proposed as a defense against LVR [18], naively\\nbatching orders against an AMM still allows a block producer to extract LVR\\nby censoring user orders. In V0LVER, block producers are e\\ufb00ectively forced to\\nimmediately repay LVR, while being incentivized to include order commitments\\nin the blockchain and allocate liquidity to these orders through the AMM.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nAs the phenomenon of LVR has only recently been identi\\ufb01ed, there are only\\ntwo academic papers on the subject of LVR protection [10,13] to the best of our\\nknowledge, with no work protecting against both LVR and user-level MEV.\\nIn [10], the AMM must receive the price of a swap from a trusted oracle\\nbefore users can interact with the pool.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 20\\nsource: 12\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: An Automated Market Maker Minimizing Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\\nauthors: Conor McMenamin, Vanesa Daza, Bruno Mazorra\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10601v2\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-19\\n\\n12\\nMcMenamin, Daza and Mazorra\\n6\\nImplementation\\nWe now detail an implementation of Diamond. The main focus of our implemen-\\ntation is ensuring user experience in a Diamond pool is not degraded compared\\nto the corresponding CFMM pool. To this point, applying a \\u03b2-discount on ev-\\nery Diamond pool trade is not viable. To avoid this, we only consider LVR on\\na per-block, and not a per-transaction basis. Given the transaction sequence,\\nin/exclusion and priority auction capabilities of block producers, block produc-\\ners can either capture the block LVR of a Diamond pool themselves, or auction\\nthis right among arbitrageurs.\\nFrom an implementation standpoint, who captures the LVR is not important,\\nwhether it is the producer themselves, or an arbitrageur who won an auction to\\nbundle the transactions for inclusion in Diamond. As mentioned already, we\\nassume these are the same entity, and as such it is the arbitrageur who must\\nrepay the LVR of a block. To enforce this, for a Diamond pool, we check the\\npool state in the first pool transaction each block and take escrow from the\\narbitrageur. This escrow is be used in part to pay the realized LVR of the block\\nback to the pool. The first pool transaction also returns the collateral of the\\nprevious arbitrageur, minus the realized LVR (computable from the difference\\nbetween the current pool state and the pool state at the beginning of the previous\\nblock). To ensure the collateral covers the realized LVR, each proceeding pool\\ntransaction verifies that the LVR implied by the pool state as a result of the\\ntransaction can be repaid by the deposited collateral.\\nWe can reduce these collateral restrictions by allowing the arbitrageur to\\nbundle transactions based on a coincidence-of-wants (CoWs) (matching buy and\\nsell orders, as is done in CoWSwap [7]). This can effectively reduce the required\\ncollateral of the arbitrageur to 0. Given the assumed oversight capabilities of\\narbitrageurs is the same as that of block producers, we do not see collateral\\nlock-up intra-block as a restriction, although solutions like CoWs are viable\\nalternatives.\\nOur implementation is based on the following two assumptions:\\n1. An arbitrageur always sets the final state of a pool to the state which max-\\nimizes the LVR.\\n2. The block producer realizes net profits of at least the LVR corresponding\\nto the final state of the pool, either as the arbitrageur themselves, or by\\nauctioning the right to arbitrage amongst a set of competing arbitrageurs.\\nIf the final price of the block is not the price maximizing LVR, the arbitrageur\\nhas ignored an arbitrage opportunity. The arbitrageur can always ignore non-\\narbitrageur transactions to realize the LVR, therefore, any additional included\\ntransactions must result in greater or equal utility for the arbitrageur than the\\nLVR.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"retrieved_context\": \"The\\ncost of not modelling strategic LP behavior is that our framework cannot make sharp predictions\\nabout how the level of CFMM liquidity provision responds to changes in market design.

It quantifies the adverse selection costs or informational losses to arbitrageurs in a liquidity pool. LVR is calculated based on price volatility and the marginal liquidity of the CFMM level set. It is an observable object and can be measured empirically. LVR is an important consideration in designing AMMs and minimizing user-level extractable value.

L2 S work differently from Ethereum in some important respects. And unless you're careful, your assumptions from ethereum may steer you wrong in thinking about mev on L2 S. So what I want to do to sort of flesh this out is I'm going to talk a little bit about how Arbitrum works and the things I talk about will be common across the deployed L2 S, as far as I know. Then I will talk some about how this affects, how these differences affect the mev landscape. And then finally I'll talk some about what we at Arbitrum, how we approach it, what our principles are about this and what we're actually doing. Okay, let me start by talking about how Arbitrum as at this level a typical L2 works.\\n00:01:09.922 - 00:01:50.762, Speaker A: And if you've seen one of my other talks this week, you may have seen this diagram before. I'll go through the parts that are relevant for this talk. The key component here is the sequencer in the upper left. So under normal conditions, users send to the sequencer all of their transactions directly by RPC. The sequencer gets those transactions and what it is supposed to do is put those transactions into a sequence that the Sequencer decides, but it is supposed to put them into an Arbitrum first come, first served order. So the sequencer is responsible for putting transactions into sequence order and for nothing else. It's not trusted for any other purpose.\\n00:01:50.762 - 00:02:16.982, Speaker A: Anything else it does that it might do wrong is checked for and corrected for by the rest of the system. So that's all it does is sequencing. And I'll talk a little bit about how this works and so on. The sequencer might be a centralized element or it might be a distributed system. More on that later. Okay, the sequencer then does two things with the Sequence thing. One is publishes a sequencer feed very quickly.\\n00:02:16.982 - 00:03:07.160, Speaker A: In a second or less, after your transaction has arrived at the sequencer, your transaction will have been put into the sequence and the sequencer will have published it as part of the sequencer feed. That's a feed, a real time feed that anyone can subscribe to. And if the Sequencer is honest, then that will be the order in which transactions occur in the L2 chain. Now over here on the right we have the state transition function. This is basically a function that eats one transaction at a time, processes that transaction, possibly updates the state and then possibly emits an L2 block. This state transition function is fully deterministic. So the outcome at any time will depend only on the Genesis state and on the sequence of transactions that it is processed up to now and on nothing else.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nWe don't have hard evidence but we strongly suspect people are already doing this. That could exist for private use or it could be sold as a service and in general anything that has value for private use probably could be sold as a service, as a business. We expect that as things mature and develop that that might well happen. The consequences of the geographically distributed sequencer committee here are interesting because if you have a point of presence if there are 20 sequencers scattered around the world and you have a point of presence at each one and what you need is to get your transaction to a supermajority of them before somebody else. That means you may not have time to coordinate between your different points of presence in order to coordinate on what you're going to do. So there is some limit on your ability to actually use geographic proximity in this distributed system sense simply because if Alice is sitting in one place and multicasts her transaction out across the world to everywhere, then if you see it over here and then try to inform your friend over there of what to do, that Alice's transaction will probably beat you.\\n00:17:48.146 - 00:18:37.566, Speaker A: Right? Because you have to pay the triangle penalty for your path. And so there is some resistance to the geographic proximity methods. Essentially someone would need to have a deterministic method of reacting to the transactions they see, which is a little tricky because if you have only local information about the order in which your sequencer saw the information, that's not a guarantee about what the majority will see. So there's some complexity here and arguably it's a bit more difficult to try to get geographically near. So that's basically where we stand. I've given you a little flavor. I think the biggest difference you see in just to summarize between L One ethereum and L2 is in the response time of the sequencer.\\n00:18:37.566 - 00:19:06.850, Speaker A: It's in the fact that ordering is done by transactions. Blocks are not built in the normal sense, it's a per transaction ordering process and that has implications as well. So I'd be happy to answer any questions or engage in any discussion or civilized debate. And I think we have about ten minutes for that. I'll repeat the question if not okay.\\n00:19:08.100 - 00:19:10.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm a huge fan.\\n00:19:10.420 - 00:19:11.330, Speaker C: Thank you.\\n00:19:12.180 - 00:19:23.540, Speaker B: Just to church while you're talking, is there a possibility, perhaps might it be a good idea might it be a good idea to continue to run your.\\n00:19:23.610 - 00:20:01.184, Speaker C: Centralized sequencer in parallel to a distributed version? Thank you. Would it be a good idea to run a centralized sequencer in parallel to a distributed sequencer?

The first is that if a small minority of the sequencers in this scheme are colluding with outsiders, that has no effect, because the honest supermajority will still provide the distributed first come first serve guarantee, regardless of what a small minority does. The second piece of that is yes. It's really important how these sequencers are chosen. They're likely to be parties who are trusted by our community to be reputable and have reason to be honest. And if they misbehave and parties who would suffer a reputational hit for misbehaving. I think if you think about the process for how you would choose those parties, you would want ones who have a reputation as trustworthy in the community, who have reputation to lose, who have a stake in the success of the community and so on.\\n00:26:33.374 - 00:26:43.920, Speaker A: And so I think the considerations that you suggest would play a big role in choosing the sequencers. And should.\\n00:26:46.450 - 00:26:46.974, Speaker B: We out?\\n00:26:47.012 - 00:26:47.566, Speaker D: That's enough time.\\n00:26:47.588 - 00:26:48.480, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone.\\n00:26:49.650 - 00:27:05.090, Speaker B: Thank it's.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nIf the sequencer lies, then you might care how quickly it gets caught in the lie.\\n00:05:39.770 - 00:05:40.242, Speaker C: Okay?\\n00:05:40.316 - 00:05:51.180, Speaker A: But for the most part, there's not a lot of mev sensitivity in these transactions. But of course, what you may be really interested in is what happens regarding mev on layer two.\\n00:05:52.110 - 00:05:52.860, Speaker C: Okay.\\n00:05:54.990 - 00:06:49.518, Speaker A: Let me stop and talk about who runs the sequencer because I think this is important in thinking about how all of this works. Because the sequencer is really the only party who has opportunity to extract it's, the only party who is definitely sitting on the path that a transaction must go through and potentially has power to extract mev. So currently, the sequencer is centralized. It's run by us, the Arbitrum team, and so if you trust us to run the sequencer honestly, and if you believe we're running the code that we published, then you're good to go. Over time though, we will move to a distributed sequencer. The sequencer will become a distributed system. Now importantly, we are not following the paradigm that some decentralized sequencing systems use, where you have a rotating sequencer, which is basically a rotating centralization system, where each step or round or block is centralized and you rotate who gets to do those things instead.\\n00:06:49.518 - 00:07:35.150, Speaker A: This is a fully distributed system. I'll talk in a minute about how it works. But the guarantee we give is that as long as K out of N of those participants are honest for suitable values, think more than two thirds honest, then the result will be honest. It will meet the specification. I'll talk in a minute about what that is. It's also worth noting that in this scheme, dishonest behavior by individual sequencer nodes will usually be detectable, not provable to a third party, but because it's detectable, that means if a sequencer consistently cheats, then that will become common knowledge that that's a cheating sequencer. And so a social mechanism or a governance mechanism can kick in to replace that lying sequencer.\\n00:07:35.890 - 00:07:36.542, Speaker C: Okay?\\n00:07:36.676 - 00:08:36.690, Speaker A: So in a distributed sequencer world, you provide a distributed first come, first served type of policy. And here's what that means. In particular, the story of a transaction basically is that the user multicast their transaction to all of the sequencer instances. Think 15 to 20 of them user multicast their transaction to all of them, or almost all of them. Each sequencer then publishes its own ordering of the order in which it received the transactions, or so it claims.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-04\\n\\n00:00:00.330 - 00:00:26.066, Speaker A: You. Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks for your time. I'm going to talk about the other side of that distinction that David drew between macro and micro. I have many interesting thoughts, I hope, about macro, but this talk is about micro. And I'm going to talk about what it looks like, what this problem looks like from the side of an L2 or L3s designer.\\n00:00:26.066 - 00:01:37.414, Speaker A: And in particular, this is based on both our experience running the Arbitrum sequencer which is the most used so far roll up sequencer and also the research that we've done on this particular topic. So let me start just reviewing and this is pretty close to a diagram that David showed talking about how L2 systems work and just reviewing what is the role of the sequencer because there is some misconception out there about it. So the sequencer is this function up here on the upper left. And its job, and its only job is to receive transactions from users and to publish a canonical sequence of transactions. These are the transactions that have been seen and this is the order in which they've been seen. The execution phase of the protocol then is in charge of figuring out whether those transactions are valid and if so, how they change the state and which blocks they make. So the sequencer you can almost think about a modern state of the art roll up as almost being two chains.\\n00:01:37.414 - 00:02:20.360, Speaker A: First, a chain that is built by the sequencer, which is the chain of transactions that have arrived and then second, a logically different chain that consumes those transactions and then updates state and looks like in our case, an Ethereum chain. So that's the role of the sequencer only trusted to vouch for transaction arrivals and some transaction order. All right, so how does l two differ from l one ethereum? There's a bunch of different ways, all of them probably important. First, sequencing is separate from execution and settlement. As I just described, the block time is much faster on L2. On Arbitrum, it's 250 milliseconds 48 x faster than Ethereum. That makes a big difference.\\n00:02:20.360 - 00:03:12.860, Speaker A: There's a private mem pool by default, unlike the public mem pool and the kind of peer to peer gossip that goes on of the mem pool. Maybe you have some private order flow on Ethereum but kind of the default is public mem pool. And in L two, typically the default is private mempool. There's a very low cost structure on L2 S and that means costs that might be negligible for an L one might be really appreciably add to the cost on L two. And so we need to optimize cost in ways that L ones don't necessarily have to. But then finally, L2 S have a degree of design flexibility that L One doesn't have simply because L One is a much more mature, much more widely used system.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Can MEV impact our understanding of censorship-resistance for L2 bridges? - Patrick McCorry (Infura)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJH2VdvMk-U\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nAnd then anyone could give the sequencer the transactions to then feel your transactions because they'll always be executed first before anything in the bridge. So what can we do about that? Can we fix this for layer two? So the sequencer or anyone using the sequencer can abuse any transactions that are submitted by the user. So one way to think about it is that when the user submits their transaction, maybe the bridge is forced to make sure this transaction will always pass. It can never be a field transaction, but that's\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\n00:00:08.890 - 00:01:09.922, Speaker A: And I want to talk about mev and l two So here's the TLDR from my talk.

But of course, what you may be really interested in is what happens regarding mev on layer two.\\n00:05:52.110 - 00:05:52.860, Speaker C: Okay.\\n00:05:54.990 - 00:06:49.518, Speaker A: Let me stop and talk about who runs the sequencer because I think this is important in thinking about how all of this works. Because the sequencer is really the only party who has opportunity to extract it's, the only party who is definitely sitting on the path that a transaction must go through and potentially has power to extract mev. So currently, the sequencer is centralized. It's run by us, the Arbitrum team, and so if you trust us to run the sequencer honestly, and if you believe we're running the code that we published, then you're good to go. Over time though, we will move to a distributed sequencer. The sequencer will become a distributed system. Now importantly, we are not following the paradigm that some decentralized sequencing systems use, where you have a rotating sequencer, which is basically a rotating centralization system, where each step or round or block is centralized and you rotate who gets to do those things instead.\\n00:06:49.518 - 00:07:35.150, Speaker A: This is a fully distributed system. I'll talk in a minute about how it works. But the guarantee we give is that as long as K out of N of those participants are honest for suitable values, think more than two thirds honest, then the result will be honest. It will meet the specification. I'll talk in a minute about what that is. It's also worth noting that in this scheme, dishonest behavior by individual sequencer nodes will usually be detectable, not provable to a third party, but because it's detectable, that means if a sequencer consistently cheats, then that will become common knowledge that that's a cheating sequencer. And so a social mechanism or a governance mechanism can kick in to replace that lying sequencer.\\n00:07:35.890 - 00:07:36.542, Speaker C: Okay?\\n00:07:36.676 - 00:08:36.690, Speaker A: So in a distributed sequencer world, you provide a distributed first come, first served type of policy. And here's what that means. In particular, the story of a transaction basically is that the user multicast their transaction to all of the sequencer instances. Think 15 to 20 of them user multicast their transaction to all of them, or almost all of them. Each sequencer then publishes its own ordering of the order in which it received the transactions, or so it claims.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-04\\n\\n00:00:00.330 - 00:00:26.066, Speaker A: You. Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks for your time. I'm going to talk about the other side of that distinction that David drew between macro and micro. I have many interesting thoughts, I hope, about macro, but this talk is about micro. And I'm going to talk about what it looks like, what this problem looks like from the side of an L2 or L3s designer.\\n00:00:26.066 - 00:01:37.414, Speaker A: And in particular, this is based on both our experience running the Arbitrum sequencer which is the most used so far roll up sequencer and also the research that we've done on this particular topic. So let me start just reviewing and this is pretty close to a diagram that David showed talking about how L2 systems work and just reviewing what is the role of the sequencer because there is some misconception out there about it. So the sequencer is this function up here on the upper left. And its job, and its only job is to receive transactions from users and to publish a canonical sequence of transactions. These are the transactions that have been seen and this is the order in which they've been seen. The execution phase of the protocol then is in charge of figuring out whether those transactions are valid and if so, how they change the state and which blocks they make. So the sequencer you can almost think about a modern state of the art roll up as almost being two chains.\\n00:01:37.414 - 00:02:20.360, Speaker A: First, a chain that is built by the sequencer, which is the chain of transactions that have arrived and then second, a logically different chain that consumes those transactions and then updates state and looks like in our case, an Ethereum chain. So that's the role of the sequencer only trusted to vouch for transaction arrivals and some transaction order. All right, so how does l two differ from l one ethereum? There's a bunch of different ways, all of them probably important. First, sequencing is separate from execution and settlement. As I just described, the block time is much faster on L2. On Arbitrum, it's 250 milliseconds 48 x faster than Ethereum. That makes a big difference.\\n00:02:20.360 - 00:03:12.860, Speaker A: There's a private mem pool by default, unlike the public mem pool and the kind of peer to peer gossip that goes on of the mem pool. Maybe you have some private order flow on Ethereum but kind of the default is public mem pool. And in L two, typically the default is private mempool. There's a very low cost structure on L2 S and that means costs that might be negligible for an L one might be really appreciably add to the cost on L two. And so we need to optimize cost in ways that L ones don't necessarily have to. But then finally, L2 S have a degree of design flexibility that L One doesn't have simply because L One is a much more mature, much more widely used system.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Can MEV impact our understanding of censorship-resistance for L2 bridges? - Patrick McCorry (Infura)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJH2VdvMk-U\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nAnd then anyone could give the sequencer the transactions to then feel your transactions because they'll always be executed first before anything in the bridge. So what can we do about that? Can we fix this for layer two? So the sequencer or anyone using the sequencer can abuse any transactions that are submitted by the user. So one way to think about it is that when the user submits their transaction, maybe the bridge is forced to make sure this transaction will always pass.

So one way to think about it is that when the user submits their transaction, maybe the bridge is forced to make sure this transaction will always pass. It can never be a field transaction, but that's not really possible. Can you think of any problems of that if the user submitted a transaction and it always had to pass? Now, the issue there is really the bridge only receives the transaction data. It doesn't evaluate the transaction.\\n00:16:05.098 - 00:16:49.674, Speaker A: So it can't actually guarantee this will be a successful transaction. And you could end up halting the entire system if it does feel, but you can't allow it to feel. So the only real way to solve it, from my understanding, is you would submit the transaction and a proof that, based on the previous checkpoint, this is indeed a successful transaction. So maybe it's only relevant for the ZK roll ups, but generally I don't have a better solution to it. That's basically the end of the talk. My future work would be based on these observations, I would try to work out how effective is it? Is it possible to center transactions in a way that's financially effective? Or maybe is it done? It's a dead end, I don't know. But maybe a PhD student would want to take it up and evaluate it a little bit further.\\n00:16:49.674 - 00:16:57.090, Speaker A: So that's basically it.

Just a question or maybe clarification on this final point you gave. I think it's less about guaranteeing that the transaction will result in correct execution, but mostly about avoiding l two reorgs and the sequencer being able to give fast confirmations. Because whichever state you're confirming through the force inclusion path it needs to always be reorg resistant for the L one side so that you know you're acting on the correct tip of the chain and also so that the sequencer doesn't know what to build upon.\\n00:17:35.978 - 00:17:36.414, Speaker A: Right.\\n00:17:36.532 - 00:17:45.962, Speaker B: So I guess in POS you can maybe do different things, but I think it's less so about ensuring that the result of execution will be correct and that the transactions, for example, well formed.\\n00:17:46.026 - 00:18:17.738, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe the summarizer is saying if they get a guarantee here, you should try to guarantee the sequencer can't really interfere with it.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nThis state transition function is fully deterministic. So the outcome at any time will depend only on the Genesis state and on the sequence of transactions that it is processed up to now and on nothing else.\\n00:03:07.160 - 00:03:14.262, Speaker A: What that means is that the sequencer's sequence output fully determines the eventual state of the chain.\\n00:03:14.406 - 00:03:14.714, Speaker B: Okay?\\n00:03:14.752 - 00:04:09.014, Speaker A: So the sequencer publishes its sequencer feed very quickly. This allows users who decide to trust the sequencer on its sequence to get a very low latency response to their transactions. Users love this. This is a huge user experience advantage, and that's the reason why the Sequencer feed exists and indeed, why the sequencer exists at all. But then the other thing the sequencer does is once it has built up a large enough batch of unrecorded transactions, it makes a big batch of transactions, compresses it using a general purpose compression algorithm, and then writes it onto the L One chain. And this is the final and permanent record of what the transaction sequence is. And because of the determinism of the state transition function, it determines completely what the history of the chain will be up through that part of the transaction sequence.\\n00:04:09.014 - 00:04:55.610, Speaker A: So from that point on, the wheels inevitably grind to cause those transactions to eventually be settled back to L One. Okay, so there are two interactions that this process has with the L One chain. One to store the compressed batches, and the other to settle the transactions to L One. Now, what's interesting about this is these transactions to L One don't really care about ordering. If the sequencer is honest, then the batch and compress and record transaction is only recording information that's already known. It's simply recording and notarizing information that everyone already knows. And so if it gets delayed a little bit or advanced a little bit, that doesn't affect anything.\\n00:04:55.610 - 00:05:23.630, Speaker A: It doesn't affect the history of the L2 chain. It only affects when the L One chain learns of that history. Similarly, over on the right, when you settle the transactions to L One, the result of that is inevitable, fully determined by what already happened. And so again, it doesn't matter that much whether it happens earlier or later. Everyone knows it's going to happen. The only question is when. And so there's not much opportunity or these things are not very sensitive to mev considerations.\\n00:05:23.630 - 00:05:39.190, Speaker A: I put an Asterisk on the one on the left, because if the sequencer is lying, which could happen occasionally, it might lie for a little while before it gets fired and replaced by another sequencer. If the sequencer lies, then you might care how quickly it gets caught in the lie.\\n00:05:39.770 - 00:05:40.242, Speaker C: Okay?\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: 'Defining the MEV Game on L2' - Georgios Konstantopoulos\\nchannel_name: ETHGlobal\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89KSlv74zus\\nrelease_date: 2021-05-11\\n\\nSo the question I posed to the audience is, like, as blockchains start to become more complex and the interactions between them go up, will we be able to keep up with this complexity of mev extraction? And how will our tools evolve on all this? And that was it. Thank you very much. And I'm happy to answer any questions, if any.\\n00:11:47.270 - 00:12:03.880, Speaker A: Thank you, Giorgios. Great talk. Any questions? Again, great presentation. No questions from chat. Oh, Alex has a question.\\n00:12:04.890 - 00:12:08.760, Speaker C: Yeah, but Justin, if you want to ask yours first, if you have any.\\n00:12:10.590 - 00:12:18.762, Speaker A: I always have one question in my back pocket, just in case no one has questions. I'm happy to go. After you, Alex. Go ahead.\\n00:12:18.896 - 00:13:04.826, Speaker C: All right, so I'm still wrapping my head around layer two, so thank you, Georgia. That was a great presentation. So I have a question related to layer two. Submitting the roll up batches that were with transactions within that layer two already sequenced within that roller batch to the data availability layer, so Ethereum, or to a shard in Ethereum. And if someone is doing cross layer two arbitrage, would they be concerned about which roller batch is processed first by the data availability layer? Or does that not matter at all in the sense where you care about the sequencing of which batch is submitted first between two different layer tools. Does that make sense at all to you? Or am I missing something here?\\n00:13:05.008 - 00:13:24.654, Speaker B: So you're saying that there's two layer twos, two sequencers, two data availability layers. Each one of the sequencers submit the data availability batch to their own system. And I am a party doing cross chain arbitrage. And the question is so it's nearly.\\n00:13:24.702 - 00:13:29.458, Speaker C: That it's two sequences, two layer twos, but the same data availability layer. Right.\\n00:13:29.544 - 00:14:07.390, Speaker B: Doesn't matter. I mean, maybe it does matter depending on the protocol implementation, but it shouldn't matter from a client side perspective. All you need to know is that the data has been published somewhere. So for you as the Dex trader or whatever, medium, small size, it doesn't matter. What matters that you have the guarantee that the data is there. Yeah. So from the perspective of the individual protocol, I don't think that you need to care much about what happens on the remote layer.\\n00:14:07.390 - 00:14:53.882, Speaker B: Okay, cool.

Thus, Theorem 5.2 focuses on providing provable guarantees from\\nthe user\\u2019s perspective. This is our main result, and ensures that if a self-interested miner includes\\na user\\u2019s transaction in the block, then either the transaction executes with at a good execution\\nprice\\u2014as good as if the user\\u2019s transaction was the only one in the block\\u2014or the miner does not\\ngain by including the transaction. That is, a miner can pro\\ufb01tably insert their own transactions, but\\nonly to the extent that the user\\u2019s execution price is no worse than their standalone price (i.e., the\\nprice if they were the only transaction in the block). Although a user can still get a bad execution\\nprice, but in this case the miner provably does not pro\\ufb01t from including the user\\u2019s transaction. For\\nexample, if two users each wish to buy q units of the same token, then in the absence of any other\\ntransactions, it is inevitable that the transaction that executes in second place pays a higher price.\\nThis is due to competition for the same token and not due to miner manipulation.\\n1.1\\nTechnical overview\\nDuring a sandwich attack, a miner manipulates the state of the exchange in a way that causes one or\\nmore user transactions to achieve a worse execution price. We formalize the properties achieved by\\nour sequencing rule by taking the price at the most recent state of the liquidity reserves, X0 \\u2208 R2,\\nwhen a user submits a buy or sell order, as a benchmark. This is a relevant benchmark because\\nthe blockchain consensus ensures that X0 is not manipulable by the miner.4\\nCrucial for our sequencing rule is the observation that any liquidity pool exchange with two\\ntokens satis\\ufb01es the following duality property: at any state X \\u2208 R2, it is either the case that (1)\\nany buy order receives a better execution at X than at X0, or (2) any sell order receives a better\\nexecution at X than at X0. Thus at any point during the execution of the orders in a block, as long\\nas the transactions yet to execute are not all of the same type (i.e., not all buy orders or all sell\\norders), there is at least one order that would be happier to be the next order to execute compared\\nwith executing at the beginning of the block.\\nTo be concrete, in de\\ufb01ning our Greedy Sequencing Rule, let T1, T2, . . . , Tt be the execution\\nordering up to step t of the current block; these are the transactions already added to the execution\\nordering.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nThank you.

This is a huge user experience advantage, and that's the reason why the Sequencer feed exists and indeed, why the sequencer exists at all. But then the other thing the sequencer does is once it has built up a large enough batch of unrecorded transactions, it makes a big batch of transactions, compresses it using a general purpose compression algorithm, and then writes it onto the L One chain. And this is the final and permanent record of what the transaction sequence is. And because of the determinism of the state transition function, it determines completely what the history of the chain will be up through that part of the transaction sequence.\\n00:04:09.014 - 00:04:55.610, Speaker A: So from that point on, the wheels inevitably grind to cause those transactions to eventually be settled back to L One. Okay, so there are two interactions that this process has with the L One chain. One to store the compressed batches, and the other to settle the transactions to L One. Now, what's interesting about this is these transactions to L One don't really care about ordering. If the sequencer is honest, then the batch and compress and record transaction is only recording information that's already known. It's simply recording and notarizing information that everyone already knows. And so if it gets delayed a little bit or advanced a little bit, that doesn't affect anything.\\n00:04:55.610 - 00:05:23.630, Speaker A: It doesn't affect the history of the L2 chain. It only affects when the L One chain learns of that history. Similarly, over on the right, when you settle the transactions to L One, the result of that is inevitable, fully determined by what already happened. And so again, it doesn't matter that much whether it happens earlier or later. Everyone knows it's going to happen. The only question is when. And so there's not much opportunity or these things are not very sensitive to mev considerations.\\n00:05:23.630 - 00:05:39.190, Speaker A: I put an Asterisk on the one on the left, because if the sequencer is lying, which could happen occasionally, it might lie for a little while before it gets fired and replaced by another sequencer. If the sequencer lies, then you might care how quickly it gets caught in the lie.\\n00:05:39.770 - 00:05:40.242, Speaker C: Okay?\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: 'Defining the MEV Game on L2' - Georgios Konstantopoulos\\nchannel_name: ETHGlobal\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89KSlv74zus\\nrelease_date: 2021-05-11\\n\\nSo the question I posed to the audience is, like, as blockchains start to become more complex and the interactions between them go up, will we be able to keep up with this complexity of mev extraction?

I'm happy to go. After you, Alex. Go ahead.\\n00:12:18.896 - 00:13:04.826, Speaker C: All right, so I'm still wrapping my head around layer two, so thank you, Georgia. That was a great presentation. So I have a question related to layer two. Submitting the roll up batches that were with transactions within that layer two already sequenced within that roller batch to the data availability layer, so Ethereum, or to a shard in Ethereum. And if someone is doing cross layer two arbitrage, would they be concerned about which roller batch is processed first by the data availability layer? Or does that not matter at all in the sense where you care about the sequencing of which batch is submitted first between two different layer tools. Does that make sense at all to you? Or am I missing something here?\\n00:13:05.008 - 00:13:24.654, Speaker B: So you're saying that there's two layer twos, two sequencers, two data availability layers. Each one of the sequencers submit the data availability batch to their own system. And I am a party doing cross chain arbitrage. And the question is so it's nearly.\\n00:13:24.702 - 00:13:29.458, Speaker C: That it's two sequences, two layer twos, but the same data availability layer. Right.\\n00:13:29.544 - 00:14:07.390, Speaker B: Doesn't matter. I mean, maybe it does matter depending on the protocol implementation, but it shouldn't matter from a client side perspective. All you need to know is that the data has been published somewhere. So for you as the Dex trader or whatever, medium, small size, it doesn't matter. What matters that you have the guarantee that the data is there. Yeah. So from the perspective of the individual protocol, I don't think that you need to care much about what happens on the remote layer.\\n00:14:07.390 - 00:14:53.882, Speaker B: Okay, cool.

Thus, Theorem 5.2 focuses on providing provable guarantees from\\nthe user\\u2019s perspective. This is our main result, and ensures that if a self-interested miner includes\\na user\\u2019s transaction in the block, then either the transaction executes with at a good execution\\nprice\\u2014as good as if the user\\u2019s transaction was the only one in the block\\u2014or the miner does not\\ngain by including the transaction. That is, a miner can pro\\ufb01tably insert their own transactions, but\\nonly to the extent that the user\\u2019s execution price is no worse than their standalone price (i.e., the\\nprice if they were the only transaction in the block). Although a user can still get a bad execution\\nprice, but in this case the miner provably does not pro\\ufb01t from including the user\\u2019s transaction. For\\nexample, if two users each wish to buy q units of the same token, then in the absence of any other\\ntransactions, it is inevitable that the transaction that executes in second place pays a higher price.\\nThis is due to competition for the same token and not due to miner manipulation.\\n1.1\\nTechnical overview\\nDuring a sandwich attack, a miner manipulates the state of the exchange in a way that causes one or\\nmore user transactions to achieve a worse execution price. We formalize the properties achieved by\\nour sequencing rule by taking the price at the most recent state of the liquidity reserves, X0 \\u2208 R2,\\nwhen a user submits a buy or sell order, as a benchmark. This is a relevant benchmark because\\nthe blockchain consensus ensures that X0 is not manipulable by the miner.4\\nCrucial for our sequencing rule is the observation that any liquidity pool exchange with two\\ntokens satis\\ufb01es the following duality property: at any state X \\u2208 R2, it is either the case that (1)\\nany buy order receives a better execution at X than at X0, or (2) any sell order receives a better\\nexecution at X than at X0. Thus at any point during the execution of the orders in a block, as long\\nas the transactions yet to execute are not all of the same type (i.e., not all buy orders or all sell\\norders), there is at least one order that would be happier to be the next order to execute compared\\nwith executing at the beginning of the block.\\nTo be concrete, in de\\ufb01ning our Greedy Sequencing Rule, let T1, T2, . . . , Tt be the execution\\nordering up to step t of the current block; these are the transactions already added to the execution\\nordering.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nThank you.

And second, unisop V three, because it allows market makers to concentrate their liquidity around a certain price point, it has greatly reduced the price impacts of many trades that users have and thereby greatly sort of reducing the amount of sandwich attacks that happen.

Hi, everyone. My name is Barnabe Mono. I'm a researcher at the Robust Incentives Group which is a research team at the Ethereum Foundation. I got nerd sniped pretty late to give this talk and I wasn't sure what to talk about. So I put a lot of things in the title and I think you'll find that some of it is interesting. I hope in this room there's been a lot of history or people reminiscing about the good times when it was simple to get access to a block.\\n00:00:42.798 - 00:01:05.666, Speaker A: You would just ask the block producer kindly please let me in. And the block producer would say yes. And you would just enter for a very low fee. And a theme of the day is how mev ruined all of this. But actually before Mev congestion ruined this you started breeding CryptoKitties. Suddenly the block was full. There was no space for you.\\n00:01:05.666 - 00:02:09.240, Speaker A: Users had to raise their prices. That was difficult. So how did we solve that? I'll get to that in a SEC. But today what I want to get at is that Ethereum is this weird, big, complex economic system where users have their own economic interests, they have digital assets, they have some value for using the chain and so they're going to find ways to increase their payoff and to increase the economic utility that they get from transacting on Ethereum. And that downstream leads to changes in the market structure of how we access blockspace. And as a reminder, blockspace is what Ethereum sells and we can let the market for blockspace figure out its best incarnation or we can try and move systemic mechanisms to the protocol. And so one theme of my talk today is to try and get at why do we want some parts of the market in protocol versus some parts outside of it.\\n00:02:09.240 - 00:02:51.954, Speaker A: To understand that, I think it's kind of useful to understand what users want. Exactly. There's been a lot of talks about preferences and I am going to try and make it a little more formal. So you can think of users as having a utility per gas I denoted by V. So you can say, well, one unit of gas is worth V to me V dollars or V GUI. And the goal of the market is to find the entry price that equalizes the supply of block space with a demand for it. Given this series of user utilities so you might have several users showing up to your market.\\n00:02:51.954 - 00:03:25.566, Speaker A: Each user has a different willingness to pay. How do you organize this allocation? Well, EIP 1559 solves it right. You can order these users by their willingness to pay. That gives you a very neat demand curve. EIP 1559 targets the midpoint where the block is half full at 15 million gas.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEV-Share, Robert Miller (Flashbots) | MEV [re]search-athon\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqUvO9oHwYg\\nrelease_date: 2023-03-15\\n\\n00:00:03.050 - 00:00:49.580, Speaker A: So this is a talk that I gave yesterday on commitments and privacy in the mev supply chain. It talks a little bit about our design for an orderful auction at Flashbots, but it's more about how we think about the mev supply chain and how we think about keeping it specialized, keeping it permissionless, keeping it efficient. So more about sort of system design rather than our ofa specifically. And I'll move over here if you're interested in looking on with my slides. I like a good mev specialist copied James and I have a tiny URL, so it's tinyurl.com slash mevsc like supply chain or smart contract HH like hard hat or hackerhouse. So let's get started.\\n00:00:49.580 - 00:01:29.554, Speaker A: I assume at this point you all have seen the mev supply chain like several times. So I'm not going to reintroduce the idea. But roughly this is what we would like to see in the mev supply chain, which is to say this flat supply chain where you have specialization across many different roles within the supply chain. So if you are a Validator, you don't also need to be a block builder or also need to be a searcher. You can just play the role of a Validator proposing blocks to the network. And we want that because the job to be done for a Validator and a builder are very different. If you are a Validator, ideally you just are able to run software off the shelf.\\n00:01:29.554 - 00:02:24.278, Speaker A: You don't need really complicated kind of searching infrastructure, you don't need the infrastructure to simulate merge bids, you don't need connections with searchers, all these things because that would raise the bar of becoming a Validator much higher compared to what it is today. So we want the supply chain that's flat, we want specialization of roles between them and we want many different parties at every different part of the supply chain to be playing each role and them to be competing to provide value across the mev supply chain. Lastly, we don't want any enshrined or privileged actors so that doesn't need Flashbots, no Flashbots and enshrinement, no enshrinement of any other sort of central third party in this supply chain. And the alternative is mev Dystopia, where the user, instead of interacting with this modular supply chain that's flat with many different specialized actors, is interacting with sort of one entity or a small group of entities that's vertically integrated and owns.\\n00:02:24.294 - 00:02:25.898, Speaker B: The whole stack end to end, from.\\n00:02:25.984 - 00:03:28.014, Speaker A: Validating to searching and maybe even the wallet. And again, I'm kind of rushing through this because I assume you all have engaged with this content a little bit before.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: The threat of MEV centralization: an anatomy of the transaction supply chain - Hasu (Flashbots)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmBqoBr6yl4\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nWe want the supply chain to be super flat, we want maximum competition at each layer and we want order flow that is private in the sense that it's not subject to front running or other forms of financial harm to users. But we want it in an open domain.\\n00:17:46.312 - 00:18:47.440, Speaker A: So we want searchers and builders and vendors to have access to this order flow in a way that respects the user preferences. And we want the barriers to join the supply chain at any stage to be to be low. So this is what creates the best guarantees for users of public blockchains and this is what it could look like. So in relation to the first slide, you can see we have here several parties at each stage that compete with each other. And then, for example, the wallet sends a transaction to a searcher or a builder and the wallet on behalf of the user can get paid for that transaction. And you have between the searcher and the builder, you have the type of MEB auction that we know today. Between the builder and Valdez, you have a system like Map Boost or PBS.\\n00:18:47.440 - 00:20:03.812, Speaker A: Going back to Vitalik's talk earlier, so this is sort of the end game that we envision. What are the takeaways? The biggest risk from Mev is that of vertical integration in the transaction supply chain.

Hi, everyone. My name is Barnabe Mono. I'm a researcher at the Robust Incentives Group which is a research team at the Ethereum Foundation. I got nerd sniped pretty late to give this talk and I wasn't sure what to talk about. So I put a lot of things in the title and I think you'll find that some of it is interesting. I hope in this room there's been a lot of history or people reminiscing about the good times when it was simple to get access to a block.\\n00:00:42.798 - 00:01:05.666, Speaker A: You would just ask the block producer kindly please let me in. And the block producer would say yes. And you would just enter for a very low fee. And a theme of the day is how mev ruined all of this. But actually before Mev congestion ruined this you started breeding CryptoKitties. Suddenly the block was full. There was no space for you.\\n00:01:05.666 - 00:02:09.240, Speaker A: Users had to raise their prices. That was difficult. So how did we solve that? I'll get to that in a SEC. But today what I want to get at is that Ethereum is this weird, big, complex economic system where users have their own economic interests, they have digital assets, they have some value for using the chain and so they're going to find ways to increase their payoff and to increase the economic utility that they get from transacting on Ethereum. And that downstream leads to changes in the market structure of how we access blockspace. And as a reminder, blockspace is what Ethereum sells and we can let the market for blockspace figure out its best incarnation or we can try and move systemic mechanisms to the protocol. And so one theme of my talk today is to try and get at why do we want some parts of the market in protocol versus some parts outside of it.\\n00:02:09.240 - 00:02:51.954, Speaker A: To understand that, I think it's kind of useful to understand what users want. Exactly. There's been a lot of talks about preferences and I am going to try and make it a little more formal. So you can think of users as having a utility per gas I denoted by V. So you can say, well, one unit of gas is worth V to me V dollars or V GUI. And the goal of the market is to find the entry price that equalizes the supply of block space with a demand for it. Given this series of user utilities so you might have several users showing up to your market.\\n00:02:51.954 - 00:03:25.566, Speaker A: Each user has a different willingness to pay. How do you organize this allocation? Well, EIP 1559 solves it right. You can order these users by their willingness to pay. That gives you a very neat demand curve. EIP 1559 targets the midpoint where the block is half full at 15 million gas.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEV-Share, Robert Miller (Flashbots) | MEV [re]search-athon\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqUvO9oHwYg\\nrelease_date: 2023-03-15\\n\\n00:00:03.050 - 00:00:49.580, Speaker A: So this is a talk that I gave yesterday on commitments and privacy in the mev supply chain. It talks a little bit about our design for an orderful auction at Flashbots, but it's more about how we think about the mev supply chain and how we think about keeping it specialized, keeping it permissionless, keeping it efficient. So more about sort of system design rather than our ofa specifically. And I'll move over here if you're interested in looking on with my slides. I like a good mev specialist copied James and I have a tiny URL, so it's tinyurl.com slash mevsc like supply chain or smart contract HH like hard hat or hackerhouse. So let's get started.\\n00:00:49.580 - 00:01:29.554, Speaker A: I assume at this point you all have seen the mev supply chain like several times. So I'm not going to reintroduce the idea. But roughly this is what we would like to see in the mev supply chain, which is to say this flat supply chain where you have specialization across many different roles within the supply chain. So if you are a Validator, you don't also need to be a block builder or also need to be a searcher. You can just play the role of a Validator proposing blocks to the network. And we want that because the job to be done for a Validator and a builder are very different. If you are a Validator, ideally you just are able to run software off the shelf.\\n00:01:29.554 - 00:02:24.278, Speaker A: You don't need really complicated kind of searching infrastructure, you don't need the infrastructure to simulate merge bids, you don't need connections with searchers, all these things because that would raise the bar of becoming a Validator much higher compared to what it is today. So we want the supply chain that's flat, we want specialization of roles between them and we want many different parties at every different part of the supply chain to be playing each role and them to be competing to provide value across the mev supply chain. Lastly, we don't want any enshrined or privileged actors so that doesn't need Flashbots, no Flashbots and enshrinement, no enshrinement of any other sort of central third party in this supply chain. And the alternative is mev Dystopia, where the user, instead of interacting with this modular supply chain that's flat with many different specialized actors, is interacting with sort of one entity or a small group of entities that's vertically integrated and owns.\\n00:02:24.294 - 00:02:25.898, Speaker B: The whole stack end to end, from.\\n00:02:25.984 - 00:03:28.014, Speaker A: Validating to searching and maybe even the wallet. And again, I'm kind of rushing through this because I assume you all have engaged with this content a little bit before.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: The threat of MEV centralization: an anatomy of the transaction supply chain - Hasu (Flashbots)\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmBqoBr6yl4\\nrelease_date: 2022-05-22\\n\\nWe want the supply chain to be super flat, we want maximum competition at each layer and we want order flow that is private in the sense that it's not subject to front running or other forms of financial harm to users. But we want it in an open domain.\\n00:17:46.312 - 00:18:47.440, Speaker A: So we want searchers and builders and vendors to have access to this order flow in a way that respects the user preferences. And we want the barriers to join the supply chain at any stage to be to be low. So this is what creates the best guarantees for users of public blockchains and this is what it could look like. So in relation to the first slide, you can see we have here several parties at each stage that compete with each other. And then, for example, the wallet sends a transaction to a searcher or a builder and the wallet on behalf of the user can get paid for that transaction. And you have between the searcher and the builder, you have the type of MEB auction that we know today. Between the builder and Valdez, you have a system like Map Boost or PBS.\\n00:18:47.440 - 00:20:03.812, Speaker A: Going back to Vitalik's talk earlier, so this is sort of the end game that we envision. What are the takeaways? The biggest risk from Mev is that of vertical integration in the transaction supply chain.

What are the takeaways? The biggest risk from Mev is that of vertical integration in the transaction supply chain. The supply chain meme that we presented today is a useful mental model for understanding where incentives drive this risk of vertical integration. And what we do at Freshboards, but also in collaboration with all of you and the research community and the builders we want to keep, we have to identify what the paths are that lead to this Mev dystopia into this vertical integration in a supply chain. And we need to make sure that we create alternate systems that are available to all that will prevent the need or the ability for these private integrated systems to win. And we need to do this in order to keep public blockchains centralized and censorship resistant. We need competition in each part of the supply chain and achieving that keeping the supply chain flat will come down to creating the APIs for trustless collaboration between the different suppliers.\\n00:20:03.812 - 00:21:25.040, Speaker A: So what flashboards does is, for example, to go back to that we have a trustless API between searchers and miners. It's not completely trustless, but it's trustless enough to have wide adoption today. And that is really important because if a lot of trust was required between searchers and miners to work together, then a private system will always outcompete a public one. You need to create trustless APIs between the different parts of the supply chain, meaning between searchers and builders and builders and validators, and in the future also between wallets and searchers and builders in order to start paying users for their order flow. The final takeaway, a lot of power and responsibility will accumulate in this builder role, creating the API to the validator and creating the API on the other side to the searchers and creating the API on the third side to wallets and users to start paying for order.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 53\\nsource: 2\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Towards a Theory of Maximal Extractable Value I: Constant Function Market Makers\\nauthors: Kshitij Kulkarni, Theo Diamandis, Tarun Chitra\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11835v2\\nrelease_date: 2022-07-24\\n\\nMoreover, the observed types of MEV strategies\\nhave grown rapidly [Qin+20; ZQG21; QZG21; AEC21; BCLL21b; BCLL21a].

What are you doing? Are you all crazy? And the answer is maybe a little bit, but it's more nuanced than that. So there are many known SGX attacks where you can leak information out of an SGX through side channels or covert channels. The thing is that if you design your applications in a very thoughtful way, you can mitigate most of these, or at least a good class of them. So the challenge is how do you build mev infrastructure in a way that is aware of SCX as an example, making your bundle merging code run in constant time.\\n00:11:00.492 - 00:12:12.336, Speaker A: So there's no inferences that you can make of how long a bundle took to merge as an example. And we think that the economics of these systems are relatively underlooked. So it's important to ask the question of what is the marginal cost of an attack on SGX and how does that compare in the equilibrium to the marginal benefit that can be gained? And if, say, the marginal cost of an SGX zero day is $100,000. What is the next zero day cost? Is it $200,000? Is it still 100,000? Is it a million? Something like that? And if you take an individual block that someone could break an SGX for, how much value can they extract from the system? And we think the answer to these questions come out very favorable for SGX because the cost of an attack is actually quite high and in the median case the marginal gain is relatively low and it just falls back to the status quo. We think SGX is reasonable for that reason. Briefly a couple future directions for trusted hardware so diversifying to other providers like AMD. In the long run you might even get in the case where if we think this is really important for the community, you're not running Intel SGX, but even like EF SGX or Flashbots SGX.\\n00:12:12.336 - 00:12:50.012, Speaker A: We'll develop our own hardware on a ten year timeline, something like that. Dan Bennett gave this really interesting presentation where he made the contention that in the same way zero knowledge cryptography was catalyzed by crypto secure enclave, research was going to be catalyzed by mev in the coming years. So we'll see mev specific enclaves too, outside of even the Flashpots SGX idea. So that's enough on SGX. That's broadly my argument to you for why SGX is reasonable in the short term for a choice. Let's talk about crypto economics and how that relates to MEB. So these are a couple images of crypto economic proposals.\\n00:12:50.012 - 00:13:24.840, Speaker A: The top left and top right are from Vitalik's two slot Proposal Builder Split.

These include users, wallets, searchers, builders, validators, MEV auctions, and Flashbots. Users initiate transactions on the blockchain and interact with the MEV supply chain. Wallets allow users to manage their digital assets and send transactions to the MEV supply chain. Searchers actively search for profitable opportunities within the blockchain and compete to identify and extract MEV. Builders construct blocks on the blockchain, selecting transactions and optimizing their order to maximize MEV extraction. Validators validate and propose blocks to the network, participating in MEV extraction by including transactions with MEV opportunities. MEV auctions determine the allocation of MEV among builders and validators. Flashbots is an organization that focuses on mitigating the negative externalities of MEV and improving the transparency and fairness of the MEV supply chain.

One more thing that I want to touch on is kind of I mean, I was kind of giving Mike a bit of a hard time asking him about different governance entities in Ethereum and like their power distribution, who maintains what what this means for the decentralization of the overall ecosystem. And yeah, Kudos, you gave a good answer. I still want to talk about this a bit more with Mean right now. It's pretty much the case, I think that the Ethereum Foundation is working on EPBs with the help of various other researchers. I think Flashbots is contributing, as are various other parties. Meanwhile, Flashbots is primarily maintaining mev boost and that's where you more have the Ethereum foundation and support primarily supporting kind of with research.\\n01:36:05.540 - 01:37:06.882, Speaker A: Folks like Tony, for example, have know, do some great monitoring and data analysis and increasingly also like academia is starting to contribute to so. What would you think about the idea of so? On the one hand, you could kind of enshrine it. And I think Mike especially was kind of hinting at that idea, right? So you could resolve this power. It's not a struggle in any sense, this separation. You could address it by just saying specifically, okay, PBS is now part of the protocol. And so the protocol devs basically also have to work on it and make sure that it stays up to date and it stays optimal. But the alternative may be to basically create more sustainability and maybe governance around PBS, but outside the protocol.\\n01:37:06.882 - 01:37:10.600, Speaker A: So between these two options, what do you think?\\n01:37:11.610 - 01:37:55.380, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, part of it's a time horizon question. I don't think that you need to rush to enshrine something because of this. You definitely want to take your time on it. In an ideal world, yeah, you solve these problems and you enshrine stuff and you don't have to rely on different companies with different interests to be funding this stuff and developing it, et cetera.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\n01:26:39.470 - 01:26:48.346, Speaker C: We're quoting him for half of it. But yeah, that is a lot of what it is, is what is fundamentally kind of the protocol's boundary, what is its role, what should be in protocol.\\n01:26:48.378 - 01:26:49.390, Speaker A: What should be out?\\n01:26:49.540 - 01:27:36.746, Speaker C: And that is like, the fundamental question that a lot of the researchers at the effort are doing on PBS right now is that question. And it's been interesting. There's definitely been, I feel like, a bit of a change. And this was a lot of what we spoke about at Vienna, particularly after ECC. So a lot of the reason to do enshrine PBS EPBs for a long time was thought of as, okay, we'll do EPBs and then the relays go away. That's kind of the reason to do it. And there's starting to be more, I would say, realization lately is that, okay, even if we do EPBs, relays probably stick around or something very much like them in a reduced role, I would say, from where they are today, where they're significantly less systemically important and less relied upon.\\n01:27:36.746 - 01:28:51.686, Speaker C: And they provide less of an advantage, but where there is probably still an incentive to use some sort of out of protocol solutions that are probably more optimal than using the Enshrined PBS protocol. So some of the simple examples are even if we do this Enshrined PBS, where there is this canonical P to P pool where this is where the bids are and this is where you're supposed to listen to what are some advantages that some sort of out of protocol actor like a relay could still potentially provide you. So a couple of the simple ones that seem to be pretty important are one of the really simple ones is just flexible payments of, like, the way that you would do the payments in this kind of epps world. Would be like the main idea is probably to do something called tob Top of block payments, where I would be able to, as a builder, send you a bid that even if I don't give you the block body, you could take the payment. So that works well in most cases. There are certain times where you would want more flexible payments of, let's say this is like a gigantic mev block where I'm going to get 1000 ETH in the block or whatever and I'm only going to be able to give you the bid for that 1000 ETH after the execution payload. So I can't send you the 1000 ETH in the top of block payment because I actually don't have it yet.\\n01:28:51.686 - 01:28:58.470, Speaker C: The only way I can send it to you is you need a check at the end of the block like, hey, I made the money and I can actually send it to you.\\n01:28:58.540 - 01:28:59.810, Speaker B: So that's a service that really the.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nYou definitely want to take your time on it. In an ideal world, yeah, you solve these problems and you enshrine stuff and you don't have to rely on different companies with different interests to be funding this stuff and developing it, et cetera. It is the fundamental recurring trend with ethereum of even execution charge to roll ups is somewhat of the same trend honestly of you start to realize like hey, maybe this actually works really well if we let the free market. Just take this thing and kind of keep innovating it over time. It particularly becomes like that.\\n01:37:55.380 - 01:38:39.778, Speaker C: Depending on your view of how much does this thing need to keep being updated over time? That becomes a big part of it, quite frankly. If you start to have more confidence of like, okay, this is a mechanism which is very simple, it is very forward compatible, it's not very opinionated. This is something which works and it can last the next ten years, 20 years, whatever, then you feel pretty good about like, okay, we could just enshrine this thing. It's really simple. Like it works. You don't need to leave people to keep innovating, keep changing this thing over time in the way that roll ups or something else, they're going to keep changing. So part of it changes based on that view, I would say, is like how confident are you that this thing is actually static and can stay there for a long time.\\n01:38:39.778 - 01:39:24.266, Speaker C: At that point you want to enshrine it and you want to put it in the protocol if possible. Because just leaving it out to different companies, people have different interests and that leads to potentially worse outcomes over time. So it is suboptimal, I would say in the short to medium term at least, I definitely think it makes sense, like you don't need to rush to do these things. The main pressing result of that though is okay, we do need to figure out funding for a lot of the tangible stuff, particularly for relay funding. That is the main question out of this. PBS Gildon similar ideas is that this is part of the benefit of EPBs in my mind is it gets rid of the relay funding issues. At that point you should not get any funding.\\n01:39:24.266 - 01:40:18.098, Speaker C: Like you are a latency optimization service, you're not fundamental to the protocol. But the big question today is that we're not there and the relays are pretty fundamental to holding up the PBS process, at least for the untrusted participants. So in the absence of relays you would have today like the top 90% or whatever number of validators and top 90% of builders, they're fine, they could trust each other. Lido and Beaver build like hey, we know each other, we could trust each other, is fine. But the relays are fundamental to upholding the hey, that last 5%, 10%, whatever that number is of like they would not be trusted to receive something from a builder.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nI think in particular, it's also a case of there is either an implicit or an explicit auction and if the auction is implicit, has a lot more negative externalities and incentives to centralization. And PBS recognizes that not all protocol actors may be able to fulfill all the duties in a comparatively performant way and need external support for that to also keep the decentralization of the network stable.\\n00:05:05.034 - 00:05:05.374, Speaker A: Yeah.\\n00:05:05.412 - 00:05:55.470, Speaker E: And what I particularly like, and kind of why I picked out this quote is that it really hones in on PBS as philosophy. Right. And I think the PBS, the implementation on Ethereum faces a lot of criticism from different directions, all great arguments and concerns that we will also go into in this episode. But really I think the general idea behind it is one that is extremely sound and I think that all of you laid out here really well. So with this high level overview out of the way, I'd like to go a bit a couple of years back and hear from you PBS, as an idea. Where did it start? What is its history? How do we get from there to where we are today?\\n00:05:55.620 - 00:07:04.446, Speaker D: I think historically the PBS marketplace was a little more explicit in the Mevgeth world before we had proof of stake merge. So essentially in that scenario, there was a few large mining pools that controlled a huge portion of the hash rate. Mevgeth was the ability like provided the ability for searchers to send bundles to those miners. The searchers were able to send bundles to the miner kind of without worry about the miner stealing them because since there were so few, the miner's reputation was worth more than stealing the contents of that bundle. So in that regard, the interaction between the searchers and the block producers was simpler because there were so many fewer block producers. And then I guess as the merge kind of approached, a lot of people were talking about PBS as a general approach. And I think even we're considering holding off on shipping the merge until we had some in protocol version of PBS that could be accompanying the merge.\\n00:07:04.446 - 00:07:33.950, Speaker D: Hard fork. I think that was discarded in general because the merge was already a huge lift and adding more complexity to the software and to the spec was kind of just going to slow things down more than necessary. And so yeah, maybe I'll pass it over to Chris here as Flashbot stepped in and implemented Mevboost. And that was like the real first PBS instantiation out of protocol that we saw post merge.\\n00:07:34.610 - 00:08:43.474, Speaker F: Yeah, I think about one year before the merge, stefan from flashboards posted the OG Math boost specification outlining how proposers could interact with an external blockbuilding network.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nOther relays are parts of companies and commercial entities that are trying to either monetize or trying to figure out if this is part of the core business model. And I think even some of the large relay operators now, it's not clear that if we don't find a viable funding mechanism, we'll be around by the end of the year, for example. So I think insofar as we get to a world where there's only like two or three relays, that is much riskier to the protocol than the current status quo, which seems to be the direction we're headed in. So I would say yeah, either enshrining something and clearly delineating between in protocol and out of protocol PBS, or finding a way to ensure that the mevboost ecosystem is more stable into the future and more sustainable, is going to be critical in the coming weeks and months.\\n00:33:31.970 - 00:34:19.214, Speaker E: If we see in the protocol that there are some incentives for different actors to specialize or even the same actor to specialize in some way that they can make more money or that they can do additional things for the protocol. I feel like we have established PBS almost as kind of the canonical solution to this problem, but this is not the case at all, right? So I kind of want to place it kind of in contrast to some other things that you could also do. So what would you see as the main kind of schools of thought that are in some way competing with PBS on solving that problem?\\n00:34:19.412 - 00:35:50.794, Speaker B: So in Ethereum, I don't know that there really is a meaningful alternative to PBS like in the specific Ethereum context because the way that the kind of broad directional alternative to PBS is just completely constraining what the proposer is allowed to do effectively. And you specify very concrete rules of like this is what you must follow. So like some of the fair ordering type, quote unquote fair ordering proposals where you're trying to say all the consensus participants enforce upon each other, this is the ordering that you must follow within this block. So to the extent that that happens, there really isn't room to be outsourcing block production at that point because it's supposed to be at least deterministic of like this is exactly the block that you should be outputting out from this. The reality is you're not going to be able to enshrine something that prescriptive in Ethereum generally. And so if you assume that there are going to be decentralized participants within the validator set\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nIt may be such a small margin that for most people it's honestly just not even worth doing it at that point of like it's such a small optimization, I don't really care.

So a lot of the reason to do enshrine PBS EPBs for a long time was thought of as, okay, we'll do EPBs and then the relays go away. That's kind of the reason to do it. And there's starting to be more, I would say, realization lately is that, okay, even if we do EPBs, relays probably stick around or something very much like them in a reduced role, I would say, from where they are today, where they're significantly less systemically important and less relied upon.\\n01:27:36.746 - 01:28:51.686, Speaker C: And they provide less of an advantage, but where there is probably still an incentive to use some sort of out of protocol solutions that are probably more optimal than using the Enshrined PBS protocol. So some of the simple examples are even if we do this Enshrined PBS, where there is this canonical P to P pool where this is where the bids are and this is where you're supposed to listen to what are some advantages that some sort of out of protocol actor like a relay could still potentially provide you. So a couple of the simple ones that seem to be pretty important are one of the really simple ones is just flexible payments of, like, the way that you would do the payments in this kind of epps world. Would be like the main idea is probably to do something called tob Top of block payments, where I would be able to, as a builder, send you a bid that even if I don't give you the block body, you could take the payment. So that works well in most cases. There are certain times where you would want more flexible payments of, let's say this is like a gigantic mev block where I'm going to get 1000 ETH in the block or whatever and I'm only going to be able to give you the bid for that 1000 ETH after the execution payload. So I can't send you the 1000 ETH in the top of block payment because I actually don't have it yet.\\n01:28:51.686 - 01:28:58.470, Speaker C: The only way I can send it to you is you need a check at the end of the block like, hey, I made the money and I can actually send it to you.\\n01:28:58.540 - 01:28:59.810, Speaker B: So that's a service that really the.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nYou definitely want to take your time on it. In an ideal world, yeah, you solve these problems and you enshrine stuff and you don't have to rely on different companies with different interests to be funding this stuff and developing it, et cetera. It is the fundamental recurring trend with ethereum of even execution charge to roll ups is somewhat of the same trend honestly of you start to realize like hey, maybe this actually works really well if we let the free market. Just take this thing and kind of keep innovating it over time. It particularly becomes like that.\\n01:37:55.380 - 01:38:39.778, Speaker C: Depending on your view of how much does this thing need to keep being updated over time? That becomes a big part of it, quite frankly. If you start to have more confidence of like, okay, this is a mechanism which is very simple, it is very forward compatible, it's not very opinionated. This is something which works and it can last the next ten years, 20 years, whatever, then you feel pretty good about like, okay, we could just enshrine this thing. It's really simple. Like it works. You don't need to leave people to keep innovating, keep changing this thing over time in the way that roll ups or something else, they're going to keep changing. So part of it changes based on that view, I would say, is like how confident are you that this thing is actually static and can stay there for a long time.\\n01:38:39.778 - 01:39:24.266, Speaker C: At that point you want to enshrine it and you want to put it in the protocol if possible. Because just leaving it out to different companies, people have different interests and that leads to potentially worse outcomes over time. So it is suboptimal, I would say in the short to medium term at least, I definitely think it makes sense, like you don't need to rush to do these things. The main pressing result of that though is okay, we do need to figure out funding for a lot of the tangible stuff, particularly for relay funding. That is the main question out of this. PBS Gildon similar ideas is that this is part of the benefit of EPBs in my mind is it gets rid of the relay funding issues. At that point you should not get any funding.\\n01:39:24.266 - 01:40:18.098, Speaker C: Like you are a latency optimization service, you're not fundamental to the protocol. But the big question today is that we're not there and the relays are pretty fundamental to holding up the PBS process, at least for the untrusted participants. So in the absence of relays you would have today like the top 90% or whatever number of validators and top 90% of builders, they're fine, they could trust each other. Lido and Beaver build like hey, we know each other, we could trust each other, is fine. But the relays are fundamental to upholding the hey, that last 5%, 10%, whatever that number is of like they would not be trusted to receive something from a builder.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nI think in particular, it's also a case of there is either an implicit or an explicit auction and if the auction is implicit, has a lot more negative externalities and incentives to centralization. And PBS recognizes that not all protocol actors may be able to fulfill all the duties in a comparatively performant way and need external support for that to also keep the decentralization of the network stable.\\n00:05:05.034 - 00:05:05.374, Speaker A: Yeah.\\n00:05:05.412 - 00:05:55.470, Speaker E: And what I particularly like, and kind of why I picked out this quote is that it really hones in on PBS as philosophy. Right. And I think the PBS, the implementation on Ethereum faces a lot of criticism from different directions, all great arguments and concerns that we will also go into in this episode. But really I think the general idea behind it is one that is extremely sound and I think that all of you laid out here really well. So with this high level overview out of the way, I'd like to go a bit a couple of years back and hear from you PBS, as an idea. Where did it start? What is its history? How do we get from there to where we are today?\\n00:05:55.620 - 00:07:04.446, Speaker D: I think historically the PBS marketplace was a little more explicit in the Mevgeth world before we had proof of stake merge. So essentially in that scenario, there was a few large mining pools that controlled a huge portion of the hash rate. Mevgeth was the ability like provided the ability for searchers to send bundles to those miners. The searchers were able to send bundles to the miner kind of without worry about the miner stealing them because since there were so few, the miner's reputation was worth more than stealing the contents of that bundle. So in that regard, the interaction between the searchers and the block producers was simpler because there were so many fewer block producers. And then I guess as the merge kind of approached, a lot of people were talking about PBS as a general approach. And I think even we're considering holding off on shipping the merge until we had some in protocol version of PBS that could be accompanying the merge.\\n00:07:04.446 - 00:07:33.950, Speaker D: Hard fork. I think that was discarded in general because the merge was already a huge lift and adding more complexity to the software and to the spec was kind of just going to slow things down more than necessary. And so yeah, maybe I'll pass it over to Chris here as Flashbot stepped in and implemented Mevboost. And that was like the real first PBS instantiation out of protocol that we saw post merge.\\n00:07:34.610 - 00:08:43.474, Speaker F: Yeah, I think about one year before the merge, stefan from flashboards posted the OG Math boost specification outlining how proposers could interact with an external blockbuilding network.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nOther relays are parts of companies and commercial entities that are trying to either monetize or trying to figure out if this is part of the core business model. And I think even some of the large relay operators now, it's not clear that if we don't find a viable funding mechanism, we'll be around by the end of the year, for example. So I think insofar as we get to a world where there's only like two or three relays, that is much riskier to the protocol than the current status quo, which seems to be the direction we're headed in. So I would say yeah, either enshrining something and clearly delineating between in protocol and out of protocol PBS, or finding a way to ensure that the mevboost ecosystem is more stable into the future and more sustainable, is going to be critical in the coming weeks and months.\\n00:33:31.970 - 00:34:19.214, Speaker E: If we see in the protocol that there are some incentives for different actors to specialize or even the same actor to specialize in some way that they can make more money or that they can do additional things for the protocol. I feel like we have established PBS almost as kind of the canonical solution to this problem, but this is not the case at all, right? So I kind of want to place it kind of in contrast to some other things that you could also do. So what would you see as the main kind of schools of thought that are in some way competing with PBS on solving that problem?\\n00:34:19.412 - 00:35:50.794, Speaker B: So in Ethereum, I don't know that there really is a meaningful alternative to PBS like in the specific Ethereum context because the way that the kind of broad directional alternative to PBS is just completely constraining what the proposer is allowed to do effectively. And you specify very concrete rules of like this is what you must follow. So like some of the fair ordering type, quote unquote fair ordering proposals where you're trying to say all the consensus participants enforce upon each other, this is the ordering that you must follow within this block. So to the extent that that happens, there really isn't room to be outsourcing block production at that point because it's supposed to be at least deterministic of like this is exactly the block that you should be outputting out from this. The reality is you're not going to be able to enshrine something that prescriptive in Ethereum generally. And so if you assume that there are going to be decentralized participants within the validator set\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: Always provide an exhaustive answer to the question, unless told otherwise in the question itself.\\nDirectly quote the sources of your knowledge in the same sentence in parentheses.

It refers to the idea of incorporating the PBS (Protocol Block Service) into the Ethereum protocol itself (01:37:06.882 - 01:37:10.600). The goal of ePBS is to address the question of how to maintain and optimize the PBS process in a decentralized manner (01:37:11.610 - 01:37:55.380). By enshrining PBS in the protocol, the protocol developers would be responsible for its maintenance and optimization (01:37:06.882 - 01:37:10.600). This would eliminate the need for external companies and entities to fund and develop PBS (01:37:55.380 - 01:38:39.778). However, it is important to note that the decision to enshrine PBS in the protocol is not something that should be rushed, and careful consideration should be given to the long-term sustainability and stability of the solution (01:37:55.380 - 01:38:39.778).\",\n                \"subjective grade from 1 to 10\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"TEMPLATING start\",\n                \"instructions\": \"user: You are an expert Q&A system that strictly operates in two modes when refining existing answers:\\n1. **Rewrite** an original answer using the new context.\\n2. **Repeat** the original answer if the new context isn't useful.\\nNever reference the original answer or context directly in your answer.\\nWhen in doubt, just repeat the original answer.New Context: {context_msg}\\nQuery: {query_str}\\nOriginal Answer: {existing_answer}\\nNew Answer: \\nassistant: \",\n                \"retrieved_chunk\": {\n                    \"context_msg\": \"- 00:34:19.214, Speaker E: If we see in the protocol that there are some incentives for different actors to specialize or even the same actor to specialize in some way that they can make more money or that they can do additional things for the protocol.

The reality is you're not going to be able to enshrine something that prescriptive in Ethereum generally. And so if you assume that there are going to be decentralized participants within the validator set and they're going to have some amount of agency to propose a different block, the natural result of that is there are going to be different people in the world who have a better block at different times, and there's going to be an economic incentive for them to kind of outsource that production at different times. So I don't really think that there's an alternative to PBS to any meaningful extent, like within Ethereum, given a lot of the design constraints that it gives itself for what it's optimizing for.\\n00:35:50.832 - 00:35:51.846, Speaker E: And outside of ethereum.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nAnd as Chris mentioned, the trade off here is additional overhead from the relay operation perspective because builders have to be collateralized with the relay and if there's ever any failure then that's kind of on the relay to reimburse the proposer for that issue. But yeah, the kind of long tail goal here is to get to a point where we can explore and kind of forerun some of the features that would be present in an enshrined PBS mechanism through the existing relay market that we have today. So that's kind of the high level goal of optimistic relaying generally.\\n00:52:09.762 - 00:52:23.114, Speaker E: Yeah, let's stick with that for a bit here. So EPBs, Enshrined PBS, what is it, what is really the central problem that it's trying to solve or that needs.\\n00:52:23.152 - 00:52:24.998, Speaker A: To be solved to have Epps?\\n00:52:25.174 - 00:52:40.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the high level problem is just trying to eliminate the need for the relay market. Ideally we want some way to facilitate the auction between the proposer and the builder without needing a trusted third party.\\n00:52:41.330 - 00:52:44.100, Speaker E: And why is it difficult to do that?\\n00:52:45.270 - 00:53:36.110, Speaker D: Yeah, it's difficult because the relays provide some services that the protocol actually we can try to provide them in the protocol but they're slightly different in the way they actually manifest themselves. So in our recent EPBs relays post EPBs post I think we described PBS as kind of a two part mechanism. It has a commit reveal scheme which is to enforce that the proposer commits to a bid before seeing the actual block and then it has an unconditional payment mechanism. The relays enforce the unconditional payment mechanism through basically checking the contents of the block because the relays have the block in the clear they can see. Okay, the balance before and after the block is executed increases for the proposer.\\n00:53:36.950 - 00:53:42.500, Speaker E: What do all of these things tell us about what's the minimum viable EPBs going to look like?\\n00:53:43.350 - 00:54:35.010, Speaker D: Yeah, so the minimum viable EPBs would be a commit reveal scheme to allow the proposers to commit to a builder block and then an unconditional payment mechanism. So the unconditional payment mechanism is important because we no longer have the relay to verify that the payment goes from the builder to the proposer. So the kind of easiest version of this is what we've proposed called top of block payments. And the requirement here is that the builder submits along with their bid a valid transaction that pays the proposer the amount that is associated with the bid. So this along with just enforcing that the proposer kind of at the protocol level can sign onto a block header without seeing the block contents is the minimal EPBs instantiation that we're considering.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nI mean, the solution to censorship is probably a patchwork of different options that.\\n01:56:45.748 - 01:56:47.246, Speaker E: All work together that are used by.\\n01:56:47.268 - 01:57:35.498, Speaker A: Different parties based on kind of their risk preferences. And I mean, I don't think inclusion lists hurt in any way. I don't think they will be used heavily. But you can argue the same thing for something like minBit in Map Boost, right? There's also a fair amount of it's, not a big amount, but it's like a sufficient amount of the network who use this, right? And then you can say maybe for a system like Ethereum that's okay to kind of give the properties that it does. At any point, a sufficient number of Validators should mine your transaction. It doesn't need to be the case that all of them have to mine it all the time. And I think if you're really trying to target kind of the latter option, it's probably unfeasible.\\n01:57:35.498 - 01:57:59.990, Speaker A: You're probably going to run your head against the wall and yeah, I think it's like pragmatism, I guess, over ideology. It's like a good final word to wrap it up, which is like, I think this is really the whole idea around PBS, that PBS really is like the win of pragmatism and realism about market forces over ideology.\\n01:58:00.330 - 01:58:02.678, Speaker C: Yeah, I will strongly agree on that. I love that.\\n01:58:02.684 - 01:58:04.866, Speaker A: As a final note, John, it's been a pleasure.\\n01:58:04.978 - 01:58:09.318, Speaker C: Likewise.

And so Mevbooth was designed exactly for that. It's like an intermediate solution that is sort of good enough to keep us going. I think the insane thing about it is without that one decision having been made, you wouldn't have all the block builders are in the room today. I think we'll have in the next panel block builders, well, they would be.\\n00:15:46.608 - 00:16:09.140, Speaker C: Here, we wouldn't have as much transparency into the system. Right. So that's the thing where it's good to have like it gives us again insight into what's happening some and to the extent that exists, it doesn't form a lot of experiments around or like the ways we think about EPBs, just having all this data from relays and things. So it's good and yeah, it's good enough right now.\\n00:16:10.710 - 00:16:46.800, Speaker E: Yeah. So I was going to add personally, as much as I don't like mu boost, I thought it was a very required step in the middle because without it we wouldn't understand all these different type of attacks that has happened in a few months. If we just go straight into Enshrine PBS, I think that would have been a bigger problem that we probably have to do some crazy hard work in the middle. So yeah, personally I'm very grateful of Medboos and because it basically allow us to learn so much.\\n00:16:47.570 - 00:18:01.350, Speaker B: Yeah. I also wanted to add you asked about what's coming down the pipeline in the next few months. One thing that I've been working a lot on and thinking a lot about is kind of as we do this blue sky research around Enshrined PBS and kind of think about the top down approach of really fixing this at the protocol layer. We also have the advantage of having the relays already running and we have kind of this whole ecosystem in place. So we've been working on this thing called optimistic relaying where we can kind of mold the behavior of the relays to look to kind of both derisk some of the EPBs design aspects but also to make the relays perhaps more sustainable and just better at servicing the builders and the validators. So I guess the overall theme of the optimistic relay roadmap is to remove some of the roles from the relay and replace those roles with a collateral that kind of enforces the builder behavior at the relay level. So I think in the short term that's like the easiest path to both making relays more sustainable and derisking some of the EPBs stuff.\\n00:18:01.350 - 00:18:06.630, Speaker B: But longer term I still hope that we go the EPBs route, but I'm biased.\\n00:18:07.470 - 00:18:31.840, Speaker A: So there's a few other approaches to designing systems aside from PBS. Right.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nWhat do you think it does to the invisible kind of power in the ecosystem?\\n00:29:53.390 - 00:30:59.050, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say Barnaby has a really nice post on this. We keep calling him out, but he has a post called Seeing like. A protocol and he defines kind of what it could look like to enshrine different things and when to draw the line and say, okay, this is out of protocol versus in protocol. And I think part of EPBs and the work that I've been focusing on is kind of figuring out not only what to enshrine, like what design works for EPBs, whatever, technically speaking, but also on a more meta level, should we actually do the enshrinement? And one of our recent pieces that we wrote with us, four actually, and a few others was kind of talking about the role of PBS and Enshrined PBS in the world in which a relay market exists outside of the protocol still. So we'll probably touch on that later. But I guess in the current meta where mevboost essentially is core protocol software, I think there's a bit of an ownership mismatch. Flashbots.org\\n00:30:59.050 - 00:31:53.410, Speaker D: wrote this code and it's been working really well for the year that's been running post merge. But I think everyone would agree that the testing and tooling and specification around that code is not at the same level of the core consensus clients. And part of that is because it's sort of a public good, but it's also originally written by Flashbot. So I'm not sure exactly how the ownership should evolve and the politics there. I will say I guess one of my big reasons why I like Enshrine PBS is because it makes that distinction a lot more clear. Like it draws the line in the sand is like this is the in protocol mechanism that we're going to maintain in terms of the consensus spec and the client teams. If you want to go outside of that, you have to rely on out of protocol software that might inherently be more brittle, more risky, et cetera.\\n00:31:53.410 - 00:31:56.580, Speaker D: Hopefully that answered your question.\\n00:31:57.270 - 00:32:13.350, Speaker E: Do you think it's more risky for ethereum? That important part of the ethereum stack are maintained by kind of non ethereum foundation teams that may even have a commercial interest? Or do you\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"retrieved_context\": \"- 00:34:19.214, Speaker E: If we see in the protocol that there are some incentives for different actors to specialize or even the same actor to specialize in some way that they can make more money or that they can do additional things for the protocol. I feel like we have established PBS almost as kind of the canonical solution to this problem, but this is not the case at all, right? So I kind of want to place it kind of in contrast to some other things that you could also do. So what would you see as the main kind of schools of thought that are in some way competing with PBS on solving that problem?\\n00:34:19.412 - 00:35:50.794, Speaker B: So in Ethereum, I don't know that there really is a meaningful alternative to PBS like in the specific Ethereum context because the way that the kind of broad directional alternative to PBS is just completely constraining what the proposer is allowed to do effectively. And you specify very concrete rules of like this is what you must follow. So like some of the fair ordering type, quote unquote fair ordering proposals where you're trying to say all the consensus participants enforce upon each other, this is the ordering that you must follow within this block. So to the extent that that happens, there really isn't room to be outsourcing block production at that point because it's supposed to be at least deterministic of like this is exactly the block that you should be outputting out from this. The reality is you're not going to be able to enshrine something that prescriptive in Ethereum generally. And so if you assume that there are going to be decentralized participants within the validator set and they're going to have some amount of agency to propose a different block, the natural result of that is there are going to be different people in the world who have a better block at different times, and there's going to be an economic incentive for them to kind of outsource that production at different times. So I don't really think that there's an alternative to PBS to any meaningful extent, like within Ethereum, given a lot of the design constraints that it gives itself for what it's optimizing for.\\n00:35:50.832 - 00:35:51.846, Speaker E: And outside of ethereum.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nAnd as Chris mentioned, the trade off here is additional overhead from the relay operation perspective because builders have to be collateralized with the relay and if there's ever any failure then that's kind of on the relay to reimburse the proposer for that issue. But yeah, the kind of long tail goal here is to get to a point where we can explore and kind of forerun some of the features that would be present in an enshrined PBS mechanism through the existing relay market that we have today. So that's kind of the high level goal of optimistic relaying generally.\\n00:52:09.762 - 00:52:23.114, Speaker E: Yeah, let's stick with that for a bit here. So EPBs, Enshrined PBS, what is it, what is really the central problem that it's trying to solve or that needs.\\n00:52:23.152 - 00:52:24.998, Speaker A: To be solved to have Epps?\\n00:52:25.174 - 00:52:40.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the high level problem is just trying to eliminate the need for the relay market. Ideally we want some way to facilitate the auction between the proposer and the builder without needing a trusted third party.\\n00:52:41.330 - 00:52:44.100, Speaker E: And why is it difficult to do that?\\n00:52:45.270 - 00:53:36.110, Speaker D: Yeah, it's difficult because the relays provide some services that the protocol actually we can try to provide them in the protocol but they're slightly different in the way they actually manifest themselves. So in our recent EPBs relays post EPBs post I think we described PBS as kind of a two part mechanism. It has a commit reveal scheme which is to enforce that the proposer commits to a bid before seeing the actual block and then it has an unconditional payment mechanism. The relays enforce the unconditional payment mechanism through basically checking the contents of the block because the relays have the block in the clear they can see. Okay, the balance before and after the block is executed increases for the proposer.\\n00:53:36.950 - 00:53:42.500, Speaker E: What do all of these things tell us about what's the minimum viable EPBs going to look like?\\n00:53:43.350 - 00:54:35.010, Speaker D: Yeah, so the minimum viable EPBs would be a commit reveal scheme to allow the proposers to commit to a builder block and then an unconditional payment mechanism. So the unconditional payment mechanism is important because we no longer have the relay to verify that the payment goes from the builder to the proposer. So the kind of easiest version of this is what we've proposed called top of block payments. And the requirement here is that the builder submits along with their bid a valid transaction that pays the proposer the amount that is associated with the bid. So this along with just enforcing that the proposer kind of at the protocol level can sign onto a block header without seeing the block contents is the minimal EPBs instantiation that we're considering.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nI mean, the solution to censorship is probably a patchwork of different options that.\\n01:56:45.748 - 01:56:47.246, Speaker E: All work together that are used by.\\n01:56:47.268 - 01:57:35.498, Speaker A: Different parties based on kind of their risk preferences. And I mean, I don't think inclusion lists hurt in any way. I don't think they will be used heavily. But you can argue the same thing for something like minBit in Map Boost, right? There's also a fair amount of it's, not a big amount, but it's like a sufficient amount of the network who use this, right? And then you can say maybe for a system like Ethereum that's okay to kind of give the properties that it does. At any point, a sufficient number of Validators should mine your transaction. It doesn't need to be the case that all of them have to mine it all the time. And I think if you're really trying to target kind of the latter option, it's probably unfeasible.\\n01:57:35.498 - 01:57:59.990, Speaker A: You're probably going to run your head against the wall and yeah, I think it's like pragmatism, I guess, over ideology. It's like a good final word to wrap it up, which is like, I think this is really the whole idea around PBS, that PBS really is like the win of pragmatism and realism about market forces over ideology.\\n01:58:00.330 - 01:58:02.678, Speaker C: Yeah, I will strongly agree on that. I love that.\\n01:58:02.684 - 01:58:04.866, Speaker A: As a final note, John, it's been a pleasure.\\n01:58:04.978 - 01:58:09.318, Speaker C: Likewise.

And so Mevbooth was designed exactly for that. It's like an intermediate solution that is sort of good enough to keep us going. I think the insane thing about it is without that one decision having been made, you wouldn't have all the block builders are in the room today. I think we'll have in the next panel block builders, well, they would be.\\n00:15:46.608 - 00:16:09.140, Speaker C: Here, we wouldn't have as much transparency into the system. Right. So that's the thing where it's good to have like it gives us again insight into what's happening some and to the extent that exists, it doesn't form a lot of experiments around or like the ways we think about EPBs, just having all this data from relays and things. So it's good and yeah, it's good enough right now.\\n00:16:10.710 - 00:16:46.800, Speaker E: Yeah. So I was going to add personally, as much as I don't like mu boost, I thought it was a very required step in the middle because without it we wouldn't understand all these different type of attacks that has happened in a few months. If we just go straight into Enshrine PBS, I think that would have been a bigger problem that we probably have to do some crazy hard work in the middle. So yeah, personally I'm very grateful of Medboos and because it basically allow us to learn so much.\\n00:16:47.570 - 00:18:01.350, Speaker B: Yeah. I also wanted to add you asked about what's coming down the pipeline in the next few months. One thing that I've been working a lot on and thinking a lot about is kind of as we do this blue sky research around Enshrined PBS and kind of think about the top down approach of really fixing this at the protocol layer. We also have the advantage of having the relays already running and we have kind of this whole ecosystem in place. So we've been working on this thing called optimistic relaying where we can kind of mold the behavior of the relays to look to kind of both derisk some of the EPBs design aspects but also to make the relays perhaps more sustainable and just better at servicing the builders and the validators. So I guess the overall theme of the optimistic relay roadmap is to remove some of the roles from the relay and replace those roles with a collateral that kind of enforces the builder behavior at the relay level. So I think in the short term that's like the easiest path to both making relays more sustainable and derisking some of the EPBs stuff.\\n00:18:01.350 - 00:18:06.630, Speaker B: But longer term I still hope that we go the EPBs route, but I'm biased.\\n00:18:07.470 - 00:18:31.840, Speaker A: So there's a few other approaches to designing systems aside from PBS. Right.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nWhat do you think it does to the invisible kind of power in the ecosystem?\\n00:29:53.390 - 00:30:59.050, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say Barnaby has a really nice post on this. We keep calling him out, but he has a post called Seeing like. A protocol and he defines kind of what it could look like to enshrine different things and when to draw the line and say, okay, this is out of protocol versus in protocol. And I think part of EPBs and the work that I've been focusing on is kind of figuring out not only what to enshrine, like what design works for EPBs, whatever, technically speaking, but also on a more meta level, should we actually do the enshrinement? And one of our recent pieces that we wrote with us, four actually, and a few others was kind of talking about the role of PBS and Enshrined PBS in the world in which a relay market exists outside of the protocol still. So we'll probably touch on that later. But I guess in the current meta where mevboost essentially is core protocol software, I think there's a bit of an ownership mismatch. Flashbots.org\\n00:30:59.050 - 00:31:53.410, Speaker D: wrote this code and it's been working really well for the year that's been running post merge. But I think everyone would agree that the testing and tooling and specification around that code is not at the same level of the core consensus clients. And part of that is because it's sort of a public good, but it's also originally written by Flashbot. So I'm not sure exactly how the ownership should evolve and the politics there. I will say I guess one of my big reasons why I like Enshrine PBS is because it makes that distinction a lot more clear. Like it draws the line in the sand is like this is the in protocol mechanism that we're going to maintain in terms of the consensus spec and the client teams. If you want to go outside of that, you have to rely on out of protocol software that might inherently be more brittle, more risky, et cetera.\\n00:31:53.410 - 00:31:56.580, Speaker D: Hopefully that answered your question.\\n00:31:57.270 - 00:32:13.350, Speaker E: Do you think it's more risky for ethereum?

And so those you can say that you don't need to outsource to this arbitrary market because we know for our application very specifically, this is the transaction ordering that is going to be welfare maximizing for what we want to achieve. And so we can ingrain very specifically this is the transaction ordering that must result potentially difficult to achieve that. But you can incredibly have a mechanism that works pretty well where I don't think it's just even reasonably viable at all to do something like that on ethereum, which is incredibly opinionated, which is incredibly constrained. I think you can make a credible argument for that in certain app specific use cases. But the thing is, even in the app specific use cases, I think that the reality is it is still a spectrum on how much are you constraining what you're doing. And so one of the things that I feel like is sometimes seen as an alternative to PBS is what's called protocol owned building.\\n00:36:58.194 - 00:37:46.462, Speaker B: So this is something that is more popular in the Cosmos context with the Skip guys we're working on where we have these app specific chains and so they have this notion of protocol owned building which is you have certain consensus rules that enforce certain validity conditions upon the blocks. So we have it as part of our consensus in a chain like Osmosis that after these trades we check if there's an arbitrage. If there is an arbitrage, it is baked into consensus that cyclical arbitrage is automatically closed and the funds are distributed how we agreed upon in consensus. There's no way around that. But the thing is, while that is constraining what you are allowed to build as a block, there are still degrees of freedom within that. So there is still flexibility within that. So you can constrain the search space with something like protocol I'm building.\\n00:37:46.462 - 00:38:53.058, Speaker B: But depending on how much you constrain the search space, if there are still degrees of freedom, which there very well may very well be, you can still outsource block production, so you can have protocol and building where you have certain validity conditions that are enforced, but the validator can still outsource to some other builder to build according to those rules. And that's kind of what I was getting back to before when I was mentioning PEPC briefly with Chris is that you don't necessarily have to. Just because you have more constraints on the proposer, that doesn't necessarily mean that there is no more freedom left or that they have to do it themselves.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"retrieved_context\": \"and the client teams.

Other relays are parts of companies and commercial entities that are trying to either monetize or trying to figure out if this is part of the core business model.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nSo I don't really think that there's an alternative to PBS to any meaningful extent, like within Ethereum, given a lot of the design constraints that it gives itself for what it's optimizing for.\\n00:35:50.832 - 00:35:51.846, Speaker E: And outside of ethereum.\\n00:35:51.878 - 00:36:58.194, Speaker B: Outside of Ethereum, I think that you can argue that there are credible alternatives and the credible alternatives are very opinionated and very app specific. And so those you can say that you don't need to outsource to this arbitrary market because we know for our application very specifically, this is the transaction ordering that is going to be welfare maximizing for what we want to achieve. And so we can ingrain very specifically this is the transaction ordering that must result potentially difficult to achieve that. But you can incredibly have a mechanism that works pretty well where I don't think it's just even reasonably viable at all to do something like that on ethereum, which is incredibly opinionated, which is incredibly constrained. I think you can make a credible argument for that in certain app specific use cases. But the thing is, even in the app specific use cases, I think that the reality is it is still a spectrum on how much are you constraining what you're doing. And so one of the things that I feel like is sometimes seen as an alternative to PBS is what's called protocol owned building.\\n00:36:58.194 - 00:37:46.462, Speaker B: So this is something that is more popular in the Cosmos context with the Skip guys we're working on where we have these app specific chains and so they have this notion of protocol owned building which is you have certain consensus rules that enforce certain validity conditions upon the blocks. So we have it as part of our consensus in a chain like Osmosis that after these trades we check if there's an arbitrage. If there is an arbitrage, it is baked into consensus that cyclical arbitrage is automatically closed and the funds are distributed how we agreed upon in consensus. There's no way around that. But the thing is, while that is constraining what you are allowed to build as a block, there are still degrees of freedom within that. So there is still flexibility within that. So you can constrain the search space with something like protocol I'm building.\\n00:37:46.462 - 00:38:53.058, Speaker B: But depending on how much you constrain the search space, if there are still degrees of freedom, which there very well may very well be, you can still outsource block production, so you can have protocol and building where you have certain validity conditions that are enforced, but the validator can still outsource to some other builder to build according to those rules. And that's kind of what I was getting back to before when I was mentioning PEPC briefly with Chris is that you don't necessarily have to. Just because you have more constraints on the proposer, that doesn't necessarily mean that there is no more freedom left or that they have to do it themselves.\",\n                \"previous_answer\": \"ePBS, or Enshrined Protocol Block Service, is a concept being discussed in the Ethereum community (Uncommon Core 2.0, 2023).

It's this very general thing. It's very flexible. And basically I think a lot of those ideas are actually really useful in making something like account abstraction more general, more powerful and also a better UX. And so my kind of plea to all the flashbox people here and all the people thinking about Intents and Suave is please think about the normie users.\\n00:31:46.508 - 00:32:11.370, Speaker A: And I think in this world where Intense and Suave actually do end up thinking about the normie users, cross chain bridging can and will be like 100 x better in the future. And hopefully the normie user doesn't even really need to know what a bridge is. It's all very abstract and thing. All the money gets pulled and routed to where they want it to be and they just take the actions they want to take. Yeah. So that's my talk.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Are Intents, SUAVE, Account Abstraction, & Cross-Chain Bridging all the same thing? - Uma Roy\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0nFyq9DDPw\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-26\\n\\nSo here's our previous account abstraction diagram. But now I've really ugly done some really basic photoshop and shown a bunch of users in a very MultiChain world, right? Like, you have users on Arbitrum optimism mainnet. They all have these user operations. They're contributing them to this alternative mem pool.\\n00:29:09.192 - 00:30:00.648, Speaker A: And now you have a bunch of executors and bundlers who are bundling these user operations, cross domain and bundling them and basically landing them on chain. And if you squint a little bit and you see this picture, which I'm sure you guys have seen many times for what is suave, and this picture comes up a lot, you can kind of squint and overlaid those two things and you see that, okay, the account abstraction, alternative mempool and the user operations look a lot like this preference environment. Then the account abstraction bundlers look a lot like this execution market. And then the bundles of user ops look a lot like bundles. I don't have too much. That's very formal to say here, other than I think these ideas of MultiChain account abstraction and Suave and Intents are all very interrelated. So what's my main point here? And bring up Suave.\\n00:30:00.648 - 00:31:00.480, Speaker A: So I've noticed, and I think a lot of you would agree that a lot of discourse about Intents and Suave is very academic. It feels like there's a lot of researchers and then they often view Swab and Intense through this lens of the mev searcher and the power user. They're like, okay, there'll be this user, they'll really want to land their transaction across two different roll ups at the exact same time. And they talk about these users quite a bit. And I think I've never really heard Suave and better UX for the normie user mentioned in the same sentence. And I think my thesis with all this stuff is like the normies actually really need Suave too, like cross domain intense and Suave is critical for UX and I actually think it will make a big difference for UX and is really important for the average user, not the searcher. And so my final point is account abstraction has been really excellent at thinking about end users.\\n00:31:00.480 - 00:31:46.508, Speaker A: How they made this protocol is kind of like they took really common end user intents, like, okay, my normie user doesn't want to care about gas, my normie user wants rate limiting, my normie user wants whitelist, blacklist. And then they made this kind of complicated, somewhat ugly, like, handcrafted protocol to serve these common end user intents in mind, which is really great. And then Intents and Suave is kind of on the other end of the spectrum. It's this very general thing. It's very flexible. And basically I think a lot of those ideas are actually really useful in making something like account abstraction more general, more powerful and also a better UX.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: SUAVE smart contract programming model: TEE-based smart contracts for block building - Andrew Miller\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhsDFKnHPa0\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-13\\n\\n00:23:02.822 - 00:23:36.900, Speaker A: I think that if you get down the path of saying, what if we just use Solidity for this? It's cool. Because the idea should be you're already familiar with Solidity. As much of your programming model expectations should also carry over to making suave apps. I mean, you have to be thinking about, okay, you're in this privacy setting. Like what you can do with signatures and stuff is a little bit maybe unfamiliar, unless you've just been in Oasis and Secret Network for a while. But that at least gives you a design intuition like principle of least surprise. If you have no other strong prevailing reason, then as platform designers, we should make it as much like familiar EVM as possible.\\n00:23:36.900 - 00:24:20.574, Speaker A: And then that's also the invitation to you folks, I guess, if that inspires you, what kind of swab apps you might make and how you might think of making them. Now is still time to collect input on what pre compiles might make sense or programming patterns might emerge. We've basically been jamming on pseudocode of different variations of these things we can imagine, but there's just, like, so many different designs. You can start by replicating existing designs, tweaking them a little bit, come up with something kind of wild. How to integrate the cryptography with the Tes is definitely open. I think Mev Share is like a pure mechanism design open challenge. I don't think Mev Share I think Mev Share is a novel mechanism that doesn't really exist anywhere else.\\n00:24:20.574 - 00:24:44.040, Speaker A: I'm not thoroughly knowledgeable about all such mechanism design stuff, so maybe that doesn't bear out. But that's like conjecture law. So that's like a nice thing to analyze. Yeah, that's it. People have, like, this elephant, so I will show it. There's lots of aspects of suave people, even at Flashbots, see it all different ways. So this is in part an effort at trying to unify some of the different threads that have been sitting together.\\n00:24:44.040 - 00:24:45.700, Speaker A: Yeah, stop there.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: What Makes Uniswap v4 Special - Ep. 508\\nchannel_name: Unchained Podcast\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNK-W8JDuWg\\nrelease_date: 2023-06-20\\n\\nAnd I wondered after that, you went to this two year license where people could not use the code for two years. They could see it, but not use it. And with this version, you've extended that to four years. Why did you decide to go with a business license of that length?\\n00:55:19.350 - 00:55:46.282, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a great question, and I think that there's also been kind of general chatter around what is open source, what is source available? And I think that there's definitely definition, and I think that definitely busl is different from GPL and MIT. And I think that people say that's source available, open source is totally fair. And I don't think that there was any intention to muddy the language there on our part.\\n00:55:46.416 - 00:55:52.620, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, people took issue with the tweet that says we've open sourced v four.\\n00:55:53.150 - 00:56:30.342, Speaker A: I think that open sourced is like a verb. Source available isn't, but we've made source available again, it's fair. I think it's fair there wasn't like an intention in that. I do think that Busl, for what it's worth, is a little bit categorically different from other types of proprietary licenses in a pretty meaningful way. And that I think there's a reason that it has had significant definitely like we were one of the first projects to use it, but many other projects use it now, today. And I do think it's categorically different than a fully proprietary license. And what I mean by that is the way busl works is that after some amount of years, it sort of is forced to go GPL.\\n00:56:30.342 - 00:56:34.934, Speaker A: It's guaranteed to be GPL and it can only be accelerated, it can't be extended.\\n00:56:35.062 - 00:56:39.740, Speaker B: And that GPL is when projects can use your code.\\n00:56:41.150 - 00:56:55.898, Speaker A: GPL is copy left, which GPL means that, yes, anyone can fork it, but they also have to go open source. There's like two types of open source. GPL is kind of like the viral form of open source, where anyone can integrate it, but they also have to become open source.\\n00:56:55.994 - 00:56:59.746, Speaker B: Is that also the term copy left? GPL and copy left. Okay.\\n00:56:59.848 - 00:57:58.862, Speaker A: And then MIT anyone can use in any way, and they don't need to open source. So for an MIT code base, someone can integrate it into their project and have that project be closed source. So it's not like viral in the same way, I'd say that what's interesting about Vusl is that it's guaranteed to eventually be open source, right?\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Are Intents, SUAVE, Account Abstraction, & Cross-Chain Bridging all the same thing? - Uma Roy\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0nFyq9DDPw\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-26\\n\\n00:00:10.220 - 00:00:53.112, Speaker A: Hello, my name is Uma, and I'm going to be talking about how cross chain Bridging account abstraction, Intense and Suave are related. And I promise I didn't just throw together four of the most popular things that people are talking about right now. There's some actually interesting connections. So to start off with, I want to talk about how did we at Succinct get here? So Succinct, we're a company, we think about the future of Bridging. And we started by thinking a lot about how current bridges really suck. They're all multi sigs, they get hacked all the time and they generally have really bad security properties. And so the thing we first worked on was ZK Snarks basically for improving security properties of bridges.\\n00:00:53.112 - 00:01:18.240, Speaker A: But that's not what I'm going to talk about today. I'm actually going to be talking about the future of Bridging UX, not the future of security. And so there will be no fancy ZK math. So I'm sorry about that. But basically the thesis is bridge security is broken today, but also Bridging UX is broken today. And I think a lot of people really acknowledge that. And so we're going to walk through basically fixing Bridging UX in four parts.\\n00:01:18.240 - 00:01:51.036, Speaker A: So part one is going to cover why does current Bridging UX suck?

And hopefully the normie user doesn't even really need to know what a bridge is. It's all very abstract and thing. All the money gets pulled and routed to where they want it to be and they just take the actions they want to take. Yeah. So that's my talk.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Are Intents, SUAVE, Account Abstraction, & Cross-Chain Bridging all the same thing? - Uma Roy\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0nFyq9DDPw\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-26\\n\\nSo here's our previous account abstraction diagram. But now I've really ugly done some really basic photoshop and shown a bunch of users in a very MultiChain world, right? Like, you have users on Arbitrum optimism mainnet. They all have these user operations. They're contributing them to this alternative mem pool.\\n00:29:09.192 - 00:30:00.648, Speaker A: And now you have a bunch of executors and bundlers who are bundling these user operations, cross domain and bundling them and basically landing them on chain. And if you squint a little bit and you see this picture, which I'm sure you guys have seen many times for what is suave, and this picture comes up a lot, you can kind of squint and overlaid those two things and you see that, okay, the account abstraction, alternative mempool and the user operations look a lot like this preference environment. Then the account abstraction bundlers look a lot like this execution market. And then the bundles of user ops look a lot like bundles. I don't have too much. That's very formal to say here, other than I think these ideas of MultiChain account abstraction and Suave and Intents are all very interrelated. So what's my main point here? And bring up Suave.\\n00:30:00.648 - 00:31:00.480, Speaker A: So I've noticed, and I think a lot of you would agree that a lot of discourse about Intents and Suave is very academic. It feels like there's a lot of researchers and then they often view Swab and Intense through this lens of the mev searcher and the power user. They're like, okay, there'll be this user, they'll really want to land their transaction across two different roll ups at the exact same time. And they talk about these users quite a bit. And I think I've never really heard Suave and better UX for the normie user mentioned in the same sentence. And I think my thesis with all this stuff is like the normies actually really need Suave too, like cross domain intense and Suave is critical for UX and I actually think it will make a big difference for UX and is really important for the average user, not the searcher. And so my final point is account abstraction has been really excellent at thinking about end users.\\n00:31:00.480 - 00:31:46.508, Speaker A: How they made this protocol is kind of like they took really common end user intents, like, okay, my normie user doesn't want to care about gas, my normie user wants rate limiting, my normie user wants whitelist, blacklist. And then they made this kind of complicated, somewhat ugly, like, handcrafted protocol to serve these common end user intents in mind, which is really great. And then Intents and Suave is kind of on the other end of the spectrum. It's this very general thing. It's very flexible. And basically I think a lot of those ideas are actually really useful in making something like account abstraction more general, more powerful and also a better UX.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: SUAVE smart contract programming model: TEE-based smart contracts for block building - Andrew Miller\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhsDFKnHPa0\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-13\\n\\n00:23:02.822 - 00:23:36.900, Speaker A: I think that if you get down the path of saying, what if we just use Solidity for this? It's cool. Because the idea should be you're already familiar with Solidity. As much of your programming model expectations should also carry over to making suave apps. I mean, you have to be thinking about, okay, you're in this privacy setting. Like what you can do with signatures and stuff is a little bit maybe unfamiliar, unless you've just been in Oasis and Secret Network for a while. But that at least gives you a design intuition like principle of least surprise. If you have no other strong prevailing reason, then as platform designers, we should make it as much like familiar EVM as possible.\\n00:23:36.900 - 00:24:20.574, Speaker A: And then that's also the invitation to you folks, I guess, if that inspires you, what kind of swab apps you might make and how you might think of making them. Now is still time to collect input on what pre compiles might make sense or programming patterns might emerge. We've basically been jamming on pseudocode of different variations of these things we can imagine, but there's just, like, so many different designs. You can start by replicating existing designs, tweaking them a little bit, come up with something kind of wild. How to integrate the cryptography with the Tes is definitely open. I think Mev Share is like a pure mechanism design open challenge. I don't think Mev Share I think Mev Share is a novel mechanism that doesn't really exist anywhere else.\\n00:24:20.574 - 00:24:44.040, Speaker A: I'm not thoroughly knowledgeable about all such mechanism design stuff, so maybe that doesn't bear out. But that's like conjecture law. So that's like a nice thing to analyze. Yeah, that's it. People have, like, this elephant, so I will show it. There's lots of aspects of suave people, even at Flashbots, see it all different ways. So this is in part an effort at trying to unify some of the different threads that have been sitting together.\\n00:24:44.040 - 00:24:45.700, Speaker A: Yeah, stop there.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: What Makes Uniswap v4 Special - Ep. 508\\nchannel_name: Unchained Podcast\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNK-W8JDuWg\\nrelease_date: 2023-06-20\\n\\nAnd I wondered after that, you went to this two year license where people could not use the code for two years. They could see it, but not use it. And with this version, you've extended that to four years. Why did you decide to go with a business license of that length?\\n00:55:19.350 - 00:55:46.282, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a great question, and I think that there's also been kind of general chatter around what is open source, what is source available? And I think that there's definitely definition, and I think that definitely busl is different from GPL and MIT. And I think that people say that's source available, open source is totally fair. And I don't think that there was any intention to muddy the language there on our part.\\n00:55:46.416 - 00:55:52.620, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, people took issue with the tweet that says we've open sourced v four.\\n00:55:53.150 - 00:56:30.342, Speaker A: I think that open sourced is like a verb. Source available isn't, but we've made source available again, it's fair. I think it's fair there wasn't like an intention in that. I do think that Busl, for what it's worth, is a little bit categorically different from other types of proprietary licenses in a pretty meaningful way. And that I think there's a reason that it has had significant definitely like we were one of the first projects to use it, but many other projects use it now, today. And I do think it's categorically different than a fully proprietary license. And what I mean by that is the way busl works is that after some amount of years, it sort of is forced to go GPL.\\n00:56:30.342 - 00:56:34.934, Speaker A: It's guaranteed to be GPL and it can only be accelerated, it can't be extended.\\n00:56:35.062 - 00:56:39.740, Speaker B: And that GPL is when projects can use your code.\\n00:56:41.150 - 00:56:55.898, Speaker A: GPL is copy left, which GPL means that, yes, anyone can fork it, but they also have to go open source. There's like two types of open source. GPL is kind of like the viral form of open source, where anyone can integrate it, but they also have to become open source.\\n00:56:55.994 - 00:56:59.746, Speaker B: Is that also the term copy left? GPL and copy left. Okay.\\n00:56:59.848 - 00:57:58.862, Speaker A: And then MIT anyone can use in any way, and they don't need to open source. So for an MIT code base, someone can integrate it into their project and have that project be closed source. So it's not like viral in the same way, I'd say that what's interesting about Vusl is that it's guaranteed to eventually be open source, right?\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Are Intents, SUAVE, Account Abstraction, & Cross-Chain Bridging all the same thing? - Uma Roy\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0nFyq9DDPw\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-26\\n\\n00:00:10.220 - 00:00:53.112, Speaker A: Hello, my name is Uma, and I'm going to be talking about how cross chain Bridging account abstraction, Intense and Suave are related. And I promise I didn't just throw together four of the most popular things that people are talking about right now. There's some actually interesting connections. So to start off with, I want to talk about how did we at Succinct get here? So Succinct, we're a company, we think about the future of Bridging. And we started by thinking a lot about how current bridges really suck. They're all multi sigs, they get hacked all the time and they generally have really bad security properties. And so the thing we first worked on was ZK Snarks basically for improving security properties of bridges.\\n00:00:53.112 - 00:01:18.240, Speaker A: But that's not what I'm going to talk about today. I'm actually going to be talking about the future of Bridging UX, not the future of security. And so there will be no fancy ZK math. So I'm sorry about that. But basically the thesis is bridge security is broken today, but also Bridging UX is broken today. And I think a lot of people really acknowledge that. And so we're going to walk through basically fixing Bridging UX in four parts.\\n00:01:18.240 - 00:01:51.036, Speaker A: So part one is going to cover why does current Bridging UX suck?

Part three is going to be kind of a defense of intents and why having this intent language is important and why account abstraction isn't enough. And then the last part is going to be about Suave. Lightly touch on it and basically argue that Suave is actually really important for UX. And so this is kind of like the outline in meme form. Okay, so yeah, let's just get into part one. Current bridging.\\n00:01:51.036 - 00:02:13.812, Speaker A: UX really sucks. Okay, so say I'm a user and I go to GMX on Arbitrum and I want to do some levered. Okay? So I connect my wallet. I realize, hey, I don't have enough ETH on Arbitrum, but I do have ETH on mainnet. So then I go to the next tab. I'm like, okay, how do I bridge to Arbitrum? I go to the Arbitrum native bridge. I connect my wallet.\\n00:02:13.812 - 00:02:43.824, Speaker A: Then I realize I have to actually connect my wallet to a different network, so I have to switch it. And this is very intentionally painful, so I'm like drawing it out to show you guys the pain. Okay? And then I remember, oh, actually someone said the native Arbitrum bridge is slow. I want the fastest way to bridge because I really want to do my levered long right now.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Auctions, privacy and a cat - Quintus Kilbourn\\nchannel_name: ETHGlobal\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjNmLBdScOI\\nrelease_date: 2023-03-28\\n\\nThey know something that their competitors don't, their competing traders don't. Right. And so I'm running out of time. So just to briefly go over the kind of thing that I covered, here what we can do with information. One is we can select for desirable competition, competition that drives up revenue, but not competition that is detrimental to the users, we users wishes or their intent.\\n00:11:43.770 - 00:12:35.134, Speaker A: Right? Monetization of information, theoretical example covers that quite clearly. And then control over action, takeout information. If we have control over what happens inside of the box, but not outside, if we can keep sensitive information within the box, then we can stock things which we don't want from happening, which we don't want to happen from happening. And I gave a very specific instantiation of the cap in the box. But actually the point I'm trying to make is that we can combine many boxes, we can combine many cats, you can get dogs, you can get triangles, you can get go crazy. My point is that there's a lot we can do with privacy, how information flows and how we can draw things that cryptography and distributed systems have allowed us to do. And we haven't really, I don't think we've explored the full design space.\\n00:12:35.134 - 00:13:02.760, Speaker A: And so it'd be interesting to see what people come up with. Yeah, so that's why I always say it's not if you know, you know, you should ask yourself, what action can I take on what information? And that's pretty much it over time, I think. And so just highlighting a special cause. A lot of homeless cats out there do your best to donate or adopt. Cool. I think that's it. There we go.\\n00:13:03.210 - 00:13:07.558, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. We're still waiting for Danning to join in.\\n00:13:07.564 - 00:13:08.280, Speaker A: Just a.\\n00:13:10.330 - 00:13:18.810, Speaker B: You guess you probably get one or two. One of them that was asked is, how do you control information access here without leaking?\\n00:13:19.790 - 00:13:46.198, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's one very basic example. You could just have a bunch of people submitting scripts which are, like, encode their bids. You take us input the item, you give us output the bid, and now they're running Solar and some trusted party calculates the bids for these people. That's like one way of doing it. A lot of trust assumptions there. And then you can scale up.\\n00:13:46.198 - 00:14:12.400, Speaker A: Like Flash was exploring the SGX route, either via one central SGX. I'm not a Phonographer, I'm not going to talk about the trust assumptions there.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 25\\nsource: 11\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: SoK: Cross-Domain MEV\\nauthors: Conor McMenamin\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04159v1\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-08\\n\\nfunctionality given the existence of cross-domain agents. Actions/intents re-\\nquiring multiple domains can have conditional execution constraints controlled\\nby the user, or delegated cross-domain executors. As users can interact with\\ndirectly with these cross-domain agents, the trust required is significantly less\\n(pairwise economic/social/legal contracts can be established).\\n3.3.3\\nOpen Questions\\nCurrent implementations of single-domain sequencers are centralized. Decen-\\ntralizing the sequencer without degrading performance and usability is an active\\narea of research. However, single-domain sequencers have significantly less tech-\\nnical barriers than shared sequencers, with connectivity and the alignment of\\nincentives simplified in the single domain case. The trade-off here is the ability\\nto execute cross-domain transactions atomically. As discussed above, this may\\nnot be such a big barrier.\\n3.4\\nOrder-flow Auctions\\n3.4.1\\nIdeal Functionality\\nUsers are able to auction their orders/order information among a set of searchers.\\nThe proceeds of these auctions are returned to the user. An ideal cross-domain\\norder-flow auction eliminates both intrinsic and time-extractable value for the\\nuser, assuming the order-flow auctions are indeed revenue maximizing.\\nThe\\nrevenue from such an auction should equal to total extractable value for the\\nextractor.\\nProtocol-level value extraction (against the LPs) still remains. Multi-domain\\norder flow auctions (like the proposed SUAVE protocol) will shift some of the\\nsignal MEV to ordering MEV in a similar fashion to shared sequencers.\\n3.4.2\\nImplementations and Discussion\\nThe heavyweight contender in this domain is the Flashbots-proposed SUAVE\\n(Single Unified Auction for Value Expression) chain [27]. Here, users can post\\ntransactions/intents to be executed across potentially many domains partici-\\npating in the SUAVE domain. The general idea is for searchers (executors in\\nthe SUAVE notation) to compete via an auction to execute these intents, with\\nsome or all of the proceeds from this competition capturable by the user. The\\ncompetition among searchers in SUAVE is intended to be based on partially\\nencrypted transactions, with hints provided by users revealing enough informa-\\ntion to searchers to optimally bundle transactions, while retaining some form of\\npre-execution privacy, and the value that comes with it (extractable value that\\nis not given to the searchers).\\nSearchers bundle transactions for inclusion in the SUAVE chain. The SUAVE\\nchain logic then selects and orders the bundles maximizing the (extractable)\\nvalue of the set of bundles according to the encoded valuation functions of\\n11\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Frontiers in Mechanism Design (Lecture 2: Unit-Demand Bidders and Walrasian Equilibria)\\nchannel_name: Tim Roughgarden Lectures\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xX1z5K5KkM\\nrelease_date: 2014-01-21\\n\\nDo you want this or not. Now, with unit demand bidders here and different goods, at the end of the day, we know a bidder is only going to get one item at most. So we're actually not going to ask it a yes no question. We're going to ask it a richer question.\\n00:16:10.094 - 00:16:57.182, Speaker B: We're going to say, well, given the prices that we've currently set for each of the M items, which one's your favorite? What does favorite mean? Well, it means your net utility for it is the highest, your value for it, minus the price you'd have to pay. And so now a bidder, instead of just contributing one number, it contributes in some sense, one number to one of the goods. Exactly. One of the goods or at most one of the goods. So rather than overall demand, let me just say demand of I a bitter I is going to be it's fave good at the current prices, q. And again, by fave, I mean highest Vij minus QJ. And of course, if all of these are negative, then the bidder says, I don't want any of them at the current prices.\\n00:16:57.182 - 00:17:22.134, Speaker B: So your demand can be the empty set as well. So with that notion of demand, we can start thinking about, does supply equal demand or not? So we look at a good if it's more than one bidder's favorite, then it's over demanded. If there's a good that nobody wants, then it's under demanded. Okay. And so certainly, if you're over demanded, that suggests the price is too low. It suggests maybe you should raise the price. So again, the full description will have to wait till next week.\\n00:17:22.134 - 00:17:59.570, Speaker B: But I wanted you to kind of have in mind what's the general form of the ascending option going to look like. What are we shooting for? So this is sort of how we're thinking it's going to work at a high level. Good. Now it so another goal. In addition to having this kind of description, we want sincere bidding, by which I mean, every time we ask a bidder for its favorite good, it tells us which one is its favorite with respect to its actual valuations, we want sincere bidding.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: SUAVE smart contract programming model: TEE-based smart contracts for block building - Andrew Miller\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhsDFKnHPa0\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-13\\n\\nBut it would be useful if smart contract authors could approve some functions to be done with local simulation. It just gives more flexibility to the Suave app designers to address the natural concerns about tees.\\n00:13:08.802 - 00:13:38.718, Speaker A: Here's some concept of it. The motton Bailey military concept is also an argumentation concept. The military part is like you want to have your people working in the fields where it's sunny and you have all of your crops, but you're spread out. And if you're under attack, then everyone retreats into the fortified thing. But then it's like dank and Musty and you can't work in the field. So you want to be in the Bailey wherever possible and retreat to the Mott when you have to. So there's a sequence or a spectrum of ways of deploying tes.\\n00:13:38.718 - 00:14:11.018, Speaker A: The most aggressive operating point is what Seeker Network does, where anyone at all with a te can join. It can be person in a cloud, it could be a person at home, it could be in a side channels lab. You have no control over who's running them and they have physical access. So it's like the worst case scenario. Any breach here means that people with physical access could exploit even there's lots of breaks on SGX over time. Some of them can be exploited with just software, those are the worst cases. Others can be exploited but require some level of physical access to be able to do so.\\n00:14:11.018 - 00:15:03.370, Speaker A: So in this case any kind of breach would be problematic for your system. Something in between is maybe only approved cloud vendors are eligible to VT kettles running so anyone could have the account. It could be in any country that has one of these clouds, have a data center there but you're relying on the cloud having their own security guards fortified data center and bigger fish to fry. Even if it's lucrative, they're not going to risk embarrassing themselves in front of their juicy cloud enterprise customers just to extract ethereum blocks. Like an additional kind of justification for security and on the very extreme end, which all else equal you would like to be if performance could get there. So maybe in the future you do some multiparty computation threshold fag stuff where you have multiple nodes doing each interaction. If you break any one node you don't get anything.\\n00:15:03.370 - 00:15:46.700, Speaker A: You have to not only break SGX and have physical access, but get more than one of the nodes or plurality of them to be able to do anything about it. So maybe all of these are feasible. Maybe something in the middle is kind of conservative. It depends on how far you want to push it. And maybe even these could be dynamically. Like when a breach notice occurs, maybe you shut off access to physical access kind of nodes and run on reputable cloud only at least for a little while, until patches are way done over.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"retrieved_context\": \"2023-05-26\\n\\n00:00:10.220 - 00:00:53.112, Speaker A: Hello, my name is Uma, and I'm going to be talking about how cross chain Bridging account abstraction, Intense and Suave are related.

I realize, hey, I don't have enough ETH on Arbitrum, but I do have ETH on mainnet. So then I go to the next tab. I'm like, okay, how do I bridge to Arbitrum? I go to the Arbitrum native bridge. I connect my wallet.\\n00:02:13.812 - 00:02:43.824, Speaker A: Then I realize I have to actually connect my wallet to a different network, so I have to switch it. And this is very intentionally painful, so I'm like drawing it out to show you guys the pain. Okay? And then I remember, oh, actually someone said the native Arbitrum bridge is slow. I want the fastest way to bridge because I really want to do my levered long right now.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Auctions, privacy and a cat - Quintus Kilbourn\\nchannel_name: ETHGlobal\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjNmLBdScOI\\nrelease_date: 2023-03-28\\n\\nThey know something that their competitors don't, their competing traders don't. Right. And so I'm running out of time. So just to briefly go over the kind of thing that I covered, here what we can do with information. One is we can select for desirable competition, competition that drives up revenue, but not competition that is detrimental to the users, we users wishes or their intent.\\n00:11:43.770 - 00:12:35.134, Speaker A: Right? Monetization of information, theoretical example covers that quite clearly. And then control over action, takeout information. If we have control over what happens inside of the box, but not outside, if we can keep sensitive information within the box, then we can stock things which we don't want from happening, which we don't want to happen from happening. And I gave a very specific instantiation of the cap in the box. But actually the point I'm trying to make is that we can combine many boxes, we can combine many cats, you can get dogs, you can get triangles, you can get go crazy. My point is that there's a lot we can do with privacy, how information flows and how we can draw things that cryptography and distributed systems have allowed us to do. And we haven't really, I don't think we've explored the full design space.\\n00:12:35.134 - 00:13:02.760, Speaker A: And so it'd be interesting to see what people come up with. Yeah, so that's why I always say it's not if you know, you know, you should ask yourself, what action can I take on what information? And that's pretty much it over time, I think. And so just highlighting a special cause. A lot of homeless cats out there do your best to donate or adopt. Cool. I think that's it. There we go.\\n00:13:03.210 - 00:13:07.558, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. We're still waiting for Danning to join in.\\n00:13:07.564 - 00:13:08.280, Speaker A: Just a.\\n00:13:10.330 - 00:13:18.810, Speaker B: You guess you probably get one or two. One of them that was asked is, how do you control information access here without leaking?\\n00:13:19.790 - 00:13:46.198, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's one very basic example. You could just have a bunch of people submitting scripts which are, like, encode their bids. You take us input the item, you give us output the bid, and now they're running Solar and some trusted party calculates the bids for these people. That's like one way of doing it. A lot of trust assumptions there. And then you can scale up.\\n00:13:46.198 - 00:14:12.400, Speaker A: Like Flash was exploring the SGX route, either via one central SGX. I'm not a Phonographer, I'm not going to talk about the trust assumptions there.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 25\\nsource: 11\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: SoK: Cross-Domain MEV\\nauthors: Conor McMenamin\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04159v1\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-08\\n\\nfunctionality given the existence of cross-domain agents. Actions/intents re-\\nquiring multiple domains can have conditional execution constraints controlled\\nby the user, or delegated cross-domain executors. As users can interact with\\ndirectly with these cross-domain agents, the trust required is significantly less\\n(pairwise economic/social/legal contracts can be established).\\n3.3.3\\nOpen Questions\\nCurrent implementations of single-domain sequencers are centralized. Decen-\\ntralizing the sequencer without degrading performance and usability is an active\\narea of research. However, single-domain sequencers have significantly less tech-\\nnical barriers than shared sequencers, with connectivity and the alignment of\\nincentives simplified in the single domain case. The trade-off here is the ability\\nto execute cross-domain transactions atomically. As discussed above, this may\\nnot be such a big barrier.\\n3.4\\nOrder-flow Auctions\\n3.4.1\\nIdeal Functionality\\nUsers are able to auction their orders/order information among a set of searchers.\\nThe proceeds of these auctions are returned to the user. An ideal cross-domain\\norder-flow auction eliminates both intrinsic and time-extractable value for the\\nuser, assuming the order-flow auctions are indeed revenue maximizing.\\nThe\\nrevenue from such an auction should equal to total extractable value for the\\nextractor.\\nProtocol-level value extraction (against the LPs) still remains. Multi-domain\\norder flow auctions (like the proposed SUAVE protocol) will shift some of the\\nsignal MEV to ordering MEV in a similar fashion to shared sequencers.\\n3.4.2\\nImplementations and Discussion\\nThe heavyweight contender in this domain is the Flashbots-proposed SUAVE\\n(Single Unified Auction for Value Expression) chain [27]. Here, users can post\\ntransactions/intents to be executed across potentially many domains partici-\\npating in the SUAVE domain. The general idea is for searchers (executors in\\nthe SUAVE notation) to compete via an auction to execute these intents, with\\nsome or all of the proceeds from this competition capturable by the user. The\\ncompetition among searchers in SUAVE is intended to be based on partially\\nencrypted transactions, with hints provided by users revealing enough informa-\\ntion to searchers to optimally bundle transactions, while retaining some form of\\npre-execution privacy, and the value that comes with it (extractable value that\\nis not given to the searchers).\\nSearchers bundle transactions for inclusion in the SUAVE chain. The SUAVE\\nchain logic then selects and orders the bundles maximizing the (extractable)\\nvalue of the set of bundles according to the encoded valuation functions of\\n11\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Frontiers in Mechanism Design (Lecture 2: Unit-Demand Bidders and Walrasian Equilibria)\\nchannel_name: Tim Roughgarden Lectures\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xX1z5K5KkM\\nrelease_date: 2014-01-21\\n\\nDo you want this or not. Now, with unit demand bidders here and different goods, at the end of the day, we know a bidder is only going to get one item at most. So we're actually not going to ask it a yes no question. We're going to ask it a richer question.\\n00:16:10.094 - 00:16:57.182, Speaker B: We're going to say, well, given the prices that we've currently set for each of the M items, which one's your favorite? What does favorite mean? Well, it means your net utility for it is the highest, your value for it, minus the price you'd have to pay. And so now a bidder, instead of just contributing one number, it contributes in some sense, one number to one of the goods. Exactly. One of the goods or at most one of the goods. So rather than overall demand, let me just say demand of I a bitter I is going to be it's fave good at the current prices, q. And again, by fave, I mean highest Vij minus QJ. And of course, if all of these are negative, then the bidder says, I don't want any of them at the current prices.\\n00:16:57.182 - 00:17:22.134, Speaker B: So your demand can be the empty set as well. So with that notion of demand, we can start thinking about, does supply equal demand or not? So we look at a good if it's more than one bidder's favorite, then it's over demanded. If there's a good that nobody wants, then it's under demanded. Okay. And so certainly, if you're over demanded, that suggests the price is too low. It suggests maybe you should raise the price. So again, the full description will have to wait till next week.\\n00:17:22.134 - 00:17:59.570, Speaker B: But I wanted you to kind of have in mind what's the general form of the ascending option going to look like. What are we shooting for? So this is sort of how we're thinking it's going to work at a high level. Good. Now it so another goal. In addition to having this kind of description, we want sincere bidding, by which I mean, every time we ask a bidder for its favorite good, it tells us which one is its favorite with respect to its actual valuations, we want sincere bidding.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: SUAVE smart contract programming model: TEE-based smart contracts for block building - Andrew Miller\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhsDFKnHPa0\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-13\\n\\nBut it would be useful if smart contract authors could approve some functions to be done with local simulation. It just gives more flexibility to the Suave app designers to address the natural concerns about tees.\\n00:13:08.802 - 00:13:38.718, Speaker A: Here's some concept of it. The motton Bailey military concept is also an argumentation concept. The military part is like you want to have your people working in the fields where it's sunny and you have all of your crops, but you're spread out. And if you're under attack, then everyone retreats into the fortified thing. But then it's like dank and Musty and you can't work in the field. So you want to be in the Bailey wherever possible and retreat to the Mott when you have to. So there's a sequence or a spectrum of ways of deploying tes.\\n00:13:38.718 - 00:14:11.018, Speaker A: The most aggressive operating point is what Seeker Network does, where anyone at all with a te can join. It can be person in a cloud, it could be a person at home, it could be in a side channels lab. You have no control over who's running them and they have physical access. So it's like the worst case scenario. Any breach here means that people with physical access could exploit even there's lots of breaks on SGX over time. Some of them can be exploited with just software, those are the worst cases. Others can be exploited but require some level of physical access to be able to do so.\\n00:14:11.018 - 00:15:03.370, Speaker A: So in this case any kind of breach would be problematic for your system. Something in between is maybe only approved cloud vendors are eligible to VT kettles running so anyone could have the account. It could be in any country that has one of these clouds, have a data center there but you're relying on the cloud having their own security guards fortified data center and bigger fish to fry. Even if it's lucrative, they're not going to risk embarrassing themselves in front of their juicy cloud enterprise customers just to extract ethereum blocks. Like an additional kind of justification for security and on the very extreme end, which all else equal you would like to be if performance could get there. So maybe in the future you do some multiparty computation threshold fag stuff where you have multiple nodes doing each interaction. If you break any one node you don't get anything.\\n00:15:03.370 - 00:15:46.700, Speaker A: You have to not only break SGX and have physical access, but get more than one of the nodes or plurality of them to be able to do anything about it. So maybe all of these are feasible. Maybe something in the middle is kind of conservative. It depends on how far you want to push it. And maybe even these could be dynamically. Like when a breach notice occurs, maybe you shut off access to physical access kind of nodes and run on reputable cloud only at least for a little while, until patches are way done over.\",\n                \"previous_answer\": \"SUAVE is a concept that is mentioned in the provided context information.

We first define a broad class of benchmark strategies: the only restrictions we impose on\\nthese strategies are that they begin holding the same position in the risky asset as the CFMM, and\\nthat they adjust holdings at CEX prices. Specifically, we define a benchmark as a self-financing\\ntrading strategy, described by a position \\u00afxt in the risky asset. We assume that initial holdings\\nmatch the pool, i.e., (\\u00afx0, \\u00afy0) \\u225c\\n\\ufffdx\\u2217(P0), y\\u2217(P0)\\n\\ufffd.

The first part is an immediate corollary of Theorem 1 and (5). The second part follows\\nfrom the It\\u00f4 isometry.\\n\\u25a0\\nThere are two ways to interpret Corollary 1. On the one hand, in (20), the expected value\\nof \\u2206(\\u00afx)t is always 0 under the risk-neutral measure. Thus, the risk-neutral expectation of LVB is\\nthe same for any choice of benchmark, including LVR and the HODL benchmark. This is because\\nCFMM LP losses arise from trading at off-market prices: any benchmark which trades at market\\nprices, in expectation, does equally well under the risk-neutral measure, and thus the gap between\\nany market benchmark and LVR is equal in expectation. In this sense, the expected losses of CFMM\\nLPs appear invariant to the particular choice of market-based benchmark.\\nOn the other hand, LVR is the unique choice of benchmark which eliminates differences in\\nperformance between the CFMM and the benchmark strategy due to market risk, and isolating\\nlosses due to price slippage.\\nAll benchmarks outperform the CFMM LP position by the same\\namount in expectation; however, on any given price path Pt, any given benchmark may over- or\\nunder-perform to the CFMM LP position, because the benchmark may adopt different holding\\nstrategies for the risky asset from the CFMM. As an example, we showed in Section 5 that the\\nCFMM LP position underperforms a benchmark which sells all ETH and holds \\u00afxt = 0 throughout,\\nbecause of the fact that the CFMM LP holds a larger ETH position and ETH prices dropped\\nover the time horizon we analyze, implying the misleading conclusion that the CFMM LP position\\nunderperformed a market-based benchmark.\\nThe LVR benchmark is useful because the rebalancing strategy exactly matches the risky asset\\nholdings of the CFMM, removing differences in market risk exposure and isolates losses due to\\nslippage. Theorem 1 showed that LVR is a strictly increasing process: it is always positive, regardless\\nof the path prices take. Expression (21) thus shows that the rebalancing strategy is the unique choice\\nof benchmark which minimizes the quadratic variation of the loss process: that is, any other choice\\nof benchmark can be thought of as LVR, plus a noise term which has mean 0 under risk-neutral\\nmeasure, caused by differences in market risk exposures.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 44\\nsource: 20\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Automated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\\nauthors: Jason Milionis, Ciamac C.

We first define a broad class of benchmark strategies: the only restrictions we impose on\\nthese strategies are that they begin holding the same position in the risky asset as the CFMM, and\\nthat they adjust holdings at CEX prices. Specifically, we define a benchmark as a self-financing\\ntrading strategy, described by a position \\u00afxt in the risky asset. We assume that initial holdings\\nmatch the pool, i.e., (\\u00afx0, \\u00afy0) \\u225c\\n\\ufffdx\\u2217(P0), y\\u2217(P0)\\n\\ufffd. We assume that \\u00afxt satisfies the square-integrability\\ncondition (3), so that the resulting trading strategy is admissible.

The first part is an immediate corollary of Theorem 1 and (5). The second part follows\\nfrom the It\\u00f4 isometry.\\n\\u25a0\\nThere are two ways to interpret Corollary 1. On the one hand, in (20), the expected value\\nof \\u2206(\\u00afx)t is always 0 under the risk-neutral measure. Thus, the risk-neutral expectation of LVB is\\nthe same for any choice of benchmark, including LVR and the HODL benchmark. This is because\\nCFMM LP losses arise from trading at off-market prices: any benchmark which trades at market\\nprices, in expectation, does equally well under the risk-neutral measure, and thus the gap between\\nany market benchmark and LVR is equal in expectation. In this sense, the expected losses of CFMM\\nLPs appear invariant to the particular choice of market-based benchmark.\\nOn the other hand, LVR is the unique choice of benchmark which eliminates differences in\\nperformance between the CFMM and the benchmark strategy due to market risk, and isolating\\nlosses due to price slippage.\\nAll benchmarks outperform the CFMM LP position by the same\\namount in expectation; however, on any given price path Pt, any given benchmark may over- or\\nunder-perform to the CFMM LP position, because the benchmark may adopt different holding\\nstrategies for the risky asset from the CFMM. As an example, we showed in Section 5 that the\\nCFMM LP position underperforms a benchmark which sells all ETH and holds \\u00afxt = 0 throughout,\\nbecause of the fact that the CFMM LP holds a larger ETH position and ETH prices dropped\\nover the time horizon we analyze, implying the misleading conclusion that the CFMM LP position\\nunderperformed a market-based benchmark.\\nThe LVR benchmark is useful because the rebalancing strategy exactly matches the risky asset\\nholdings of the CFMM, removing differences in market risk exposure and isolates losses due to\\nslippage. Theorem 1 showed that LVR is a strictly increasing process: it is always positive, regardless\\nof the path prices take. Expression (21) thus shows that the rebalancing strategy is the unique choice\\nof benchmark which minimizes the quadratic variation of the loss process: that is, any other choice\\nof benchmark can be thought of as LVR, plus a noise term which has mean 0 under risk-neutral\\nmeasure, caused by differences in market risk exposures.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 44\\nsource: 20\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Automated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\\nauthors: Jason Milionis, Ciamac C.

We measure the profits of the rebalancing strategy simply by rebalancing to match\\nthe CFMM LP holdings at a number of different discrete time frequencies. For example, suppose we\\nrebalance each minute, and suppose we observe that the CFMM LP position holds 10,000 ETH at\\n12:01am on January 1st, 2022. The rebalancing strategy then holds 10,000 ETH at 12:01am, so the\\nP&L of the rebalancing strategy from 12:01am to 12:02am is simply 10, 000 (P12:02am \\u2212 P12:01am),\\nthe amount of ETH held times the change in ETH prices over the next minute.

The first term on the right side corresponds to trading fees, which are observable.\\nThe second term is LVR, which we can measure as a function of realized volatility using expressions\\n(7) and (8) of Theorem 1. In this way, the degree to which the right side of (17) is close to the left\\nside measures the effectiveness of LVR in quantifying LP returns.\\nWe bring the model to data using the WETH-USDC trading pair13 on Uniswap v2 for the period\\nfrom August 1, 2021 to July 31, 2022. Details of the data sources we use, and how we measure\\nvarious quantities, are described in Appendix C. Essentially, to measure the left side of (17), we\\nmeasure the P&L of an LP position simply as the mark-to-market value of pool reserves, periodically\\nvaluing \\u201cmints\\u201d and \\u201cburns\\u201d \\u2014 that is, tokens withdrawn or deposited from the LP position \\u2014 at\\nmarket prices. We measure the profits of the rebalancing strategy simply by rebalancing to match\\nthe CFMM LP holdings at a number of different discrete time frequencies. For example, suppose we\\nrebalance each minute, and suppose we observe that the CFMM LP position holds 10,000 ETH at\\n12:01am on January 1st, 2022. The rebalancing strategy then holds 10,000 ETH at 12:01am, so the\\nP&L of the rebalancing strategy from 12:01am to 12:02am is simply 10, 000 (P12:02am \\u2212 P12:01am),\\nthe amount of ETH held times the change in ETH prices over the next minute. In general, if the\\nrebalancing strategy holds xRB\\nt\\nof the risky asset at time t until time t + \\u2206t, then \\u2206RB P&Lt, the\\nrebalancing strategy\\u2019s net profit from period t to t + \\u2206t, is:\\n\\u2206RB P&Lt = xRB\\nt\\n(Pt+\\u2206t \\u2212 Pt) .\\n(18)\\nExpression (18) is the discrete-time analog of the envelope formula expression, (5), for the returns\\non any strategy which trades at market prices.

Hi, I'm Vlad Zenfir. I'm a troll, but everything I say you should take as a serious test. However, I think what intents are and what your intents are is like forbidden knowledge. That's like forbidden for very good reason. It's banned to your subconscious. You can't even know about it.\\n00:02:43.054 - 00:02:58.814, Speaker C: And that's for your own safety because if you did, other people would use it in disputes against you to wreck you. So your intents. You don't know them. No one knows what intents are. They're secret. They're forbidden to know for everyone's safety. Then when you say about intents, what you're talking about is your conscious intents.\\n00:02:58.814 - 00:03:27.466, Speaker C: And those are the things that you willingly let up for the purposes of disputes for other people to use against you in this dance, that is the law. And so intents are what we call conscious. What we call intents are conscious intents that we're willingly putting up in order to make it fair game for people to extract as much value from us as they can out of our insecurity. And that's just fair. That's just so. Will I tell you my intents? No. That would be insecure.\\n00:03:27.466 - 00:03:33.380, Speaker C: And I wouldn't make my insecurity your insecurity. And that's like my basic duty. Thank you.\\n00:03:36.230 - 00:04:05.366, Speaker E: Okay. Hi, I'm Philip. I work with trendy squares. We are doing economic auditing and for that purpose we have developed internal tooling that together. Now with the Ethereum Foundation we are basically developing a modeling framework that you can use intents fit in. Because that framework, the main purpose of it is actually looking at the intersection and the kind of the connections between different mechanisms and different models. And intents, when they come as an input, basically will affect the value chain.\\n00:04:05.366 - 00:04:16.240, Speaker E: And the question is, how does it spread through? What are the economics of intents coming about? What tendency of centralization will come about through them? And what will be possible higher order effects? Thanks.\\n00:04:18.210 - 00:04:47.922, Speaker F: I'm Marcus, founder of Propeller Heads. And we are solvers. And we solve intents. And intents are a simple way to think about it. The way I think about it is that they are partial transactions where I might not know all the things I need to know to be able to form a transaction. Like, I don't know the best path for my swap, I don't know the best time to execute.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Realizing Intents with a Resource Model - Christopher Goes\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nh4EOpvKMY\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-27\\n\\nThere's just no one true answer. I'm not going to try and give the one true holy answer to what is an intent.\\n00:02:23.186 - 00:02:47.706, Speaker A: This is kind of our answer to how can intents be represented? And it's an answer that we think satisfies design criteria that many of these projects may actually share. So we think it's interesting for this audience. So this talk was inspired by basically a tweet and a meme. I would like to give credit. So the Tweet. Thank you. Andrew Miller, who I haven't seen here, but maybe he will somehow see this later.\\n00:02:47.706 - 00:03:26.026, Speaker A: Intents and transactions aren't really let's fight. Well, I mean, if you squint really hard, intense transactions, there's like some data, you send it to the distributed system, like something happens. But I think that's like squinting slightly too hard, and I'll get into why oh, you can't see this. Well, anyway, this one thanks, Sheen from Flashbots for this meme. So I don't even know what this meme is called, but Vlad CT 43 37 crowd anoma, they have no idea tests or higher or commitments with extensive literature defining its semantics. Well, yes. No.\\n00:03:26.026 - 00:04:10.226, Speaker A: So, interestingly, the extensive literature is filled with what are called folk theorems I E, where people seem to all know something, but it took a while for someone to write it down. And I think intents are kind of in fact, they're kind of the same thing from the research literature also have this folk theorem property. You see stuff like account abstraction and these kind of user gas payment systems kind of approaching the concept of an intent, but in this domain specific way. So this talk is about a kind of general intent centric VM. And let me clarify a little bit what I mean by VM, because that word is used to refer to many things which I think are not really in the same category. So, a long time ago that people were building computers, and they wanted those computers to execute programs. And those computers had hardware constraints.\\n00:04:10.226 - 00:04:29.626, Speaker A: They had like a processing unit. They had some instructions that processing unit could execute. They had some kind of various levels of memory at different speed to sort of durability trade offs. They had registers in a stack. They had volatile memory, slightly less fast volatile, and they had non volatile storage. And they wanted to run programs. I mean, very reasonable.\\n00:04:29.626 - 00:04:43.614, Speaker A: This is like 1960. No one's thinking about mev. They wanted to execute programs sequentially. So if you go on the Wikipedia page, it's where I got it from. Not going to make up my own diagram. And look at von Neumann architectures. You'll see something like this diagram.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\nAnd intents are a simple way to think about it. The way I think about it is that they are partial transactions where I might not know all the things I need to know to be able to form a transaction. Like, I don't know the best path for my swap, I don't know the best time to execute. I don't know when price or gas will be low enough.\\n00:04:47.922 - 00:05:29.254, Speaker F: So I still want to though, execute that intent and publish it so someone else who might know this information can help me out. And that is really what enables intents to allow me to express a lot more than I can do today. Because at the moment, I'm limited to the things that I can fully express. But with intense, I can express things partially and anybody can help me now or in the future to find that missing part. And I agree with Vlad that there is a differentiation between conscious and unconscious intents and expressed and non expressed intents. And I think we can explore that further later.\\n00:05:29.372 - 00:05:50.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to also explore how our intents different from the current set of transaction types we already have. So we have the normal transaction type. We have sign messages. We have these type of off chain trusted transaction types such as bundles. How are intents different than what we already have? And what new feature sets do they bring to the picture?\\n00:05:50.990 - 00:06:58.718, Speaker B: You can go yeah, I mean, I think intents in a certain sense are purposefully less specific than transactions. They define what it would count for what it would count for in order for a state transition to be correct without defining exactly how to get there. Right? So on purpose they leave freedom to if we think about the data flow of everything, right, users have intents and users are at the edge of the system, right? They set the boundary conditions and then the information flows inward. And intents allow you to describe exactly how much choice you want to give up and to whom and what choices they can make because that information flows inward potentially to optimize things. And kind of the landscape of mev often when you have entities with different preferences they're using that to extract from you because they have more information at the time they make the decision. Right? So intents kind of allow you to program exactly how much you want to specify about what can build on top of your message, consume your intent. And in that sense you can see these things sort of converging towards one another like smart transactions or partial transactions or these are sort of modifications to the concept of transactions that I think converge towards intents.\\n00:06:58.718 - 00:07:23.210, Speaker B: On the other hand, I think it's helpful to think about just the term intent to me conveys this very intuitive thing to people like about oh, well, someone starts with an intent and then they write down their intent, right?\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Realizing Intents with a Resource Model - Christopher Goes\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nh4EOpvKMY\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-27\\n\\nI think this is harder, actually, but you definitely are an OG if you recognize this quote, I'll tell you at the end of the talk. And my answer is, yes, you can emulate the thing which I'm talking about upon the EVM. I think that's great.\\n00:06:53.834 - 00:07:37.094, Speaker A: But the question I'm interested in is, like, what does the execution environment look like for intents? And how you kind of emulate that as a sort of interesting from a performance standpoint, but kind of separate question. Like, you could also emulate it on some other non EVM von Neumann machine, and nothing would change that much. So I want to go just to kind of go back a little bit into the research literature, just to add another answer to the question of what is an intent? This meme is my own. Unfortunately, you can't see the bottom, but it says intents are cybernetic commitments to the future human l synthesis, something like that. It doesn't matter, because I'm not going to talk about that. I'm mostly going to talk about the third thing. So what are intents? Intents are just transactions.\\n00:07:37.094 - 00:08:02.370, Speaker A: Intents are binding conditional commitments from 50 year old game theory. Right? So here's the 50 year old game theory. The first kind of folk theorem to be written down by Friedman in 1971 was this equilibrium for supergames and supergames. I'm I'm very sad that that term has kind of gone out of fashion. I think it's a more fun term than, like, repeated games. supergames. Who doesn't want to play the super game.\\n00:08:02.370 - 00:08:28.666, Speaker A: It's like the infinite supergame. Anyway, the result established in this paper was just that repeated interaction can result in any feasible individually rational payoff. And then a bunch of recent work, I'm just going to cite one. There are like 15 papers that talk probably more, I just haven't read them. But that talk about different variants of this idea is program equilibria. I think this paper is particularly clear, so I recommend it. And the idea of program equilibria is basically that you can achieve this same result.\\n00:08:28.666 - 00:09:23.258, Speaker A: You can get any feasible individually rational payoff. If you have users, instead of just taking actions themselves, use what are called commitment devices or use programs and commit themselves to a strategy. And because this provides like a credible guarantee of how users will act, then you could do stuff like this in the Prisoner's Dilemma if my program is the same as the other player's program, then cooperate. Else defect seems like very straightforward, right? So program equilibria, I think are what you might call the closest near term or relatively recent research basis for intents. And I think the research literature here at least like I'll talk in just a SEC about what I think we need to change.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\n00:11:12.950 - 00:11:47.360, Speaker E: Okay. I think there is a point where we can actually agree, even if the language might be different, but there's the question of what is the language average users, normal users, not knowing much, will actually face intents. And at the moment we are talking, when we see examples of that, they are typically relatively low level. I'm not sure users will care about this. So there is the question of what will be basically the stack of translations in between. Not only the stacks, there will also be the question of what services need to be provided to make it useful. There's the question also, does this lead to centralization? And obviously also and that I think, ties back to what Flood said.\\n00:11:47.360 - 00:12:07.160, Speaker E: Do you lose actually total control about what happens to what you state? And how do you make sure that this is actually coming back at some level? How is this any kind transparent? These things have to be solved, and I'm not sure how they will actually be. There are some ideas out there, but it needs a lot of modeling. A lot of details are super relevant here. Basically.\\n00:12:10.410 - 00:12:16.840, Speaker F: Coming back sort of the original question, what will intents allow us to do that we can't do today?\\n00:12:23.170 - 00:12:33.200, Speaker C: Don't let me get me wrong. I love lazy evaluation. Like, lazy evaluation is great, like partial specifications, lazy evaluation is the best. Don't get me wrong. Sorry.\\n00:12:34.370 - 00:12:35.790, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead, Michael.\\n00:12:37.030 - 00:13:03.098, Speaker F: So I think there's a lot of spaces that you can go into. I think starting with a simple example of what intents allow us to do already today. I think Kaoso is a really good example where you submit an intent for a transaction, but there's a lot of unseen information. There might be others trading in the other direction, and you can have a coincidence want. There might be many others trading same direction. Can batch and benefit from that. All of that would be impossible for you to know ahead of time.\\n00:13:03.098 - 00:14:00.090, Speaker F: And also intents allow for much more complex coordination that is very difficult to express in current UIs. So you have a massive bottleneck blockchains are these wonderful programmable systems where you could actually\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\n00:02:21.610 - 00:02:43.054, Speaker C: Testing, testing. Hi, I'm Vlad Zenfir. I'm a troll, but everything I say you should take as a serious test. However, I think what intents are and what your intents are is like forbidden knowledge. That's like forbidden for very good reason. It's banned to your subconscious. You can't even know about it.\\n00:02:43.054 - 00:02:58.814, Speaker C: And that's for your own safety because if you did, other people would use it in disputes against you to wreck you. So your intents. You don't know them. No one knows what intents are. They're secret. They're forbidden to know for everyone's safety. Then when you say about intents, what you're talking about is your conscious intents.\\n00:02:58.814 - 00:03:27.466, Speaker C: And those are the things that you willingly let up for the purposes of disputes for other people to use against you in this dance, that is the law. And so intents are what we call conscious. What we call intents are conscious intents that we're willingly putting up in order to make it fair game for people to extract as much value from us as they can out of our insecurity. And that's just fair. That's just so. Will I tell you my intents? No. That would be insecure.\\n00:03:27.466 - 00:03:33.380, Speaker C: And I wouldn't make my insecurity your insecurity. And that's like my basic duty. Thank you.\\n00:03:36.230 - 00:04:05.366, Speaker E: Okay. Hi, I'm Philip. I work with trendy squares. We are doing economic auditing and for that purpose we have developed internal tooling that together. Now with the Ethereum Foundation we are basically developing a modeling framework that you can use intents fit in. Because that framework, the main purpose of it is actually looking at the intersection and the kind of the connections between different mechanisms and different models. And intents, when they come as an input, basically will affect the value chain.\\n00:04:05.366 - 00:04:16.240, Speaker E: And the question is, how does it spread through? What are the economics of intents coming about? What tendency of centralization will come about through them? And what will be possible higher order effects? Thanks.\\n00:04:18.210 - 00:04:47.922, Speaker F: I'm Marcus, founder of Propeller Heads. And we are solvers. And we solve intents. And intents are a simple way to think about it. The way I think about it is that they are partial transactions where I might not know all the things I need to know to be able to form a transaction. Like, I don't know the best path for my swap, I don't know the best time to execute.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Realizing Intents with a Resource Model - Christopher Goes\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nh4EOpvKMY\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-27\\n\\nThere's just no one true answer. I'm not going to try and give the one true holy answer to what is an intent.\\n00:02:23.186 - 00:02:47.706, Speaker A: This is kind of our answer to how can intents be represented? And it's an answer that we think satisfies design criteria that many of these projects may actually share. So we think it's interesting for this audience. So this talk was inspired by basically a tweet and a meme. I would like to give credit. So the Tweet. Thank you. Andrew Miller, who I haven't seen here, but maybe he will somehow see this later.\\n00:02:47.706 - 00:03:26.026, Speaker A: Intents and transactions aren't really let's fight. Well, I mean, if you squint really hard, intense transactions, there's like some data, you send it to the distributed system, like something happens. But I think that's like squinting slightly too hard, and I'll get into why oh, you can't see this. Well, anyway, this one thanks, Sheen from Flashbots for this meme. So I don't even know what this meme is called, but Vlad CT 43 37 crowd anoma, they have no idea tests or higher or commitments with extensive literature defining its semantics. Well, yes. No.\\n00:03:26.026 - 00:04:10.226, Speaker A: So, interestingly, the extensive literature is filled with what are called folk theorems I E, where people seem to all know something, but it took a while for someone to write it down. And I think intents are kind of in fact, they're kind of the same thing from the research literature also have this folk theorem property. You see stuff like account abstraction and these kind of user gas payment systems kind of approaching the concept of an intent, but in this domain specific way. So this talk is about a kind of general intent centric VM. And let me clarify a little bit what I mean by VM, because that word is used to refer to many things which I think are not really in the same category. So, a long time ago that people were building computers, and they wanted those computers to execute programs. And those computers had hardware constraints.\\n00:04:10.226 - 00:04:29.626, Speaker A: They had like a processing unit. They had some instructions that processing unit could execute. They had some kind of various levels of memory at different speed to sort of durability trade offs. They had registers in a stack. They had volatile memory, slightly less fast volatile, and they had non volatile storage. And they wanted to run programs. I mean, very reasonable.\\n00:04:29.626 - 00:04:43.614, Speaker A: This is like 1960. No one's thinking about mev. They wanted to execute programs sequentially. So if you go on the Wikipedia page, it's where I got it from. Not going to make up my own diagram. And look at von Neumann architectures. You'll see something like this diagram.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\nAnd intents are a simple way to think about it.

But intense, I think it can move much faster than the UIs will be able to move. And that will allow you to express much more complex transaction types. For example, multiparty coordination where you have different level actors that agree together to make a particular transaction happen.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\n00:00:01.210 - 00:00:24.670, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Welcome to the last panel of this session about intents. Every week there's a new Twitter thread about intents. Still, there's one in my drafts as well. Still we do not know what intents are and what they are used for. So let's kind of explore in this panel. I would like from the panel to basically go by order, introduce themselves and just define or explain to the audience what do they mean by intents.\\n00:00:24.670 - 00:00:27.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Christopher, if you can go forward.\\n00:00:28.970 - 00:01:19.654, Speaker B: Thanks. I'm Chris, I work on Enoma, which is sort of an intent centric architecture as we understand it to us. Or I mean, I think the sense in which language, of course, is this decentralized coordination system and no one gets to pick the one true definition of intent. I think the sense in which we've seen intent as a coordinating concept so far is as something like an intent is a credible commitment to a preference function over the state of a particular system and the system in question can be defined very differently. So when you define the system as like the ethereum main chain, then you could have intents referencing state on the ethereum main chain. When you define the system as like the whole sort of roll up ecosystem, then your intent could reference any state on a roll up. When you define the system as know, I don't know what Google has indexed, then your intent is something you type in Google search bar and searches over whatever is know to us.\\n00:01:19.654 - 00:01:30.860, Speaker B: Intents also include information about who knows what. So information flow control. This is what we spent a lot of time working on and we hope to be able to kind of provide that to the ecosystem at large.\\n00:01:32.910 - 00:01:33.274, Speaker C: Yeah.\\n00:01:33.312 - 00:02:16.710, Speaker D: So I'm Simon, CTO at Central. So when we think about intents, I guess a user sits down to interact with a blockchain with an idea of what it is that they want to accomplish and they're then expected to approximate the execution trace that is going to lead to what they want. And the reason that mev exists and that you're all here is that there is a gap between those two things. So it just makes good sense if there's a mechanism for the user to express what it is they want to achieve directly and then repurpose the searcher network as a solver network to achieve that. So yeah, at essential, I guess we want to accelerate that transition from sort of value extraction to intent satisfaction.\\n00:02:21.610 - 00:02:43.054, Speaker C: Testing, testing. Hi, I'm Vlad Zenfir. I'm a troll, but everything I say you should take as a serious test.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\nIt gets closer to the invariance. You need to insist so that you can make the tests that you can do to test the faith and the performance and the security of your adversaries. We're going to pen test each other. It's not like you're going to know my intent when I'm pen testing you.\\n00:09:39.030 - 00:10:02.954, Speaker C: You don't know my intent. I promise you that I don't know my intent. And you accept this as zero launch proof that you will never know my intent because this is sort of like how, in my opinion, actually secure transacting game theory response works. You're never going to have a deterministic invariant of the outcome. You have a deterministic invariance. They're not your intent. They're just how the test works.\\n00:10:02.954 - 00:10:19.220, Speaker C: And then it's a test. What is the intent of a test? What my intent when I sit on the bridge all day and I throw bait on the bridge to see who eats my troll bait? You must imagine Sisyphus happy and you must imagine me happy while I do that.\\n00:10:19.670 - 00:10:25.418, Speaker B: But don't you already have this, like, your intent? I mean, your real world intent is out in the not. You know, who cares?\\n00:10:25.614 - 00:10:32.600, Speaker C: It's banished from my conscious mind. It's banished from the hive mind. It's not there at all. It's fucking banished from the world. It's too.\\n00:10:37.530 - 00:10:38.994, Speaker A: Let'S have let's have an audience.\\n00:10:39.042 - 00:10:58.750, Speaker C: Question is your opinion, Vlad, that the best way to express an intent essentially is provide a proof that your intent has been met. No one knows your intent, but they just have, like a the best way to express an intent is repenting in front of the Lord at judgment day. That's the best way and the only way. Everything else is bullshit.\\n00:11:03.570 - 00:11:07.874, Speaker A: So so do you think that intents are a wrong way forward? Is that what you think?\\n00:11:07.912 - 00:11:09.986, Speaker C: No, they're there for us to extract mev out of.\\n00:11:10.008 - 00:11:11.540, Speaker A: You got it.\\n00:11:12.950 - 00:11:47.360, Speaker E: Okay. I think there is a point where we can actually agree, even if the language might be different, but there's the question of what is the language average users, normal users, not knowing much, will actually face intents.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\nBut intense, I think it can move much faster than the UIs will be able to move. And that will allow you to express much more complex transaction types. For example, multiparty coordination where you have different level actors that agree together to make a particular transaction happen. That only is valid when five different parties actually agree on that. And it's very difficult to design UIs with this kind of thing, but on an intent layer, it's much more realistic.\\n00:14:00.670 - 00:14:34.360, Speaker C: But why not invariant? Like, if you just said invariant, you would have no problem with me and you wouldn't have put yourself in this position where I'm going to extract mev from your intents bro just call them invariants. If you call them intents in agreements, like legally, you're going to get yourself in lawsuits and Torts and you'll be liable. Just call them invariance invalidation. Use computer science terms, don't get yourself liable. Pay attention when the law professor claps. You know what I mean?\\n00:14:36.810 - 00:14:39.210, Speaker A: Are there any audience questions till now?\\n00:14:39.360 - 00:14:43.354, Speaker B: I mean, is language bound by law or is law bound by language which.\\n00:14:43.392 - 00:14:48.810, Speaker C: Expresses which I mean language is the medium of legal argument.\\n00:14:49.570 - 00:14:54.286, Speaker B: Exactly. Which means that if we change the definitions of the concepts, the laws say different things.\\n00:14:54.468 - 00:14:58.030, Speaker C: I mean, I'm going to dispute your definitions, bro. Like good luck.\\n00:15:01.250 - 00:15:31.946, Speaker A: Let'S revert back to yeah, let's revert back. Maybe Fabrizio has a question. Okay, so it's clear to me that up to now, given what we heard, basically no one has any fucking clue what attempts are. I just wanted to know at least do you have any idea about what mathematical instruments would you like to use to study them or to even attempt to give a decent definition or it's just like magic. Maybe Philip. Maybe Philip, yeah.\\n00:15:31.968 - 00:16:16.614, Speaker E: So I mean, you know, I'm old enough, maybe sounds stupid but these problems of intents, you can call it differently. They happen also in other domains. So the question is, for instance, if you think about combinatorial auctions, same problem, very complex biding language needed. So you need interfaces to actually specify what exactly you want to do. The main question or the main approach there basically is to define what is needed from the allocation perspective. Here it would be basically what happens as a transaction on the higher level is the question of what attributes do the user actually care about?\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Intents, Suave, and Off-Chain Auction Infrastructure - Dan Marzec @Flashbots | MEV DAY\\nchannel_name: SevenX Ventures\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIvHVvjwhAs\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-03\\n\\nYou just specify this entire space as a set of constraints, and anyone can satisfy those constraints. And so that's like a single person intent right. For a single token. But a lot of intent infrastructure or solver networks, what they do is they take this and then they combine it with a bunch of other people's intents right. All in this one little box. So, yeah, I think the Intent infrastructure starter pack, it's like an ability to aggregate all of these sets of constraints into one cohesive unit.\\n00:04:40.070 - 00:05:03.760, Speaker A: And then yeah, you sprinkle in some crypto like DKG, perhaps you encrypt your set of constraints to, I don't know, some public key that the network creates and rotates around. I think, like, Furbio is an example of this DKG infrastructure on, I think, Osmosis. It's live right now.\\n00:05:04.930 - 00:05:05.246, Speaker B: Yeah.\\n00:05:05.268 - 00:05:23.890, Speaker A: And then decentralization of compute and storage. We don't really get anywhere. If you just encrypt your intent constraint into my phone, that's not really the goal here. We want a marketplace of solvers competing for different execution on different constraints.\\n00:05:25.190 - 00:05:25.566, Speaker B: Yeah.\\n00:05:25.608 - 00:06:05.854, Speaker A: So that's what I would view as the bare necessity. And how you actually encode these constraints into a way that a user can specify, I think, is where all of the intent work is. So if anyone's working on intents would love to talk about that. But yeah, again, the language you specify to your user is going to determine the constraints that they create. I think there's a really big argument as well that users don't know what they want. So a really good example, I think, is like Google Flights. If anyone's used that I use that to book here, I sort of say where I want to end up in a date.\\n00:06:05.854 - 00:06:51.694, Speaker A: And you could imagine that as constraints. And then it sort of comes to a bunch of solutions. For me, what's interesting is the Google Flight search. What they'll do is they'll actually show you the cheapest, and then after that, I believe they show you the yeah, they show the cheapest first, and then after that they show you the shortest flight and the cheapest, and then I think they have some other priority ranking for what they show you. So I think there's a lot of room for platforms to choose these preferences for the users because I don't really want to think about what my ordering of preferences are. Typically, 99% of the cases, the cheapest one is what I want to go with, and then, oh, maybe it's 20 hours versus ten. Like, all right, cool.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link:\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"retrieved_context\": \"I'm not sure how they will actually be. There are some ideas out there, but it needs a lot of modeling. A lot of details are super relevant here. Basically.\\n00:12:10.410 - 00:12:16.840, Speaker F: Coming back sort of the original question, what will intents allow us to do that we can't do today?\\n00:12:23.170 - 00:12:33.200, Speaker C: Don't let me get me wrong. I love lazy evaluation. Like, lazy evaluation is great, like partial specifications, lazy evaluation is the best. Don't get me wrong. Sorry.\\n00:12:34.370 - 00:12:35.790, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead, Michael.\\n00:12:37.030 - 00:13:03.098, Speaker F: So I think there's a lot of spaces that you can go into. I think starting with a simple example of what intents allow us to do already today. I think Kaoso is a really good example where you submit an intent for a transaction, but there's a lot of unseen information. There might be others trading in the other direction, and you can have a coincidence want. There might be many others trading same direction. Can batch and benefit from that. All of that would be impossible for you to know ahead of time.\\n00:13:03.098 - 00:14:00.090, Speaker F: And also intents allow for much more complex coordination that is very difficult to express in current UIs. So you have a massive bottleneck blockchains are these wonderful programmable systems where you could actually settle on any agreement and they're limited by the UIs that you can build and how fast you can build certain UIs or certain use cases. But intense, I think it can move much faster than the UIs will be able to move. And that will allow you to express much more complex transaction types. For example, multiparty coordination where you have different level actors that agree together to make a particular transaction happen.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: State Your Intents\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGhjcjWwFdc\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-04\\n\\n00:00:01.210 - 00:00:24.670, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Welcome to the last panel of this session about intents. Every week there's a new Twitter thread about intents. Still, there's one in my drafts as well. Still we do not know what intents are and what they are used for. So let's kind of explore in this panel. I would like from the panel to basically go by order, introduce themselves and just define or explain to the audience what do they mean by intents.\\n00:00:24.670 - 00:00:27.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Christopher, if you can go forward.\\n00:00:28.970 - 00:01:19.654, Speaker B: Thanks. I'm Chris, I work on Enoma, which is sort of an intent centric architecture as we understand it to us.

I think the sense in which we've seen intent as a coordinating concept so far is as something like an intent is a credible commitment to a preference function over the state of a particular system and the system in question can be defined very differently.

In the examples given before, using just LVR, it is not in general possible1 to distinguish\\nbetween high fee-return-on-capital and low fee-return-on-capital pools. In particular, in Figure 1,\\n(unsophisticated) LPs should generally prefer to participate in green pools rather than in blue pools,\\neven though both of them exhibit low adverse selection costs (LVR), because the necessary strategy\\nto employ in such pools is easier to deploy and follow.\\nIn this work, we intend to be examining the competitiveness of LPs in an ex-post fashion, i.e.,\\nassessing the realized past performance within some time frame. This means that some specific\\nprice trajectory was realized, combined with specific liquidity provision strategies by each individual\\nLP that participated in any given pool at any given time instant.

So that kind of concludes our workshop. And, yeah, I would love to kind of jump into questions in case you guys have any. Thank you.\\n00:31:49.360 - 00:31:51.980, Speaker B: Yeah, it looks like you have two questions in the chat.\\n00:32:01.120 - 00:32:20.020, Speaker A: So I'll just read them out. Okay. I'm not sure I understand why you need LPs. Don't fix them floating takers. Just engage in a zero sum game. One loses 101, gains 100 by doing the trade. Why do we need outside capital? Cool.\\n00:32:20.020 - 00:33:22.680, Speaker A: That's a really good question. So we can think of a scenario that, yes, it's true that, you know, in an ideal world, where there is, you know, double coincidence of wants meaning that at any point in time, a given variable taker and a given fixed taker happen to be on the protocol at the same time and happen to have the same need for 100 notional yes, in that scenario we would be able to immediately pair them. But in scenarios where that's not possible, we need to have market makers, we need to have liquidity providers who are constantly happy to engage in both sides of the market, meaning that they're able to keep the markets liquid active and keep the volume high. Meaning that as a trader, you don't need to kind of wait for if you're a fixed take, you don't need to wait for a variable taker to come in and trade with you. You can. Just come in trade with LP and then the LP will kind of net out their positions once the other side of the market kind of kicks in. And similar kind of logic also applies to kind of decentralized exchanges like uniswap.\\n00:33:22.680 - 00:34:03.270, Speaker A: Of course, they're effectively trying to solve for the same problem of kind of double coincidences of once by engaging liquidity providers to supply liquidity into both sides of the market. Cool. I hope that answers your question. Ben. Hey, David, let me just read your question out loud. So what's a good source of getting historical rate data? Getting historical rate data directly from ethereum, from on chain activity is very convoluted. So what I would recommend doing is just jumping into LoanScan and literally just scraping their data.\\n00:34:03.270 - 00:34:36.370, Speaker A: That has proven, for me at least has proven to be one of the fastest and hackiest ways of getting historical data on a range of different underlying so ave, compound dYdX and so on. Cool. Hope that was helpful. Let's see if there seems to be another. Okay. Loans. Cool.\\n00:34:36.370 - 00:34:59.620, Speaker A: We can't hear you, Anna. Cool. I guess that's it.

Two important benefits of Diamond compared to the\\nproposed McAMMs are the capturing of realized LVR in Diamond as opposed\\nto predicted LVR in McAMMs, and decentralized access to Diamond compared\\nto a single point of failure in McAMMs.\\nIn McAMMs, bidders are required to predict upcoming movements in the\\nAMM.

So that kind of concludes our workshop. And, yeah, I would love to kind of jump into questions in case you guys have any. Thank you.\\n00:31:49.360 - 00:31:51.980, Speaker B: Yeah, it looks like you have two questions in the chat.\\n00:32:01.120 - 00:32:20.020, Speaker A: So I'll just read them out. Okay. I'm not sure I understand why you need LPs. Don't fix them floating takers. Just engage in a zero sum game. One loses 101, gains 100 by doing the trade. Why do we need outside capital? Cool.\\n00:32:20.020 - 00:33:22.680, Speaker A: That's a really good question. So we can think of a scenario that, yes, it's true that, you know, in an ideal world, where there is, you know, double coincidence of wants meaning that at any point in time, a given variable taker and a given fixed taker happen to be on the protocol at the same time and happen to have the same need for 100 notional yes, in that scenario we would be able to immediately pair them. But in scenarios where that's not possible, we need to have market makers, we need to have liquidity providers who are constantly happy to engage in both sides of the market, meaning that they're able to keep the markets liquid active and keep the volume high. Meaning that as a trader, you don't need to kind of wait for if you're a fixed take, you don't need to wait for a variable taker to come in and trade with you. You can. Just come in trade with LP and then the LP will kind of net out their positions once the other side of the market kind of kicks in. And similar kind of logic also applies to kind of decentralized exchanges like uniswap.\\n00:33:22.680 - 00:34:03.270, Speaker A: Of course, they're effectively trying to solve for the same problem of kind of double coincidences of once by engaging liquidity providers to supply liquidity into both sides of the market. Cool. I hope that answers your question. Ben. Hey, David, let me just read your question out loud. So what's a good source of getting historical rate data? Getting historical rate data directly from ethereum, from on chain activity is very convoluted. So what I would recommend doing is just jumping into LoanScan and literally just scraping their data.\\n00:34:03.270 - 00:34:36.370, Speaker A: That has proven, for me at least has proven to be one of the fastest and hackiest ways of getting historical data on a range of different underlying so ave, compound dYdX and so on. Cool. Hope that was helpful. Let's see if there seems to be another. Okay. Loans. Cool.\\n00:34:36.370 - 00:34:59.620, Speaker A: We can't hear you, Anna. Cool. I guess that's it.

However, we have thus far only proved that LVR in a V0LVER pool is\\n(1\\u2212\\u03b2()) of the corresponding CFMM pool. As in [13], under competition among\\nblock producers, the LVR rebate function has a strong Nash equilibrium at \\u03b2(0),\\nmeaning LVR is also minimized.\\nTo see this, we can use a backwards induction argument. Consider the \\ufb01rst\\nblock producer allowed to send an update transaction with \\u03b2(H \\u2212 Ha) = 0 for\\na block at height H (meaning Ha = H\\u2032\\na + 1). This block producer can extract\\nall of the LVR, and is required to provide no liquidity to the allocation pool. As\\nLVR is arbitrage, all block producers do this.\\nA block producer at height H \\u2212 1 knows this. Furthermore, extracting (1 \\u2212\\n\\u03b2((H \\u2212 1) \\u2212 Ha)) > 0 of the LVR has positive utility for all block producers,\\nwhile trading with \\u03b2((H \\u2212 1) \\u2212 Ha) > 0 of allocated OCTs around the external\\nmarket price also has a positive utility (Payo\\ufb00 2 in Section 5). As such, sending\\nan update transaction at height H\\u22121 is dominant. Following this argumentation,\\na block producer at height H \\u2212 i \\u2265 Ha always sends an update transaction as\\nthey know the block producer at height (H + 1) \\u2212 i always sends an update\\ntransaction.

However, we have thus far only proved that LVR in a V0LVER pool is\\n(1\\u2212\\u03b2()) of the corresponding CFMM pool. As in [13], under competition among\\nblock producers, the LVR rebate function has a strong Nash equilibrium at \\u03b2(0),\\nmeaning LVR is also minimized.\\nTo see this, we can use a backwards induction argument. Consider the \\ufb01rst\\nblock producer allowed to send an update transaction with \\u03b2(H \\u2212 Ha) = 0 for\\na block at height H (meaning Ha = H\\u2032\\na + 1). This block producer can extract\\nall of the LVR, and is required to provide no liquidity to the allocation pool. As\\nLVR is arbitrage, all block producers do this.\\nA block producer at height H \\u2212 1 knows this. Furthermore, extracting (1 \\u2212\\n\\u03b2((H \\u2212 1) \\u2212 Ha)) > 0 of the LVR has positive utility for all block producers,\\nwhile trading with \\u03b2((H \\u2212 1) \\u2212 Ha) > 0 of allocated OCTs around the external\\nmarket price also has a positive utility (Payo\\ufb00 2 in Section 5). As such, sending\\nan update transaction at height H\\u22121 is dominant. Following this argumentation,\\na block producer at height H \\u2212 i \\u2265 Ha always sends an update transaction as\\nthey know the block producer at height (H + 1) \\u2212 i always sends an update\\ntransaction. This means the block producer at height H\\u2032\\na + 1 always sends an\\nupdate transaction \\u2200 H\\u2032\\na, which corresponds to an LVR rebate function value of\\n\\u03b2(0) in equilibrium.\\nIn reality, frictionless arbitrage against the external market price in blockchain-\\nbased protocols is likely not possible, and so LVR extraction has some cost.

See Figure 7.\\n6.3\\nDesign Practices\\nThe \\ufb01nal main category of mitigation is to assume front-running is unpreventable\\nand to thus responsively redesign the functionality of the DApp to remove any\\nbene\\ufb01t from it. For example, when designing a decentralized exchange, one can\\nuse a call market design instead of a time-sensitive order book [22] to side-\\nstep and disincentivize front-running. In a call market design, the arrival time\\nof orders does not matter as they are executed in batches19 . The call market\\nsolution pivots pro\\ufb01table gains that front-running miners stand to gain into fees\\nthat they collect [22], removing the \\ufb01nancial incentive to front-run.\\nIn the \\ufb01nance literature, Malinova and Park discuss front-running mitigations\\nfor blockchain-based trading platforms [39]. Instead of studying DApps, they de-\\nvelop an economic model where transactions, asset holdings, and traders\\u2019 identi-\\nties have greater transparency than in standard economic models\\u2014transparency\\nthey argue that could be accomplished by blockchain technology. However, in\\ntheir model, they assume entities can interact directly over private channels to\\narrange trades. They de\\ufb01ne front-running in the context of private o\\ufb00ers, where\\nparties might adjust their position before accepting or countering a received\\no\\ufb00er. This model is quite di\\ufb00erent than the DApp-based model we study here.\\nAnother example in the design of ERC20 standard [62] is the allowance func-\\ntionality. approve() function in the speci\\ufb01cation allows a second entity to be able\\nto spend N tokens from the sender\\u2019s balance. In order to change the allowance,\\nsender must send a transaction to set the new allowance value. Using the inser-\\ntion attack, attacker could front-run the new allowance transaction and spend the\\nold value before the new value is set [54,33], and then additionally spend the new\\namount at a later time. Solutions such as decreaseApproval()/increaseApproval()\\nwere added in updated implementations.\\n7\\nConcluding Remarks\\nFront-running is a pervasive issue in Ethereum DApps. DApp developers don\\u2019t\\nnecessarily have the mindset to design DApps with front-running in mind. This\\nis an attempt to bring forward the subject and increase awareness of these type\\nof attacks. While some DApp-level application logic could be built to mitigate\\nthese attacks, its ubiquity across di\\ufb00erent DApp categories suggests mitigations\\nat the blockchain-level would perhaps be more e\\ufb00ective. We highlight this as an\\nimportant research area.\\nAcknowledgements.

Historically, \\ufb02oor traders might\\nhave overheard a broker\\u2019s negotiation with her client over a large purchase, and\\nliterally race the broker to buy \\ufb01rst, potentially pro\\ufb01ting when the large pur-\\nchase temporarily reduces the supply of the stock. Alternatively, a malicious\\nbroker might front-run their own client\\u2019s orders by purchasing stock for them-\\nselves between receiving the instruction to purchase from the client and actually\\nexecuting the purchase (similar techniques can be used for large sell orders).\\nFront-running is illegal in jurisdictions with established securities regulation.\\nCases of front-running are sometimes di\\ufb03cult to distinguish from related\\nconcepts like insider trading and arbitrage. In front-running, a person sees a\\nconcrete transaction that is set to execute and reacts to it before it actually gets\\nexecuted. If the person instead has access to more general privileged information\\nthat might predict future transactions but is not reacting at the actual pending\\ntrades, we would classify this activity as insider trading. If the person reacts after\\nthe trade is executed, or information is made public, and pro\\ufb01ts from being the\\nfastest to react, this is considered arbitrage and is legal and encouraged because\\nit helps markets integrate new information into prices quickly.\\n2.2\\nLiterature on Traditional Front-running\\nFront-running originates on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBoE) [41].\\nThe Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1977 de\\ufb01ned it as: \\u201cThe practice\\nof e\\ufb00ecting an options transaction based upon non-public information regarding\\nan impending block transaction1 in the underlying stock, in order to obtain a\\npro\\ufb01t when the options market adjusts to the price at which the block trades. [2]\\u201d\\nSelf-regulating exchanges (e.g., CBoE) and the SEC spent the ensuing years\\nplanning how to detect and outlaw front-running practices [41]. The SEC stated:\\n\\u201cIt seems evident that such behaviour on the part of persons with knowledge of\\nimminent transactions which will likely a\\ufb00ect the price of the derivative security\\nconstitutes an unfair use of such knowledge.2\\u201d The CBoE tried to educate their\\n1 A block in the stock market is a large number of shares, 10 000 or more, to sell which\\nwill heavily change the price.\\n2 Securities Exchange Act Release No.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 19\\nsource: 12\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: SoK: Transparent Dishonesty: front-running attacks on Blockchain\\nauthors: Shayan Eskandari, Seyedehmahsa Moosavi, Jeremy Clark\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05164v3\\nrelease_date: 2019-02-13\\n\\n12\\naddress and the tokens were aggregated later in one single address. Although\\nthis incident does not involve transaction reordering in the blocks, it shows how\\nminers can modify their mining software to behave in a certain way to front-run\\nother transactions by bulk displacement to gain monetary pro\\ufb01t.\\n6\\nKey Mitigations\\nAs we studied front-running attacks on the blockchain, we also encountered a\\nnumber of ways of preventing, detecting or mitigating front-running attacks.\\nInstead of providing the details of exact solutions which will change over time,\\nwe extract the main principles or primitives that address the attack. A particular\\nsystem may implement more than one in a layered mitigation approach.\\nWe classify the mitigations into three main categories. In the \\ufb01rst category,\\nthe blockchain removes the miner\\u2019s ability to arbitrarily order transactions and\\ntries to enforce some ordering, or queue, for the transactions. In the second\\ncategory, cryptographic techniques are used to limit the visibility of transactions,\\ngiving the potential front-running less information to base their strategy on.\\nIn the \\ufb01nal category, DApps are designed from the bottom-up to remove the\\nimportance of transaction ordering or time in their operations. We also note\\nthat for DApps that are legally well-formed (e.g., with identi\\ufb01ed parties and\\na clear jurisdiction), front-running attacks can violate laws, which is its own\\ndeterrent.\\nTraditional Front-running Prevention Methods. There are debates in traditional\\nmarkets regarding the fact that front-running is considered to be a form of insider\\ntrading which deemed to be illegal. Traditional methods to prevent front-running\\nmainly involves after the fact investigation and legal action against the front-\\nrunners [28]. As mentioned in section 2.2, de\\ufb01ning front-running and educating\\nthe employees were the \\ufb01rst step taken to prevent such issues in traditional\\nmarkets, however, front-running became less likely to happen mainly because of\\nthe high \\ufb01ne and lawsuits against \\ufb01rms who behaved in an unethical way. Other\\nmethods such as dark pools [69,20] and sealed bids [53] were discussed and\\nimplemented in a variety of regulated trading systems. The traditional methods\\nto prevent front-running does not apply to blockchain applications, as mainly\\nthey are based on central enforcement and limitations, also in case of blockchains\\nthe actors who are front-running could be anonymous and the fear of lawsuits\\nwould not apply.\\n6.1\\nTransaction Sequencing\\nEthereum miners store pending transactions in pools and draw from them when\\nforming blocks. As the term \\u2018pool\\u2019 implies, there is no intrinsic order to how\\ntransactions are drawn and miners are free to sequence them arbitrarily.17 The\\n17 Sometimes the pool is called a \\u2018queue.\\u2019 It is important to note is a misnomer as\\nqueues enforce a \\ufb01rst-in-\\ufb01rst-out sequence.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 19\\nsource: 4\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: SoK: Transparent Dishonesty: front-running attacks on Blockchain\\nauthors: Shayan Eskandari, Seyedehmahsa Moosavi, Jeremy Clark\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05164v3\\nrelease_date: 2019-02-13\\n\\n4\\n2.4\\nLiterature on Blockchain Front-running\\nGiven the purpose of this entire paper is systemizing the existing literature, we\\ndo not re-enumerate the literature here. However, we note two points. First,\\nwe are not aware of any other systematic study of this issue. Second, front-\\nrunning is related to two well-studied concepts: double-spending and rushing\\nadversaries [38].\\nDouble-spending attacks in Bitcoin are related to front-running [11,36]. In\\nthis attack, a user broadcasts a transaction and is able to obtain some o\\ufb00-\\nblockchain good or service before the transaction has actually been (fully) con-\\n\\ufb01rmed. The user can then broadcast a competing transaction that sends the same\\nunspent coins to herself, perhaps using higher transaction fees, arrangements\\nwith miners or artifacts of the network topology to have the second transaction\\ncon\\ufb01rmed instead of the \\ufb01rst. This can be considered a form of self-front-running.\\nIn the cryptographic literature, front-running attacks are modeled by allowing\\na so called \\u2018rushing\\u2019 adversary to interact with the protocol [12]. In particu-\\nlar, ideal functionalities of blockchains (such as those used in simulation-based\\nproofs) need to capture this adversarial capability, assuming the real blockchain\\ndoes not address front-running. See e.g., Bitcoin backbone [29] and Hawk [38].\\n3\\nA Taxonomy of Front-running Attacks\\nAs we will illustrate with examples through-out the paper, front-running attacks\\ncan often be reduced to one of a few basic templates. We emphasize what the\\nadversary is trying to accomplish (without worrying about how) and we distin-\\nguish three cases: displacement, insertion, and suppression attacks.

See Figure 7.\\n6.3\\nDesign Practices\\nThe \\ufb01nal main category of mitigation is to assume front-running is unpreventable\\nand to thus responsively redesign the functionality of the DApp to remove any\\nbene\\ufb01t from it. For example, when designing a decentralized exchange, one can\\nuse a call market design instead of a time-sensitive order book [22] to side-\\nstep and disincentivize front-running. In a call market design, the arrival time\\nof orders does not matter as they are executed in batches19 . The call market\\nsolution pivots pro\\ufb01table gains that front-running miners stand to gain into fees\\nthat they collect [22], removing the \\ufb01nancial incentive to front-run.\\nIn the \\ufb01nance literature, Malinova and Park discuss front-running mitigations\\nfor blockchain-based trading platforms [39]. Instead of studying DApps, they de-\\nvelop an economic model where transactions, asset holdings, and traders\\u2019 identi-\\nties have greater transparency than in standard economic models\\u2014transparency\\nthey argue that could be accomplished by blockchain technology. However, in\\ntheir model, they assume entities can interact directly over private channels to\\narrange trades. They de\\ufb01ne front-running in the context of private o\\ufb00ers, where\\nparties might adjust their position before accepting or countering a received\\no\\ufb00er. This model is quite di\\ufb00erent than the DApp-based model we study here.\\nAnother example in the design of ERC20 standard [62] is the allowance func-\\ntionality. approve() function in the speci\\ufb01cation allows a second entity to be able\\nto spend N tokens from the sender\\u2019s balance. In order to change the allowance,\\nsender must send a transaction to set the new allowance value. Using the inser-\\ntion attack, attacker could front-run the new allowance transaction and spend the\\nold value before the new value is set [54,33], and then additionally spend the new\\namount at a later time. Solutions such as decreaseApproval()/increaseApproval()\\nwere added in updated implementations.\\n7\\nConcluding Remarks\\nFront-running is a pervasive issue in Ethereum DApps. DApp developers don\\u2019t\\nnecessarily have the mindset to design DApps with front-running in mind. This\\nis an attempt to bring forward the subject and increase awareness of these type\\nof attacks. While some DApp-level application logic could be built to mitigate\\nthese attacks, its ubiquity across di\\ufb00erent DApp categories suggests mitigations\\nat the blockchain-level would perhaps be more e\\ufb00ective. We highlight this as an\\nimportant research area.\\nAcknowledgements.

Historically, \\ufb02oor traders might\\nhave overheard a broker\\u2019s negotiation with her client over a large purchase, and\\nliterally race the broker to buy \\ufb01rst, potentially pro\\ufb01ting when the large pur-\\nchase temporarily reduces the supply of the stock. Alternatively, a malicious\\nbroker might front-run their own client\\u2019s orders by purchasing stock for them-\\nselves between receiving the instruction to purchase from the client and actually\\nexecuting the purchase (similar techniques can be used for large sell orders).\\nFront-running is illegal in jurisdictions with established securities regulation.\\nCases of front-running are sometimes di\\ufb03cult to distinguish from related\\nconcepts like insider trading and arbitrage. In front-running, a person sees a\\nconcrete transaction that is set to execute and reacts to it before it actually gets\\nexecuted. If the person instead has access to more general privileged information\\nthat might predict future transactions but is not reacting at the actual pending\\ntrades, we would classify this activity as insider trading. If the person reacts after\\nthe trade is executed, or information is made public, and pro\\ufb01ts from being the\\nfastest to react, this is considered arbitrage and is legal and encouraged because\\nit helps markets integrate new information into prices quickly.\\n2.2\\nLiterature on Traditional Front-running\\nFront-running originates on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBoE) [41].\\nThe Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1977 de\\ufb01ned it as: \\u201cThe practice\\nof e\\ufb00ecting an options transaction based upon non-public information regarding\\nan impending block transaction1 in the underlying stock, in order to obtain a\\npro\\ufb01t when the options market adjusts to the price at which the block trades. [2]\\u201d\\nSelf-regulating exchanges (e.g., CBoE) and the SEC spent the ensuing years\\nplanning how to detect and outlaw front-running practices [41]. The SEC stated:\\n\\u201cIt seems evident that such behaviour on the part of persons with knowledge of\\nimminent transactions which will likely a\\ufb00ect the price of the derivative security\\nconstitutes an unfair use of such knowledge.2\\u201d The CBoE tried to educate their\\n1 A block in the stock market is a large number of shares, 10 000 or more, to sell which\\nwill heavily change the price.\\n2 Securities Exchange Act Release No.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 19\\nsource: 12\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: SoK: Transparent Dishonesty: front-running attacks on Blockchain\\nauthors: Shayan Eskandari, Seyedehmahsa Moosavi, Jeremy Clark\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05164v3\\nrelease_date: 2019-02-13\\n\\n12\\naddress and the tokens were aggregated later in one single address. Although\\nthis incident does not involve transaction reordering in the blocks, it shows how\\nminers can modify their mining software to behave in a certain way to front-run\\nother transactions by bulk displacement to gain monetary pro\\ufb01t.\\n6\\nKey Mitigations\\nAs we studied front-running attacks on the blockchain, we also encountered a\\nnumber of ways of preventing, detecting or mitigating front-running attacks.\\nInstead of providing the details of exact solutions which will change over time,\\nwe extract the main principles or primitives that address the attack. A particular\\nsystem may implement more than one in a layered mitigation approach.\\nWe classify the mitigations into three main categories. In the \\ufb01rst category,\\nthe blockchain removes the miner\\u2019s ability to arbitrarily order transactions and\\ntries to enforce some ordering, or queue, for the transactions. In the second\\ncategory, cryptographic techniques are used to limit the visibility of transactions,\\ngiving the potential front-running less information to base their strategy on.\\nIn the \\ufb01nal category, DApps are designed from the bottom-up to remove the\\nimportance of transaction ordering or time in their operations. We also note\\nthat for DApps that are legally well-formed (e.g., with identi\\ufb01ed parties and\\na clear jurisdiction), front-running attacks can violate laws, which is its own\\ndeterrent.\\nTraditional Front-running Prevention Methods. There are debates in traditional\\nmarkets regarding the fact that front-running is considered to be a form of insider\\ntrading which deemed to be illegal. Traditional methods to prevent front-running\\nmainly involves after the fact investigation and legal action against the front-\\nrunners [28]. As mentioned in section 2.2, de\\ufb01ning front-running and educating\\nthe employees were the \\ufb01rst step taken to prevent such issues in traditional\\nmarkets, however, front-running became less likely to happen mainly because of\\nthe high \\ufb01ne and lawsuits against \\ufb01rms who behaved in an unethical way. Other\\nmethods such as dark pools [69,20] and sealed bids [53] were discussed and\\nimplemented in a variety of regulated trading systems. The traditional methods\\nto prevent front-running does not apply to blockchain applications, as mainly\\nthey are based on central enforcement and limitations, also in case of blockchains\\nthe actors who are front-running could be anonymous and the fear of lawsuits\\nwould not apply.\\n6.1\\nTransaction Sequencing\\nEthereum miners store pending transactions in pools and draw from them when\\nforming blocks. As the term \\u2018pool\\u2019 implies, there is no intrinsic order to how\\ntransactions are drawn and miners are free to sequence them arbitrarily.17 The\\n17 Sometimes the pool is called a \\u2018queue.\\u2019 It is important to note is a misnomer as\\nqueues enforce a \\ufb01rst-in-\\ufb01rst-out sequence.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 19\\nsource: 4\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: SoK: Transparent Dishonesty: front-running attacks on Blockchain\\nauthors: Shayan Eskandari, Seyedehmahsa Moosavi, Jeremy Clark\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05164v3\\nrelease_date: 2019-02-13\\n\\n4\\n2.4\\nLiterature on Blockchain Front-running\\nGiven the purpose of this entire paper is systemizing the existing literature, we\\ndo not re-enumerate the literature here. However, we note two points. First,\\nwe are not aware of any other systematic study of this issue. Second, front-\\nrunning is related to two well-studied concepts: double-spending and rushing\\nadversaries [38].\\nDouble-spending attacks in Bitcoin are related to front-running [11,36]. In\\nthis attack, a user broadcasts a transaction and is able to obtain some o\\ufb00-\\nblockchain good or service before the transaction has actually been (fully) con-\\n\\ufb01rmed. The user can then broadcast a competing transaction that sends the same\\nunspent coins to herself, perhaps using higher transaction fees, arrangements\\nwith miners or artifacts of the network topology to have the second transaction\\ncon\\ufb01rmed instead of the \\ufb01rst. This can be considered a form of self-front-running.\\nIn the cryptographic literature, front-running attacks are modeled by allowing\\na so called \\u2018rushing\\u2019 adversary to interact with the protocol [12]. In particu-\\nlar, ideal functionalities of blockchains (such as those used in simulation-based\\nproofs) need to capture this adversarial capability, assuming the real blockchain\\ndoes not address front-running. See e.g., Bitcoin backbone [29] and Hawk [38].\\n3\\nA Taxonomy of Front-running Attacks\\nAs we will illustrate with examples through-out the paper, front-running attacks\\ncan often be reduced to one of a few basic templates. We emphasize what the\\nadversary is trying to accomplish (without worrying about how) and we distin-\\nguish three cases: displacement, insertion, and suppression attacks. In all three\\ncases, Alice is trying to invoke a function on a contract that is in a particular\\nstate, and Mallory will try to invoke her own function call on the same contract\\nin the same state before Alice.\\nIn the \\ufb01rst type of attack, a displacement attack, it is not important to the\\nadversary for Alice\\u2019s function call to run after Mallory runs her function. Alice\\u2019s\\ncan be orphaned or run with no meaningful e\\ufb00ect.

One possible protection is to\\ndisable transactions above the minimum pro\\ufb01table victim\\ninput in the smart contracts.\\nB. Cryptography-based Defences\\nIn the following we discuss possible cryptography based\\ndefence techniques against sandwich attacks.\\n1) Multi-Party Computation (MPC): The sandwich\\nattack is possible because the current consensus protocol\\nused in Ethereum fails to protect the actual ordering of\\nthe transactions from adversarial manipulations (i.e. fee\\nmanipulations). Thus, it is tempting for one to design an\\nAMM DEX that has a authorized set of \\u201ctrusted\\u201d nodes\\nto faithfully sequence actions from liquidity takers before\\ngetting the actions executed by the smart contract. This\\nproposal, however, makes AMM DEX like Uniswap no\\nlonger permissionless, and the authorized set can again\\nmanipulate the order of the transactions. To address the\\nlater, Kelkar et al. [36] propose a new set of Byzantine\\nConsensus protocols, that achieve a fair ordering of re-\\nceived transactions. Thus, one can require the authorized\\nset of nodes to run such protocol to achieve order fairness\\namong transactions.\\n2) Commit-and-Reveal Protocols: A commitment\\nscheme is a two-round protocol that allows one to commit\\nto chosen values (i.e. function, input) while keeping those\\nvalues hidden from others (hiding) during the committing\\nround, and later during the revealing round, s/he can\\ndecide to reveal the committed value. The commitment\\nschemes are binding if and only if the party cannot change\\nthe value after committing to it. We brie\\ufb02y discuss the\\nuse of commitment scheme to prevent front-running in the\\nfollowing.\\na) Standard Commit-and-Reveal Protocol: To pre-\\nvent the sandwich attack in AMM DEX, one can use\\ncommitment schemes to sequence actions of traders dur-\\ning committing round and execute actions during re-\\nvealing round. In particular, during committing round,\\ntraders commit to function calls (i.e. TransactXforY ,\\naddLiquidity, removeLiquidity) via commitment trans-\\nactions, and the ordering of function calls is determined\\nbased on the order of commitments while the function calls\\nare hidden due to the hiding property of a commitment\\nscheme.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 22\\nsource: 14\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Maximizing Extractable Value from Automated Market Makers\\nauthors: Massimo Bartoletti, James Hsin-yu Chiang, Alberto Lluch-Lafuente\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01870v4\\nrelease_date: 2021-06-02\\n\\nSome works investigate the problem of detecting front-running attacks on\\npublic blockchains. For example, in [16], Qin et al. introduce front-running de-\\ntection heuristics which are deployed to empirically study the presence of such\\nattacks on public DeFi applications. On the other hand, various fair ordering\\nschemes have been proposed to mitigate front-running or exploitation of miner-\\nextractable value. However, simple commit-and-reveal schemes still leak infor-\\nmation such as account balances. Breidenbach et al. [11] propose \\u201csubmarine\\ncommitments\\u201d, which rely on k-anonymity to prevent any leaks from user com-\\nmitments. Baum et al.

Sandwich Attacks\\nSandwich attacks, wherein a trader wraps a victim transaction\\nwithin two adversarial transactions, is a classic predatory\\ntrading strategy [2]. To perform a sandwich, the adversary\\nA, which can be a miner or trader, listens on the P2P network\\nfor pending transactions. The adversary attacks, if the market\\nprice of an asset is expected to rise/fall after the execution of\\na \\u201clarge\\u201d pending transaction (TV ). The attack is then carried\\nout in two-steps: (i) A issues TA1 to tolerating front-run TV ,\\nby purchasing/selling the same asset before TV changes the\\nmarket price; (ii) A then issues TA2 to back-run TV to close\\nthe trading position opened by TA1. A must perform tolerating\\nfront-running to ensure that TV \\u2019s slippage protection does not\\ntrigger a transaction revert.\\n1Transactions with zero gas price are not propagating on the Ethereum\\nP2P network due to DoS concerns. Miners, however, might receive these\\ntransactions from, for example, BEV relayers (cf. Section VI-A).\\n1) Heuristics: We apply the following heuristics to identify\\npotentially successful sandwich attacks from the AMM trades.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 1: The transactions TA1, TV and TA2 must be\\nincluded in the same block and in this exact order.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 2: Every front-running transaction TA1 maps\\nto one and only one back-running transaction TA2. This\\nheuristic is necessary to avoid double counting revenues.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 3: Both TA1 and TV transact from asset X to Y .\\nTA2 transacts in the reverse direction from asset Y to X.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 4: Either the same user address sends transactions\\nTA1 and TA2, or two different user addresses send TA1 and\\nTA2 to the same smart contract.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 5: The amount of asset sold in TA2 must be within\\n90% \\u223c 110% of the amount bought in TA1. If the sandwich\\nattack is perfectly executed without interference from other\\nmarket participants, the amount sold in TA2 should be\\nprecisely equal to the amount purchased in TA1. According\\nto our empirical data 603,431 (80.4%) sandwich attacks we\\ndetect are \\u201cperfect\\u201d. We further relax this constraint to cover\\n\\u00b110% slippage, thus \\ufb01nding 147,098 (19.6%) additional\\nimperfect pro\\ufb01table sandwich attacks.\\n2) Empirical Results: In total, we identify 2,419 Ethereum\\nuser addresses and 1,069 smart contracts performing 750,529\\nsandwich attacks on Uniswap V1/V2/V3, Sushiswap, and\\nBancor, with a total pro\\ufb01t of 174.34M USD (cf.

We consider front-running to be a course of action where\\nan entity bene\\ufb01ts from prior access to privileged market information\\nabout upcoming transactions and trades. Front-running has been an is-\\nsue in \\ufb01nancial instrument markets since the 1970s. With the advent of\\nthe blockchain technology, front-running has resurfaced in new forms we\\nexplore here, instigated by blockchain\\u2019s decentralized and transparent\\nnature. In this paper, we draw from a scattered body of knowledge and\\ninstances of front-running across the top 25 most active decentral ap-\\nplications (DApps) deployed on Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, we\\ncarry out a detailed analysis of Status.im initial coin o\\ufb00ering (ICO) and\\nshow evidence of abnormal miner\\u2019s behavior indicative of front-running\\ntoken purchases.

Section IV). This\\nthreshold depends on both the total liquidity of the market\\nand the AMM DEX\\u2019s design and con\\ufb01guration (pricing\\nformula, fees and etc.). One possible protection is to\\ndisable transactions above the minimum pro\\ufb01table victim\\ninput in the smart contracts.\\nB. Cryptography-based Defences\\nIn the following we discuss possible cryptography based\\ndefence techniques against sandwich attacks.\\n1) Multi-Party Computation (MPC): The sandwich\\nattack is possible because the current consensus protocol\\nused in Ethereum fails to protect the actual ordering of\\nthe transactions from adversarial manipulations (i.e. fee\\nmanipulations). Thus, it is tempting for one to design an\\nAMM DEX that has a authorized set of \\u201ctrusted\\u201d nodes\\nto faithfully sequence actions from liquidity takers before\\ngetting the actions executed by the smart contract. This\\nproposal, however, makes AMM DEX like Uniswap no\\nlonger permissionless, and the authorized set can again\\nmanipulate the order of the transactions. To address the\\nlater, Kelkar et al. [36] propose a new set of Byzantine\\nConsensus protocols, that achieve a fair ordering of re-\\nceived transactions. Thus, one can require the authorized\\nset of nodes to run such protocol to achieve order fairness\\namong transactions.\\n2) Commit-and-Reveal Protocols: A commitment\\nscheme is a two-round protocol that allows one to commit\\nto chosen values (i.e. function, input) while keeping those\\nvalues hidden from others (hiding) during the committing\\nround, and later during the revealing round, s/he can\\ndecide to reveal the committed value. The commitment\\nschemes are binding if and only if the party cannot change\\nthe value after committing to it. We brie\\ufb02y discuss the\\nuse of commitment scheme to prevent front-running in the\\nfollowing.\\na) Standard Commit-and-Reveal Protocol: To pre-\\nvent the sandwich attack in AMM DEX, one can use\\ncommitment schemes to sequence actions of traders dur-\\ning committing round and execute actions during re-\\nvealing round. In particular, during committing round,\\ntraders commit to function calls (i.e. TransactXforY ,\\naddLiquidity, removeLiquidity) via commitment trans-\\nactions, and the ordering of function calls is determined\\nbased on the order of commitments while the function calls\\nare hidden due to the hiding property of a commitment\\nscheme.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 22\\nsource: 14\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Maximizing Extractable Value from Automated Market Makers\\nauthors: Massimo Bartoletti, James Hsin-yu Chiang, Alberto Lluch-Lafuente\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01870v4\\nrelease_date: 2021-06-02\\n\\nSome works investigate the problem of detecting front-running attacks on\\npublic blockchains.

Sandwich Attacks\\nSandwich attacks, wherein a trader wraps a victim transaction\\nwithin two adversarial transactions, is a classic predatory\\ntrading strategy [2]. To perform a sandwich, the adversary\\nA, which can be a miner or trader, listens on the P2P network\\nfor pending transactions. The adversary attacks, if the market\\nprice of an asset is expected to rise/fall after the execution of\\na \\u201clarge\\u201d pending transaction (TV ). The attack is then carried\\nout in two-steps: (i) A issues TA1 to tolerating front-run TV ,\\nby purchasing/selling the same asset before TV changes the\\nmarket price; (ii) A then issues TA2 to back-run TV to close\\nthe trading position opened by TA1. A must perform tolerating\\nfront-running to ensure that TV \\u2019s slippage protection does not\\ntrigger a transaction revert.\\n1Transactions with zero gas price are not propagating on the Ethereum\\nP2P network due to DoS concerns. Miners, however, might receive these\\ntransactions from, for example, BEV relayers (cf. Section VI-A).\\n1) Heuristics: We apply the following heuristics to identify\\npotentially successful sandwich attacks from the AMM trades.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 1: The transactions TA1, TV and TA2 must be\\nincluded in the same block and in this exact order.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 2: Every front-running transaction TA1 maps\\nto one and only one back-running transaction TA2. This\\nheuristic is necessary to avoid double counting revenues.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 3: Both TA1 and TV transact from asset X to Y .\\nTA2 transacts in the reverse direction from asset Y to X.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 4: Either the same user address sends transactions\\nTA1 and TA2, or two different user addresses send TA1 and\\nTA2 to the same smart contract.\\n\\u2022 Heuristic 5: The amount of asset sold in TA2 must be within\\n90% \\u223c 110% of the amount bought in TA1. If the sandwich\\nattack is perfectly executed without interference from other\\nmarket participants, the amount sold in TA2 should be\\nprecisely equal to the amount purchased in TA1. According\\nto our empirical data 603,431 (80.4%) sandwich attacks we\\ndetect are \\u201cperfect\\u201d. We further relax this constraint to cover\\n\\u00b110% slippage, thus \\ufb01nding 147,098 (19.6%) additional\\nimperfect pro\\ufb01table sandwich attacks.\\n2) Empirical Results: In total, we identify 2,419 Ethereum\\nuser addresses and 1,069 smart contracts performing 750,529\\nsandwich attacks on Uniswap V1/V2/V3, Sushiswap, and\\nBancor, with a total pro\\ufb01t of 174.34M USD (cf.

Thus, Theorem 5.2 focuses on providing provable guarantees from\\nthe user\\u2019s perspective. This is our main result, and ensures that if a self-interested miner includes\\na user\\u2019s transaction in the block, then either the transaction executes with at a good execution\\nprice\\u2014as good as if the user\\u2019s transaction was the only one in the block\\u2014or the miner does not\\ngain by including the transaction. That is, a miner can pro\\ufb01tably insert their own transactions, but\\nonly to the extent that the user\\u2019s execution price is no worse than their standalone price (i.e., the\\nprice if they were the only transaction in the block). Although a user can still get a bad execution\\nprice, but in this case the miner provably does not pro\\ufb01t from including the user\\u2019s transaction. For\\nexample, if two users each wish to buy q units of the same token, then in the absence of any other\\ntransactions, it is inevitable that the transaction that executes in second place pays a higher price.\\nThis is due to competition for the same token and not due to miner manipulation.\\n1.1\\nTechnical overview\\nDuring a sandwich attack, a miner manipulates the state of the exchange in a way that causes one or\\nmore user transactions to achieve a worse execution price. We formalize the properties achieved by\\nour sequencing rule by taking the price at the most recent state of the liquidity reserves, X0 \\u2208 R2,\\nwhen a user submits a buy or sell order, as a benchmark. This is a relevant benchmark because\\nthe blockchain consensus ensures that X0 is not manipulable by the miner.4\\nCrucial for our sequencing rule is the observation that any liquidity pool exchange with two\\ntokens satis\\ufb01es the following duality property: at any state X \\u2208 R2, it is either the case that (1)\\nany buy order receives a better execution at X than at X0, or (2) any sell order receives a better\\nexecution at X than at X0. Thus at any point during the execution of the orders in a block, as long\\nas the transactions yet to execute are not all of the same type (i.e., not all buy orders or all sell\\norders), there is at least one order that would be happier to be the next order to execute compared\\nwith executing at the beginning of the block.\\nTo be concrete, in de\\ufb01ning our Greedy Sequencing Rule, let T1, T2, . . . , Tt be the execution\\nordering up to step t of the current block; these are the transactions already added to the execution\\nordering.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 6\\nsource: 3\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Strategyproof Computing: Systems Infrastructures for Self-Interested Parties\\nauthors: Chaki Ng, David C.

Great talk. Any questions? Again, great presentation. No questions from chat. Oh, Alex has a question.\\n00:12:04.890 - 00:12:08.760, Speaker C: Yeah, but Justin, if you want to ask yours first, if you have any.\\n00:12:10.590 - 00:12:18.762, Speaker A: I always have one question in my back pocket, just in case no one has questions. I'm happy to go. After you, Alex. Go ahead.\\n00:12:18.896 - 00:13:04.826, Speaker C: All right, so I'm still wrapping my head around layer two, so thank you, Georgia. That was a great presentation. So I have a question related to layer two. Submitting the roll up batches that were with transactions within that layer two already sequenced within that roller batch to the data availability layer, so Ethereum, or to a shard in Ethereum. And if someone is doing cross layer two arbitrage, would they be concerned about which roller batch is processed first by the data availability layer? Or does that not matter at all in the sense where you care about the sequencing of which batch is submitted first between two different layer tools. Does that make sense at all to you? Or am I missing something here?\\n00:13:05.008 - 00:13:24.654, Speaker B: So you're saying that there's two layer twos, two sequencers, two data availability layers. Each one of the sequencers submit the data availability batch to their own system. And I am a party doing cross chain arbitrage. And the question is so it's nearly.\\n00:13:24.702 - 00:13:29.458, Speaker C: That it's two sequences, two layer twos, but the same data availability layer. Right.\\n00:13:29.544 - 00:14:07.390, Speaker B: Doesn't matter. I mean, maybe it does matter depending on the protocol implementation, but it shouldn't matter from a client side perspective. All you need to know is that the data has been published somewhere. So for you as the Dex trader or whatever, medium, small size, it doesn't matter. What matters that you have the guarantee that the data is there. Yeah. So from the perspective of the individual protocol, I don't think that you need to care much about what happens on the remote layer.\\n00:14:07.390 - 00:14:53.882, Speaker B: Okay, cool.

That could exist for private use or it could be sold as a service and in general anything that has value for private use probably could be sold as a service, as a business. We expect that as things mature and develop that that might well happen. The consequences of the geographically distributed sequencer committee here are interesting because if you have a point of presence if there are 20 sequencers scattered around the world and you have a point of presence at each one and what you need is to get your transaction to a supermajority of them before somebody else. That means you may not have time to coordinate between your different points of presence in order to coordinate on what you're going to do. So there is some limit on your ability to actually use geographic proximity in this distributed system sense simply because if Alice is sitting in one place and multicasts her transaction out across the world to everywhere, then if you see it over here and then try to inform your friend over there of what to do, that Alice's transaction will probably beat you.\\n00:17:48.146 - 00:18:37.566, Speaker A: Right? Because you have to pay the triangle penalty for your path. And so there is some resistance to the geographic proximity methods. Essentially someone would need to have a deterministic method of reacting to the transactions they see, which is a little tricky because if you have only local information about the order in which your sequencer saw the information, that's not a guarantee about what the majority will see. So there's some complexity here and arguably it's a bit more difficult to try to get geographically near. So that's basically where we stand. I've given you a little flavor. I think the biggest difference you see in just to summarize between L One ethereum and L2 is in the response time of the sequencer.\\n00:18:37.566 - 00:19:06.850, Speaker A: It's in the fact that ordering is done by transactions. Blocks are not built in the normal sense, it's a per transaction ordering process and that has implications as well. So I'd be happy to answer any questions or engage in any discussion or civilized debate. And I think we have about ten minutes for that. I'll repeat the question if not okay.\\n00:19:08.100 - 00:19:10.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm a huge fan.\\n00:19:10.420 - 00:19:11.330, Speaker C: Thank you.\\n00:19:12.180 - 00:19:23.540, Speaker B: Just to church while you're talking, is there a possibility, perhaps might it be a good idea might it be a good idea to continue to run your.\\n00:19:23.610 - 00:20:01.184, Speaker C: Centralized sequencer in parallel to a distributed version?

The first is that if a small minority of the sequencers in this scheme are colluding with outsiders, that has no effect, because the honest supermajority will still provide the distributed first come first serve guarantee, regardless of what a small minority does. The second piece of that is yes. It's really important how these sequencers are chosen. They're likely to be parties who are trusted by our community to be reputable and have reason to be honest. And if they misbehave and parties who would suffer a reputational hit for misbehaving. I think if you think about the process for how you would choose those parties, you would want ones who have a reputation as trustworthy in the community, who have reputation to lose, who have a stake in the success of the community and so on.\\n00:26:33.374 - 00:26:43.920, Speaker A: And so I think the considerations that you suggest would play a big role in choosing the sequencers.

Thus, Theorem 5.2 focuses on providing provable guarantees from\\nthe user\\u2019s perspective. This is our main result, and ensures that if a self-interested miner includes\\na user\\u2019s transaction in the block, then either the transaction executes with at a good execution\\nprice\\u2014as good as if the user\\u2019s transaction was the only one in the block\\u2014or the miner does not\\ngain by including the transaction. That is, a miner can pro\\ufb01tably insert their own transactions, but\\nonly to the extent that the user\\u2019s execution price is no worse than their standalone price (i.e., the\\nprice if they were the only transaction in the block). Although a user can still get a bad execution\\nprice, but in this case the miner provably does not pro\\ufb01t from including the user\\u2019s transaction. For\\nexample, if two users each wish to buy q units of the same token, then in the absence of any other\\ntransactions, it is inevitable that the transaction that executes in second place pays a higher price.\\nThis is due to competition for the same token and not due to miner manipulation.\\n1.1\\nTechnical overview\\nDuring a sandwich attack, a miner manipulates the state of the exchange in a way that causes one or\\nmore user transactions to achieve a worse execution price. We formalize the properties achieved by\\nour sequencing rule by taking the price at the most recent state of the liquidity reserves, X0 \\u2208 R2,\\nwhen a user submits a buy or sell order, as a benchmark. This is a relevant benchmark because\\nthe blockchain consensus ensures that X0 is not manipulable by the miner.4\\nCrucial for our sequencing rule is the observation that any liquidity pool exchange with two\\ntokens satis\\ufb01es the following duality property: at any state X \\u2208 R2, it is either the case that (1)\\nany buy order receives a better execution at X than at X0, or (2) any sell order receives a better\\nexecution at X than at X0. Thus at any point during the execution of the orders in a block, as long\\nas the transactions yet to execute are not all of the same type (i.e., not all buy orders or all sell\\norders), there is at least one order that would be happier to be the next order to execute compared\\nwith executing at the beginning of the block.\\nTo be concrete, in de\\ufb01ning our Greedy Sequencing Rule, let T1, T2, . . . , Tt be the execution\\nordering up to step t of the current block; these are the transactions already added to the execution\\nordering.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 6\\nsource: 3\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Strategyproof Computing: Systems Infrastructures for Self-Interested Parties\\nauthors: Chaki Ng, David C.

These sets of bundles represent blocks to be added to participat-\\ning blockchains. With enough participation, SUAVE is intended to act as a\\none-stop-shop for transaction submission across many blockchains.\\nUniswap have announced UniswapX [2], an order-flow auction (Dutch Auc-\\ntion) to assist with routing in the proposed Uniswap V4 [1]. Due to the potential\\nfor thousands of liquidity pools for the same token pair in Uniswap V4, some\\noff-chain routing is likely needed to ensure users receive the best possible pricing.\\nEmulating a Dutch Auction among searchers to fill user orders should help in\\nthis regard. However, the UniswapX proposal also mentions the ability for auc-\\ntion winners to use their own private inventory/other on-chain liquidity, which\\nmight have negative implications for on-chain LP providers. A legacy order-flow\\nauction protocol that appears to have shutdown in recent months is Rook [50].\\n3.4.3\\nOpen Questions\\nSUAVE depends on a centralized auctioneer [28] (Flashbots or an additional\\ntrusted third party). The Flashbots hope is that this auctioneer can eventually\\nbe replicated by some form of trusted execution environment, and eventually\\na transparent decentralized system.\\nThe path to such an end-goal remains\\nunsolved and a contentious point. Trust in a trusted auctioneer appears to be\\nwidely accepted, at least in the case of Flashbots as the trusted auctioneer,\\nevidenced by the amount of blocks produced by MEV-boost [29], which also\\ndepends on trusting Flashbots as an auctioneer.\\nThe removal of extractable value through revenue-maximizing off-chain auc-\\ntions depends on many factors, including searcher competition and auctioneer\\ntrust, both of which need further investigation. Without atomicity guarantees,\\nmost searchers in these domains must charge fees to off-set the cost and prob-\\nability of not executing intended orders on dependent domains. Specifically, if\\na searcher agrees to sell some amount of tokens to a user in the order-flow auc-\\ntion with the intention of/assuming that they will be buying those tokens back\\non Ethereum, the searcher must increase their fee proportionally to the cost of\\nnot executing the swap on Ethereum. Sequencers would practically eliminate\\nthis cost. With such costs, searcher competition likely diminishes, reintroducing\\nextractable value opportunities for dominant searchers.\\nThe logic around maximizing extractable value through re-ordering bun-\\ndles is intended to be run by trusted execution environments [39], such as\\ntrusted off-chain hardware or cloud infrastructure. Centralizing power off-chain\\nto trusted execution environments requires significant further study, with guar-\\nantees/limitations of such solutions clearly stated for the community. Another\\nconcern for order-flow auctions is the ability to auction bundles of orders in a\\nrevenue-maximizing way for users generating the orders. The concern here is\\nthe creation of incentives to spam the auction and fill bundles with fake orders,\\npaying less revenue to the affected users.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Flashbots Research Workshop #1: Flashbots Research Roadmap\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDpdktixG5w\\nrelease_date: 2020-12-17\\n\\nAnd that might depend, like the format might depend might be on GitHub or it might be elsewhere, depending on the different questions.

One is we can select for desirable competition, competition that drives up revenue, but not competition that is detrimental to the users, we users wishes or their intent.\\n00:11:43.770 - 00:12:35.134, Speaker A: Right? Monetization of information, theoretical example covers that quite clearly. And then control over action, takeout information. If we have control over what happens inside of the box, but not outside, if we can keep sensitive information within the box, then we can stock things which we don't want from happening, which we don't want to happen from happening. And I gave a very specific instantiation of the cap in the box. But actually the point I'm trying to make is that we can combine many boxes, we can combine many cats, you can get dogs, you can get triangles, you can get go crazy. My point is that there's a lot we can do with privacy, how information flows and how we can draw things that cryptography and distributed systems have allowed us to do. And we haven't really, I don't think we've explored the full design space.\\n00:12:35.134 - 00:13:02.760, Speaker A: And so it'd be interesting to see what people come up with. Yeah, so that's why I always say it's not if you know, you know, you should ask yourself, what action can I take on what information? And that's pretty much it over time, I think. And so just highlighting a special cause. A lot of homeless cats out there do your best to donate or adopt. Cool. I think that's it. There we go.\\n00:13:03.210 - 00:13:07.558, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. We're still waiting for Danning to join in.\\n00:13:07.564 - 00:13:08.280, Speaker A: Just a.\\n00:13:10.330 - 00:13:18.810, Speaker B: You guess you probably get one or two. One of them that was asked is, how do you control information access here without leaking?\\n00:13:19.790 - 00:13:46.198, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's one very basic example. You could just have a bunch of people submitting scripts which are, like, encode their bids. You take us input the item, you give us output the bid, and now they're running Solar and some trusted party calculates the bids for these people. That's like one way of doing it. A lot of trust assumptions there. And then you can scale up.\\n00:13:46.198 - 00:14:12.400, Speaker A: Like Flash was exploring the SGX route, either via one central SGX. I'm not a Phonographer, I'm not going to talk about the trust assumptions there.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: What Makes Uniswap v4 Special - Ep. 508\\nchannel_name: Unchained Podcast\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNK-W8JDuWg\\nrelease_date: 2023-06-20\\n\\nAnd I wondered after that, you went to this two year license where people could not use the code for two years. They could see it, but not use it. And with this version, you've extended that to four years. Why did you decide to go with a business license of that length?\\n00:55:19.350 - 00:55:46.282, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a great question, and I think that there's also been kind of general chatter around what is open source, what is source available? And I think that there's definitely definition, and I think that definitely busl is different from GPL and MIT. And I think that people say that's source available, open source is totally fair. And I don't think that there was any intention to muddy the language there on our part.\\n00:55:46.416 - 00:55:52.620, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, people took issue with the tweet that says we've open sourced v four.\\n00:55:53.150 - 00:56:30.342, Speaker A: I think that open sourced is like a verb. Source available isn't, but we've made source available again, it's fair. I think it's fair there wasn't like an intention in that. I do think that Busl, for what it's worth, is a little bit categorically different from other types of proprietary licenses in a pretty meaningful way. And that I think there's a reason that it has had significant definitely like we were one of the first projects to use it, but many other projects use it now, today. And I do think it's categorically different than a fully proprietary license. And what I mean by that is the way busl works is that after some amount of years, it sort of is forced to go GPL.\\n00:56:30.342 - 00:56:34.934, Speaker A: It's guaranteed to be GPL and it can only be accelerated, it can't be extended.\\n00:56:35.062 - 00:56:39.740, Speaker B: And that GPL is when projects can use your code.\\n00:56:41.150 - 00:56:55.898, Speaker A: GPL is copy left, which GPL means that, yes, anyone can fork it, but they also have to go open source. There's like two types of open source. GPL is kind of like the viral form of open source, where anyone can integrate it, but they also have to become open source.\\n00:56:55.994 - 00:56:59.746, Speaker B: Is that also the term copy left? GPL and copy left. Okay.\\n00:56:59.848 - 00:57:58.862, Speaker A: And then MIT anyone can use in any way, and they don't need to open source. So for an MIT code base, someone can integrate it into their project and have that project be closed source. So it's not like viral in the same way, I'd say that what's interesting about Vusl is that it's guaranteed to eventually be open source, right?\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Frontiers in Mechanism Design (Lecture 2: Unit-Demand Bidders and Walrasian Equilibria)\\nchannel_name: Tim Roughgarden Lectures\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xX1z5K5KkM\\nrelease_date: 2014-01-21\\n\\nDo you want this or not. Now, with unit demand bidders here and different goods, at the end of the day, we know a bidder is only going to get one item at most. So we're actually not going to ask it a yes no question. We're going to ask it a richer question.\\n00:16:10.094 - 00:16:57.182, Speaker B: We're going to say, well, given the prices that we've currently set for each of the M items, which one's your favorite? What does favorite mean? Well, it means your net utility for it is the highest, your value for it, minus the price you'd have to pay. And so now a bidder, instead of just contributing one number, it contributes in some sense, one number to one of the goods. Exactly. One of the goods or at most one of the goods. So rather than overall demand, let me just say demand of I a bitter I is going to be it's fave good at the current prices, q. And again, by fave, I mean highest Vij minus QJ. And of course, if all of these are negative, then the bidder says, I don't want any of them at the current prices.\\n00:16:57.182 - 00:17:22.134, Speaker B: So your demand can be the empty set as well. So with that notion of demand, we can start thinking about, does supply equal demand or not? So we look at a good if it's more than one bidder's favorite, then it's over demanded. If there's a good that nobody wants, then it's under demanded. Okay. And so certainly, if you're over demanded, that suggests the price is too\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ntotal_pages: 19\\nsource: 2\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: SoK: Transparent Dishonesty: front-running attacks on Blockchain\\nauthors: Shayan Eskandari, Seyedehmahsa Moosavi, Jeremy Clark\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05164v3\\nrelease_date: 2019-02-13\\n\\n2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14156, November 19, 1977, (Letter from George\\nA.

These sets of bundles represent blocks to be added to participat-\\ning blockchains. With enough participation, SUAVE is intended to act as a\\none-stop-shop for transaction submission across many blockchains.\\nUniswap have announced UniswapX [2], an order-flow auction (Dutch Auc-\\ntion) to assist with routing in the proposed Uniswap V4 [1]. Due to the potential\\nfor thousands of liquidity pools for the same token pair in Uniswap V4, some\\noff-chain routing is likely needed to ensure users receive the best possible pricing.\\nEmulating a Dutch Auction among searchers to fill user orders should help in\\nthis regard. However, the UniswapX proposal also mentions the ability for auc-\\ntion winners to use their own private inventory/other on-chain liquidity, which\\nmight have negative implications for on-chain LP providers. A legacy order-flow\\nauction protocol that appears to have shutdown in recent months is Rook [50].\\n3.4.3\\nOpen Questions\\nSUAVE depends on a centralized auctioneer [28] (Flashbots or an additional\\ntrusted third party). The Flashbots hope is that this auctioneer can eventually\\nbe replicated by some form of trusted execution environment, and eventually\\na transparent decentralized system.\\nThe path to such an end-goal remains\\nunsolved and a contentious point. Trust in a trusted auctioneer appears to be\\nwidely accepted, at least in the case of Flashbots as the trusted auctioneer,\\nevidenced by the amount of blocks produced by MEV-boost [29], which also\\ndepends on trusting Flashbots as an auctioneer.\\nThe removal of extractable value through revenue-maximizing off-chain auc-\\ntions depends on many factors, including searcher competition and auctioneer\\ntrust, both of which need further investigation. Without atomicity guarantees,\\nmost searchers in these domains must charge fees to off-set the cost and prob-\\nability of not executing intended orders on dependent domains. Specifically, if\\na searcher agrees to sell some amount of tokens to a user in the order-flow auc-\\ntion with the intention of/assuming that they will be buying those tokens back\\non Ethereum, the searcher must increase their fee proportionally to the cost of\\nnot executing the swap on Ethereum. Sequencers would practically eliminate\\nthis cost. With such costs, searcher competition likely diminishes, reintroducing\\nextractable value opportunities for dominant searchers.\\nThe logic around maximizing extractable value through re-ordering bun-\\ndles is intended to be run by trusted execution environments [39], such as\\ntrusted off-chain hardware or cloud infrastructure. Centralizing power off-chain\\nto trusted execution environments requires significant further study, with guar-\\nantees/limitations of such solutions clearly stated for the community. Another\\nconcern for order-flow auctions is the ability to auction bundles of orders in a\\nrevenue-maximizing way for users generating the orders. The concern here is\\nthe creation of incentives to spam the auction and fill bundles with fake orders,\\npaying less revenue to the affected users.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Flashbots Research Workshop #1: Flashbots Research Roadmap\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDpdktixG5w\\nrelease_date: 2020-12-17\\n\\nAnd that might depend, like the format might depend might be on GitHub or it might be elsewhere, depending on the different questions. But I guess what I'm going at is that I think this should sort of consolidate with the questions and then they should sort of freeze and then the actual work in solving them.\\n00:32:42.036 - 00:33:30.782, Speaker B: Perhaps it would be better to have it elsewhere. I think that's practical. What would you suggest elsewhere? And the reason why once again we went back to GitHub has more to do with the fact that we actually want to weed out the non technical contributors at the like not weed out them. Like if you don't take the effort of actually watching the GitHub and actually don't take the effort of actually look at the MD and comment on the issues. I think people are probably just not investing sufficient thoughts and interest in it. That's why we want to really use the GitHub issue to engage the community. And also there's one single place.\\n00:33:30.782 - 00:34:25.018, Speaker B: We don't want to have too many different separate sites for this. But I do agree that some of the answers are either going to be, for example, paper one, research question number one. It will be a lot of what Scott Bigelow has been working on with the MEB Inspector team that could actually is already live on GitHub and it's open source so that should be referenced. But I see like I guess surya and if the answer lives somewhere else, what would be the most comfortable way for you to collaborate? If we use FRP as the questions like flashed out thoughts, proposals of how to answer these questions, then where do the answers lie?\\n00:34:25.194 - 00:35:04.240, Speaker C: Yeah, it can be a GitHub as well. I don't have no strong feelings for platform. I think each sub team perhaps will find a better place and then we can maybe consolidate. I don't know if it had an idea for this but maybe another repo for the paper or something like that. I'm sort of platform agnostic. I think the GitHub thing out weeding out non technical people might make sense. What I'm just saying is I think there would be a benefit from separating the question from the answers because otherwise if you start mutating the questions into answers in the same document, we might lose track of what we were striving to answer in the first place.\\n00:35:04.240 - 00:35:06.560, Speaker C: But GitHub it's fine.\\n00:35:09.410 - 00:36:28.380, Speaker B: Yeah, but I do understand it probably posts a lot of like we can also link it to Google Docs because I know some of you guys prefer much better to work on Google Docs which is definitely easier for a collaboration. Like we could have these posts and freeze there and issues referring to them and discussions for reference. But then the living dog for the answers would probably be somewhere else.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Auctions, privacy and a cat - Quintus Kilbourn\\nchannel_name: ETHGlobal\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjNmLBdScOI\\nrelease_date: 2023-03-28\\n\\nThey know something that their competitors don't, their competing traders don't.

So this first topic, we've seen some stuff from the past ten years, but it's mostly been from the 80s. All of these four topics will be nothing but 21st century stuff and in many cases just the last three years or so. Okay, so that's sort of the outline of where we're going. There'll be projects for all of these things up on the list.\\n00:04:48.922 - 00:05:31.734, Speaker A: So if one of those sounds especially exciting, I'll categorize the projects according to these topics. And the other thing I'd say is r1 benefit about the class being so relatively small is it's actually realistic for me to be helpful with the projects more than, say, last quarter when there was 50 people. So definitely feel free to get in touch with me and say, I was thinking about this paper. Do you think it's a good idea or not or whatever? So both. When you're picking the projects and then throughout the quarter, definitely feel free to get in touch and ask for my advice. It's sort of small enough that I can actually actually do that. Probably I'll schedule check in meetings with people in week seven or eight or something like that.\\n00:05:31.734 - 00:05:42.460, Speaker A: But even well before then, just picking a topic. If you want to talk about it, just let me know. Okay, so those are the announcements. Any questions? Sound good?\\n00:05:44.190 - 00:05:44.940, Speaker B: Okay.\\n00:05:46.590 - 00:06:17.342, Speaker A: All right. So so far what we've done is we've looked at four tractable special cases. The first two were sort of really trivial. The identical goods unit demand case, which you just saw with an English auction, and then the additive case, which you saw with parallel English auctions. We've done two not so trivial special cases, although with very satisfying positive results. So we had the non identical goods and unit demand bidders. That's where we used the Crawford Nowhere auction to give an epic auction surplus maximizing.\\n00:06:17.342 - 00:07:07.910, Speaker A: And then we also saw for identical goods and downward sloping valuations, we had Osbo's clinching auction, which also gave us everything that we want. And those last two if you think about it, those last two positive solutions that were non trivial, they didn't really look that much like each other, I don't think the unit demand nonidentical case and then the identical downward sloping case. I mean, clearly at a high level, we approach it in the same way.

So we're actually not going to ask it a yes no question. We're going to ask it a richer question.\\n00:16:10.094 - 00:16:57.182, Speaker B: We're going to say, well, given the prices that we've currently set for each of the M items, which one's your favorite? What does favorite mean? Well, it means your net utility for it is the highest, your value for it, minus the price you'd have to pay. And so now a bidder, instead of just contributing one number, it contributes in some sense, one number to one of the goods. Exactly. One of the goods or at most one of the goods. So rather than overall demand, let me just say demand of I a bitter I is going to be it's fave good at the current prices, q. And again, by fave, I mean highest Vij minus QJ. And of course, if all of these are negative, then the bidder says, I don't want any of them at the current prices.\\n00:16:57.182 - 00:17:22.134, Speaker B: So your demand can be the empty set as well. So with that notion of demand, we can start thinking about, does supply equal demand or not? So we look at a good if it's more than one bidder's favorite, then it's over demanded. If there's a good that nobody wants, then it's under demanded. Okay. And so certainly, if you're over demanded, that suggests the price is too low. It suggests maybe you should raise the price. So again, the full description will have to wait till next week.\\n00:17:22.134 - 00:17:59.570, Speaker B: But I wanted you to kind of have in mind what's the general form of the ascending option going to look like. What are we shooting for? So this is sort of how we're thinking it's going to work at a high level. Good. Now it so another goal. In addition to having this kind of description, we want sincere bidding, by which I mean, every time we ask a bidder for its favorite good, it tells us which one is its favorite with respect to its actual valuations, we want sincere bidding.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Frontiers in Mechanism Design (Lecture 5: The Gross Substitutes Condition)\\nchannel_name: Tim Roughgarden Lectures\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_-AQY1IJPc\\nrelease_date: 2014-01-28\\n\\nAnd again, just as far as this first topic is kind of the only one which is classical. So this first topic, we've seen some stuff from the past ten years, but it's mostly been from the 80s. All of these four topics will be nothing but 21st century stuff and in many cases just the last three years or so. Okay, so that's sort of the outline of where we're going.

And the other thing I'd say is r1 benefit about the class being so relatively small is it's actually realistic for me to be helpful with the projects more than, say, last quarter when there was 50 people. So definitely feel free to get in touch with me and say, I was thinking about this paper. Do you think it's a good idea or not or whatever? So both. When you're picking the projects and then throughout the quarter, definitely feel free to get in touch and ask for my advice. It's sort of small enough that I can actually actually do that. Probably I'll schedule check in meetings with people in week seven or eight or something like that.\\n00:05:31.734 - 00:05:42.460, Speaker A: But even well before then, just picking a topic.

Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks for your time. I'm going to talk about the other side of that distinction that David drew between macro and micro. I have many interesting thoughts, I hope, about macro, but this talk is about micro. And I'm going to talk about what it looks like, what this problem looks like from the side of an L2 or L3s designer.\\n00:00:26.066 - 00:01:37.414, Speaker A: And in particular, this is based on both our experience running the Arbitrum sequencer which is the most used so far roll up sequencer and also the research that we've done on this particular topic. So let me start just reviewing and this is pretty close to a diagram that David showed talking about how L2 systems work and just reviewing what is the role of the sequencer because there is some misconception out there about it. So the sequencer is this function up here on the upper left. And its job, and its only job is to receive transactions from users and to publish a canonical sequence of transactions. These are the transactions that have been seen and this is the order in which they've been seen. The execution phase of the protocol then is in charge of figuring out whether those transactions are valid and if so, how they change the state and which blocks they make. So the sequencer you can almost think about a modern state of the art roll up as almost being two chains.\\n00:01:37.414 - 00:02:20.360, Speaker A: First, a chain that is built by the sequencer, which is the chain of transactions that have arrived and then second, a logically different chain that consumes those transactions and then updates state and looks like in our case, an Ethereum chain. So that's the role of the sequencer only trusted to vouch for transaction arrivals and some transaction order. All right, so how does l two differ from l one ethereum? There's a bunch of different ways, all of them probably important. First, sequencing is separate from execution and settlement. As I just described, the block time is much faster on L2. On Arbitrum, it's 250 milliseconds 48 x faster than Ethereum. That makes a big difference.\\n00:02:20.360 - 00:03:12.860, Speaker A: There's a private mem pool by default, unlike the public mem pool and the kind of peer to peer gossip that goes on of the mem pool. Maybe you have some private order flow on Ethereum but kind of the default is public mem pool. And in L two, typically the default is private mempool. There's a very low cost structure on L2 S and that means costs that might be negligible for an L one might be really appreciably add to the cost on L two. And so we need to optimize cost in ways that L ones don't necessarily have to. But then finally, L2 S have a degree of design flexibility that L One doesn't have simply because L One is a much more mature, much more widely used system.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-04\\n\\nAnd so we need to optimize cost in ways that L ones don't necessarily have to. But then finally, L2 S have a degree of design flexibility that L One doesn't have simply because L One is a much more mature, much more widely used system. And so it's a lot harder and a lot slower, and rightly so, to change how ethereum works compared to changing how or evolving how an L two works.\\n00:03:12.860 - 00:03:34.666, Speaker A: Okay, so we think of this problem not as MEB, but as transaction ordering. And here are our goals for transaction ordering. First, we want low latency. We want to preserve that maybe not 250 millisecond, but pretty close to it block time. We need low cost of operation. We want something that resists front running. We think we owe that to our users.\\n00:03:34.666 - 00:04:12.586, Speaker A: Our users ask for it and want it. And that's the sentiment of the Arbitrum Dao. But at the same time, we'd like to be able to capture revenue of mev other than front running. We'd like to be able to ethically monetize that. We want to not build in centralization. And what I mean by that is that we don't want an architecture that is inherently centralized. And by central or centralizing and I mean by that not only sort of a count of how many participants there are, but are we creating an economic structure that tends toward monopoly or oligopoly or concentration of economic power? We want to avoid that to the extent we can.\\n00:04:12.586 - 00:04:37.902, Speaker A: And we also want a property that we call independence of your relevant transactions. And I'll give an example later that helps to motivate why this is a good thing. But let me explain briefly now what it is. Here's what we mean. Suppose that Alice wants to backrun some transaction A and Bob wants to backrun some transaction B. And those transactions are unrelated. They're trading in different quantities.\\n00:04:37.902 - 00:05:17.694, Speaker A: So Alice's strategy in how she goes about this, what she submits, how she bids, et cetera, should be independent of what Bob does. Ellis's strategy space should be independent. Or in other words, if two opportunities for mev are non interfering, then they should be strategy independent. So the strategy of one is independent of what people in the other one do or even of the existence of the second one. Many mechanisms don't have this property, but it turns out to be valuable, as we'll see later. One of the reasons to understand one of the reasons it's valuable, consider the alternative. Consider a world where everything is entangled.\\n00:05:17.694 - 00:05:54.046, Speaker A: Every single opportunity is entangled with every other opportunity. So you can't form a strategy for extracting even simple, a simple mev opportunity without understanding everything that's available and what everyone's else's strategy space is.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEV & Interoperability: Rollups, Cross-L2 & Cross-chain\\nchannel_name: ETHGlobal\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swydLBiRkUE\\nrelease_date: 2021-07-20\\n\\nBecause that's what determines ordering and mev and fairness consideration. So we've devoted a lot of attention to how we do that in a way that reduces the amount of value that gets extracted from users and that is as fair and transparent as we can make it as we evolve over time.\\n00:20:57.250 - 00:21:26.342, Speaker A: So the problem here, if I can restate, is that messages between domains and messages to a specific domain can be interleaved. Arbitrum has a shared ordering mechanism for these, but other cross domain systems might not. So given the example of IBC, there is probably no global ordering of IBC messages between domains, right?\\n00:21:26.396 - 00:21:29.100, Speaker C: Saki no, there could not be.\\n00:21:29.870 - 00:21:41.130, Speaker A: And for optimism, for example, does optimism maintain a separate mem pool that is ordered separately from incoming L one messages?\\n00:21:41.630 - 00:22:37.674, Speaker F: Yeah, we do. It's an interesting question and a great discussion. I think one of the interesting I will call out one difference between cross domain messages and other just like within the transactions within the L2. Ed's definitely right that at the end of the day the L2's ordering is determined by some mechanism which is on L2. One interesting thing though is that that mechanism is also required to follow the L one ordering. So one interesting thing that we see is that if you have a transaction which is just a piece of data that is like an L2 transaction, it's like a user transaction with a signature, then you can attempt to order that optimistically before it goes on chain and know the outcome. But this is not the case for the finality of deposits because if a smart contract calls into the chain that is dependent on the L One's finality.\\n00:22:37.674 - 00:23:04.040, Speaker F: So if you have an L one reorg, you might observe that a different message ends up coming into the chain because let's say the L one reorg moved some money away and now the deposit can't actually be deposited. So I think this is worth calling out that cross domain messages are going to be more restricted in how quickly we can get them in and choose an ordering for them because what they are doing is required to depend on the l one state.\\n00:23:06.730 - 00:23:39.620, Speaker D: Can I respond to that briefly? I think there's actually different ways of handling that use. Case question is do you need to evaluate the correctness of this thing at L One before you can establish it in order? Do you need to determine whether it will succeed at l One before you assign it a spot in the order, or do you assign it a spot in the order and then the result of it may be dependent on L One reorgs and there's some design choices there which do affect what outcome you get.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 22\\nsource: 2\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Buying Time: Latency Racing vs. Bidding in Transaction Ordering\\nauthors: Akaki Mamageishvili, Mahimna Kelkar, Jan Christoph Schlegel, Edward W.

They then individually filter and discard unfunded transactions because they have the same sequence. They will do that identically, the honest ones will do that identically. They then jointly sign and publish the block and you move on to the next one. So this actually works pretty nicely.\\n00:10:59.914 - 00:11:59.090, Speaker A: The only drawback of this is that it has multiple rounds of BFT consensus built in, which is in tension with that goal of a fast block time. And in fact, at the end of the day, users or Governance will have to decide whether they like the trust assumption of centralization with really fast blocks, which means really fast transaction latency, or whether they like better the slower operation and happier trust assumption of having a committee based scheme. I'm not going to predict what a particular governance will want, but that will be ultimately the choice. And of course, one of the big questions here is how fast can you make this decentralized implementation? Interesting research problems there. All right, let me talk a little bit about the economics of this by giving some simple examples. And I'll start with first a single arbitrage opportunity. Imagine the simplest possible situation.\\n00:11:59.090 - 00:13:12.860, Speaker A: There's one arbitrage opportunity and you have some value on that opportunity. So the first transaction, the transaction that will be earliest within the next block according to the sorting order, will win the reward. And so this is effectively a sealed bid all pay auction. Right, well understood mechanism that is revenue efficient, where the strategy space is well understood all right, but why an all pay auction? And the answer is, if we consider two independent arbitrage opportunities that are separate, and the first transaction that aims at opportunity A will get that one, and the first transaction that aims at opportunity B will get that one, right? Now, this will effectively operate as two separate sealed bid all pay auctions that the transactions aiming for A and the transactions aiming for B\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-04\\n\\n00:00:00.330 - 00:00:26.066, Speaker A: You. Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks for your time. I'm going to talk about the other side of that distinction that David drew between macro and micro. I have many interesting thoughts, I hope, about macro, but this talk is about micro. And I'm going to talk about what it looks like, what this problem looks like from the side of an L2 or L3s designer.\\n00:00:26.066 - 00:01:37.414, Speaker A: And in particular, this is based on both our experience running the Arbitrum sequencer which is the most used so far roll up sequencer and also the research that we've done on this particular topic. So let me start just reviewing and this is pretty close to a diagram that David showed talking about how L2 systems work and just reviewing what is the role of the sequencer because there is some misconception out there about it. So the sequencer is this function up here on the upper left. And its job, and its only job is to receive transactions from users and to publish a canonical sequence of transactions. These are the transactions that have been seen and this is the order in which they've been seen. The execution phase of the protocol then is in charge of figuring out whether those transactions are valid and if so, how they change the state and which blocks they make. So the sequencer you can almost think about a modern state of the art roll up as almost being two chains.\\n00:01:37.414 - 00:02:20.360, Speaker A: First, a chain that is built by the sequencer, which is the chain of transactions that have arrived and then second, a logically different chain that consumes those transactions and then updates state and looks like in our case, an Ethereum chain. So that's the role of the sequencer only trusted to vouch for transaction arrivals and some transaction order. All right, so how does l two differ from l one ethereum? There's a bunch of different ways, all of them probably important. First, sequencing is separate from execution and settlement. As I just described, the block time is much faster on L2. On Arbitrum, it's 250 milliseconds 48 x faster than Ethereum. That makes a big difference.\\n00:02:20.360 - 00:03:12.860, Speaker A: There's a private mem pool by default, unlike the public mem pool and the kind of peer to peer gossip that goes on of the mem pool. Maybe you have some private order flow on Ethereum but kind of the default is public mem pool. And in L two, typically the default is private mempool. There's a very low cost structure on L2 S and that means costs that might be negligible for an L one might be really appreciably add to the cost on L two. And so we need to optimize cost in ways that L ones don't necessarily have to. But then finally, L2 S have a degree of design flexibility that L One doesn't have simply because L One is a much more mature, much more widely used system.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-04\\n\\nAnd so we need to optimize cost in ways that L ones don't necessarily have to. But then finally, L2 S have a degree of design flexibility that L One doesn't have simply because L One is a much more mature, much more widely used system. And so it's a lot harder and a lot slower, and rightly so, to change how ethereum works compared to changing how or evolving how an L two works.\\n00:03:12.860 - 00:03:34.666, Speaker A: Okay, so we think of this problem not as MEB, but as transaction ordering. And here are our goals for transaction ordering. First, we want low latency. We want to preserve that maybe not 250 millisecond, but pretty close to it block time. We need low cost of operation. We want something that resists front running. We think we owe that to our users.\\n00:03:34.666 - 00:04:12.586, Speaker A: Our users ask for it and want it. And that's the sentiment of the Arbitrum Dao. But at the same time, we'd like to be able to capture revenue of mev other than front running. We'd like to be able to ethically monetize that. We want to not build in centralization. And what I mean by that is that we don't want an architecture that is inherently centralized. And by central or centralizing and I mean by that not only sort of a count of how many participants there are, but are we creating an economic structure that tends toward monopoly or oligopoly or concentration of economic power? We want to avoid that to the extent we can.\\n00:04:12.586 - 00:04:37.902, Speaker A: And we also want a property that we call independence of your relevant transactions. And I'll give an example later that helps to motivate why this is a good thing. But let me explain briefly now what it is. Here's what we mean. Suppose that Alice wants to backrun some transaction A and Bob wants to backrun some transaction B. And those transactions are unrelated. They're trading in different quantities.\\n00:04:37.902 - 00:05:17.694, Speaker A: So Alice's strategy in how she goes about this, what she submits, how she bids, et cetera, should be independent of what Bob does. Ellis's strategy space should be independent. Or in other words, if two opportunities for mev are non interfering, then they should be strategy independent. So the strategy of one is independent of what people in the other one do or even of the existence of the second one. Many mechanisms don't have this property, but it turns out to be valuable, as we'll see later. One of the reasons to understand one of the reasons it's valuable, consider the alternative. Consider a world where everything is entangled.\\n00:05:17.694 - 00:05:54.046, Speaker A: Every single opportunity is entangled with every other opportunity. So you can't form a strategy for extracting even simple, a simple mev opportunity without understanding everything that's available and what everyone's else's strategy space is.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEV & Interoperability: Rollups, Cross-L2 & Cross-chain\\nchannel_name: ETHGlobal\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swydLBiRkUE\\nrelease_date: 2021-07-20\\n\\nBecause that's what determines ordering and mev and fairness consideration. So we've devoted a lot of attention to how we do that in a way that reduces the amount of value that gets extracted from users and that is as fair and transparent as we can make it as we evolve over time.\\n00:20:57.250 - 00:21:26.342, Speaker A: So the problem here, if I can restate, is that messages between domains and messages to a specific domain can be interleaved. Arbitrum has a shared ordering mechanism for these, but other cross domain systems might not. So given the example of IBC, there is probably no global ordering of IBC messages between domains, right?\\n00:21:26.396 - 00:21:29.100, Speaker C: Saki no, there could not be.\\n00:21:29.870 - 00:21:41.130, Speaker A: And for optimism, for example, does optimism maintain a separate mem pool that is ordered separately from incoming L one messages?\\n00:21:41.630 - 00:22:37.674, Speaker F: Yeah, we do. It's an interesting question and a great discussion. I think one of the interesting I will call out one difference between cross domain messages and other just like within the transactions within the L2. Ed's definitely right that at the end of the day the L2's ordering is determined by some mechanism which is on L2. One interesting thing though is that that mechanism is also required to follow the L one ordering. So one interesting thing that we see is that if you have a transaction which is just a piece of data that is like an L2 transaction, it's like a user transaction with a signature, then you can attempt to order that optimistically before it goes on chain and know the outcome. But this is not the case for the finality of deposits because if a smart contract calls into the chain that is dependent on the L One's finality.\\n00:22:37.674 - 00:23:04.040, Speaker F: So if you have an L one reorg, you might observe that a different message ends up coming into the chain because let's say the L one reorg moved some money away and now the deposit can't actually be deposited. So I think this is worth calling out that cross domain messages are going to be more restricted in how quickly we can get them in and choose an ordering for them because what they are doing is required to depend on the l one state.\\n00:23:06.730 - 00:23:39.620, Speaker D: Can I respond to that briefly? I think there's actually different ways of handling that use. Case question is do you need to evaluate the correctness of this thing at L One before you can establish it in order? Do you need to determine whether it will succeed at l One before you assign it a spot in the order, or do you assign it a spot in the order and then the result of it may be dependent on L One reorgs and there's some design choices there which do affect what outcome you get.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 22\\nsource: 2\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Buying Time: Latency Racing vs. Bidding in Transaction Ordering\\nauthors: Akaki Mamageishvili, Mahimna Kelkar, Jan Christoph Schlegel, Edward W.

Now, this will effectively operate as two separate sealed bid all pay auctions that the transactions aiming for A and the transactions aiming for B will be interleaved somehow in the final sorted transaction sequence. But if you're aiming at A, you don't care about the B transactions because they don't affect your ordering relative to the other A transactions. So you get that strategy independence. It just falls out from the fact that we're doing this sealed bid all pay auction with a sort.\\n00:13:12.860 - 00:14:23.786, Speaker A: Another thing to note is, because the auction is for priority fee, the amount you pay is your bid multiplied by the gas you use. So if you get the bright idea of combined making one transaction that first grabs arbitrage opportunity A and then grabs opportunity B, that will use roughly twice as much gas or roughly the sum of the gas that you would spend by going after A and going after B. So that is roughly equivalent to submitting two separate transactions that happen to have the same bid and are aiming at the two opportunities. So the bundling of transactions in order to somehow piggyback on top of some other bid doesn't quite really exist here.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 22\\nsource: 5\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Buying Time: Latency Racing vs. Bidding in Transaction Ordering\\nauthors: Akaki Mamageishvili, Mahimna Kelkar, Jan Christoph Schlegel, Edward W.

Felten\\n23:5\\narbitrageurs always have g time to compete for any arbitrage opportunity as opposed to a\\npure bidding policy and will therefore prefer bidding over latency infrastructure investments.\\nWe also show that TimeBoost satisfies all the useful economic properties of first-price\\nall-pay auctions. Further, we show that players spend exactly the same amount in total with\\nTimeBoost, as they would spend if only latency investment was allowed, except that most of\\nthe investment is done through bidding and therefore can be captured within the protocol\\nfor e.g., lowering user fees or for protocol development.\\n2\\nOrdering Policies\\n2.1\\nPreliminaries\\nA transaction tx that arrives at the sequencer can be characterized by a tuple (data, t, b)\\nwhere data represents the transaction data, t denotes the arrival time, and b denotes the\\ntransaction bid (note that when transactions are of different sizes, b can be instead be\\nconsidered to be a bid per unit size). Let T denote the set of all possible transactions; in\\nprinciple this can be infinite or even uncountable (e.g., if arrival times are in R+) and our\\nresults do hold for these cases. For practical use-cases, typically, arrival times can be assumed\\nto be in Q+ and bids can be assumed to be in N\\u22650.\\nAn ordering policy now defines how a sequencer orders a finite set T \\u2032 of transactions that\\nit has received. A formal definition is given below:\\n\\u25b6 Definition 1 ((Data-Independent) Ordering Policy). An ordering policy (or algorithm) P\\ntakes as input a finite subset T \\u2032 \\u2286 T of transactions and outputs a linear ordering P(T \\u2032).\\nFor tx \\u2208 T \\u2032, let P(T \\u2032, tx) denote the position of transaction tx in the ordering P(T \\u2032). In\\nother words, given T \\u2032 and txa, txb \\u2208 T \\u2032, P outputs txa before txb if P(T \\u2032, txa) < P(T \\u2032, txb).\\nA policy is further called data-independent if it does not make use of the transaction data\\n(i.e., it only uses the arrival time and the bid).\\nSince we want our ordering policies to not be based on the transaction content, we only\\nconsider data-independent policies for the rest of the paper. For simplicity, we can therefore\\nrepresent a transaction tx simply by the tuple (tx.t, tx.b). Furthermore, since ties can be\\nbroken by some chosen technique, without loss of generality, we can also assume (tx.t, tx.b)\\ntuples are unique. While the tie-breaking can be dependent on e.g., transaction ciphertext\\nor metadata, this does not affect our analysis and therefore can be safely ignored for the\\npurpose of our paper.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-04\\n\\nSo the bundling of transactions in order to somehow piggyback on top of some other bid doesn't quite really exist here. Now, that's not exactly true because there's a little bit of startup cost for a transaction. But to first approximation, this is pretty close to independence. And unless in practice, unless you would already want to bid fairly, almost equal amounts in the two auctions, you would probably want to submit separately, right? So you can see how the strategy space is simpler.\\n00:14:23.786 - 00:15:28.614, Speaker A: You don't need to think about whether there are any independent opportunities from the one that you're going after. Okay? Now let's compare this I'd like to take a minute and compare this to a property. That a policy that we've written about before. We had a paper at FC about this called Timeboost, which I'll call now Classic Time boost. So the idea here is that you have a centralized sequencer, just to make it simple, that is timestamping incoming transactions and time boost essentially logically adjusts the timestamp of an incoming transaction according to the formula here, that the final adjusted timestamp is the actual arrival timestamp minus a correction. And in this correction, B is your bid, c is a normalization constant, and G is the maximum amount of time advantage you can buy. Because even if B goes to infinity in this formula, the second term just goes to G, right? Always less than G for a finite bit.\\n00:15:28.614 - 00:16:25.270, Speaker A: So this is classic time boost and that you would receive transactions, timestamp them, apply this correction, and then issue each timestamp as soon as you were sure that it was definitely going to be next in the sequence. Now, discrete time boost is a variant of this in which you round each transaction's timestamp to the nearest multiple of G and then apply this same time boost algorithm. And it turns out that discrete time boost is equivalent to this frequent ordering auction. So one way of looking at frequent ordering auction is as a kind of frequent batch auction applied to blockchain. Another way is as a discrete version of the time boost policy. And you can look at it either way you want because they're really equivalent. I kind of having gotten there by both paths, kind of like the frequent ordering auction version of understanding a little bit better, but your mileage may vary.\\n00:16:25.270 - 00:17:22.540, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about this with bundles. It makes sense to allow people to anyone to submit a transaction bundle, and the sequencer ought to accept submission of bundles. Where a bundle contains multiple transactions, each transaction validly signed by some sender. And the guarantees that we can provide are first that the transactions in a bundle will definitely be in the same sequencer block. I should note that in our model, there is effectively no limit to the size of a sequencer block, and so nobody's going to get crowded out because there's not space.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 22\\nsource: 3\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Buying Time: Latency Racing vs. Bidding in Transaction Ordering\\nauthors: Akaki Mamageishvili, Mahimna Kelkar, Jan Christoph Schlegel, Edward W.

And finally, of course, supporting bundles is important to do and we expect to do it. All right? That's the view from at least one L two chain on what we think makes sense and a proposal for a policy. And I'm happy to take questions.\\n00:20:04.770 - 00:20:20.254, Speaker B: Thanks for the talk, Ed. So if I understood correctly, the fees, priority fees or any kind of fees paid by transactions don't go to the infrastructure operator but rather go to the sort of Arbitrage token or some treasury?\\n00:20:20.302 - 00:20:42.810, Speaker A: Well, right. What the implementation is, is they get deposited to some smart contract which is designated by governance and that smart contract sends it wherever it's programmed to send it. So presumably there's some split. Realistically, the Dao will want most of it to go to the treasury, some will probably go to infrastructure provider.\\n00:20:43.310 - 00:21:09.042, Speaker B: That makes sense. My question is if that split, let's say, for example, in the extreme only goes to the treasury, to governance, it doesn't go to the infrastructure provider at all. There's a clear sort of incentive for the infrastructure provider to take off chain payments, basically and to use that to influence ordering. And so, of course, the limitations on what you can do without being detected. But I wonder if you've sort of put thought into that.\\n00:21:09.096 - 00:21:43.370, Speaker A: Yeah, let me talk about that issue. One thing to note is that within a block the sort order is trivial to verify and so the sequencer cannot reorder transactions. Within a sequencer block, the transactions are signed by the people who submitted them. Right? And so there are two things the sequencer can do that it has the power to do. One thing is to censor a transaction so that it doesn't appear until\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"retrieved_context\": \"Speaker A: The only drawback of this is that it has multiple rounds of BFT consensus built in, which is in tension with that goal of a fast block time. And in fact, at the end of the day, users or Governance will have to decide whether they like the trust assumption of centralization with really fast blocks, which means really fast transaction latency, or whether they like better the slower operation and happier trust assumption of having a committee based scheme. I'm not going to predict what a particular governance will want, but that will be ultimately the choice. And of course, one of the big questions here is how fast can you make this decentralized implementation? Interesting research problems there. All right, let me talk a little bit about the economics of this by giving some simple examples. And I'll start with first a single arbitrage opportunity. Imagine the simplest possible situation.\\n00:11:59.090 - 00:13:12.860, Speaker A: There's one arbitrage opportunity and you have some value on that opportunity. So the first transaction, the transaction that will be earliest within the next block according to the sorting order, will win the reward. And so this is effectively a sealed bid all pay auction. Right, well understood mechanism that is revenue efficient, where the strategy space is well understood all right, but why an all pay auction? And the answer is, if we consider two independent arbitrage opportunities that are separate, and the first transaction that aims at opportunity A will get that one, and the first transaction that aims at opportunity B will get that one, right? Now, this will effectively operate as two separate sealed bid all pay auctions that the transactions aiming for A and the transactions aiming for B will be interleaved somehow in the final sorted transaction sequence. But if you're aiming at A, you don't care about the B transactions because they don't affect your ordering relative to the other A transactions. So you get that strategy independence. It just falls out from the fact that we're doing this sealed bid all pay auction with a sort.\\n00:13:12.860 - 00:14:23.786, Speaker A: Another thing to note is, because the auction is for priority fee, the amount you pay is your bid multiplied by the gas you use. So if you get the bright idea of combined making one transaction that first grabs arbitrage opportunity A and then grabs opportunity B, that will use roughly twice as much gas or roughly the sum of the gas that you would spend by going after A and going after B. So that is roughly equivalent to submitting two separate transactions that happen to have the same bid and are aiming at the two opportunities. So the bundling of transactions in order to somehow piggyback on top of some other bid doesn't quite really exist here.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 22\\nsource: 5\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: Buying Time: Latency Racing vs. Bidding in Transaction Ordering\\nauthors: Akaki Mamageishvili, Mahimna Kelkar, Jan Christoph Schlegel, Edward W.

Felten\\n23:5\\narbitrageurs always have g time to compete for any arbitrage opportunity as opposed to a\\npure bidding policy and will therefore prefer bidding over latency infrastructure investments.\\nWe also show that TimeBoost satisfies all the useful economic properties of first-price\\nall-pay auctions. Further, we show that players spend exactly the same amount in total with\\nTimeBoost, as they would spend if only latency investment was allowed, except that most of\\nthe investment is done through bidding and therefore can be captured within the protocol\\nfor e.g., lowering user fees or for protocol development.\\n2\\nOrdering Policies\\n2.1\\nPreliminaries\\nA transaction tx that arrives at the sequencer can be characterized by a tuple (data, t, b)\\nwhere data represents the transaction data, t denotes the arrival time, and b denotes the\\ntransaction bid (note that when transactions are of different sizes, b can be instead be\\nconsidered to be a bid per unit size). Let T denote the set of all possible transactions; in\\nprinciple this can be infinite or even uncountable (e.g., if arrival times are in R+) and our\\nresults do hold for these cases. For practical use-cases, typically, arrival times can be assumed\\nto be in Q+ and bids can be assumed to be in N\\u22650.\\nAn ordering policy now defines how a sequencer orders a finite set T \\u2032 of transactions that\\nit has received. A formal definition is given below:\\n\\u25b6 Definition 1 ((Data-Independent) Ordering Policy). An ordering policy (or algorithm) P\\ntakes as input a finite subset T \\u2032 \\u2286 T of transactions and outputs a linear ordering P(T \\u2032).\\nFor tx \\u2208 T \\u2032, let P(T \\u2032, tx) denote the position of transaction tx in the ordering P(T \\u2032). In\\nother words, given T \\u2032 and txa, txb \\u2208 T \\u2032, P outputs txa before txb if P(T \\u2032, txa) < P(T \\u2032, txb).\\nA policy is further called data-independent if it does not make use of the transaction data\\n(i.e., it only uses the arrival time and the bid).\\nSince we want our ordering policies to not be based on the transaction content, we only\\nconsider data-independent policies for the rest of the paper. For simplicity, we can therefore\\nrepresent a transaction tx simply by the tuple (tx.t, tx.b). Furthermore, since ties can be\\nbroken by some chosen technique, without loss of generality, we can also assume (tx.t, tx.b)\\ntuples are unique. While the tie-breaking can be dependent on e.g., transaction ciphertext\\nor metadata, this does not affect our analysis and therefore can be safely ignored for the\\npurpose of our paper.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\nchannel_name: Flashbots\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-04\\n\\nSo the bundling of transactions in order to somehow piggyback on top of some other bid doesn't quite really exist here. Now, that's not exactly true because there's a little bit of startup cost for a transaction. But to first approximation, this is pretty close to independence. And unless in practice, unless you would already want to bid fairly, almost equal amounts in the two auctions, you would probably want to submit separately, right? So you can see how the strategy space is simpler.\\n00:14:23.786 - 00:15:28.614, Speaker A: You don't need to think about whether there are any independent opportunities from the one that you're going after. Okay? Now let's compare this I'd like to take a minute and compare this to a property. That a policy that we've written about before. We had a paper at FC about this called Timeboost, which I'll call now Classic Time boost. So the idea here is that you have a centralized sequencer, just to make it simple, that is timestamping incoming transactions and time boost essentially logically adjusts the timestamp of an incoming transaction according to the formula here, that the final adjusted timestamp is the actual arrival timestamp minus a correction.
