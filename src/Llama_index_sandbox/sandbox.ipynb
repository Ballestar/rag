In a roll-up scenario, there is a direct communication channel between the user and the sequencer, eliminating the need for a gas protocol. The response a user receives from the sequencer, and its timing, depends on how the sequencer has ordered the transactions. Sequencers can be either centralized or decentralized. The transition from a centralized to a decentralized sequencer involves an agreement with the chain, where the participants in the decentralized committee are paid for their work. If they fail to perform, they can be fired.

This transaction is converted into a specific format by a wallet. Some transactions are identified or manipulated by entities known as searchers, who transform these transactions into bundles. Other transactions bypass this step. The next entity in the chain is the builder, who selects the transactions to be included in the next block and forwards this block to a miner or validator for confirmation.\\n\\nThe competition among miners and validators is a crucial aspect of public blockchains, providing users with assurances such as resistance to censorship and market power. This competition prevents a single entity from controlling the selection of transactions for a block.\\n\\nHowever, there is a concern that the entire supply chain could collapse into a single vertically integrated entity, a scenario referred to as MEV Dystopia. In this situation, a single party would create all blocks on public blockchains, eliminating all user guarantees.\\n\\nThe builder and the miner or validator are distinct entities. Traditionally, mining pools have served as builders, selecting transactions and organizing them into a block. The miner or validator then validates this block with a proof of work or proof of stake, giving it economic weight in the fork choice rule.\\n\\nBuilding was simpler in the past when all a mining pool needed was a good view of the mempool and the ability to select the highest paying transactions. However, MEV has complicated building because it's not just about running a simple algorithm to extract MEV. It involves identifying MEV transactions, executing these transactions, possibly maintaining a coin inventory, and managing risk.\\n\\nIn the future, it is anticipated that individuals will attempt to move further up the supply chain to gain more control. However, this is challenging due to already entrenched interests.

This is typically achieved by exploiting the discrepancy between the pool's price and the external market price during the creation of a new blockchain block. \\n\\nA protocol known as V0LVER, presented in the research paper \\\"An AMM minimizing user-level extractable value and loss-versus-rebalancing\\\" by Conor McMenamin and Vanesa Daza, offers protection against user-level Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and LVR. It harmonizes the interests of the user, the pool, and the block producer, which are usually competing entities in AMMs. It accomplishes this by incentivizing the block producer to shift the pool to the price that maximizes LVR. When selecting a price, the block producer is obliged to confirm its accuracy. This mechanism encourages block producers to align the price of a V0LVER pool with the external market price, providing users with an AMM where the expected trade price is always the external market price, excluding fees. This also minimizes the LVR against the pool when arbitrageurs are competing (\\\"An AMM minimizing user-level extractable value and loss-versus-rebalancing\\\", Conor McMenamin, Vanesa Daza, 2023-01-31, [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13599v2)).\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"model_params\": {\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n            \"temperature\": 0,\n            \"max_tokens\": null,\n            \"additional_kwargs\": {},\n            \"max_retries\": 10,\n            \"api_type\": \"open_ai\",\n            \"api_base\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n            \"api_version\": \"\",\n            \"class_type\": \"openai\",\n            \"class_name\": \"openai_llm\"\n        },\n        \"user_raw_input\": \"How do L2 sequencers work?\",\n        \"LLM_response\": \"L2 sequencers function by receiving transactions from users and deciding their order based on a specific policy.

The sequencer plays a significant role in the extraction of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). In a roll-up scenario, there is a direct communication channel between the user and the sequencer, eliminating the need for a gas protocol. The response a user receives from the sequencer, and its timing, depends on how the sequencer has ordered the transactions. Sequencers can be either centralized or decentralized. The transition from a centralized to a decentralized sequencer involves an agreement with the chain, where the participants in the decentralized committee are paid for their work. If they fail to perform, they can be fired. The selection of these participants is based on trust, and they are likely to be known entities (\\\"Transaction Ordering: The View from L2 (and L3) - Ed Felten | MEV-SBC \\u201923\\\", Flashbots, 2023-09-04, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfSbtBOGAQ); \\\"MEVeconomics in L2 - A Closer Look at the Sequencer's Role and MEV - Patrick McCorry\\\", ETHGlobal, 2023-03-28, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb8nY2-Osjc); \\\"L2 sequencing and MEV - Ed Felten (Arbitrum)\\\", Flashbots, 2022-05-22, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxml80TparY)).\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"model_params\": {\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n            \"temperature\": 0,\n            \"max_tokens\": null,\n            \"additional_kwargs\": {},\n            \"max_retries\": 10,\n            \"api_type\": \"open_ai\",\n            \"api_base\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n            \"api_version\": \"\",\n            \"class_type\": \"openai\",\n            \"class_name\": \"openai_llm\"\n        },\n        \"user_raw_input\": \"Do an exhaustive breakdown of the MEV supply chain\",\n        \"LLM_response\": \"The Miner Extractable Value (MEV) supply chain is a complex process that begins with a user initiating a transaction. This transaction is converted into a specific format by a wallet. Some transactions are identified or manipulated by entities known as searchers, who transform these transactions into bundles. Other transactions bypass this step. The next entity in the chain is the builder, who selects the transactions to be included in the next block and forwards this block to a miner or validator for confirmation.\\n\\nThe competition among miners and validators is a crucial aspect of public blockchains, providing users with assurances such as resistance to censorship and market power. This competition prevents a single entity from controlling the selection of transactions for a block.\\n\\nHowever, there is a concern that the entire supply chain could collapse into a single vertically integrated entity, a scenario referred to as MEV Dystopia. In this situation, a single party would create all blocks on public blockchains, eliminating all user guarantees.\\n\\nThe builder and the miner or validator are distinct entities. Traditionally, mining pools have served as builders, selecting transactions and organizing them into a block. The miner or validator then validates this block with a proof of work or proof of stake, giving it economic weight in the fork choice rule.\\n\\nBuilding was simpler in the past when all a mining pool needed was a good view of the mempool and the ability to select the highest paying transactions. However, MEV has complicated building because it's not just about running a simple algorithm to extract MEV. It involves identifying MEV transactions, executing these transactions, possibly maintaining a coin inventory, and managing risk.\\n\\nIn the future, it is anticipated that individuals will attempt to move further up the supply chain to gain more control. However, this is challenging due to already entrenched interests. The goal is to make it economically feasible and rational for actors to give up their order flow and participate in an open auction (\\\"SoK: Cross-Domain MEV\\\", Conor McMenamin, 2023-08-08, [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04159v1); \\\"It\\u2019s My MEV and I Want It Now - Tom Schmidt\\\", ETHGlobal, 2023-03-28, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHsU2hSNNcM); \\\"State of the MEV Union - Jon Charbonneau\\\", ETHGlobal, 2023-03-28, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-STbGjZc_OU); \\\"Multi-block MEV\\\", Johannes Rude Jensen, Victor von Wachter, Omri Ross, 2023-03-08, [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04430v2); \\\"The threat of MEV centralization: an anatomy of the transaction supply chain - Hasu (Flashbots)\\\", Flashbots, 2022-05-22, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmBqoBr6yl4); \\\"Why your blockchain needs an MEV solution - Hasu (Flashbots)\\\", Flashbots, 2022-05-22, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYFuFLe9kp0); \\\"Flashbots Research Workshop #7: Cross-domain MEV AMA\\\", Flashbots, 2021-12-23, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR0Z0nWXeFU); \\\"MEV.WTF Summit\\\", ETHGlobal, 2021-07-02, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3nACF7uVZw)).\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"model_params\": {\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n            \"temperature\": 0,\n            \"max_tokens\": null,\n            \"additional_kwargs\": {},\n            \"max_retries\": 10,\n            \"api_type\": \"open_ai\",\n            \"api_base\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n            \"api_version\": \"\",\n            \"class_type\": \"openai\",\n            \"class_name\": \"openai_llm\"\n        },\n        \"user_raw_input\": \"What is ePBS?\",\n        \"LLM_response\": \"Enshrined Proposal Builder Separation (ePBS) is a concept within the Ethereum protocol that aims to address certain challenges.

The goal of SUAVE is to create a fair and efficient system for transaction ordering that minimizes the negative impacts of MEV. It does this by allowing all participants to bid for transaction inclusion and order in a block, thus reducing the potential for manipulation and exploitation.

This is typically achieved by exploiting the discrepancy between the pool's price and the external market price during the creation of a new blockchain block. \\n\\nA protocol known as V0LVER, presented in the research paper \\\"An AMM minimizing user-level extractable value and loss-versus-rebalancing\\\" by Conor McMenamin and Vanesa Daza, offers protection against user-level Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and LVR. It harmonizes the interests of the user, the pool, and the block producer, which are usually competing entities in AMMs. It accomplishes this by incentivizing the block producer to shift the pool to the price that maximizes LVR. When selecting a price, the block producer is obliged to confirm its accuracy. This mechanism encourages block producers to align the price of a V0LVER pool with the external market price, providing users with an AMM where the expected trade price is always the external market price, excluding fees. This also minimizes the LVR against the pool when arbitrageurs are competing (\\\"An AMM minimizing user-level extractable value and loss-versus-rebalancing\\\", Conor McMenamin, Vanesa Daza, 2023-01-31, [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13599v2)).\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"model_params\": {\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n            \"temperature\": 0,\n            \"max_tokens\": null,\n            \"additional_kwargs\": {},\n            \"max_retries\": 10,\n            \"api_type\": \"open_ai\",\n            \"api_base\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n            \"api_version\": \"\",\n            \"class_type\": \"openai\",\n            \"class_name\": \"openai_llm\"\n        },\n        \"user_raw_input\": \"What are intents?\",\n        \"LLM_response\": \"In the context of blockchain technology, an intent refers to a user's desire to perform a specific action or transaction on the blockchain. This could be anything from transferring tokens to interacting with a smart contract. The term is often used in discussions about transaction ordering and Miner Extractable Value (MEV), where the order in which transactions (or intents) are processed can have significant implications for the outcomes of those transactions. \\n\\nIn more advanced systems, intents can be complex and involve multiple steps or conditions. For example, a user might have an intent to buy a certain token if its price drops to a specific level, or to participate in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol under certain conditions. These intents can be expressed through transactions that are submitted to the blockchain, and the way these transactions are handled can have a big impact on the user's experience and the overall efficiency and fairness of the system (\\\"MEVday Paris: PBS and Beyond\\\", Frontier Research, 2023-08-08, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk2tQA_Pxfo); \\\"An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\\", Uncommon Core 2.0, 2023-09-02, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o); \\\"SUAVE: A Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression\\\", Conor McMenamin, 2023-08-08, [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04159v1)).\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"model_params\": {\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n            \"temperature\": 0,\n            \"max_tokens\": null,\n            \"additional_kwargs\": {},\n            \"max_retries\": 10,\n            \"api_type\": \"open_ai\",\n            \"api_base\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n            \"api_version\": \"\",\n            \"class_type\": \"openai\",\n            \"class_name\": \"openai_llm\"\n        },\n        \"user_raw_input\": \"What are the papers that deal with LVR?\",\n        \"LLM_response\": \"The following research papers discuss the concept of Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR):\\n\\n1. \\\"Arbitrageurs' profits, LVR, and sandwich attacks: batch trading as an AMM design response\\\" by Andrea Canidio and Robin Fritsch, released on 2023-07-05 ([source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02074v2)).\\n\\n2. \\\"The Pricing And Hedging Of Constant Function Market Makers\\\" by Richard Dewey and Craig Newbold, released on 2023-06-20 ([source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11580v1)).\\n\\n3. \\\"Multi-block MEV\\\" by Johannes Rude Jensen, Victor von Wachter, and Omri Ross, released on 2023-03-08 ([source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04430v2)).\\n\\n4. \\\"An AMM minimizing user-level extractable value and loss-versus-rebalancing\\\" by Conor McMenamin and Vanesa Daza, released on 2023-01-31 ([source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13599v2)).\\n\\n5. \\\"An Automated Market Maker Minimizing Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\\\" by Conor McMenamin, Vanesa Daza, and Bruno Mazorra, released on 2022-10-19 ([source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10601v2)).\\n\\n6. \\\"Quantifying Blockchain Extractable Value: How dark is the forest?\\\" by Kaihua Qin, Liyi Zhou, and Arthur Gervais, released on 2021-01-14 ([source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05511v5)).\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"model_params\": {\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n            \"temperature\": 0,\n            \"max_tokens\": null,\n            \"additional_kwargs\": {},\n            \"max_retries\": 10,\n            \"api_type\": \"open_ai\",\n            \"api_base\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n            \"api_version\": \"\",\n            \"class_type\": \"openai\",\n            \"class_name\": \"openai_llm\"\n        },\n        \"user_raw_input\": \"What are solutions to mitigate front-running and sandwich attacks?\",\n        \"LLM_response\": \"Several solutions have been proposed to mitigate front-running and sandwich attacks in blockchain systems:\\n\\n1.

Gas Price Auctions: Users bid on gas prices for their transactions. The highest bidder gets their transaction included first.\\n\\n4. Time-Locked Transactions: Transactions are locked for a certain period of time, preventing them from being front-run.\\n\\n5. Sequencers: In Layer 2 solutions, sequencers receive transactions from users and decide the order in which they are included in a block.\\n\\n6.
